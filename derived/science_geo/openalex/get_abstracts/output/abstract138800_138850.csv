https://openalex.org/W2022634662,"The pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) airways infection is unknown. Two hypotheses, ""hypotonic [low salt]/defensin"" and ""isotonic volume transport/mucus clearance,"" attempt to link defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated ion transport to CF airways disease. We tested these hypotheses with planar and cylindrical culture models and found no evidence that the liquids lining airway surfaces were hypotonic or that salt concentrations differed between CF and normal cultures. In contrast, CF airway epithelia exhibited abnormally high rates of airway surface liquid absorption, which depleted the periciliary liquid layer and abolished mucus transport. The failure to clear thickened mucus from airway surfaces likely initiates CF airways infection. These data indicate that therapy for CF lung disease should not be directed at modulation of ionic composition, but rather at restoring volume (salt and water) on airway surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1972937465,"We investigated the potential of double-stranded RNA to interfere with the function of genes in Drosophila. Injection of dsRNA into embryos resulted in potent and specific interference of several genes that were tested. In contrast, single-stranded RNA weakly interfered with gene activity. The method was used to determine the reception mechanism of the morphogen Wingless. Interference of the frizzled and Drosophila frizzled 2 genes together produced defects in embryonic patterning that mimic loss of wingless function. Interference of either gene alone had no effect on patterning. Epistasis analysis indicates that frizzled and Drosophila frizzled 2 act downstream of wingless and upstream of zeste-white3 in the Wingless pathway. Our results demonstrate that dsRNA interference can be used to analyze many aspects of gene function."
https://openalex.org/W1999763722,"Humans show considerable interindividual variation in susceptibility to weight gain in response to overeating. The physiological basis of this variation was investigated by measuring changes in energy storage and expenditure in 16 nonobese volunteers who were fed 1000 kilocalories per day in excess of weight-maintenance requirements for 8 weeks. Two-thirds of the increases in total daily energy expenditure was due to increased nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which is associated with fidgeting, maintenance of posture, and other physical activities of daily life. Changes in NEAT accounted for the 10-fold differences in fat storage that occurred and directly predicted resistance to fat gain with overfeeding (correlation coefficient = 0.77, probability &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that as humans overeat, activation of NEAT dissipates excess energy to preserve leanness and that failure to activate NEAT may result in ready fat gain."
https://openalex.org/W2014001335,"Variations in small game hunting along the northern and eastern rims of the Mediterranean Sea and results from predator-prey simulation modeling indicate that human population densities increased abruptly during the late Middle Paleolithic and again during the Upper and Epi-Paleolithic periods. The demographic pulses are evidenced by increasing reliance on agile, fast-reproducing partridges, hares, and rabbits at the expense of slow-reproducing but easily caught tortoises and marine shellfish and, concurrently, climate-independent size diminution in tortoises and shellfish. The results indicate that human populations of the early Middle Paleolithic were exceptionally small and highly dispersed."
https://openalex.org/W2087520649,"The G+C nucleotide content of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences is strongly correlated with the optimal growth temperature of prokaryotes. This property allows inference of the environmental temperature of the common ancestor to all life forms from knowledge of the G+C content of its rRNA sequences. A model of sequence evolution, assuming varying G+C content among lineages and unequal substitution rates among sites, was devised to estimate ancestral base compositions. This method was applied to rRNA sequences of various species representing the major lineages of life. The inferred G+C content of the common ancestor to extant life forms appears incompatible with survival at high temperature. This finding challenges a widely accepted hypothesis about the origin of life."
https://openalex.org/W2159584083,"Phagocytosis requires actin assembly and pseudopod extension, two cellular events that coincide spatially and temporally. The signal transduction events underlying both processes may be distinct. We tested whether phagocytic signaling resembles that of growth factor receptors, which induce actin polymerization via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis was accompanied by a rapid increase in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatein vivo, and addition of wortmannin (WM) or LY294002, two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase(s), inhibited phagocytosis but not Fcγ receptor-directed actin polymerization. However, both compounds prevented maximal pseudopod extension, suggesting that PI 3-kinase inhibition produced a limitation in membrane required for pseudopod extension. Availability of plasma membrane was not limiting for phagocytosis, because blockade of ingestion in the presence of WM was not overcome by reducing the number of particles adhering to macrophages. However, decreasing bead size, and hence the magnitude of pseudopod extension required for particle engulfment, relieved the inhibition of phagocytosis in the presence of WM or LY294002 by up to 80%. The block in phagocytosis of large particles occurred before phagosomal closure, because both compounds inhibited spreading of macrophages on substrate-bound IgG. Macrophage spreading on IgG was accompanied by exocytic insertion of membrane from an intracellular source, as measured by the dye FM1-43. These results indicate that one or more isoforms of PI 3 kinase are required for maximal pseudopod extension but not phagocytosis per se.

Phagocytosis via Fcγ receptors in macrophages is accompanied by actin assembly, pseudopod extension, and phagosomal closure (1Greenberg S. El Khoury J. Di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J.

However, it is not known precisely how enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation leads to changes in either the cytoskeleton or the membrane. Signaling by Fcγ receptors shares many elements in common with that of growth factor receptors. For example, both classes of receptors signal directly or indirectly through tyrosine kinases, and ligation of multiple growth factor receptors and FcγRs 1The abbreviations used are: FcγR, receptor for the Fc portion of IgG; EIgG, sheep erythrocytes opsonized with rabbit IgG; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; thio-macrophages, mouse macrophages elicited after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate broth; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PLA2, phospholipase A2; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: FcγR, receptor for the Fc portion of IgG; EIgG, sheep erythrocytes opsonized with rabbit IgG; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; thio-macrophages, mouse macrophages elicited after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate broth; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PLA2, phospholipase A2; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. culminates in net actin assembly and plasma membrane-based protrusions (1Greenberg S.

Phosphotyrosine residues within the kinase insert region of the cytosolic domain of the PDGF receptor bind the p85/p110 isoform of PI 3-kinase, and mutation of these residues abolishes membrane ruffling induced by this receptor (6Kundra V.

Precisely how PI 3-kinases participate in actin assembly is not known, but pharmacological inhibition of PI 3-kinase inhibits GTP loading of Rac1 stimulated by PDGF, and addition of constitutively active forms of Rac1 induces membrane ruffling despite the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors (10Kotani K.

These data suggest that PI 3-kinase lies upstream of Rac1. In contrast, recent studies of epithelial cells spreading on collagen suggest that PI 3-kinase, which is required for motility, may lie downstream of Rho family GTPases (14Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).The role of PI 3-kinase in actin assembly mediated by other types of receptors is less clear. For G protein-linked receptors, such as the thrombin receptor (15Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11358-11366Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the chemotactic peptide receptor (16Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem.

Serlin B.S. Simpson P.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2413-2422PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of PI 3-kinase has been reported to have no effect on stimulus-induced actin polymerization. For immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif-containing receptors, such as FcεRI, addition of wortmannin does not inhibit IgE-induced actin polymerization but does block the appearance of well-formed membrane ruffles in response to antigen (18Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Hall A. Martinez A.M. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated a role for PI 3-kinase in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (19Ninomiya N. Hazeki K. Fukui Y. Seya T. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22732-22737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Crowley M.T. Costello P.S. Fitzer-Attas C.J. Turner M. Meng F. Lowell C. Tybulewicz V.L.J. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp.

In one, a role for this enzyme was suggested for the closure of phagosomes (21Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Although quantitation of PI 3-kinase activity or F-actin was not performed, addition of wortmannin did not appear to inhibit the formation of “phagocytic cups,” as determined by fluorescence micrographs of phalloidin-stained cells interacting with phagocytic targets (21Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar).A study of FcεRI in mast cells suggests that stimulation of actin polymerization may not necessarily lead to membrane ruffles (18Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Hall A. Martinez A.M. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similarly, in DT40 lymphocytes expressing chimeric receptors encoding CD16 and the γ subunit of Fc receptors, addition of IgG-coated targets resulted in localized actin assembly and rudimentary plasma membrane protrusions, but phagocytosis did not occur (22Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that actin polymerization at the plasma membrane is not always coupled to pseudopod extension; distinct signals may be required for this function. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that pseudopod extension by FcγRI expressed in COS cells occurred in the absence of net actin assembly (23Lowry M.B. Duchemin A. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that actin assembly and pseudopod extension, two cellular events that normally coincide spatially and temporally, may be regulated by distinct signal transduction cascades.PI 3 kinases have been implicated in multiple aspects of membrane trafficking, including endocytosis, exocytosis, and membrane recycling (for review, see Ref. 24Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During phagocytosis, significant amounts of plasma membrane are internalized in the form of phagocytic vacuoles. However, this is accompanied by no apparent decrease in membrane surface area (25Tapper H. Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 409-418PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that surface membrane is replenished from an intracellular source. To define the role of PI 3-kinase in phagocytosis, we used a variety of approaches to identify the stage in phagocytosis that was blocked during PI 3-kinase inhibition. These studies indicate that the block occurs during pseudopod extension, not during the very early phases (i.e. F-actin accumulation) or late phases (i.e. phagosomal closure) of ingestion and could be bypassed when requirements for pseudopod extension were minimized. The block in pseudopod extension coincided with a decrease in exocytic insertion of membrane, suggesting that PI 3-kinases are required for coordinating membrane insertion events and pseudopod extension.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate a requirement for one or more isoforms of PI 3-kinase in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Although these results are not surprising in light of earlier reports of the requirement for this family of enzymes in phagocytosis, the role for PI 3-kinase in phagocytosis that we are proposing is somewhat unexpected. Studies of the PDGF receptor signaling cascade indicate that PI 3-kinase activity is required for membrane ruffling and actin polymerization (8Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 33Heldman A.W. Kandzari D.E. Tucker R.W. Crawford L.E. Fearon E.R. Koblan K.S. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), both of which occur in a Rac1-dependent manner. Similar to growth factor receptor signaling, FcγR-dependent signaling pathways that culminate in actin assembly are tyrosine kinase- and Rac1-dependent (2Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, our results clearly indicate that PI 3-kinase activity is not required for FcγR-mediated actin assembly. Rather, blockade of PI 3-kinase(s) appears to result in the functional dissociation between cytoskeletal assembly and pseudopod extension, events that are normally coupled. These data are somewhat different than those of Araki et al. (21Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), who described a block in phagosomal closure and macropinocytosis in the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Our results support of role for PI 3-kinase in an earlier step in phagocytosis. Because the cellular components required for the terminal fusion of vesicles, an event akin to phagosomal closure, are likely to be different than those governing process extension, this distinction has mechanistic consequences. Indeed, given the results described in Fig. 6and studies that show a requirement for PI 3-kinase in membrane trafficking (36Spiro D.J. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 211: 535-539Google Scholar, 38Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that up-regulation of one or more intracellular membrane compartments is required for optimal pseudopod extension, and that this event is dependent on one or more isoforms of PI 3-kinase.The identity of PI 3-kinase-sensitive membrane compartments is under extensive study by many groups (for review, see Ref. 24Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The bulk of evidence shows a requirement for PI 3-kinase in trafficking from one or more recycling compartments that contain transferrin receptors and/or glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (10Kotani K.

In addition, several studies demonstrate a requirement for PI 3-kinase in the secretory pathway (45Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Yomogida S. Mue S. Ohuchi K. Cell.

Med. 1994; 180: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Conceivably, one or more of these pathways are up-regulated during, and are required for, pseudopod extension. Interestingly, a recent ultrastructural study of phagocytosis in monocytes demonstrated the accumulation of plasma membrane-derived, electron-lucent vesicles beneath nascent phagosomes, particularly in the presence of PLA2 inhibitors (48Lennartz M.R. Yuen A.F.C. Masi S.M. Russell D.G. Buttle K.F. Smith J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2041-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the lack of restoration of phagocytosis by arachidonate in the presence of PI 3-kinase blockade and the results of Fig. 4 Bindicate that this membrane compartment is not likely to be directly regulated by PI 3-kinase.This study did not address the specific isoforms of PI 3-kinase involved in phagocytosis and pseudopod extension. The list of PI 3-kinase family members is long (for review, see Ref. 49Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and many have been only partially characterized. The isoform most often implicated in cellular signaling, p85/p110, is activated by many growth factor receptors; during receptor clustering, the p85 regulatory subunit is recruited to the receptor itself (50Escobedo J.A.

Although transfection of RAW LacR/FMLPR.2 cells with Δp85, a p110 binding-defective allele of p85, did not result in impaired phagocytosis despite apparent expression (data not shown), it also produced no detectable phenotypic changes in the cells; therefore, we could not verify that it functioned in a dominant-negative fashion. Other members of the PI 3-kinase family, in addition to p85 binding isoforms, may be activated after Fcγ receptor activation (60Melendez A.J. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2169-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Several molecular targets of the lipid products of PI 3-kinase have been identified. One of these, ARNO (cytohesin-2), contains a PH domain that is capable of interacting with acidic phospholipids in vitro (61Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau C.L. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L.

Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and intact ARF6 has been shown to be required in phagocytosis (63Zhang Q. Cox D. Tseng C.-C. Donaldson J.G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Other likely targets include proteins that interact with or stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange activity of members of the Rab family of GTPases. Wortmannin inhibits Rab5-mediated stimulation of endocytosis (64Li G.P. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and blocks insulin-stimulated binding of 35S-GTPγS to Rab4 (65Shibata H. Omata W. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14542-14546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is possible that lipid products of PI 3-kinase bind to PH domains on guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ARF and Rab family members, thereby increasing their exchange activity. For example, a role for phosphoinositide-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity has been described for Vav (66Han J.W. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X.D. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Another product of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, may be required for Rab-dependent membrane fusion. Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binds the FYVE finger domain of EEA1, a protein that is required for Rab5-dependent endosomal fusion in vitro. This phospholipid is required for membrane localization of EEA1 (for review, see Ref. 67Wiedemann C. Cockcroft S. Nature. 1998; 394: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple lipid products of PI 3-kinase may be required for promoting membrane fusion events in vivo, including those that accompany phagocytosis.Although it could be argued that ingestion of beads of 1–2 μm in diameter differ mechanistically from ingestion of larger beads, our results suggest that they share certain common elements, including cytochalasin sensitivity and a requirement for one or more tyrosine kinases. The slightly greater sensitivity of large bead phagocytosis to cytochalasin may reflect a requirement for sustained actin polymerization necessary to support the formation of large pseudopods. Phagocytosis of small (i.e. 1–2 μm) beads would be expected to require less sustained actin assembly to achieve complete particle engulfment. Thus, the typically incomplete inhibition of barbed end actin filament growth by cytochalasin may result in complete failure in the engulfment of large beads and only partial inhibition in the engulfment of small beads. These data are similar to recent findings by Koval et al. (68Koval M. Preiter K. Adles C. Stahl P.D. Steinberg T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), in which complete inhibition of the ingestion of latex particles by macrophages required high (2.5 μm) concentrations of cytochalasin D. Although we did not test the phagocytosis of beads smaller than 1 μm, it is anticipated that the cellular machinery involved in the ingestion of progressively smaller test particles may not require the active participation of the actin-based cytoskeleton, as suggested by Koval et al. (68Koval M. Preiter K. Adles C. Stahl P.D. Steinberg T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), or the membrane recruitment of tyrosine kinases. It is difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the requirement of PI 3-kinase in the phagocytosis of other phagocytic targets, such as bacteria, because they are geometrically distinctive and may not necessarily be opsonized uniformly, as is the case here. However, a demonstration of a requirement for PI 3-kinase was reported for the ingestion ofListeria monocytogenes by epithelial cells (69Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar); it is possible that the role of this enzyme in phagocytosis ofListeria is similar to that described in the current study.Several studies that attempt to elucidate how a cell extends surface protrusions focus on the role of actin as a protrusive force driving pseudopod extension and view the membrane as a passive component in this process (for review, see Ref. 70Condeelis J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 411-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Other models for membrane protrusion have proposed a role for a polarized endocytic cycle that involves exocytosis of vesicles at the leading edge (71Bretscher M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 601-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In support of this model, recycled transferrin receptors are concentrated at the leading lamella in migrating fibroblasts (72Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and protrusion of the cell surface in plasmodia has been linked with exocytic events (73Sesaki H. Ogihara S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 809-818PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of macrophage phagosomes indicate the presence of multiple syntaxins, and addition of tetanus toxin light chain, a v-SNARE protease, inhibited FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, underscoring the close association of the endocytic and exocytic compartments (74Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar, 75Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Sjolin C. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data support a model of pseudopod extension that requires active participation of tyrosine kinases, actin polymerization, and PI 3-kinase. All are necessary for the coordinated extension of pseudopods that culminate in the formation and eventual closure of the phagosome. Phagocytosis via Fcγ receptors in macrophages is accompanied by actin assembly, pseudopod extension, and phagosomal closure (1Greenberg S. El Khoury J. Di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). FcγR-directed actin assembly is blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and requires the participation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (3Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp.

We have determined the core histone residues acetylated in vitro by recombinant p300 and PCAF within mononucleosomes. p300 specifically acetylates all sites of histones H2A and H2B known to be acetylated in bulk chromatin in vivo but preferentially acetylates lysines 14 and 18 of histone H3 and lysines 5 and 8 of histone H4. PCAF primarily acetylates lysine 14 of H3 but also less efficiently acetylates lysine 8 of H4. PCAF in its native form, which is present in a stable multimeric protein complex lacking p300/CBP, primarily acetylates H3 to a monoacetylated form, suggesting that PCAF-associated polypeptides do not alter the substrate specificity.

The association of DNA with histones in chromatin antagonizes transcription in vitro (1Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar) and molecular genetic analyses in yeast have demonstrated roles for specific, evolutionarily conserved lysine residues within the N termini of the core histones in transcriptional regulation in vivo (for review see Ref. 3Grunstein M.

Several studies have demonstrated an enrichment of hyperacetylated histones within transcriptionally active/competent chromatin in vivo (for review see Refs. 4Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28171-28174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutational analyses of yeast GCN5 indicate that GCN5 HAT activity in vitro is correlated with histone acetylation at promoter regions and transcriptional activation of target genes in vivo (18Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These results are further supported by in vitro transcription experiments from nucleosomal templates showing acetylCoA-dependent activation by the GCN5-containing SAGA complex (20Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence demonstrate the requirement of the HAT activity of GCN5 for transcriptional activation in a nucleosomal context. The multiplicity of HATs identified suggests they may serve distinct functions. CBP and p300 are highly homologous coactivator proteins (21Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) that bind a number of sequence-specific transcriptional activators and have been suggested to be central integrators of transcriptional signals from various signal transduction pathways (22Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Both CBP and p300 interact with the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein, and this interaction results in transcriptional repression of some CBP- and p300-regulated genes (23Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 24Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

We have previously described a cellular factor, PCAF (p300/CBP-associatedfactor), which competes both in vitro andin vivo with E1A for binding to p300 and CBP (10Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of PCAF bears a high degree of sequence homology to the yeast GCN5 nuclear HAT. We have shown that PCAF (10Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) and p300 (11Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) have intrinsic HAT activity. Thus, p300 and PCAF form a histone acetylase complex in vivo. The functional requirements for the HAT activities of PCAF and p300/CBP have recently been examined in the regulation of myogenic differentiation (26Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.-J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y.J. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation (27Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), as well as in the cAMP and growth factor-induced signaling pathways (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The HAT activity of PCAF is required for myogenic, nuclear receptor- and growth factor-induced signaling pathways, whereas that of p300/CBP is dispensable. However, the intrinsic HAT activity of p300/CBP is required for cAMP-induced transcriptional activation (27Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These findings indicate distinct functional differences between the HAT activities of PCAF and p300/CBP. To further characterize the functional differences between PCAF and p300, we have examined the specificity of human p300 and PCAF for core histones in mononucleosomes isolated from HeLa cells. To date, the specific residues within core histones targeted by a nuclear HAT have been determined only for yeast GCN5 (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1997; 383: 269-272Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that p300 specifically targets all four core histones at sites known to be acetylated in vivo. These sites both overlap and extend the sites used by GCN5 (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1997; 383: 269-272Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). PCAF, which is homologous to GCN5, targets the same free histones H3 and H4 (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1997; 383: 269-272Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Significantly, even though numerous lysine residues are present in the N termini of core histones, only residues known to be acetylated in vivo are acetylated by p300 and PCAF, suggesting that histones are a physiological substrate for these enzymes. A cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of p300 was subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector, pACSG2 (PharMingen), downstream and in-frame with a DNA sequence encoding the FLAG epitope. Individual plaques of recombinant virus that express high levels of FLAG-p300 were isolated. Recombinant FLAG-p300 and FLAG-PCAF were purified as described previously (10Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). HeLa mononuclesomes were prepared as described previously (29O'Neill T.E. Roberge M. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradient-purified HeLa mononucleosomes (16 μg with respect to DNA) were labeled in a 150-μl reaction containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purified recombinant FLAG-p300 (600 fmol) or FLAG-PCAF (50 pmol) and [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.3 nmol at 50 nCi/μl, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added prior to incubation at 30 °C for 45 min. At the end of the labeling period, an aliquot of each reaction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and another aliquot was subjected to HAT assay on P81 filters as described previously (30Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The remainder of each sample was acid precipitated and purified by reverse-phase HPLC and microsequenced as described previously (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1997; 383: 269-272Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged PCAF was expressed in HeLa cells, and a stable high molecular weight PCAF complex was purified as described previously (31Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T.

Nucleosomes and free histones were acetylated as described (31Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), except that the incubation time of the reaction was increased to 1 h to maximize acetylation. The products of theses reactions were analyzed on an acid-urea gel as described (32West M.H. Bonner W.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3238-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), except that Triton X-100 was omitted to avoid separation of H3 isoforms. To date, the specific lysine residues within the core histones targeted by a nuclear histone acetyltransferase have only been examined in detail for yeast GCN5 (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1997; 383: 269-272Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Recombinant yGCN5 acetylates Lys14 of H3 and Lys8 and Lys16 of H4 when free (non-nucleosomal) histones are used as substrate. This pattern of acetylation is distinct and nonoverlapping with the acetylation pattern of the cytoplasmic HAT B involved in histone deposition (Refs. 33Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18576-18582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that acetylation of these residues may correlate with increased transcription. All reports of acetylation site usage by specific HATs to date have utilized free (non-nucleosomal) histone or synthetic peptide substrates (8Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G.

Given their nuclear localization, it seems likely that the coactivators PCAF and p300 acetylate nucleosomal substrates in vivo. Because functional differences between PCAF and p300 have been reported (26Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.-J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y.J. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y.

Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the acetylation site profiles of PCAF and p300 on a chromatin substrate were different. Recombinant human p300 and PCAF were used to label HeLa mononucleosomes with [3H]acetyl-coenzyme A. Individual core histones were then separated by reverse-phase HPLC and analyzed by N-terminal microsequencing. Radioactivity eluted during each cycle of the sequencing run was quantitated by scintillation counting for a direct measure of acetylation site usage. Previous studies have shown that the steady-state level of acetylation in unsynchronized growing HeLa cells is relatively low with the majority of the core histones being unacetylated or monoacetylated (36Thorne A.W.

Moreover, these studies have determined non-random site occupancy on H3 and H4. Lys14 of H3 and Lys16 of H4 are the residues most frequently acetylated in the monoacetylated forms of these histones in bulk chromatin (36Thorne A.W. Kmiciek D. Mitchelson K. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, although the mononucleosome substrates used in these experiments were not completely devoid of acetyl groups, the majority of the core histones were unacetylated or monoacetylated. In interpreting our acetylation data, we have considered that a small fraction of H3 and H4 was pre-acetylated at Lys14 and Lys16, respectively. Acetylation of mononucleosomes with PCAF results in strong acetylation of H3 and weak but reproducible acetylation of H4 (Fig.1). The yeast homolog of PCAF, GCN5, is unable to acetylate mononucleosomes in vitro(37Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F.

Our results indicate that Lys14 of H3 (Fig.2 A) and Lys8 of H4 (Fig. 2 B) are acetylated when purified from a PCAF-acetylated mononucleosome preparation. Little, if any, acetylation occurred at other known sites of in vivo acetylation. In the case of H3, the lack of acetylation at other residues is unlikely to be due to prior acetylation in vivo, because Lys14is the preferred steady-state site in vivo, and this residue is strongly preferred by PCAF under our assay conditions.Figure 2Microsequence analysis of mononucleosomal histones acetylated by PCAF.

We considered that Lys16 may have been unavailable for acetylation in our experiments, because this is a known preferred acetylation site in vivoin HeLa cells (37Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). We measured the amounts of bulk acetyllysine and lysine eluted in cycles 5, 8, 12, and 16 from the microsequencer. Less than 5% of the lysine residues in cycles 5 and 12 were acetylated (data not shown), indicating that the lack of acetylation at these residues by PCAF was not due to in vivoacetylation at these sites. We found that Lys16 of H4 was 59% acetylated (data not shown), even though little, if any, [3H]acetate was incorporated at this position (Fig. 2 C). Thus site occupancy may have been a contributing factor to our inability to acetylate this site. Alternatively, access to Lys16 of H4 in nucleosomes by HATs may be restricted either due to the association of the H4 tail with nucleosomal DNA (38Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar) or its proximity to the globular domain of H4 (38Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In this regard, it would be interesting to determine whether acetylation site usage is altered in the presence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, such as Swi/SNF, NURF, and CHRAC (for review see Ref. 40Varga-Weisz P.D. Becker P.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have reported that PCAF in its native form is present in a multisubunit complex containing more than 20 polypeptides (31Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Although not all of these subunits have been identified, the PCAF complex contains human counterparts of the yeast ADA2, ADA3, and SPT3 proteins; a subset of TAFs (TBP-associatedfactors); and TAF-related factors. Consistent with the observation that the interaction of p300 and CBP with PCAF in vivo is not stoichiometric or stable (10Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), the PCAF complex contains no p300 or CBP (31Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Importantly, the N-terminal half of PCAF, the region required for p300 and CBP interaction, is apparently dispensible for complex formation, because the short form of hGCN5, which lacks sequences homologous to the N terminus of PCAF, is found in an indistinguishable complex (31Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the notion that the N terminus of PCAF may be involved in transient interactions with p300/CBP, other coactivators, or sequence-specific transcription factors. The PCAF complex, like recombinant PCAF, preferentially acetylates H3 but weakly acetylates H4 (31Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). We examined whether the PCAF complex and recombinant PCAF exhibit a similar pattern of acetylation of H3 and H4. Mononucleosomes and free core histones were acetylated by the native PCAF complex or recombinant PCAF, and the degree of acetylation was determined by acid-urea gel analysis followed by autoradiography. In contrast to p300, which acetylates H3 and H4 on multiple lysine residues (Fig. 3, A,lane 2, and B, lane 2), both recombinant PCAF and the PCAF complex primarily acetylate H3 to a monoacetylated form when either free histones (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4, respectively) or nucleosomes (Fig.3 A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively) are used as substrates. Histone H4 is also primarily monoacetylated; however, the complex does yield a significant level of diacetylated H4 on free histone H4 (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Because the steady-state level of H4 monoacetylated at Lys16 is approximately 60%, it is likely that this diacetylated form is derived from modification of endogenously monoacetylated H4 at a residue other than Lys16. Thus, we conclude that the PCAF complex and the recombinant PCAF catalytic subunit have a similar substrate specificity in that they both preferentially acetylate a single residue of H3 and are only able to weakly acetylate a single residue of H4 within nucleosomal substrates in vitro. We have previously shown that p300 is capable of acetylating all four core histones in HeLa mononucleosomes (Ref. 11Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, lane 2). Sequence analysis of nucleosomal H3 acetylated by p300 revealed a strong preference for Lys14 and Lys18 with a significant amount of labeling on Lys23 (Fig. 4 C). A low level of [3H]acetyllysine was also detected at Lys4. Thus, p300 is capable of acetylating four of the six lysines known to be acetylated in vivobut has a preference for Lys14 and Lys18. Significantly, p300 did not acetylate residues Lys9 and Lys27 of H3. Acetylation at these sites has been correlated with deposition of H3 in replicating chromatin (33Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18576-18582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and the lack of acetylation at these sites by p300 is strong evidence for the involvement of a distinct activity in deposition-related acetylation of H3. Interestingly, both PCAF and p300, which can associate under certain conditions in vivo (10Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), demonstrate a strong preference for Lys14of H3. The combined action of both of these HATs at this residue may contribute to the high steady-state level of acetylation of this residue observed in vivo (36Thorne A.W. Kmiciek D. Mitchelson K. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When nucleosomal H4 was acetylated by p300, a strong preference for Lys5 and Lys8 was detected (Fig.4 D). Considerably less acetylation occurred at Lys12 and Lys16. As mentioned above, relatively high steady-state levels of acetylation at Lys16 or restricted accessibility of this residue within nucleosomes may result in low levels of acetylation at this site in vitro. Acetylation of Lys5 and Lys 12 has been correlated with histone deposition (33Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18576-18582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar); however, the results presented here suggest that acetylation of these sites may also play a role in transcriptional activation. The role of these particular acetylation events within these distinct processes may be distinguished by the context in which they occur (e.g. nucleosomal and nuclear versus non-nucleosomal and cytoplasmic) and also the potential for additional acetylations in combinatorial fashion by transcription-associated HATs. Sequence analysis of H2A demonstrated an absolute specificity of p300 for Lys5, the predominant site acetylated in H2A in vivo (36Thorne A.W. Kmiciek D. Mitchelson K. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), despite the presence of three additional lysines (Fig.4 A). This single residue specificity was in stark contrast to the multi-residue specificity of p300 for H2B. H2B contains 10 lysine residues within its first 30 amino acids, 4 of which (Lys5, Lys12, Lys15, and Lys20) have been reported to be acetylated in vivo (Ref. 36Thorne A.W. Kmiciek D. Mitchelson K. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and Table I). All four of these sites are acetylated by p300 in vitro with an apparent preference of p300 for Lys12 and Lys15(Fig. 3 B). Significantly, acetylation was not detected at lysine residues that are not known to be acetylated in vivo. (Note that we attribute the [3H]acetyllysine signal detected in cycle 16 of this analysis to carryover of a portion of the strong signal at Lys15 due to sequencing lag). These findings indicate that the HAT activity of p300 is highly selective for known in vivo acetylation sites and acetylates essentially all the lysines in H2A and H2B that are acetylated in vivo. The acetylation site specificity of p300 and PCAF with nucleosomal substrates under our assay conditions is summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of p300 and PCAF nucleosomal acetylation sitesCore histoneH2AH2BH3H4PCAFNDND148p30055,12,15,2014,18,235,8,12In vivo55,12,15,204,9,14,18,235,8,12,16The acetylation sites of nucleosomal core histones acetylated by p300 or PCAF as identified by microsequence analysis are summarized.

The results presented here demonstrate that both PCAF and p300 acetylate known in vivo acetylation sites. Therefore, although it has been reported that these enzymes are able to acetylate and modulate the activities of proteins other than histones in vitro (41Imhof A. Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), our data lend strong support to the idea that core histones are bona fide substrates of p300 and PCAF in vivo, possibly in addition to other proteins. Note that histones were recently shown to be targeted by the HAT activity of yeast GCN5in vivo (18Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We show striking differences in the acetylation sites preferred by p300 and PCAF in nucleosomal histones, with PCAF showing specificity for fewer sites than p300 under the conditions employed here. Recent studies have demonstrated that the HAT activity of PCAF is required for myogenic differentiation (26Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.-J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y.J.

Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), whereas that of p300 is dispensible. One hypothesis consistent with our data and these unique requirements for the HAT activity of PCAF over that of p300 is that acetylation site-specific phenomena are involved in transcriptional regulation. The mechanism(s) by which acetylation facilitates transcription remains to be defined, yet current data are consistent with the possibility that acetylation at sites preferred by PCAF in nucleosomes positioned about promoters may serve to recruit factors required for transcription that are not recruited by acetylation at sites preferred by p300. Alternatively it is conceivable that differences in the manner in which PCAF and p300 themselves are recruited to promoters underlie the differential functional requirements. For example, PCAF may be recruited to promoters through a transient interaction with p300/CBP and, once recruited, may associate with other factors that allow more extensive accessibility to nucleosomes beyond the immediate transcription factor binding site. That is, the HAT activity of p300/CBP may be unable to direct extensive acetylation within the promoter region or throughout the coding region of the gene due to its sequestration at the transcription factor binding site. Identification of the sites acetylated by these HATs in nucleosomal substrates, as reported here, should facilitate experimental investigation of the mechanisms of activation by these and other transcriptional regulators that possess HAT activity.

We show that PC moves across the Golgi stacks without ever leaving the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. During transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, PC is found within tubular-saccular structures greater than 300 nm in length. Thus, supermolecular cargoes such as PC do not utilize the conventional vesicle-mediated transport to traverse the Golgi stacks.

The process of cell surface receptor internalization (also termed endocytosis) is dependent on the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane into the cytosol.

Receptor stimulation leads to recruitment of cytosolic dynamin to coated pits where it induces constriction of the pits and fission of vesicles (7McClure S.J. Robinson P.J. Mol. Membr.

Accumulating evidence suggests that tyrosine protein phosphorylation is critical for the internalization of cell surface receptors.

Recently, overexpression of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src was found to cause an increase in the internalization rate constant of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor following EGF treatment (18Ware M.F.

Although these results suggest involvement of tyrosine kinases in the process of receptor internalization, their role(s) in this process is not well defined. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that tyrosine kinase activity might regulate endocytosis by acting on accessory molecules important for receptor internalization such as dynamin. We find not only that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin is required for β2-AR internalization but that this phosphorylation event itself is regulated by receptor stimulation. HEK293 cells were maintained and transfected precisely as described (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

The β2-AR sequestration was quantified as loss of cell surface receptors determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry as described (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.

To generate single tyrosine mutants (Y231F and Y597F), tyrosine 231 or tyrosine 597 of rat dynamin I was mutated to phenylalanine by overlapping polymerase chain reaction (UAC(Y) → UUC(F)) (20Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). The double tyrosine mutant (Y231F/Y597F) dynamin was constructed by recombination of the two single tyrosine mutant constructs. Isolation of total cellular dynamin for analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation was performed by affinity purification with full-length GST-Grb2 fusion protein according to the method of Gout et al. (11Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D.

GST fusion proteins were prepared as glutathione-agarose conjugates as described previously (6Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

For the detection of transient, agonist-promoted association of dynamin and c-Src, covalent protein cross-linking with Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP, Pierce) was employed. Cells were stimulated in 4.6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of 2.5 mm DSP in Me2SO, and plates were rocked for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1m Tris, pH 7.5, followed by two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/Hepes to remove unreacted DSP. Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Cell lysates in RIPA buffer were incubated with the specified antibodies and protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Src antibody (Src-2, Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc.) was used for c-Src immunoprecipitation after protein cross-linking. Dynamin proteins were immunoprecipitated without cross-linking using either mouse monoclonal anti-dynamin antibody (Hudy-1; Upstate Biotech. Inc.) or rabbit polyclonal anti-dynamin I-specific antibody (kind gift of S. L. Schmid). Immunoprecipitates or GST-Grb2 fusion complexed proteins were resolved on acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, immunoblotted with anti-dynamin or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (RC20H or PY20H, Transduction Laboratories), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK293 cells stably expressing dynamin I were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described (19Lin F.-T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Dynamin was purified using GST-Grb2 binding as described above. Partially purified dynamin was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the dynamin band was excised from the gel and subsequently used for microsequencing after tryptic digestion (22Fredericks Z.L.

HA-Erk2 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 lysates using 6 μg of 12CA5 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer and twice with kinase buffer (23Hawes B.E. van Biesen T.

Labeled MBP was quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Spatial distribution and trafficking of receptors control their function. For example, mitogenic signaling emanating from certain GPCRs and RTKs is dependent on receptor internalization (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.C.

To determine whether tyrosine kinase activity is required for G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis, isoproterenol-induced internalization of the β2-AR was examined in HEK293 cells pretreated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Fig.1 A shows that pretreatment of cells with the generic tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A reduced isoproterenol-mediated internalization of the β2-AR by 60%. More dramatically, acute exposure of cells to the specific c-Src kinase inhibitor PP1 reduced the isoproterenol-induced β2-AR sequestration by approximately 80% (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, expressing either a c-Src kinase inhibitor (Csk) or a kinase defective, dominant inhibitory form of c-Src (K298M) impaired the isoproterenol-mediated internalization of the β2-AR. Conversely, expression of an activated form of Src (v-Src) increased agonist-dependent sequestration of the β2-AR (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that Src tyrosine kinase activity is required for agonist-dependent internalization of the β2-AR. A direct interaction between c-Src and dynamin in neuronal cells has been described (27Foster-Barber A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because c-Src kinase activity was required for the agonist-mediated internalization of β2-AR, we examined whether dynamin is a phosphotyrosyl protein and a substrate for c-Src. Cellular dynamin was isolated using a GST-Grb2 affinity purification following agonist exposure. As shown in Fig.2 A, isoproterenol stimulation resulted in 2–2.5-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin (upper immunoblot), which was maximal within 2 min of agonist exposure. These results demonstrate that β2-AR activation induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin. Next, we examined whether c-Src is the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin following activation of the β2-AR. We expressed the c-Src inhibitors, Csk and K298M c-Src, or the constitutively active v-Src and examined their effect on isoproterenol-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin in HEK293 cells stably expressing dynamin I. Fig. 2 B shows that expression of Csk or K298M c-Src inhibited the agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, whereas expression of activated Src (v-Src) further enhanced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin (upper immunoblot). Thus, agonist stimulation resulted in a net increase in the phosphotyrosine content of the cellular dynamin pool, which could be reversed by inhibition of Src activity. These data mirror the effects of these reagents on β2-AR sequestration (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that c-Src-regulated internalization of the β2-AR may be mediated by the c-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin. Foster-Barber and Bishop (27Foster-Barber A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have reported that the purified SH3 domain of c-Src binds dynamin in vitro and that dynamin co-precipitates with c-Src from PC12 cell lysates. These authors did not describe tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin or modulation of c-Src-dynamin complex formation following receptor activation. To test the hypothesis that the agonist-regulated association of dynamin and c-Src might account for the agonist-promoted increase in dynamin tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined the ability of c-Src to form a complex with dynamin following β2-AR activation. Protein cross-linking was used to stabilize potentially transient, agonist-mediated, dynamin-c-Src interactions. HEK293 cells stably expressing dynamin I were treated with or without isoproterenol for 2 min followed by covalent protein cross-linking with DSP. As shown in Fig. 2 C, treatment of cells with isoproterenol increased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated dynamin present in c-Src immunoprecipitates. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of trypsin-digested phosphodynamin isolated from isoproterenol-stimulated cells revealed the presence of two major phosphopeptides. Microsequencing and amino acid sequence analyses (19Lin F.-T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) of one peptide revealed that Tyr597 is phosphorylated (Fig.3 A). Sequence analysis of the second phosphopeptide revealed sequences just N-terminal to a GYIG motif (Tyr231) that displays high sequence homology to consensus c-Src phosphorylation sites (28Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin affected its function, each of these tyrosine residues (at positions 231 and 597) was mutated to phenylalanine singly and in combination. As shown in Fig. 3 (B and C), whereas isoproterenol treatment increased the tyrosine phosphorylation content of wild-type dynamin, the single tyrosine mutants (Y231F and Y597F), and the double tyrosine mutant (Y231F/Y597F) of dynamin exhibited diminished tyrosine phosphorylation in both isoproterenol-stimulated and nonstimulated cells. The dramatic decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of Y231F/Y597F mutant strongly suggests that these residues represent the phosphorylated sites in vivo. In agreement with previous results (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 15Zhang J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), overexpression of wild-type dynamin did not enhance agonist-promoted sequestration of the β2-AR (Fig. 4 A). However, expression of Y231F or Y597F dynamin resulted in a modest reduction of agonist-induced β2-AR internalization. Expression of the Y231F/Y597F dynamin inhibited approximately 70% of the agonist-induced internalization of the β2-AR, which was equivalent to the degree of inhibition observed with GTPase-deficient dynamin K44A. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin plays an important role in its ability to support endocytosis. Recent data suggest that agonist-promoted endocytosis plays a dual regulatory role in signaling pathways emanating from GPCRs or RTKs. Activation of the Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathway by GPCRs, such as those for isoproterenol, lysophosphatidic acid, thrombin, and bombesin (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), is dependent on receptor internalization. In the case of the β2-AR, protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor confers receptor-Gi coupling, with subsequent Ras-dependent Erk1/2 activation mediated by Gβγ-subunits derived from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (31Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin 1 or dynamin, which attenuate agonist-mediated endocytosis, blocks β2-AR-mediated Erk1/2 activation (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Considering the role of dynamin in endocytosis, we investigated the effects of expressing wild-type or mutant dynamin on the β2-AR-mediated activation of the Erk2 MAP kinase. Expression of the Y231F or Y597F mutated forms of dynamin reduced the isoproterenol-mediated activation of Erk2 approximately 60% (Fig. 4,B and C). However, expression of the Y231F/Y597F mutant reduced the agonist-induced Erk2 activation by 80–90%, similar to the effects observed using the K44A dynamin (Fig. 4, Band C). These data suggest that c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin is required for Ras-mediated activation of MAP kinase by β2-AR by virtue of its involvement in receptor sequestration. Our results establish that agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin is required for β2-AR internalization and internalization-dependent signaling to MAP kinase. Clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated receptor internalization is regulated by the enzymatic (GTPase) activity of dynamin. As shown in Fig.3 A, Tyr231 and Tyr597 reside in the GTPase and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of dynamin, respectively. Intermolecular interaction between GTPase and GED domains of adjacent dynamins has been reported to regulate the GTPase activity of the enzyme (13Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr231 might regulate the GTPase activity of dynamin by controlling these intermolecular interactions. Another mutation that disables the GTPase activity of dynamin (K44A) also ablates the ability of dynamin to function in internalization of receptors (14Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 15Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) have been shown to mediate interactions with acidic phospholipids. Although there is as yet no direct evidence for dynamin PH domain-phospholipid interaction, acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate have been shown to stimulate GTPase activity of dynamin in vitro (10Lin H.C.

Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to control the GTPase activity of dynamin (33Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27979-27982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tyr597 is located in one of three variable loops of the dynamin PH domain that possess positive electrostatic potential (35Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr597 may alter the ability of dynamin to interact with effector molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and G protein βγ subunits, resulting in modulation of dynamin GTPase activity. Although the molecular mechanism(s) whereby tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin regulates its function remain unclear, the present results establish that the c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin provides one mechanism by which GPCRs regulate their own internalization and MAP kinase signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2079297169,Cochlear frequency selectivity in lower vertebrates arises in part from electrical tuning intrinsic to the sensory hair cells. The resonant frequency is determined largely by the gating kinetics of calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels encoded by the slo gene. Alternative splicing of slo from chick cochlea generated kinetically distinct BK channels. Combination with accessory beta subunits slowed the gating kinetics of alpha splice variants but preserved relative differences between them. In situ hybridization showed that the beta subunit is preferentially expressed by low-frequency (apical) hair cells in the avian cochlea. Interaction of beta with alpha splice variants could provide the kinetic range needed for electrical tuning of cochlear hair cells.

In Balb/c 3T3 cells, serum stimulation did not affect Sp1 synthesis or the relative binding of Sp1 family members to DNA; however, it did result in a rapid, ∼2-fold increase in Sp1 levels and an ∼3-fold increase in specific Sp1 phosphorylation in mid-G1. In normal human diploid fibroblasts, serum stimulation also increased Sp1 phosphorylation in mid-G1 but did not affect Sp1 levels. Therefore, Sp1 phosphorylation is regulated in a growth/cell cycle-dependent manner which correlates temporally with induction of dihydrofolate reductase transcription. Further studies revealed a kinase activity specifically associated with Sp1 in a growth-regulated manner. This activity is distinct from purified kinases previously shown to phosphorylate Sp1 in vitro and phosphorylates Sp1 between amino acids 612 and 678 in its C terminus, a region also phosphorylated in mid-G1 in vivo.

Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have determined that Sp1 and E2F sites have distinct roles in the growth/cell cycle regulation of the hamster DHFR promoter (6Jensen D.E. Black A.R. Swick A.G. Azizkhan J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although complete repression of DHFR transcription in G0 and early G1 requires E2F sites, its induction in late G1is mediated by Sp1 sites. A direct role of Sp1-dependent transcription in growth regulation of transcription is supported by targeting of Sp1 by viral oncoproteins (e.g. Refs. 7Sif S. Capobianco A.J. Gilmore T.D.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5513-5521PubMed Google Scholar).Sp1 is a ubiquitous, 778-amino acid transcription factor that recognizes GC-rich sequences present in many promoters (see Refs. 1Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar and2Black A.R. Azizkhan J.C. Pezcoller Found. J. 1996; 3: 4-16Google Scholar, for review). Although Sp1 has been viewed as a constitutive transcriptional activator which acts as a basal factor for TATAA-less promoters, an increasing number of studies indicate that Sp1-dependent transcription is regulated in response to a variety of signals. For example, in addition to their role in growth/cell cycle regulation of transcription, Sp1 sites are involved in induction of DHFR transcription in response to methotrexate (12Eastman H.B. Swick A.G. Schmitt M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), induction of CYP11A transcription in response to cyclic AMP (13Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26750-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription could be effected by changes in Sp1 abundance, DNA binding activity, and/or transactivation activity. Sp1 is O-glycosylated and phosphorylated, and both of these modifications are likely to be important in its regulation. Phosphorylation has been implicated in changes in Sp1 binding and transcriptional activation (15Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 16Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and its interaction with other factors (19Roos M. Su K. Baker J. Kudlow J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). An additional mechanism that could underlie the regulation of gene expression through Sp1 sites has come to light with the finding that Sp1 is a member of a multigene family. Of the four known members of the family, Sp2 does not recognize the same sequence as Sp1 and Sp4 expression is restricted to the brain. Sp3, on the other hand, is ubiquitously expressed and recognizes the same sequences as Sp1 but has a more complex transcriptional activity. Whereas Sp1 appears to be almost exclusively an activating transcription factor, Sp3 contains a transcriptionally repressive domain and can act as a transcriptional activator or repressor, dependent on the promoter and cell type (20Birnbaum M.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A role for Sp3 in regulation of Sp1 site-dependent transcription is seen in its mediation of p21 induction during keratinocyte differentiation (26Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).To determine the mechanism(s) underlying growth/cell cycle-regulated induction of Sp1 site-dependent transcription, we characterized changes in Sp1 following serum stimulation of quiescent cells. Serum stimulation leads to an increase in Sp1 levels and phosphorylation, with the increased phosphorylation correlating with induction of Sp1-dependent activation of the DHFR promoter in mid-late G1. We also determined that this change in phosphorylation is accompanied by changes in the association of Sp1 with a novel Sp1 kinase activity which phosphorylates the C terminus of Sp1.DISCUSSIONTo elucidate possible mechanisms underlying the serum induction of Sp1 site-dependent transcription, we have examined the levels, synthesis, phosphorylation, and DNA binding of Sp1. Serum stimulation of Balb/c 3T3 cells leads to an increase in Sp1 levels and phosphorylation, while neither Sp1 synthesis nor its specific DNA binding activity change. The increase in Sp1 phosphorylation was greater than that of protein, indicating that it results, at least in part, from an increase in the level of phosphorylation of individual Sp1 molecules. This was confirmed in NHDF where increases in Sp1 phosphorylation were seen with no significant increase in protein levels. The ratios of the different Sp1 site binding complexes were not affected by serum stimulation, indicating that the induction of transcription is not simply due to changes in the relative binding of stimulatory (Sp1) and inhibitory (Sp3) factors to the Sp1 sites. Therefore, of the parameters tested, only changes in Sp1 levels and phosphorylation could account for the growth-related changes in Sp1-dependent transcription.Analysis of the kinetics of these events revealed that induction of Sp1 protein levels occurs rapidly following serum stimulation of Balb/c 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A), whereas the increase in phosphorylation is delayed (Figs. 2 B and 3). Previously, we have reported that the kinetics of serum induction of Sp1-dependent transcription is promoter dependent in Balb/c 3T3 cells (6Jensen D.E. Black A.R. Swick A.G. Azizkhan J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), occurring either with delayed kinetics (the DHFR promoter) or rapidly (5XSp1Δ53MLP) following serum stimulation. In vivofootprinting data demonstrating that the DHFR promoter is constitutively occupied during the G0-S phase transition (42Wells J. Held P. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggest that Sp1 is not limiting at this promoter. The finding that the 5XSp1Δ53MLP promoter shows greater sensitivity to Sp1 overexpression than the DHFR promoter (see “Results”) supports this notion and indicates that Sp1 levels are more limiting at the more rapidly induced 5XSp1Δ53MLP promoter. This leads to a model for differential regulation of promoter activity by Sp1: at promoters where Sp1 levels are limiting, the rapid induction of Sp1 levels by serum would lead to rapid induction of transcription, whereas with promoters which are regulated by Sp1 phosphorylation and where Sp1 levels are not limiting, induction would be delayed.While the current study was ongoing, it was reported that serum stimulation of CHO K1 cells leads to a delayed induction of Sp1 levels and that this change correlates with the increase in Sp1-dependent transcription of DHFR (43Noe V. Chen C. Alemany C. Nicolas M. Caragol I. Chasin L.A. Ciudad C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between this study and our findings presumably resides in the different cell types and/or promoters used (the studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells used a truncated DHFR promoter containing only one Sp1 site which has shown very low activity in other studies (28Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). Although the possible contribution of phosphorylation to the induction seen in Chinese hamster ovary cells was not addressed, it appears that Sp1-dependent transcription may be regulated at multiple levels dependent on the promoter and cell type studied. This is supported by the finding that Sp1 sites play a greater role in growth regulation of the rep3 promoter than the DHFR promoter in NIH 3T3 cells (5Schilling L.J. Farnham P.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar), and that Sp1 levels and/or binding activity do not change following serum stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells or human fibroblasts (8Miltenberger R.J. Farnham P.J. Smith D.E. Stommel J.M. Cornwell M.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic A. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 44Good L.F. Dimri G.P. Campisi J. Chen K.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30483-30490Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Although not examined here, another potential mechanism for regulation of Sp1 is through O-glycosylation which has been shown to play a role in the association of Sp1 with other factors (19Roos M. Su K. Baker J. Kudlow J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and in regulation of its degradation (18Han I. JE K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Our findings are suggestive of a possible role for O-glycosylation since Sp1 levels change in Balb/c 3T3 cells without concomitant changes in Sp1 synthesis, indicating that its levels may be regulated by changes in degradation.In keeping with the serum stimulation of the phosphorylation of Sp1, we have observed an Sp1-associated kinase activity, whose interaction with Sp1 is growth-regulated. Although rigorous proof that the Sp1-associated kinase activity represents a physiologically relevant Sp1 kinase will require identification of the kinase(s) involved and determination of the effects of its inhibition in vivo (46Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) (and is, therefore, beyond the scope of the present study), several factors argue in favor of its physiological relevance. The level of the activity is growth-regulated, indicating that either the activity and/or association with Sp1 of the relevant kinase(s) is likewise growth-regulated. Furthermore, at least the majority of the activity is specifically associated with Sp1 (Fig. 4 B). The specificity of the interaction is reinforced by the finding that this activity binds strongly to GST-Sp1 (it remains bound following extensive washing of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Sp1 which had been preincubated with eluate from Sp1 immunoprecipitates2). Finally, the Sp1-associated kinase activity phosphorylates Sp1 in its C-terminal domain, a region phosphorylated in late G1 cells in vivo.Although these studies have identified an Sp1-associated kinase that is likely to be involved in regulation of its transcription, the identity of the kinase is unknown at present. Sp1 has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by CK2, PKA, and DNA-dependent protein kinase; however, the Sp1-associated kinase differs from these kinases in its ability to utilize GTP and its sensitivity to staurosporine and ethidium bromide, respectively. Although it is possible that the Sp1-associated kinase activity represents more than one kinase (it phosphorylates at least two sites on Sp1 in vitro), the low level of its GTP usage, minimal inhibition by low concentration of staurosporine, and insensitivity to ethidium bromide indicate that, if it contains any of the above kinases, they represent only a small proportion of the total activity. During the preparation of this manuscript, it was reported that DNA-dependent protein kinase leads to an increase in Sp1 activity through phosphorylation of serine 131 in the N terminus of Sp1 (47Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this phosphorylation could be enhanced by HIV-TAT, it remained dependent on the presence of DNA. Since the Sp1-associated kinase did not phosphorylate the N terminus of Sp1 and was insensitive to disruption of protein-DNA complexes by ethidium bromide, these findings further emphasize that the kinase identified here is distinct from DNA-dependent protein kinase. Therefore, the Sp1-associated kinase activity identified here contains a novel growth-regulated Sp1 kinase(s).Consistent with the data obtained in vitro, it is also unlikely that CK2, PKA, or DNA-dependent protein kinase are directly responsible for the increased phosphorylation of Sp1 in G1 in vivo. Phosphorylation of Sp1 by CK2 leads to a reduction in Sp1 DNA binding and occurs on threonine (15Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 37Zhang S. Kim K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, since G1 phosphorylation of Sp1 is on serine and no differences in DNA binding were observed between G0 and G1 cells, CK2 is unlikely to be directly responsible for the growth/cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Sp1. Although PKA activation leads to activation of Sp1 site-dependent transcription at a number of promoters, its precise role in this phenomenon is unclear. PKA phosphorylates Sp1 in vitro and this phosphorylation leads to increased Sp1 DNA binding (17Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of PKA in vivo leads to enhanced Sp1 site-dependent transcription of the sgk promoter without changes in Sp1 levels or DNA binding activity (48Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and enhanced binding to Sp1 sites at the NF-L promoter following PKA activation is due to a factor other than Sp1 (49White L.A. Reeben M. Saarma M. Whittemore S.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The increased DNA binding induced by PKA and the presence of only threonine (Thr366) in the PKA consensus site in Sp1 preclude it from being the kinase responsible for the G1 phosphorylation seen here. DNA-dependent protein kinase requires DNA ends for activity and has been implicated in responses to DNA damage (50Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar); therefore, it is unlikely to be relevant to the G1phosphorylation of Sp1. The involvement of kinases other than DNA-dependent kinase in phosphorylation of Sp1 is supported by its phosphorylation in G1 SCID mouse fibroblasts2 which lack DNA-dependent kinase activity (51Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, in keeping with the presence of Sp1 sites in multiple promoters, Sp1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by multiple kinases which are likely to be important in regulation of its activity in response to diverse signals. Ongoing studies are aimed at identifying the Sp1-associated kinase(s) and determining the precise physiological roles of its phosphorylation of Sp1.Sp1 is multiply phosphorylated and migrates as a doublet on SDS-PAGE due to different mobilities of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (35Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, serum stimulation did not change the ratio of these forms in either Balb/c 3T3 cells or NHDF (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Ref. 27Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic A. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enhanced phosphorylation of Sp1 in mid-late G1 presumably reflects increased phosphorylation of only one or a small subset of the Sp1 phosphorylation sites. In keeping with this, the Sp1-associated kinase phosphorylated a limited region of Sp1 within its C terminus (Fig. 6). Furthermore, in addition to phosphorylation of the N terminus of Sp1, our studies revealed phosphorylation in the C-terminal 167 amino acids of Sp1 in G1 cells in vivo. Unfortunately, due to low expression of transfected proteins in serum-starved cells, it was not possible to determine how phosphorylation of this fragment is related to the up-regulation of Sp1 phosphorylation in G1. Interestingly, while studies in asynchronously growing HeLa cells readily detected phosphorylation of the N-terminal portion of Sp1, they failed to detect significant phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (35Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Although this discrepancy may reflect cell type differences, together with the phosphorylation of the C terminus of Sp1 by a growth-regulated, Sp1-associated kinase activity, it further argues that the C terminus of Sp1 is preferentially phosphorylated in G1 cells.The region of Sp1 phosphorylated in vitro lies in the N-terminal half of the DNA-binding domain of the protein. This region contains only 3 serines (Fig. 5 C); however, due to the relaxed kinase substrate specificity observed in vitro, it is not possible to say which of these are physiological sites of phosphorylation. Nonetheless, these studies delineate the region of Sp1 which can be phosphorylated by the Sp1-associated kinase activity. The N-terminal zinc finger contributes weakly to the high affinity binding of Sp1 to DNA (52Yokono M. Saegusa N. Matsushita K. Sugiura Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6824-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which may account for the finding that enhanced Sp1 phosphorylation in G1 does not correlate with significant changes in the specific DNA binding activity of Sp1.Lack of correlation between DHFR transcription and increased levels or DNA binding of Sp1 indicate that the enhanced Sp1 activity is likely to involve alterations in its association with other proteins. With regard to enhanced phosphorylation of Sp1 in G1, it is noteworthy that the C terminus of Sp1 has been implicated in its interaction with other transcription factors. This region of Sp1 is involved in synergistic activation with sterol regulatory element-binding protein (53Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 54Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and mediates its interaction with TAFII55 (55Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and with both YY1 and E2F1 (27Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic A. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, the region of Sp1 that interacts with E2F1 maps precisely to the region phosphorylated by the Sp1-associated kinase activity. 4L-W. Guo, A. R. Black, and J. C. Azizkhan, unpublished data. Since interaction with YY1 or E2F1 can affect Sp1-dependent transcription in the absence of their direct binding to DNA (27Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic A. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 56Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), modulation of these interactions by phosphorylation of Sp1 in mid-late G1could mediate changes in Sp1 site-dependent transcription. Sp1 has also been shown to physically or functionally interact with other cell cycle regulatory proteins such as retinoblastoma protein and p107 (58Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R.

Current efforts are directed at determining how mutation of this C-terminal region of Sp1 affects its interaction with other factors and the growth/cell cycle regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription. Expression of a large number of genes associated with DNA synthesis, such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PKA, protein kinase A; NHDF, normal human diploid fibroblasts; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PKA, protein kinase A; NHDF, normal human diploid fibroblasts; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. is tightly regulated with cell growth and the cell cycle. Many of these genes have promoters which lack a TATAA element but contain binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and E2F (1Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of E2F sites in growth/cell cycle regulation of transcription and the regulation of E2F by retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and related pocket proteins have been extensively characterized (see Refs. 2Black A.R.

Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have determined that Sp1 and E2F sites have distinct roles in the growth/cell cycle regulation of the hamster DHFR promoter (6Jensen D.E. Black A.R. Swick A.G. Azizkhan J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although complete repression of DHFR transcription in G0 and early G1 requires E2F sites, its induction in late G1is mediated by Sp1 sites. A direct role of Sp1-dependent transcription in growth regulation of transcription is supported by targeting of Sp1 by viral oncoproteins (e.g. Refs. 7Sif S. Capobianco A.J. Gilmore T.D.

These rearrangements lead to a complete absence of LGI1 expression in glioblastoma cells. The LGI1 gene encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD and contains 3.5 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) with conserved flanking sequences. In the LRR domain, LGI1 has the highest homology with a number of transmembrane and extracellular proteins which function as receptors and adhesion proteins. LGI1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, especially in brain; its expression is reduced in low grade brain tumors and it is significantly reduced or absent in malignant gliomas. Its localization to the 10q24 region, and rearrangements or inactivation in malignant brain tumors, suggest that LGI1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene involved in progression of glial tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2137618022,"All possible pairwise combinations of UvrD, MutL, MutS, and MutH were tested using the yeast two-hybrid system to identify potential interactions involving mismatch repair proteins. A two-hybrid screen previously identified a physical interaction between MutL and UvrD. Although several other known interactions were not observed, a novel interaction between MutL and MutH was detected. A series of truncations from the NH2 and COOH termini of MutL demonstrated that the COOH-terminal 218 amino acids were sufficient for the two-hybrid interaction with MutH. Removal of a small number of residues from either the NH2 or COOH termini of MutH eliminated the two-hybrid interaction with MutL. Protein affinity chromatography experiments confirmed that MutL, but not MutS, physically associates with MutH. Furthermore, MutL greatly stimulated the d(GATC)-specific endonuclease activity of MutH in the absence of MutS and a mispaired base. Stimulation of the MutH-associated endonuclease activity by MutL was dependent on ATP binding but not ATP hydrolysis. Further stimulation of this reaction by MutS required the presence of a DNA mismatch and a hydrolyzable form of ATP. These results suggest that MutL activates the MutH-associated endonuclease activity through a physical interaction during methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli.

These results suggest that MutL activates the MutH-associated endonuclease activity through a physical interaction during methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. The methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway in Escherichia coli functions to correct DNA biosynthetic errors that arise during chromosomal replication and to discourage recombination between substantially diverged DNA sequences (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the mismatch repair system results in elevated spontaneous mutation rates (2Nevers P. Spatz H.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 139: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pathway has been reconstituted in vitro and involves the action of eight proteins (3Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Initiation of mismatch repair requires MutS, MutL, and MutH in addition to a DNA mismatch, ATP, and Mg2+, and results in the generation of a nick in the unmethylated (nascent) strand of a nearby hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence (4Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transient hemimethylated state of d(GATC) sequences after replication serves as a signal to direct repair to the nascent DNA strand (5Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MutH is stimulated to catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage at the d(GATC) site in the presence of MutL and MutS (4Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the initiation stage of mismatch repair, DNA unwinding is initiated at the nick by DNA helicase II (UvrD) and proceeds to a point beyond the error (10Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excision of the error-containing DNA strand is facilitated by the action of one of several exonucleases (depending on the polarity of the reaction) which serve to degrade the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. as it is unwound by UvrD (11Grilley M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ssDNA-binding protein, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme catalyzes repair synthesis on the resulting gapped DNA molecule to restore the correct sequence, and DNA ligase seals the final nick (3Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The E. coli MutH protein possesses a weak endonuclease activity that is specific for unmethylated d(GATC) sequences (13Welsh K.M. Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15624-15629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, MutS, MutL, and a hemimethylated DNA substrate containing a mismatched base pair, the MutH-associated endonuclease activity is greatly stimulated (4Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the MutH endonuclease activity is activated by the MutS-MutL complex is not known. Recently, we identified a physical interaction between the MutL and UvrD proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen with UvrD as bait (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, a biochemical interaction was reported between MutL and UvrD (15Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To identify other potential interactions involving E. coli mismatch repair proteins, all possible pairwise combinations of MutS, MutL, MutH, and UvrD were tested for interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. An interaction was identified between MutL and MutH which was subsequently confirmed by affinity chromatography. The weak endonuclease activity of MutH on unmethylated d(GATC) sequences was greatly stimulated by MutL. Surprisingly, this stimulation of the activity of MutH occurred in the absence of MutS and a mismatched base pair, suggesting that MutL is the component of the MutS-MutL complex responsible for activating MutH during mismatch repair in vivo and that the activation occurs via a direct physical interaction. In addition, the stimulation of MutH by MutL was dependent on ATP but not ATP hydrolysis. These results suggest an additional role for the MutL protein in coordinating activities during mismatch repair in E. coli. pGAD424 and pGBT9, and yeast HF7c and SFY526 were from the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). pCYB1, pCYB2, and all components of the Impact I protein purification system were from New England Biolabs. E. coliGE1752ΔuvrD (16Mendonca V.M. Kaiser-Rogers K. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4641-4651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GE1752mutS::Tn5 (17.Kaiser-Rogers, K. A., Escherichia coli DNA Helicase II: Construction and Characterization of ATPase “A” Site Mutants and Deletion Mutants Involving Helicase II, Helicase IV, and Rep Protein. Ph.D. dissertation, 1991, 66, 70, Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.Google Scholar) were constructed previously in this laboratory. HMS174 (recA1 hsdR (rK12-mK12+) RifR) was from Novagen. BL21(DE3)mutS::Tn5 was constructed by P1 transduction (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar) using GE1752mutS::Tn5 as the donor strain and BL21(DE3) as the recipient. Several Kanrtransductants were selected, colony purified, and screened for a mutator phenotype. To ensure that the mutator phenotype was caused by the mutant mutS allele, complementation experiments were performed using a high copy number plasmid that expressed MutS. To prepare M13mp18 ssDNA, phage infection of E. coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) and collection of phage particles were performed as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 4.26-4.32Google Scholar). Phage particles were purified on a CsCl gradient (0.438 g of CsCl/ml; 83,000 × g for 24 h at 25 °C). After isolation from the gradient and dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to remove CsCl, the phage particles were treated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 50 °C. M13mp18 ssDNA was purified from phage particles by sequential extractions with buffered phenol, 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol followed by ethanol precipitation. M13mp18 RF DNA was prepared from phage-infected XL-1 Blue cells as described (20$$Google Scholar). T7 DNA polymerase was purified previously according to a published procedure (21Fischer H. Hinkle D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7956-7964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All enzymes used for cloning and PCR were from New England Biolabs with the exception of T4 DNA ligase, which was from Boehringer Mannheim. Nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Construction of pGAD424-UvrD, pGAD424-MutL, pGBT9-UvrD, and pGBT9-MutL was described previously (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The coding regions of mutS and mutH were amplified by PCR from E. coli K-12 genomic DNA using Vent DNA polymerase. Oligonucleotide primers for amplifying themutS gene contained restriction enzyme sites that allowed cloning of the mutS coding sequence into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pGAD424 and pGBT9, creating a translational fusion with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain and DNA binding domain, respectively, for use in the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, these primers contained restriction enzyme sites that allowed cloning of mutS into the NdeI and SmaI sites of pCYB2 for overexpression and purification of MutS using the Impact I protein purification system. Likewise, primers for amplifying themutH coding sequence contained restriction enzyme sites that allowed cloning of mutH into the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pGAD424 and pGBT9 and into theNdeI and SapI sites of pCYB1. pET3c-MutL was constructed by subcloning the NdeI-BamHI fragment containing the mutL coding sequence from pGAD424 into theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET3c (Novagen). Deletions from each end of themutL gene in pGAD424 were constructed previously (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To construct mutHΔ38N and mutHΔ10C, the appropriate portion of the mutH gene was amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide primers used in these reactions contained restriction enzyme sites that allowed cloning of each PCR product into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBT9, creating a translational fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Potential interactions between mismatch repair genes were tested in yeast HF7c by cotransformation of all possible combinations of pGAD424 and pGBT9 harboring theuvrD, mutL, mutS, and mutHgenes. After selection of cotransformants on complete synthetic media lacking tryptophan and leucine, cells were transferred to complete synthetic media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and supplemented with 1 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. HF7c contains a HIS3 reporter gene that requires a two-hybrid interaction for expression. Yeast SFY526 containing a lacZreporter gene was used to confirm any interactions by monitoring β-galactosidase activity in the presence of the color-producing substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified (where indicated) as described by the supplier using the substrate o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, and results were expressed as Miller units (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). Purification of MutL from GE1752ΔuvrD was described previously (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To overexpress MutL in an E. coli strain lacking a functionalmutS gene product, a 10.5-liter culture of BL21(DE3)mutS::Tn5 containing pET3c-MutL was grown at 30 °C in 2 × YT medium. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A 600 nm of 2.0, and incubation at 30 °C was continued for 5 h. Cells (118 g) were harvested by centrifugation and washed with M9 minimal medium salts. Cell lysis and protein purification were performed essentially as described previously (9Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a few exceptions. First, 10% glycerol was included in all column buffers. Second, a Bio-Rex 70 column was used as the initial chromatographic step. Subsequently, the first hydroxylapatite chromatographic step was used, and the second hydroxylapatite column was eliminated. Third, a Superose 12 HR 10/30 high performance liquid chromatography sizing column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for the final purification step instead of a Sephadex G-150 column. Storage buffer for MutL was 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. To overexpress MutH, three 1-liter cultures of HMS174 containing pCYB1-MutH were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 nmof 1.2 in 2 ×YT medium. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, and growth was continued at 30 °C for 5 h. Cells (12 g) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 750 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed by sonication, and protein purification was performed using a 20-ml chitin column (4.1 cm × 4.9 cm2) equilibrated in column buffer essentially as recommended for the Impact I system. To overexpress MutH in an E. coli strain lacking a functional mutS gene product, a 10.5-liter culture of GE1752mutS::Tn5 containing pCYB1-MutH was grown at 30 °C to an optical density of 3.0 in 2 × YT medium. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, and growth was continued for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with M9 minimal medium salts, and resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells (70 g) were lysed by sonication and purified on a 20-ml chitin column (4.1 cm × 4.9 cm2) according to the Impact I purification protocol. The chitin column was equilibrated and washed with column buffer, and intein-induced self-cleavage was initiated with cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 72 h before elution of MutH from the chitin column. Pooled MutH (18 mg in 27.5 ml) was dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol to remove the 2-mercaptoethanol. MutH was precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 4 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and dialyzed against two 500-ml volumes of this buffer to remove ammonium sulfate. MutH was loaded in 1-ml aliquots onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 sizing column at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min to separate MutH from a prominent contaminating protein of approximately 75 kDa. Both preparations of MutH were stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. To overexpress MutS, four 750-ml cultures of HMS174 containing pCYB2-MutS were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 nmof 0.7 in 2 × YT medium. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, and growth was continued for an additional 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 750 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells (9 g) were lysed by sonication and purified using a 20-ml chitin column (4.1 cm × 4.9 cm2) essentially as recommended for the Impact I system. Purified MutS was stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. All protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Because of the nature of the intein cleavage reaction in the Impact I system, purified MutS contained two extra amino acids on the COOH terminus (proline and glycine). The amino acid sequence of MutH purified using the Impact I system was identical to native MutH. The oligonucleotides 5′-GGTACCGAGTTCGAATTCG-3′ and 5′-GGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG-3′ were used to generate covalently closed duplex M13mp18 DNA containing a single G-T mismatch (heteroduplex) and no mismatch (homoduplex), respectively. The G-T mismatch in the heteroduplex substrate disrupted a SacI site in the polylinker of M13mp18. The presence of the mismatch was confirmed by digestion of the heteroduplex substrate withSacI. Both oligonucleotides anneal to identical positions in the M13mp18 polylinker, and all manipulations used to generate the heteroduplex and homoduplex substrates were identical. Before annealing, oligonucleotides were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Annealing mixtures (65 μl) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 140 pmol of oligonucleotide, and 4.6 pmol of M13mp18 ssDNA molecules. These mixtures were heated to 94 °C for 3 min and cooled 1 °C/min to 30 °C in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermal cycler. Components of the extension reaction were added to the annealing mixtures such that a final volume of 130 μl was achieved containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 8 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 500 μm each dNTP, and 8.3 mm dithiothreitol. Extension reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with enough T7 DNA polymerase to achieve complete conversion of M13mp18 ssDNA to duplex molecules. To achieve covalently closed molecules, 750 μm ATP and 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to each extension reaction. Extension reactions were pooled and covalently closed, and nicked circular DNA was separated on a CsCl/EtBr gradient as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 4.26-4.32Google Scholar). MutH-catalyzed endonuclease reactions (16 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 50 ng of the appropriate DNA substrate. When present, ATP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP were 1.25 mm. When present, MutL and MutS were added immediately before initiation of the reactions with the indicated concentration of MutH. All protein dilutions were made in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and quenched with 4 μl of 5 × dye solution (25% glycerol, 100 mm EDTA, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml EtBr to separate covalently closed and nicked circular DNA species. Agarose gels were subsequently irradiated with a hand-held UV (254 nm) lamp for 30 min, restained for 30 min with 0.5 μg/ml EtBr, and destained with deionized and distilled water. Gels were illuminated with UV light and photographed using an Eagle Eye II still video imaging system (Stratagene). 4.5 mg of purified MutH was covalently coupled to approximately 750 μl of Affi-Gel 10 resin as described by the supplier (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm MES (pH 6.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol for 12 h at 4 °C. The coupling reaction was quenched with 25 mm ethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 1 h, and the resin was transferred to a chromatography column (inner diameter = 0.75 cm). The coupling efficiency was greater than 50% based on quantitation of protein in the initial column flow-through using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The column was equilibrated with affinity buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mm MgCl2) containing 50 mmNaCl. Approximately 100 μg of the indicated protein, diluted to a 1-ml volume in affinity buffer plus 50 mm NaCl, was applied to the MutH affinity column at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. The column was washed four times with 500 μl of affinity buffer plus 50 mm NaCl, collecting each wash as an individual fraction. The column was eluted with four 500-μl volumes of affinity buffer plus 1 m NaCl, collecting each as an individual fraction. Fractions were analyzed for protein content by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A control column containing chicken egg white lysozyme covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 resin was constructed previously (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Experiments using this column were performed exactly as described for the MutH affinity column. Previously, we identified a physical interaction between the methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins MutL and UvrD using a yeast two-hybrid screen of an E. coli genomic library with UvrD as bait (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To identify other potential interactions between components of the mismatch repair system, the mutS andmutH genes were amplified by PCR from E. coliK-12 genomic DNA and cloned into the two-hybrid system vectors pGAD424 and pGBT9 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All possible pairings of uvrD, mutL, mutS, and mutH were tested for interactions in yeast HF7c cells containing a HIS3 two-hybrid reporter gene. Although the previously described dimerization of MutL (9Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oligomerization of MutS (7Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and interaction between MutL and MutS (9Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were not detected using the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown), a potential interaction between MutL and MutH was observed (Fig.1). Interestingly, the interaction between MutL and MutH was only observed when MutL was fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain and MutH was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. To confirm that the pGAD424-MutH construct expressing MutH as a fusion with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain did not contain a mutation resulting in the loss of an interaction with the MutL-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion, mutH was subcloned from pGBT9-MutH into pGAD424. Again, an interaction was not observed with the MutL-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion. These results were confirmed using yeast SFY526, containing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of a promoter other than the HIS3 reporter gene in HF7c. The reason for the observed “polarity” in the two-hybrid interaction between MutL and MutH is not known. Purified MutH protein (Fig.2) was covalently coupled to an activated agarose resin (Affi-Gel 10) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm a physical interaction between MutL and MutHin vitro, 100 μg of purified MutL was applied to the MutH affinity column. The column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 1 m NaCl. A large fraction of the applied MutL was retained on the MutH column after the 50 mm NaCl wash steps and was eluted with 1 m NaCl (Fig.3 A). In contrast, when an identical experiment was performed using an Affi-Gel 10 column covalently coupled to chicken egg white lysozyme, the applied MutL was found exclusively in the flow-through and 50 mm NaCl wash fractions (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, MutL was specifically retained on the MutH affinity column because of a physical interaction with MutH.Figure 3MutL is specifically retained on a MutH affinity column. Approximately 100 μg of MutL (panel A), BSA (panel C), or MutS (panel D) was applied to a 750-μl Affi-Gel 10 column to which purified MutH had been covalently coupled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Likewise, 100 μg of MutL was applied to an Affi-Gel 10 column containing covalently coupled chicken egg white lysozyme (panel B). In all panels: lane 1, flow-through (FT); lanes 2–5, 50 mmNaCl wash fractions; lanes 6–9, 1 m NaCl elution fractions. Each lane contains 36 μl of the corresponding fraction. All fractions were 500 μl with the exception of the flow-through, which was 1 ml. Molecular mass markers were: rabbit muscle phosphorylase b, 97.4 kDa; BSA, 66.2 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ensure further that the interaction between MutL and MutH observed using affinity chromatography was specific, 100 μg each of BSA and MutS were applied to the MutH affinity column. Using the same experimental protocol used for MutL, neither BSA nor MutS was retained to a significant extent on the column (Fig. 3, C andD). These results support the yeast two-hybrid results and suggest that a physical interaction exists between MutL and MutH. To identify the regions of MutL and MutH responsible for the two-hybrid interaction, a series of truncations was made from the NH2 and COOH termini of both proteins. TruncatedmutL alleles were generated in pGAD424 and tested for an interaction in the presence of pGBT9-MutH in yeast SFY526 (Fig.4). Likewise, truncated mutHalleles were generated in pGBT9 and tested for an interaction in the presence of pGAD424-MutL. SFY526 contains a lacZ reporter gene encoding β-galactosidase. The relative strengths of interactions were measured using a spectrophotometric assay that monitors the cleavage of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside by β-galactosidase. Results are reported as Miller units (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). Removal of 293, 344, or 397 amino acids from the NH2terminus of MutL (MutLΔ293N, MutLΔ344N, and MutLΔ397N) did not eliminate the two-hybrid interaction with MutH. In contrast, removal of 438 amino acids from the NH2 terminus (MutLΔ438N) or 59 amino acids from the COOH terminus (MutLΔ59C) of MutL completely eliminated the two-hybrid interaction with MutH. These results indicate that the COOH-terminal 218 amino acids of MutL are necessary and sufficient to maintain this interaction and therefore contain the MutH interaction interface. Removal of 38 amino acids from the NH2 terminus (MutHΔ38N) or 10 amino acids from the COOH terminus (MutHΔ10C) of MutH eliminated the two-hybrid interaction with MutL. Thus, we were unable to define the interaction interface of MutH in more detail. It is possible that both ends of MutH contribute to the interaction domain. Alternatively, one or both of these truncation mutants may not be expressed or maintained as stable proteins in the yeast cells. These results are strikingly similar to those observed for the MutL-UvrD interaction (14Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal 218 amino acids of MutL were also sufficient to maintain the two-hybrid interaction with UvrD, whereas both the NH2 and COOH termini of UvrD were required for the interaction with MutL. The d(GATC)-specific endonuclease activity of MutH is relatively weak in the absence of other components of the mismatch repair system (13Welsh K.M. Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Their distinct catalytic and chromatographic properties result from binding different metals. The apo-enzyme, obtained after metal is removed from either enzyme, is catalytically inactive. Addition of Ni2+ or Co2+ to the apo-protein yields E-2 activity. E-2′ activity is obtained when Fe2+ is added.

Remnants have been found of a shallow-water reef that formed during a pause, similar to the Younger Dryas, in the penultimate deglaciation at 130,000 ± 2000 years ago, when sea level was 60 to 80 meters lower than it is today. Porites coral, which grew during this period, has oxygen isotopic values and strontium/calcium ratios that indicate that sea-surface temperatures were much cooler (22° ± 2°C) than either Last Interglacial or present-day tropical temperatures (29° ± 1°C). These observations provide further evidence for a major cooling of the equatorial western Pacific followed by an extremely rapid rise in sea level during the latter stages of Termination II."
https://openalex.org/W2091092658,"The role of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling was analyzed. STAT5 became immediately and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine 694 in response to TCR stimulation. Expression of the protein tyrosine kinase Lck, a key signaling protein in the TCR complex, activated DNA binding of transfected STAT5A and STAT5B to specific STAT inducible elements. The role of Lck in STAT5 activation was confirmed in a Lck-deficient T cell line in which the activation of STAT5 by TCR stimulation was abolished. Expression of Lck induced specific interaction of STAT5 with the subunits of the TCR, indicating that STAT5 may be directly involved in TCR signaling. Stimulation of T cell clones and primary T cell lines also induced the association of STAT5 with the TCR complex. Inhibition of STAT5 function by expression of a dominant negative mutant STAT5 reduced antigen-stimulated proliferation of T cells. Thus, TCR stimulation appears to directly activate STAT5, which may participate in the regulation of gene transcription and T cell proliferation during immunological responses."
https://openalex.org/W2019532691,"We have investigated the effect of inducing apoptosis in BJAB and Jurkat cells on the cellular content of several polypeptide chain initiation factors. Serum deprivation results in inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis in BJAB cells; at early times, there is selective degradation of polypeptide initiation factor eIF4G but no major losses of other key initiation factors. The disappearance of full length eIF4G is accompanied by the appearance of smaller forms of the protein, including a major product of approximately 76 kDa. Apoptosis induced by cycloheximide results in similar effects. Both total cytoplasmic eIF4G and eIF4G associated with eIF4E are degraded with a half-life of 2–4 h under these conditions. Treatment of serum-starved or cycloheximide-treated cells with Z-VAD.FMK or Z-DEVD.FMK, which inhibit caspases required for apoptosis, protects eIF4G from degradation and blocks the appearance of the ca. 76 kDa product. Exposure of BJAB cells to rapamycin rapidly inhibits protein synthesis but does not lead to acute degradation of eIF4G. In both BJAB and Jurkat cells induction of apoptosis with anti-Fas antibody or etoposide also results in the selective loss of eIF4G, which is inhibitable by Z-VAD.FMK. These data suggest that eIF4G is selectively targeted for cleavage as cells undergo apoptosis and is a substrate for proteases activated during this process."

https://openalex.org/W2008153397,"Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widespread parasites of humans and animals. The parasite has a remarkable ability to invade a broad range of cells within its mammalian hosts by mechanisms that are poorly understood at the molecular level. This broad host cell specificity suggests that adhesion should involve the recognition of ubiquitous surface-exposed host molecules or, alternatively, the presence of various parasite attachment molecules able to recognize different host cell receptors. We have discovered a sugar-binding activity (lectin) in tachyzoites ofT. gondii that plays a role in vitro in erythrocyte agglutination and infection of human fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The ability to agglutinate erythrocytes can be reversed by a variety of soluble glycoconjugates, of which heparin, fucoidan, and dextran sulfate were the most effective. Interestingly, infectivity of tachyzoites for human foreskin fibroblasts, cells that are commonly used to grow T. gondii in vitro, was increased by low concentrations of the sulfated glycoconjugates that inhibited hemagglutination activity (i.e. dextran sulfate and fucoidan) whereas high concentrations inhibited parasite infection. Furthermore, inhibition of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and sulfation on the host cells reduced Toxoplasma infectivity. Finally,Toxoplasma tachyzoites showed a reduced ability to infect epithelial cell mutants deficient in the biosynthesis of surface proteoglycans. The probable identity of the hemagglutinin(s) was investigated by 1) direct binding of red blood cells to filter blots ofToxoplasma proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 2) binding of metabolically labeled parasite proteins to fixed mammalian cells. Three parasite bands were thus identified as candidate adhesins. These results suggest that attachment of T. gondii to its target cell is mediated by parasite lectins and that sulfated sugars on the surface of host cells may function as a key parasite receptor.

These results suggest that attachment of T. gondii to its target cell is mediated by parasite lectins and that sulfated sugars on the surface of host cells may function as a key parasite receptor. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects about 13 of the adult population of the world (1McCabe R. Remington J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although toxoplasmosis is generally asymptomatic in healthy adults, the infection may cause severe sequelae in neonates and life-threatening lesions in AIDS patients (2Wilson C.B. Remington J.S. Stagno S. Reynolds D.W. Pediatrics. 1980; 66: 767-774PubMed Google Scholar, 3Koppe J.G. Loewer-Sieger D.H. De Roever-Bonnet H. Lancet. 1986; 1: 254-256Abstract PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Levy R.M. Bredesen D.E. Rosenblum M.L. J. Neurosurg. 1985; 621: 475-495Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Furthermore, toxoplasmosis is also of considerable importance in domestic animals, given its association with abortion in sheep and swine and as a major source of infection for humans (5Remington J.S. Desmonts G. Remington J.S. Klein J.O. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 89-195Google Scholar).The T. gondii life cycle includes three major, distinct stages: sporozoites, which are the product of the sexual cycle, and the asexually dividing tachyzoites and bradyzoites. The sporozoite and the bradyzoite reside within distinct cyst structures that are relatively long-lived and infectious if ingested. On the other hand, the rapidly growing tachyzoite is responsible for spreading the infection from cell to cell and probably for most of the disease symptoms. Tachyzoites multiply inside a parasitophorous vacuole that does not fuse with host cell lysosomes. Rapid multiplication of the intracellular parasite is followed by rupture of the host cell and infection of contiguous cells. At some point during infection, there is a shift from multiplication of tachyzoites to the formation of tissue cysts filled with bradyzoites (5Remington J.S. Desmonts G. Remington J.S. Klein J.O. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 89-195Google Scholar).T. gondii tachyzoites have the ability to interact with and invade a diverse array of cells, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and cells of the central nervous system. Ultrastructural studies indicate that invasion is a very rapid (15–40 s) and complex event in which specialized organelles located in the anterior pole of the tachyzoite seem to be involved (6Werk R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Sibley L.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 129-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Schwartzman J.D. Saffer L.D. Avila J.L. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 18. Plenum Press, New York1992: 333-364Google Scholar). The process of entry is initiated by the parasite contacting the host cell with its anterior region; this is followed by protrusion of the conoid, modification of the host cell membrane, and secretion of the microneme and rhoptry contents. As the parasite enters, host cell pseudopods extend along the parasite, so that the tachyzoite becomes enclosed in an intracellular vacuole separated from the host cytosol by a unit membrane (6Werk R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Sibley L.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 129-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Schwartzman J.D. Saffer L.D. Avila J.L. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 18. Plenum Press, New York1992: 333-364Google Scholar).Attachment is a prerequisite for microbial colonization and invasion of host cells and is usually mediated by microbial surface proteins called adhesins that bind to protein or carbohydrate epitopes present on the host cell surfaces. Several lines of evidence indicate thatToxoplasma tachyzoites interact with host cells by specific receptor-ligand types of interactions (9Mineo J.R. McLeod R. Mack D. Smith J. Khan I.A. Ely K.H. Kasper L.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3951-3964PubMed Google Scholar, 10Furtado G.C. Slowik M. Kleinman H.K. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2337-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Furtado G.C. Cao Y. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4925-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, invasion of host cells by tachyzoites can be inhibited by treating the parasite with rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against theToxoplasma major surface protein, SAG1 (9Mineo J.R. McLeod R. Mack D. Smith J. Khan I.A. Ely K.H. Kasper L.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3951-3964PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that a SAG1-deficient mutant is still able to infect host cells (9Mineo J.R. McLeod R. Mack D. Smith J. Khan I.A. Ely K.H. Kasper L.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3951-3964PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that additional parasite molecules may be available to allow host cell infection. That components of the extracellular matrix may be important participants in this process has also been shown in experiments demonstrating that the glycoprotein laminin was able to enhance tachyzoite attachment to a macrophage-like cell line in vitro (10Furtado G.C. Slowik M. Kleinman H.K. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2337-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that host cell laminin bound to the parasite surface mediates binding of the tachyzoite to the laminin receptor α6β1 on eukaryotic cells (11Furtado G.C. Cao Y. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4925-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The knowledge that T. gondii possesses the ability to attach to and replicate within almost any type of nucleated cell prompted us to look for clues that may explain this promiscuous and efficient parasite conduct. One possible interpretation for this seemingly indiscriminate behavior may be the presence of multiple adhesion molecules on the Toxoplasma surface that interact with cells of dissimilar background and surface composition. However, it is also possible that a single Toxoplasma adhesin may be able to recognize a host cell surface receptor common to most vertebrate cells. Because carbohydrates are found modifying most cell surface proteins and have the greatest potential for structural variety, and because there is good evidence to believe that they act as carriers of biological information, our studies were designed to identify a potential T. gondii sugar-binding protein that might be involved in the process of host cell recognition and attachment. We have discovered a Toxoplasma surface lectin with specificity for sulfated polysaccharides that appears to be important in the process of attachment to the host cell.DISCUSSIONCell surface lectins are increasingly being considered as mediators of cell-cell interaction in a range of biological systems (30Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 31Lasky L.A. Presta L.G. Erbe D.V. Metcalf B.W. Dalton B.J. Poste G. Cellular Adhesion: Molecular Definition to Therapeutic Potential. Plenum Press, New York1994: 37-53Crossref Google Scholar, 32Lis H. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In the microbial world, lectins help microorganisms in the process of recognition and attachment to host surfaces, a critical step in successful colonization and, ultimately, production of disease (33Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). In the case of Apicomplexa parasites, there is evidence that the homing of malaria sporozoites to the liver is based on the recognition of hepatocyte cell surface heparan sulfate (reviewed in ref. 34Frevert U. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas infection of the host erythrocytes by Plasmodium merozoites appears to be mediated at least in part by sialic acid (35Orlandi P.A. Klotz F.W. Haynes J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), whereas placental chondroitin sulfate A is a cell surface receptor for infected erythrocytes (36Fried M. Duffy P.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). We thus sought to determine whether aToxoplasma lectin or family of lectins that recognize different sugar residues might modulate Toxoplasma tropism and infection.For our initial experiments, we chose the method of mixed agglutination using whole tachyzoites and detergent lysates of the parasite plus rabbit erythrocytes and found an agglutinating activity inhibitable by the sulfated polysaccharides heparin, dextran sulfate and fucoidan. None of the tested mono- and disaccharides inhibited agglutination, suggesting that a polysaccharide is required to span two or more active sites on the sugar binding domain or may be a reflection of the fact that the binding mechanism involves a large number of weak interactions. An important question is whether inhibition of hemagglutination by heparin, dextran sulfate and fucoidan is related to electrostatic interactions or a specific steric configuration, because this would give an insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in these events. Because the glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate have charge densities that are comparable to or higher than fucoidan, and yet they display no inhibitory activity, the inhibitory mechanism must depend on more than the electrostatic interaction between charged molecules of different polarities.The structural specificity required for inhibition is also exemplified by the difference in potency of heparin and heparan sulfate. Structurally, heparin and heparan sulfate molecules consist of repeated disaccharide units that are sulfated differently. In general, heparin contains a higher proportion of sulfation and higherl-iduronic acid:d-glucuronic acid ratio than heparan sulfate, suggesting that although a relatively high sulfation density appears essential, it is possible that the composition of the carbohydrate backbone and the position of sulfated groups also play a crucial role in the interaction of the Toxoplasma lectin and its inhibitors. Furthermore, a range of effects onToxoplasma-host cell interaction, not directly related to their charge density (Table II), was observed with the different sulfated polysaccharides. Therefore, a unique specificity of binding, probably related to the conformation of the native ligand, dictates the biological effect and suggests that the location of the sulfated residues is as important as the charge density per se.It would be tempting to propose a model on the basis of some common structural motif. For fucoidan, a sulfated polymer of α-(1→3)-linked l-fucose, it has been estimated that most of the sulfated esters are located on the C-4 position (37Patankar M.S. Oehninger S. Barnett T. Williams R.L. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21770-21776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the case of heparin the carbohydrate backbone consists of hexuronic acid (d-glucuronic or l-iduronic) β-(1→4)-linked to d-glucosamine units, with variable location of the sulfated substituents, encompassing:N-sulfation of free amino groups at C-2 of glucosamine,O-sulfation at C-2 of iduronic acid residues, andO-sulfation at C-6 of glucosamine units (38Casu B. Adv. Carb. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Dextran sulfate is a α-(1→6)-linked d-glucose polymer that is highly O-sulfated. Therefore, the available information does not justify modeling on the basis of their constituent sugars and glycosidic linkage. It is possible that the role of the polysaccharide backbone may be to determine the specificity of binding by providing a correct spatial orientation of the N-acetylated,N-sulfated, and O-sulfated groups, mimicking the region on the host cell recognized by the Toxoplasma lectin. Alternatively, it is possible that those agents with the highest sulfate content may make it more likely that a sulfate group is in a favorable context for binding in a substantial fraction of the molecules.Competition experiments using FITC-heparin and unlabeled inhibitors (e.g. heparin, dextran sulfate, and fucoidan) argue for the existence of a nonspecific parasite receptor capable of interacting with a range of sulfated polysaccharides able to inhibit hemagglutination and alter parasite infection.The identity of the host cell molecule(s) recognized by this parasite receptor is not known. Among the prominent sulfated macromolecules found in higher cells are the proteoglycans, a class of glycoproteins that contain a core protein with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chains. Glycosaminoglycans consists of linear polymers composed of disaccharide repeating units of uronic acid and hexosamine. There are four general classes of glycosaminoglycans: 1) hyaluronic acid, 2) chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, 3) keratan sulfate, and 4) heparan sulfate/heparin (39Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). As the chains polymerize, they undergo various sulfation and epimerization reactions that, together with variations in the length of the polymer, confer proteoglycans with a tremendous structural heterogeneity. Recent studies support the role of cell surface proteoglycans as adhesion receptors for many pathogenic microorganisms (reviewed in Ref. 41Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including viruses, protozoan parasites, and bacterial pathogens (19Ortega-Barria E. Pereira M.E.A.

These interactions fall into two classes: (a) Trypanosoma cruzi(19Ortega-Barria E. Pereira M.E.A.

Virol. 1989; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bind directly to mammalian cell surface proteoglycans; and (b)Chlamydia trachomatis (25Zhang J.P. Stephens R.S. Cell. 1992; 69: 861-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) employs a different mechanism in which attachment to, and subsequent infectivity of, eukaryotic cells is dependent on a heparan sulfate-like ligand on the surface of the organism that bridges acceptors on the microorganism and host cell surface membranes, facilitating cell-cell contact. It has been proposed that the heparan sulfate-like adhesin is synthesized byChlamydia (25Zhang J.P. Stephens R.S. Cell. 1992; 69: 861-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our finding that low doses of soluble, sulfated polysaccharides induce a significant increase in tachyzoite infectivity suggests that the Toxoplasma receptor belongs to the second class of molecules. This was further supported by the fact that increasing doses of soluble proteoglycans and sulfated polysaccharides not only abolished such an increase, but at the highest concentration produced a significant inhibition, as expected when receptors on both cell surfaces are saturated, inhibiting the ternary complexes.The availability of mutant cell lines with genetic defects in glycosaminoglycan assembly provides us with additional data to support the idea that sulfated polysaccharides participate in host cell infection. Our results with these cell lines indicate that heparan sulfate may be the host-derived ligand for the parasite lectin. However, heparin but not heparan sulfate was found to inhibit the lectin activity as assessed by inhibition of hemagglutination and modified infection of HFF cells. Because the structural analysis of the glycosaminoglycan chain of heparan sulfate has demonstrated the presence of heparin segments in its structure (45Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Buonassisi V. Colburn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3565-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that these heparin-like regions may mimic the natural carbohydrate ligand for the parasite lectin. This suggestion is further supported by the fact that preliminary results from experiments using glycosaminoglycan lyases indicated that treatment of HFF cells with heparinase (specific for heparin) but not heparitinase (specific for heparan sulfate) (45Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Buonassisi V. Colburn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3565-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or chondroitinase ABC resulted in about a 25% decrease in the ability of Toxoplasma to infect the host cell (data not shown). Taken together, the evidence presented supports the hypothesis that T. gondii utilizes cell surface sulfated sugars, including a heparin-like molecule, to interact with the host cell.To gain insight into the identity of the Toxoplasma lectin activity, we exploited its ability to bind a variety of eukaryotic cells. First, by overlaying nitrocellulose filters, containing separated Toxoplasma proteins, with a suspension of red blood cells, we identified putative adhesins of 45, 65, and 71 kDa. The fact that preincubation of the filter with fucoidan abolished the binding of the 65- and 71-kDa proteins provided evidence of their sugar-binding ability (data not shown). We next asked whether intrinsically radiolabeled Toxoplasma proteins were able to bind to fixed cells and found that molecules of 26 and 65 kDa bound in a sugar inhibitable manner to the surface of the erythrocytes, whereas a protein of 45 kDa resisted elution by all the inhibitors tested. The relative participation of these proteins in the process of infection is currently unknown, but their diversity and specificity indicates thatToxoplasma, like other microorganisms, may employ various molecules to interact with the host.Several groups have pursued the study of sugar-binding proteins onToxoplasma (9Mineo J.R.

Hambach C. Windeck T. Heesemann J. Parasitol. Res. 1993; 79: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specific binding of neoglycoproteins (i.e. BSA-GlcN) to live tachyzoites was observed by Robertet al. (46Robert R. De La Jarrige P.L. Mahaza C. Cottin J. Marot-Leblond A. Senet J.-M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4670-4673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lectins and neoglycoproteins (BSA-GlcNAc and BSA-d-galactose) labeled with colloidal gold particles were used by de Carvalho et al. (47de Carvalho L. Souto-Padr-n T. de Souza W. J. Parasitol. 1991; 77: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to probe thin sections of tachyzoites with the result that significant labeling of the rhoptries was seen. In neither case, however, were the authors able to identify or determine the function of the parasite molecule responsible for the sugar-binding activity. In another study, inhibition of infection of fibroblast by preincubation of tachyzoites with BSA-GlcN was observed (9Mineo J.R. McLeod R. Mack D. Smith J. Khan I.A. Ely K.H. Kasper L.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3951-3964PubMed Google Scholar). Because this effect was significantly higher in a strain ofT. gondii expressing SAG1 than in a SAG1-deficient mutant, Mineo et al. (9Mineo J.R. McLeod R. Mack D. Smith J. Khan I.A. Ely K.H. Kasper L.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3951-3964PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that SAG1 likely binds a glycosylated host cell receptor. More recently, a 15-kDa fetuin-binding protein was identified using affinity chromatography on fetuin-agarose (48Gross U. Hambach C. Windeck T. Heesemann J. Parasitol. Res. 1993; 79: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Differences in carbohydrate specificity, biological effect observed, and molecular mass distinguish these sugar-binding proteins from the sulfated polysaccharide-specific lectin(s) described in this paper. Determining the relative contribution of all these molecules to parasite infectivity is essential to a better understanding of the pathogenic process in toxoplasmosis. They also provide specificities and tentative identities (by size) for the lectins involved, making their further characterization now possible. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects about 13 of the adult population of the world (1McCabe R. Remington J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although toxoplasmosis is generally asymptomatic in healthy adults, the infection may cause severe sequelae in neonates and life-threatening lesions in AIDS patients (2Wilson C.B. Remington J.S. Stagno S. Reynolds D.W. Pediatrics. 1980; 66: 767-774PubMed Google Scholar, 3Koppe J.G. Loewer-Sieger D.H. De Roever-Bonnet H. Lancet. 1986; 1: 254-256Abstract PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Levy R.M. Bredesen D.E. Rosenblum M.L. J. Neurosurg. 1985; 621: 475-495Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Furthermore, toxoplasmosis is also of considerable importance in domestic animals, given its association with abortion in sheep and swine and as a major source of infection for humans (5Remington J.S. Desmonts G. Remington J.S. Klein J.O. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 89-195Google Scholar). The T. gondii life cycle includes three major, distinct stages: sporozoites, which are the product of the sexual cycle, and the asexually dividing tachyzoites and bradyzoites. The sporozoite and the bradyzoite reside within distinct cyst structures that are relatively long-lived and infectious if ingested. On the other hand, the rapidly growing tachyzoite is responsible for spreading the infection from cell to cell and probably for most of the disease symptoms. Tachyzoites multiply inside a parasitophorous vacuole that does not fuse with host cell lysosomes. Rapid multiplication of the intracellular parasite is followed by rupture of the host cell and infection of contiguous cells. At some point during infection, there is a shift from multiplication of tachyzoites to the formation of tissue cysts filled with bradyzoites (5Remington J.S. Desmonts G. Remington J.S. Klein J.O. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 89-195Google Scholar). T. gondii tachyzoites have the ability to interact with and invade a diverse array of cells, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and cells of the central nervous system. Ultrastructural studies indicate that invasion is a very rapid (15–40 s) and complex event in which specialized organelles located in the anterior pole of the tachyzoite seem to be involved (6Werk R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Sibley L.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 129-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Schwartzman J.D. Saffer L.D. Avila J.L. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 18. Plenum Press, New York1992: 333-364Google Scholar). The process of entry is initiated by the parasite contacting the host cell with its anterior region; this is followed by protrusion of the conoid, modification of the host cell membrane, and secretion of the microneme and rhoptry contents. As the parasite enters, host cell pseudopods extend along the parasite, so that the tachyzoite becomes enclosed in an intracellular vacuole separated from the host cytosol by a unit membrane (6Werk R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Sibley L.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 129-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Schwartzman J.D. Saffer L.D. Avila J.L. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 18. Plenum Press, New York1992: 333-364Google Scholar). Attachment is a prerequisite for microbial colonization and invasion of host cells and is usually mediated by microbial surface proteins called adhesins that bind to protein or carbohydrate epitopes present on the host cell surfaces. Several lines of evidence indicate thatToxoplasma tachyzoites interact with host cells by specific receptor-ligand types of interactions (9Mineo J.R. McLeod R. Mack D. Smith J. Khan I.A. Ely K.H. Kasper L.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3951-3964PubMed Google Scholar, 10Furtado G.C. Slowik M. Kleinman H.K. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2337-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Furtado G.C. Cao Y. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4925-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, invasion of host cells by tachyzoites can be inhibited by treating the parasite with rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against theToxoplasma major surface protein, SAG1 (9Mineo J.R.

While previous results indicate that loss of function for fz has tissue polarity defects, loss-of-function effects of Dfz2 are not known. Here, we have examined the requirements of fz and Dfz2 during neurogenesis. Our results indicate that both Fz and DFz2 function in Wg signaling, and loss of either of the two affects the same subset of neuroblasts as those affected by loss of wg. While these defects are partially penetrant in embryos lacking either fz or Dfz2, the penetrance is significantly enhanced in embryos lacking both. Since the penetrance of the CNS phenotypes is not complete in double mutants, additional components that allow some degree of Wg signaling must exist in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2000347396,"The RET gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase whose function is essential during the development of kidney and the intestinal nervous system. Germline mutations affecting one of five cysteines (Cys609, 611, 618, 620 and 634) located in the juxtamembrane domain of the RET receptor are responsible for the vast majority of two cancer-prone disorders, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). These mutations lead to the replacement of a cysteine by an alternate amino acid. Mutations of the RET gene are also the underlying genetic cause of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a congenital aganglionosis of the hindgut. In a fraction of kindreds, MEN 2A cosegregate with HSCR and affected individuals carry a single mutation at codons 609, 618 or 620. To examine the consequences of cysteine substitution on RET function, we have introduced a Cys to Arg mutation into the wild-type RET at either codons 609, 618, 620, 630 or 634. We now report that each mutation induces a constitutive catalytic activity due to the aberrant disulfide homodimerization of RET. However, mutations 630 and 634 activate RET more strongly than mutations 609, 618 or 620 as demonstrated by quantitative assays in rodent fibroblasts and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that mutations 618 and 620, and to a lesser extent mutation 609, result in a marked reduction of the level of RET at the cell surface and as a consequence decrease the amount of RET covalent dimer. These findings provide a molecular basis explaining the range of phenotype engendered by alterations of RET cysteines and suggest a novel mechanism whereby mutations of cysteines 609, 618 and 620 exert both activating and inactivating effects."

Assay of selected major isomers such as 8-epi-PGF2α or isoprostane F2α-I in human urine has proven an accurate noninvasive means of evaluating their formation in vivo (3Delanty N. Reilly M.

In view of further refining the quantitative assessment of the endogenous formation of F2-isoprostanes, it would be important to investigate their degradation in vivo. The identification of the major metabolites of selected F2-isoprostanes would be useful for two main reasons. First, quantitation of major metabolites in addition to the parent compound may allow a more accurate evaluation of the overall production of the biomarker in vivo while adding significance to individual measurements. Second, identification of F2-isoprostane metabolites may help finding circulating compounds that can be measured without the risk of artifactual production ex vivo (2Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Patrono C. FitzGerald G.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Theoretically, metabolism of F2-isoprostanes may proceed as for F2-prostaglandins (6Granström E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5254-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Granström E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7470-7485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Green K. Biochim. Biophys.

The structural differences between the four regioisomers and the stereochemical differences within each regioisomer class (1Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar) will likely cause major differences in the way each product is degraded, further complicating the picture. Therefore, metabolism of F2-isoprostanes cannot be studied with a single parent compound as a model nor can a single type of metabolite be chosen to monitor degradation of F2-isoprostanes as a group. Moreover, administration of relevant amounts of a single isomer to study its catabolism may somewhat alter its metabolic pathway, possibly favoring reactions that are normally inhibited by the presence of other competing endogenous substrates. Therefore, a reasonable approach to characterize F2-isoprostane catabolism would be to identify the major endogenous metabolites of the principal isomers produced in vivo. To date, two distinct F2-isoprostane isomers, 8-epi-PGF2α and isoprostane F2α-I (5Praticò D. Barry O.P. Lawson J.A. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W. Khanapure S.P. Iuliano L. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc.

The same group identified other F2-isoprostane metabolites as a group of C16 dioic compounds of unknown stereochemistry, with two hydroxyl groups, one keto group, and one double bond (11Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Takahashi K. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4161-4169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the identification of two endogenous urinary metabolites of 8-epi-PGF2α by a strategy taking advantage of immobilized antibodies to capture endogenous cross-reactants for subsequent identification/measurement by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (12Chiabrando C.

PGF2α and 3,3′,4,4′-[2H4]-PGF2α were from Upjohn Co. (Kalamazoo, MI).ent-12-epi-PGF2α (15Sand 15R), 12-epi-PGF2α(15S and 15R), and 15R-8-epi-PGF2α, were synthesized in our laboratory as described previously (14Roland A. Durand T. Rondot B. Vidal J.P. Rossi J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1996; 133: 1149-1154Google Scholar, 15Guy A. Durand T. Vidal J.P. Rossi J.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 1543-1546Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). IAC extractions were performed as described previously, using immunosorbents prepared with antibodies raised against 8-epi-PGF2α (16Bachi A. Zuccato E. Baraldi M. Fanelli R. Chiabrando C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, urine was diluted (1:2–1:5) with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) spiked with 2H4-labeled internal standard, if required, and percolated slowly through a IAC column prepared with the immunosorbent (IgG fraction of the antiserum coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B). After washing with distilled water, the column was eluted with acetone:water (95:5, v/v), and the eluate was dried under an air stream. Samples were converted to various derivatives before GC-MS analysis. Pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) ester and trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers were prepared as described (14Roland A. Durand T. Rondot B. Vidal J.P. Rossi J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1996; 133: 1149-1154Google Scholar),tert-butyldimethylsilyl (tBDMS) ethers by treating dried samples with 10 μl ofN-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA, Pierce, Rockford, IL) plus dry pyridine (10 μl) and acetonitrile (30 μl) for 1 h at 60 °C, cyclic butyl boronate derivatives (BB) by adding 1-butane boronic acid (60 μl of a 0.3 mg/ml solution in acetonitrile) for 10 min at 40 °C, and methyl esters (ME) by addition of ethereal diazomethane (150 μl) at room temperature. GC-negative ion chemical ionization (NICI)-MS was performed as described (16Bachi A. Zuccato E. Baraldi M. Fanelli R. Chiabrando C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using a Finnigan 4000 mass spectrometer. Briefly, GC operating conditions were: NB-54 (5% phenyl, 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) or CP-Sil 19 CB (14% cyanopropylphenyl, 86% dimethylpolysiloxane) fused silica capillary columns (length, 25 m; inner diameter, 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.12 μm); solvent-split injection (50 to 300 °C); oven temperature, isothermal at 120 °C for 1 min, and then programmed to 300 °C at 25°/min; helium was used as a carrier gas. NICI operating conditions were: selected ion recording (SIR) of carboxylate anions (M-181, loss of⋅CH2C6F5); full scan mode: 100–850 m/z; methane as reagent gas; electron energy, 100 eV. GC-electron impact (EI)-MS was performed using a VARIAN SATURN 2000 Ion Trap mass spectrometer. GC operating conditions were: HP-5 MS (5% phenyl, 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) fused-silica capillary column (length, 30 m; inner diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm); splitless injection (240 °C); oven temperature, isothermal at 160 °C for 1 min, and then programmed to 310 °C at 20°/min; helium as carrier gas. MS conditions were: ion trap temperature, 200 °C; mass range, 50–650 m/z; electron energy, 70 eV. To control IAC extraction efficiency for metabolite quantitation without stable isotope-labeled analogues, we devised the following procedure: (a) test urine samples containing different pre-determined amounts of endogenous 8-epi-PGF2α were percolated in succession through three IAC columns withoutinternal standard; (b) each column was then eluted separately in tubes containing a fixed amount of the internal standard2H4-8-epi-PGF2α; (c) GC-NICI-MS quantitation of the metabolites recovered in the three IAC eluates from the same urine sample showed that all compounds had been extracted almost completely in the first two rounds (96–100% for 8-epi-PGF2α and 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α, 87–92% for 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α). Two-round extractions were therefore performed for unknown samples, the total amount of each metabolite being calculated by summing the two partial results obtained. Quantitation was done by using standard plots of 8-epi-PGF2α/2H4-8-epi-PGF2αpeak area ratio (y) versus the amount of 8-epi-PGF2α (x) (r= 0.9999), assuming that equimolar amounts of the C20 and C18 analogues give similar carboxylate anion peak area response, because this ion carries most of the total ion current. The total synthesis of the enantiomer of (15S)-2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2αwas carried out as we have described recently (17Guy A. Durand T. Roland A. Cormenier E. Rossi J.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 6181-6184Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using diacetone-d-glucose as starting material. After methylation of the carboxyl acid with diazomethane, the 15R-epimer (ent-2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α) could be separated from the 15S-epimer by flash chromatography over silical gel. Relative stereochemical assignments were made by NOE 1H NMR study. A mixture of normal saturated C18-C24 fatty acids were derivatized to PFB esters and analyzed by GC-NICI-MS in the SIR mode, monitoring their carboxylate anions (M-PFB). Plots of retention times (y) with two different GC columns against carbon number (x) (r = 0.999) were used to calculate equivalent C values from the retention times of different PFB derivatives (TMS, BB-TMS, or tBDMS) of each metabolite (Table I). The same procedure was used to calculate C values of ME-TMS metabolites with C18-C24 fatty acid methyl esters (see 'Results“).Table INICI mass spectral data and equivalent C values of different PFB derivatives of 8-epi-PGF2α, PGF2α, and their metabolitesCompoundStructureTMStBDMSBB-TMSm/zC valueaNB-54 column.C valuebCP SIL19 column.m/zC valueaNB-54 column.C valuebCP SIL19 column.m/zC valueaNB-54 column.C valuebCP SIL19 column.8-epi-PGF2αC20:256922.9022.8369528.4427.7349125.5626.20IC18:254121.1221.0966726.4426.2046323.8524.57IIC18:154321.3421.2066926.5826.2446524.1424.78IIIcThis compound was not observed in urine but only in rat hepatocytes.C16:151519.48NDdND, not done.641NDND437NDNDPGF2αC20:256923.2723.1569529.2428.2649124.9425.43IaC18:254121.5221.4466727.0626.7446323.1623.68IIaC18:154321.8121.6966927.3826.9546523.4923.97IIIaC16:151519.8119.6464125.4525.2043721.6322.12a NB-54 column.b CP SIL19 column.c This compound was not observed in urine but only in rat hepatocytes.d ND, not done. Open table in a new tab 6-h urine was collected from healthy volunteers (8 males, 2 females; age, 24–57 years; 5 smokers and 5 nonsmokers). Four nonsmokers were given two oral doses of naproxen sodium (550 mg at 12-h interval), and urine was collected before treatment and after the second dose. Samples were stored at −20 °C. 24-h urine was collected from male Crl:CD (SD)BR rats (300–350 g) kept in metabolic cages. 8-epi-PGF2α (10 μg dissolved in 0.5 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline) was injected intravenously into a rat whose urine was collected for 24 h before and after treatment. Samples were kept at −20 °C until analyzed. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national 2Decreto Legislativo Number 116, G.U., suppl. 40, 18 Febbraio 1992, Circolare No. 8, Gazzetta Ufficiale, 14 Luglio 1994. and international laws and policies. 3European Economic Community Council Directives 86/609, Official Journal L 358, 1, Dec. 12, 1987; Guide for the Care and Use for Laboratory Animals, U.S. National Research Council, 1996. Hepatocytes were isolated from fed male Crl:CD (SD)BR rats (230–260 g) by perfusing the liver with a collagenase solution (collagenase type IV, Sigma) by the method of Seglen (18Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5189) Google Scholar). After removing the liver capsule, the cell suspension was passed through gauze. The hepatocytes were washed three times (50 g × 1 min) and suspended in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 18 mm Hepes, 1 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The viability, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was higher than 85%. After 3 h of adhesion the medium was changed with an equal medium without fetal calf serum and gentamicin, and the cells were incubated for 20 min with and without 8-epi-PGF2α or PGF2α. The cell-free incubation medium was collected and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Metabolites were extracted both by IAC and by C18 solid phase extraction (SPE). The latter was performed by loading the sample at pH 3.5, washing with water and petroleum ether, and then eluting with methyl formate. Aliquots of IAC and C18 SPE extracts were dried and derivatized to ME-TMS or PFB-TMS and analyzed by GC-EI-MS or GC-NICI-MS, respectively. Because polyclonal antibodies raised against prostanoids coupled to the carrier protein via the carboxyl group often cross-react with the corresponding β-oxidation products (12Chiabrando C.

Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) for their ability to extract any of its possible α-chain-shortened (C18 and C16) metabolites. Aliquots (10 ml) of a human urine pool were extracted using three different immunosorbents prepared with A, B, and C antibodies. Extracts were derivatized as PFB-TMS and first analyzed by GC-NICI-MS in the SIR mode, monitoring the carboxylate anions of 8-epi-PGF2α (m/z 569) and those of its putative C18 and C16 homologues (m/z 541 for C18:2, m/z 543 for C18:1, and m/z 515 for C16:1). The three immunosorbents showed different selectivity toward the C18 and C16 metabolites, with A extracting only 8-epi-PGF2α and no metabolites and B extracting 8-epi-PGF2α and a single C18:2 metabolite (I), whereas C extracted 8-epi-PGF2α plus PGF2α and doublets of their chain-shortened homologues C18:2 (I and Ia) and C18:1 (II and IIa) as well as a single C16 metabolite (IIIa) (Fig.1). The GC behavior of these compounds preliminarily suggested that I and II were metabolites of 8-epi-PGF2α, whereas Ia, IIa, and IIIa were derived from PGF2α (TableI). Structural identification of immunoextracted urinary metabolites was achieved by different complementary approaches, all suggesting that they were the following: 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α (I) and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α (II), plus their PGF2α-derived counterparts 2,3-dinor-PGF2α (Ia) and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-PGF2α (IIa), and 2,3,4,5-tetranor-PGF2α (IIIa). Different portions of an IAC extract of human urine (40 ml on immunosorbent C) were derivatized to PFB-TMS, PFB-tBDMS, or PFB-BB-TMS and analyzed by GC-NICI-MS in the SIR mode. Carboxylate anion m/z values to be monitored were calculated for the different derivatives and for each of the following putative structures: trihydroxy-dinor-prostadienoic acid (C18:2), trihydroxy-dinor-prostaenoic acid (C18:1), and trihydroxy-tetranor-prostaenoic acid (C16:1). For each derivative, peaks were registered at the expected m/z value with C values changing coordinately with the authentic parent compounds on the different columns (Table I), thus confirming the proposed structures. Additional structural information was obtained by the formation of butylboronate cyclic derivatives (PFB-BB-TMS), implying that the two 9,11-hydroxyls are in the cis position for all compounds (11Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Takahashi K. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4161-4169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data regarding the C16 metabolite of 8-epi-PGF2α identified in rat hepatocyte preparation (see below) are also shown in Table I. The Cvalues of the C18 and C16 metabolites were about 1.5 and 3 units smaller than those of the respective parent compound for the different derivatives, as reported for two- and four-carbon α-chain shortening of F series prostaglandins (8Green K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 231: 419-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Osborne D.J. Boot J.R. Cockerill A.F. Cranstone K.G. Dawson W. Harvey J. Mallen D.N.B. Smith C.W. Prostaglandins. 1979; 17: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Δ5 double bond saturation resulted in the expected small increase in Cvalue for all PFB derivatives. Full scan NICI mass spectra were obtained from a 35-ml human urine sample extracted on immunosorbent C and derivatized as PFB-TMS. The mass spectra of all metabolites revealed a carboxylate anion isotopic cluster (M-181, loss of pentafluorobenzyl group) as the only prominent peak, with the expectedm/z values (Table I) and relative isotopic abundance (data not shown). To obtain additional evidence of the identity of urinary 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α, full scan EI-MS analysis was performed on a IAC extract (immunosorbent C) from a 160-ml human urine sample derivatized as ME-TMS. At the retention time of authenticent-2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α(C value 21.69; cf. C value for 8-epi-PGF2α: 23.18), we recorded a mixed mass spectrum clearly showing doublets of major fragment ions atm/z 305–307, 376–378, 395–397, and 466–468, corresponding to the major fragment ions retaining the α-chain of 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α (as seen in the hepatocyte preparation, Fig.2 A and TableII) and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α (as seen with the authentic enantiomer, Fig. 2 D and Table II). The difference of 2 Da in the fragment ion doublets is due to the presence or absence of the Δ5 double bond. The two compounds coeluted when analyzed as ME-TMS in these conditions. We then prepared a similar sample but before derivatization reextracted it on immunosorbent B, thus eliminating 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α. We thus obtained a mass spectrum (Fig. 2 C) of weak intensity but with all prominent ions corresponding to those of 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α (Fig. 2 A and Table II).Table IIEI-MS fragmentation pattern of ME-TMS derivatives of 8-epi-PGF2α and its metabolitesIon assignmentLoss ofm/z8-epi-PGF2αMetabolite IMetabolite IIMetabolite IIIM+584556558530[M − 15]+⋅CH3569541543515[M − 31]+⋅OCH3499[M − 71]+⋅CH2−(CH2)3−CH3513485487[M − 90]+TMSOH494466468440[M − 15 − 90)]+⋅CH3 + TMSOH479451453425[M − 31 − 90)]+⋅OCH3 + TMSOH437409[M − 71 − 90]+⋅CH2−(CH2)3−CH3+ TMSOH423395397369[M − 90 × 2]+TMSOH × 2404376378350[M − 90 −a]+TMSOH + a353353353[M − 71 − 90 × 2]+⋅CH2−(CH2)3−CH3+ TMSOH × 2333abase peak.305abase peak.307abase peak.279abase peak.[M − 71 − 90 − 116]+TMSOH +⋅CH2−(CH2)3−CH3 +b307279281253[TMSO−CH=CH−CH=OTMS]+217217217217c +199199199199[TMSO=CH−OTMS]+191191191191d +173173173173a, α-chain:C1–C7 for 8-epi-PGF2α, C1–C5 for I and II, and C1–C3 for III; b, C9–C10 or C10–C11 for 8-epi-PGF2α, C7–C8 or C8–C9 for I and II, and C5–C6 or C6–C7 for III; c, ω-chain: C13–C20 for 8-epi-PGF2α, C11–C18 for I and II, and C9–C16 for III; d, C15–C20 for 8-epi-PGF2α, C13–C18 for I and II, and C11–C16 for III.a base peak.

Aliquots of pooled rat urine (10 ml) were also extracted on immunosorbent C and processed as described above for NICI-MS analysis. The same compounds were identified as for human urine, with the exception of the C18:2 derivative of PGF2α (2,3-dinor-PGF2α), which was not detectable (data not shown). In a rat treated with 10 μg of intravenous 8-epi-PGF2α, 24-h excretion of 8-epi-PGF2α, 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α, and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α increased by 5.6-, 9.1-, and 9.2-fold over the respective pre-treatment levels (1.16, 1.20, and 1.55 ng/24 h), suggesting that the latter compounds were metabolites of the former. To confirm the identity of the urinary metabolites we verified that their gas chromatographic and mass spectral characteristics were identical to those of β-oxidation products of authentic 8-epi-PGF2α or PGF2α incubated with rat hepatocytes, which were in turn identified by EI-GC-MS as follows. Products of 8-epi-PGF2α or PGF2α metabolism by isolated rat hepatocytes were extracted in parallel by IAC (immunosorbent C) and C18 SPE. Both extracts were then analyzed by full scan EI-GC-MS. Putative 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α (Metabolite I) was present in both extracts. Its structure was proven by the mass spectrum of its ME-TMS derivative (Fig. 2 A) showing the ions expected in agreement with the fragmentation pattern described in Table II. Another abundant β-oxidation metabolite was identified in this preparation as 2,3,4,5-tetranor-8-epi-PGF2α on the basis of the EI mass spectrum and GC behavior (C value: 20.12). Its mass spectrum (Fig. 2 B) was almost identical to that reported by Green (8Green K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 231: 419-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) for the corresponding metabolite of PGF2α. 2,3,4,5-Tetranor-8-epi-PGF2α could be observed in the C18 SPE but not in the IAC extract. This result indicates that immunosorbent C does not extract this metabolite, and therefore we cannot presently exclude nor prove its presence in urine. 2,3-Dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-epi-PGF2α was a minor product in the hepatocyte preparation, as judged by NICI-MS analysis of PFB-TMS derivatives of C18 and IAC extracts. In the hepatocyte preparation incubated with PGF2α, we confirmed the identity of 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-PGF2α and 2,3,4,5-tetranor-PGF2α but could not find 2,3-dinor-PGF2α, either in SPE or in IAC extracts examined by both EI- and NICI-MS, similar to what had been observed in rat urine. The same products of PGF2α metabolism were identified by Sago et al. (21Sago T. Nakayama R. Okumura T. Saito K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 879: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in rat hepatocytes. The EI mass spectra of PGF2α metabolites (not shown) were very similar to those published previously (8Green K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 231: 419-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and to those we have shown here for the corresponding metabolites of 8-epi-PGF2α. This similarity was expected, because it had been observed for the parent epimeric compounds, 8-epi-PGF2α and PGF2α (not shown). The immunoaffinity behavior and GC-MS characteristics of urinary Metabolite I versushepatocyte-derived 2,3-dinor-8-epi-PGF2α, taken as a reference, were compared directly as follows. Hepatocyte medium and human urine were immunoextracted in parallel on two distinct antibodies (immunosorbents B and C) and derivatized to PFB-TMS, PFB-tBDMS, and PFB-BB-TMS. Samples were then analyzed by GC-NICI-MS in the SIR mode in the conditions described above, but with a lower GC temperature programming rate (10 °C/min), resulting in retention times of 14.45, 18.02, and 16.32 min for the PFB-TMS (m/z 541), PFB-tBDMS (m/z667)"

The high pH species of H2O2, HO2−, was previously implicated as the reactive species. However, recent EPR studies of the enzyme performed in the physiological pH range 7.4–7.6 with the spin trap 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrolline-N-oxide attributed the intense EPR signal of 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrolline-N-oxide-OH obtained from SOD1 and H2O2 to the peroxidase activity of the enzyme. The present study establishes that this intense signal is obtained only in the presence of bicarbonate. To explore the critical role of HCO3−, a comprehensive EPR investigation of the radical production and redox state of the active site copper was performed. The results indicate that HCO3−competes with other anions for the anion-binding site of SOD1 (Arg141) but does not bind directly to the copper. Structurally different anions that bind to Arg141 did not stimulate, but rather blocked, peroxidase function, ruling out an effect due to mere anion binding. However, the structurally similar anions HSeO3−and HSO3−mimic HCO3−in stimulating peroxidase function. These data suggest that HCO3− bound to Arg141 anchors the neutral H2O2molecule at the active site copper, enabling its redox cleavage. Thus, SOD1 acquires peroxidase activity at physiological pH only in the presence of HCO3− or structurally similar anions. Alterations in pH that shift the HCO3−/CO2equilibrium as occur in disease processes such as ischemia, sepsis, or shock would modulate the peroxidase function of SOD1.

Alternately, exogenous reductants such as xanthine, urate, formate, and azide can protect the enzyme when they serve as sacrificial substances and spare the essential histidines (5Hodgson E.K.

HO2−, rather than H2O2, was implicated as the active species, due to its resemblance to O·̄2 in structure and charge (6Blech D.M. Borders Jr., C.L. Arch. Biochem.

Although H2O2 was able to reduce the active site Cu2+ to Cu+ at high concentrations, the reaction of H2O2 to form the bound ⋅OH was favored only when the pH was raised above 8, since the pK a for H2O2 is 11.9 (12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H.J. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recently, EPR spin trapping studies demonstrated that CuZn-SOD and H2O2 at normal physiological pH values in the presence of the spin trap, DMPO, yield large amounts of the hydroxyl adduct, DMPO-OH, which was attributed to free ⋅OH (10Yim M.B.

In general, it is difficult to explain these results based on the alkaline-based HO2−-mediated reaction mechanism. While H2O2 with its pK a of 11.9 gives rise to trace amounts of HO2− at pH 7.4 and this might react with Cu+ at the active site, the rate constant of this reaction is quite low at neutral pH (k obs ∼ 0.1 m−1 s−1) (12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H.J. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, one would expect little if any detectable DMPO-OH generation at pH 7.4. Hence, the high magnitude EPR signals obtained (10Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 11Yim M.B.

While most of the in vitro spin trapping studies in the physiological pH range are carried out in a variety of buffers, all of the above spin trapping studies with CuZn-SOD (10Yim M.B. Chock P.B.

However, there has been no prior explanation for the importance of HCO3− in this system. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluate the role of HCO3− in the peroxidase function of CuZn-SOD. We observe that large magnitude DMPO-OH generation occurs only in bicarbonate buffer with no significant signal obtained in other buffers. The critical role of HCO3− in producing these signals is characterized. Structural changes of the active site copper in the presence of HCO3− are studied by EPR measurements of the Cu(II). These studies suggest that at physiological pH, HCO3− binds to the anion-binding site of CuZn-SOD and facilitates the approach of H2O2 to the active site, enabling its redox cleavage. Bovine erythrocyte CuZn-SOD was purchased from Sigma (98% enzyme, 4000–5800 units/mg) or Worthington (100% enzyme, 2273 units/mg). Activity was assayed by the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich (21Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). Human CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, sodium formate, sodium azide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium bisulfite, sodium hydrogen selenite, hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w), Hepes, Tris, sodium hydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, CAPS, potassium thiocyanate, potassium sulfate, sodium nitrate, borate, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyl-1-oxy (TEMPO), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), Me2SO, and ethanol were obtained from Sigma. Deferoxamine mesylate was obtained from Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Fe3+-(nitrilotriacetate)2 (Fe-NTA) was prepared as described previously (22Aisen P. Liebman A. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 253: 1930-1937Google Scholar). 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Purified DMPO was purchased from Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Spin Trap Source. Phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 100 μm DTPA and purged with dry nitrogen gas, was used to prepare stock solutions of DMPO. EPR spectra were recorded in quartz flat cells at room temperature with a Bruker ER 300 or ESP 300E spectrometer operating at X-band with 100-kHz modulation frequency and a TM 110 cavity. The microwave frequency and magnetic field were precisely measured using an EIP 575 microwave frequency counter and a Bruker ER035M NMR gaussmeter. EPR spectral simulations were performed using computer programs as described previously (23Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Appl. Rad. Isotop. 1992; 44: 367-372Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the free radical signals was performed by computer simulation of the spectra and by comparison of the double integral of the observed signal with that of a TEMPO standard (10 mm) measured under identical conditions (24Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR spectra of the active site Cu2+ of CuZn-SOD were recorded in 3-mm quartz tubes at 77 K using a liquid nitrogen dewar. A Perkin-Elmer Lambda-6 UV-VIS spectrophotometer was used for optical studies. Either human or bovine CuZn-SOD (1.25 μm), dissolved in 23.5 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% N2, gave rise to a large EPR signal when treated with H2O2 (1 mm) in the presence of DMPO (50 mm) (Fig.1 A). The quartet signal with typical intensity ratio, 1:2:2:1, and hyperfine couplings,a H = a N = 14.9 G, confirmed by computer simulation, corresponds to DMPO-OH (24Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The intense signal was only obtained in bicarbonate buffer and was largely insensitive to changes in pH in the range 7.0–8.0. With similar conditions of enzyme and H2O2 concentrations but in other buffers including Hepes, PBS, and Tris (Fig.1 B), no signal was observed. Previously, the reaction between H2O2 and the reduced copper of the active site was shown to increase at high pH, due to the ionization of H2O2 to HO2−(pK a = 11.9) (6Blech D.M. Borders Jr., C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H.J. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such an enhanced interaction was suggested to promote the formation of the copper-bound ⋅OH and rapid inactivation of the enzyme (6Blech D.M. Borders Jr., C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H.J. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anticipating a parallel increase in the DMPO-OH formation, experiments were carried out at pH 10.5. While no signal was observed in CAPS buffer (Fig. 1 C), a small DMPO-OH signal was obtained in Na2CO3buffer (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the presence of HCO3− rather than a high pH is critical for the DMPO-OH formation. To exclude the possibility of trapping some bicarbonate-derived radicals obtained from a reaction between⋅OH and HCO3−, a Fenton⋅OH generating system of Fe-NTA (10 μm) and H2O2 (1 mm) was carried out in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with DMPO (50 mm) in the presence or absence of HCO3− (20 mm). Except for the first 5 min, the DMPO-OH signal declined in the presence of HCO3−compared with that observed in the absence of HCO3− (Fig.2). In similar experiments with the Fenton ⋅OH generating system at pH 10.5, similar DMPO-OH spectra were observed, demonstrating that the decrease in signal from SOD at pH 10.5 shown in Fig. 1 D was not simply due to a loss of efficacy of the trap.Figure 2DMPO-OH formation from a Fenton hydroxyl radical generating system in bicarbonate buffer. EPR spectra were recorded with parameters as described in the legend to Fig. 1 from Fe-NTA (10 μm) and H2O2 (1 mm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA and no NaHCO3(A) or 23.5 mm NaHCO3(B). Concentration of DMPO-OH was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The vital role played by HCO3− in the peroxidative function of CuZn-SOD toward DMPO in producing DMPO-OH was further investigated in the context of the enzyme's affinity for anions (2Bannister J.V.

Production of DMPO-OH by CuZn-SOD and H2O2 was examined in the presence of a variety of anions, such as azide, nitrate, sulfate, borate, thiocyanate and formate. These anions were reported to have affinity for the anion site of the enzyme. EPR spectra were measured every 5 min for more than 1 h following the addition of H2O2 (1 mm) to CuZn-SOD (1.25 μm), DMPO (50 mm), and the anion (20 mm) at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, these anions did not cause significant DMPO-OH generation in comparison with HCO3−. However, these anions when taken together with HCO3−, diminished the signal normally observed with HCO3−. As an example, the effect of NaH2PO4 and NaCl are shown in Fig.4, A and B. The decrease in the signal ranged from 20 to 90%, depending on the type of anion and its concentration.Figure 4Bicarbonate-mediated DMPO-OH generation in the presence of competing anions.

Thiocyanate (K d ∼ 200 mm) and azide (K d ∼ 10–16 mm) are typical examples that coordinate the Cu2+ and induce distinct changes in the copper hyperfine splitting parameters (27Fee J.A. Gaber B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Djinovic-Carugo K. Polticelli F. Desideri A. Rotilio G. Wilson K.S. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

We compared the effects of thiocyanate (200 mm), azide (20 mm), and bicarbonate (200 mm) at pH 7.0 on the Cu2+-EPR at 77K of CuZn-SOD (0.5 mm) (Fig.5). The anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants (A ∥) of SCN-SOD (148 G; Fig.5 B) and N3-SOD (156 G; Fig. 5 C) were considerably larger than that of the native enzyme (135 G, Fig.5 A), in agreement with the previous reports (27Fee J.A. Gaber B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Djinovic-Carugo K. Polticelli F. Desideri A. Rotilio G. Wilson K.S. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

In contrast, the A ∥ value for CuZn-SOD with HCO3− (Fig. 5 D) remained the same as the native enzyme, indicating that HCO3− does not bind directly to the copper. To further understand the unique mechanism in which HCO3− facilitates the access of the active site by the neutral H2O2, several anions were studied based on their structural similarity to HCO3−. Indeed, bisulfite (HSO3−) and biselenite (HSeO3−), which are isostructural to HCO3−, effected the generation of DMPO-OH in a similar fashion as HCO3−. While the sample containing 1.25 μm CuZn-SOD, and 1 mm H2O2, in the presence of DMPO did not give rise to any signal in the absence of these anions or HCO3− (Fig.6 A), it generated intense EPR signals when supplemented with 20 mmHCO3− (Fig. 6 B), HSO3− (Fig. 6 C), or HSeO3− (Fig. 6 D). The signal obtained with HSO3− (Fig.6 C) actually corresponds to the⋅SO3− radical adduct of DMPO, DMPO-⋅SO3−, as confirmed by the characteristic hyperfine splittings, a H = 16.0 G and a N = 14.7 G (38Mottley C. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Sivarajah K. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5050-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies reported that ⋅SO3− radicals might also be generated by the autooxidation of the bisulfite anion, which could be prevented by 1 mm DTPA (38Mottley C. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Sivarajah K. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5050-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, H2O2 has been reported to react directly with bisulfite to produce ⋅SO3− (38Mottley C. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Sivarajah K. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5050-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we included 1 mm DTPA in our experiments to prevent spontaneous ⋅SO3− generation, and control measurements in the absence of CuZn-SOD were performed to subtract the contribution from the direct reaction of bisulfite with H2O2 for the signal of DMPO-⋅SO3− in Fig.6 C. Two distinct experiments were performed to assess the effect of concentrations of H2O2 and HCO3− on the DMPO-OH signal generation. In the first one, DMPO-OH production was evaluated from a mixture of 1.25 μm CuZn-SOD, 50 mm DMPO, and 20 mm HCO3− with varying concentrations of H2O2 (0–50 mm). In the second one, [H2O2] was kept fixed at 1 mm, while [HCO3−] was varied from 0 to 10 mm. In both experiments, the EPR signal was accumulated for 10 min, immediately after the addition of H2O2. As shown in Fig.7 A, the signal increased linearly when [H2O2] was increased from 0 to 2 mm and reached a plateau at about 10 mm. However, at [H2O2] higher than 30 mm, there was a slow decline in the signal generation. Similarly, with respect to HCO3−, the signal increased linearly from 0 to 2 mm and reached a plateau at about 6 mm (Fig. 7 B). In order to confirm that the peroxidase function of CuZn-SOD and its dependence on bicarbonate is a generalized phenomenon observed with substrates other than DMPO, experiments were performed with ABTS, a chromogenic substrate very widely used for measuring peroxidase activity (39Childs R.E."

To understand the functional interaction between these two proteins, the effects of a PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide (3AB), on the p53 pathway were investigated in human glioblastoma cells with different p53 status. Consistent with previous studies, irradiation with gamma-rays induced both p53 and WAF1 accumulation in A-172 cells (wtp53) but not in T98G cells (mp53). However, the presence of 3AB but not its analog suppressed radiation-induced accumulation of wtp53 and the expression of WAF1 and MDM2. Similar results were also obtained from U87MG, another human glioblastoma cell line with wtp53 status. Northern blotting analysis showed that 3AB inhibited the gamma-ray-induced WAF1 gene expression. Moreover, 3AB but not its analog inhibited irradiation-induced activation of sequence-specific DNA binding of wtp53 as detected using 32P-labeled or biotin-labeled p53 consensus sequence (p53CON). However, immunoblotting with an anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody showed that p53 proteins of the p53CON-bound fraction did not contain poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). These findings suggested that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is required for rapid accumulation of p53, activation of p53 sequence-specific DNA binding and its transcriptional activity after DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2023329576,"The activity of the human apoA-II promoter is controlled by a synergistic interaction of the distal enhancer and the proximal promoter. An important role in apoA-II promoter activity is exerted by a transcription factor, designated CIIIB1, which binds to the proximal element AB and the distal elements of the enhancer, K and L. In the present communication we establish that CIIIB1 corresponds to the previously described factor, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) using the following criteria. (a) Purification of CIIIB1 by affinity chromatography provided a heat-stable protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa that cross-reacted with anti-USF1 and -USF2a antibodies; (b) CIIIB1 bound to the elements AB, K, and L was supershifted by these antibodies; (c) the heterodimer USF1/2a is the predominant form that corresponds to CIIIB1. Cotransfection experiments in HepG2 cells established the functional significance of USF in apoA-II transcription. It was found that the minimal promoter AB was transactivated by USF2a. In addition, all three E-box motifs present in elements AB, K and L are necessary for maximum transactivation by USF2a. A dominant negative form of USF2a inhibits the activity of apoA-II promoter. The USF1/2a heterodimer, which is naturally expressed in the liver, is as efficient as the USF2a homodimer in the transactivation of apoA-II promoter/enhancer constructs. Cotransfection experiments in COS-1 cells showed that hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) synergized with USF2a in the transactivation of the apoA-II promoter. In addition, we showed that HNF-4 and USF2a bind to the enhancer cooperatively. This may account for the transcriptional synergism observed between USF and HNF-4 in the transactivation of the apoA-II promoter.

Inactivation of theapoA-II gene in mice suggests a complex role for apoA-II in atherosclerosis, with both antiatherogenic and proatherogenic properties (2Weng W. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14788-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Clinical observations and tissue culture studies suggest that an increase in apoA-II production may be less protective against atherosclerosis by raising the proportion of a high density lipoprotein subclass containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpAI:AII), thereby decreasing the proportion of the antiatherogenic subclass of high density lipoprotein containing only apoA-I (LpAI) (3Puchois P.

ApoA-II is expressed in the liver and, to a much lesser extent, in the human fetal intestine (5Hussain M.M. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent kinetic data in normolipidemic humans indicate that human apoA-II production rate is the major factor determining the distribution of apoA-I between LpAI and LpAI:AII (6Ikewaki K. Zech L.A. Kindt M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,7Ikewaki K. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr, H.B. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 399-407PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in hepatic transcription of apoA-II may, therefore, lead to the development of new tools to control the ratio between LpAI and LpAI:AII. We have already reported that the human (−911/+29) apoA-II promoter is sufficient for liver-restricted expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice (8Le Beyec J. Benetollo C. Chauffeton V.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9657-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The element AB is important for the function of the apoA-II promoter and binds an activity designated CIIIB1 (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CIIIB1 was first described as a heat-stable factor that binds to element B of the apoC-III promoter (14Ogami K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9640-9646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CIIIB1 binding site GTCACCTG contains the CANNTG consensus E-box motif (16Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G.

E-box motifs are recognized by basic helix/loop/helix transcription factors, which contain a basic (b) DNA binding domain and a helix/loop/helix (HLH) dimerization domain. In the case of bHLH/ZIP-related proteins, the bHLH domain is contiguous with a second dimerization domain, a leucine zipper (ZIP). The latter group includes a wide variety of transcription factors, such as c-Myc, Max (18Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), TFE3 (19Beckman H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), TFEB (20Carr C.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human USF was first designated as major late transcription factor (16Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Three USF isoforms have been described, USF1, 2a, and 2b, with apparent molecular masses of 43, 44, and 38 kDa, respectively (23Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sirito M. Lin Q. Marity T. Sawadogo M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2a and 2b are encoded by two different genes, and USF2a and 2b are generated by differential splicing. Although ubiquitously expressed, USF has been involved in transcription of genes with tissue specificity (25Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Khan A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J.

Genomics. 1995; 25: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified CIIIB1 from rat liver nuclear extracts by DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography. We found that CIIIB1 is immunologically related to USF using anti-USF1 and anti-USF2a. DNA binding and competition experiments showed that USF binds to the regulatory elements AB, K, and L. We have established in HepG2 cells the functional significance of USF in apoA-II promoter activity. Finally, cotransfection experiments in COS-1 cells and DNA binding assays demonstrated synergism between USF2a and HNF-4 in the transactivation of the apoA-II promoter and a cooperative binding of the two factors to their cognate sites of the apoA-II promoter. The following oligonucleotides were used for plasmid construction in this work. KJ Kpn Hindc contains the sequence of the domains K and J from position −768 to −712 (9Chambaz J. Cardot P. Pastier D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11676-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with two restriction sites, KpnI and HindIII. KJ Kpn Hindnc is the complementary strand. L Sal Kpnc contains the domain L from position −807 to −769 (9Chambaz J. Cardot P. Pastier D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11676-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with SalI andKpnI restriction sites. L Sal Kpnnc represents the complementary strand. For gel-shift assays, the used double-stranded oligonucleotides of element AB (−68 to −32) and mutated element AB have been previously described (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (see Fig.2 A). Oligonucleotides J (−738 to −712), K (−762 to −741), K/J (−764 to −712) and L (−805 to −771) represent the J, K, K/J, and L regions of the apoA-II promoter (9Chambaz J. Cardot P. Pastier D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11676-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide CIIIB represents the element B of the human apoC-III promoter from −92 to −67 (14Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides NFY, MLP, and HNF-4 contain the binding site for NFY proteins (27Raymondjean M. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), a consensus binding site for USF (25Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Khan A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and a binding site for HNF-4, respectively (14Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AB plasmid, containing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene under the control of the −80/+29 minimal human apoA-II promoter, has been previously described (9Chambaz J. Cardot P. Pastier D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11676-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as have the ABM1 and ABM6 plasmids with mutations M1 and M6 in element AB (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The E-AB and E-ABM1 plasmids containing the distal enhancer (−911/−614) and the proximal promoter (−80/+29) with either nonmutated element AB or mutation M1 in element AB have also been described (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To join the K/J and AB apoA-II promoter regions, the AB plasmid was digested by KpnI and HindIII and ligated with the annealed KJ Kpn Hindc and ncoligos, thus generating the K/J-AB plasmid (see Fig. 3 A). Similarly, the AB plasmid was digested with SalI andKpnI and ligated to the annealed L Sal Kpnc andnc oligos to generate the L-AB plasmid (see Fig.3 A). The K/J-AB plasmid was subsequently digested bySalI and KpnI to ligate the annealed L Sal Kpnc and nc oligos, thus generating the L-K/J-AB plasmid (see Fig. 3 A). AfterHindIII/XhoI digestion of E-ABM1 plasmid, the ABM1 element was gel-purified. The L-K/J-AB plasmid was then digested by HindIII and XhoI, and the AB element was removed and replaced by the gel-purified ABM1 element, thus generating the L-K/J-ABM1 plasmid (see Fig. 3 A). These plasmids were sequenced.Figure 3Transactivation of various constructs of the apoA-II promoter by USF in HepG2 cells. A, schematic representation of the (−911/+29) apoA-II promoter (upper panel) and of the various CAT reporter plasmids used for transient transfection experiments (lower panel). B, comparison of the transactivation effect of USF2a or its mutated form, TDU2 (lacking the transactivation domain), on the wild type or mutated apoA-II proximal promoter, which contains one E-box motif. Transient transfections in HepG2 cells and CAT assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each experiment, CAT activity was calculated by linear regression as the slope of the reaction velocity and was expressed in cpm/min. CAT activities are expressed as a percentage of the activity of the reference plasmid AB, arbitrarily fixed at 1%. C, effect of the distal E-box motifs present in elements K and L on the activity of the proximal AB apoA-II promoter and its transactivation by USF1 and USF2a.

D, inhibition of the activity of the L-K/J-AB and E-AB promoters by the mutated USF2a derivative, TDU2. CAT activities are expressed as described in C. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three to five times. Results represent means ±S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. a, p ≤ 0.001 relative to the AB reporter with control DNA. b,p > 0.05 relative to the AB reporter with control DNA.c, p > 0.05 relative to the ABM1 reporter with control DNA. d, p ≤ 0.01 relative to the ABM6 reporter with control DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All buffers contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, which were added just before use. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared from rat livers, as described previously (28Cardot P. Pastier D. Lacorte J.-M. Mangeney M. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12139-12148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The extracts (1.6 g of protein) in nuclear dialysis buffer (NDB) containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol were heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and protein aggregates were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was adjusted to 5 mm MgCl2 and to 125 μg/ml sonicated herring sperm and was used for affinity chromatography purification. DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography was performed according to Kadonaga and Tjian (29Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), using as ligand the double-stranded oligonucleotide that represents the element B (−93 to −71) of the human apoC-III promoter region (14Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was eluted with a step gradient of 0.5 m and 1 m KCl in NDB. CIIIB1 activity was recovered in 0.5 m KCl fractions. Three successive affinity chromatographies were performed. After the third affinity chromatography, fractions containing CIIIB1 were further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The gel was stained briefly in 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250. A digestion was performed in an excised gel slice with a lysyl endopeptidase. The resulting peptides were separated on a reverse phase C18 column. Amino acid sequence analysis of the selected peaks was performed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 473A. Affinity chromatography purified CIIIB1 from rat liver nuclear extracts and whole COS-1 cell extract overexpressing USF2a were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gel, then electrotransferred on a nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Rad apparatus, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After blocking for 2 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), rabbit anti-USF1 or -USF2a antibodies, diluted 200- and 1,000-fold, respectively, in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, were incubated overnight and washed three times (TBS, TBS with 0.1% Tween, TBS). Antisera against human USF1 (43 kDa) and USF2a (44 kDa) were kindly provided by Michel Raymondjean (U129 INSERM) (25Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Khan A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A.

Then anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with peroxidase diluted 1,000-fold in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin were incubated for 1 h and washed three times (TBS, TBS with 0.1% Tween, TBS), and peroxydase-conjugated antibodies were detected using 4-chloro-1-naphtol enzyme as substrate. The various CAT gene reporter plasmids were cotransfected with the plasmid RSV-βgal in HepG2 cells and COS-1 cells using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (32Graham F.L. van der EB A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined to normalize the variability in transfection efficiency (33Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed in a liquid phase, as described previously (34Desbois C. Massé T. Madjar J.-J. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 300-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The initial velocity of the enzymatic reaction was estimated by measuring the amount of labeled acetylchloramphenicol, which diffused directly into the liquid phase in the scintillation counting vial. cDNAs encoding USF1, USF2a, and TDU2 (USF2a that lacks the NH2-terminal activation domain) subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pCMV were kindly provided by Michel Raymondjean (U129 INSERM) (25Viollet B.

Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (35Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol.

Annealing and labeling of synthetic oligonucleotides were performed as described previously (14Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA were performed according to Fried and Crothers (36Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) as described by Lacorte et al. (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μl of rat liver nuclear extract (2 to 3 μg/μl of total proteins) and 6 μl of the same extract, heated for 5 min at 85 °C were used in EMSA. Aliquots of 6 μl and 4 μl of the first and second affinity elution fractions, respectively, were also used in EMSA. For supershift assays, anti-USF1, -USF2a, or -HNF-4 antibodies were diluted 10-fold, and 1 μl was added to the reaction mix. Anti-HNF-4 antibody was kindly provided by F. M. Sladek (37Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnel Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). To further characterize CIIIB1, which is essential for apoA-II promoter activity, the protein was purified to near homogeneity from rat liver nuclear extracts by heat treatment at 85 °C for 5 min followed by three cycles of DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography with the element B of the human apoCIII promoter (Fig.1). The presence of CIIIB1 in purified fractions was assessed by EMSA analysis using the CIIIB probe (Fig.1 C, lanes 1–4). SDS-PAGE analysis of the affinity-purified CIIIB1 revealed two predominant proteins, with molecular masses of 45 and 97 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The 97-kDa protein was not a dimer of the 45-kDa protein, since affinity samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Digestion with lysyl endopeptidase of the 97-kDa protein generated five peptides, which were microsequenced. The sequences obtained matched perfectly those of the human polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) (TableI) (38Patton J.G. Porro E.B. Galceran J. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).

Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9640-9646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether this protein corresponds to USF because the CIIIB1 binding site, GTCACCTG, contains an E-box motif, CANNTG. This motif binds heat-stable b/HLH/ZIP proteins such as USF, which is expressed abundantly in the liver. An immunoblot analysis was performed with specific antibodies raised against the transactivation domain of USF1 (M domain) or USF2a (G domain) (25Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Khan A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Anti-USF1 or anti-USF2a (Fig. 1 B,left and right panels) cross-reacted with a 43/44-kDa polypeptide in the purified affinity fraction (Fig.1 B, 2nd AFF.). When both antibodies were used (Fig. 1 B, middle panel), two polypeptides were observed in the affinity-purified fraction (Fig. 2 B,2nd AFF.). The upper polypeptide comigrates with the 44-kDa isoform USF2a in the USF2a control (Fig. 2 B, USF2a), and the lower polypeptide corresponds to the 43-kDa isoform USF1. To further confirm the identity of CIIIB1, EMSA and supershift assays were performed with anti-USF1 and anti-USF2a (Fig. 1, C andD). The CIIIB1 complex is competed out by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides CIIIB and AIIAB (Fig. 1 C,lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 1 D,lanes 15 and 16). When both antibodies were added to the reaction, the CIIIB1 complex was totally supershifted (Fig.1 C, lane 9, and Fig. 1 D, lane 19). A residual complex remained after addition of each antibody. The mobility of the remaining complex corresponds to the homodimer USF1/1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 8 and 10, and Fig. 1 D, lanes 18 and 20) or to the homodimer USF2a/2a (Fig. 1 C, lanes 7 and12, and Fig. 1 D, lanes 17and 22). These findings provide strong evidence that CIIIB1 is mostly the heterodimer USF1/2a. USF1 and USF2a overexpressed in COS-1 cells formed specific complexes with the AIIAB probe (Fig.2 B). Oligonucleotides containing specific mutations in the element AB were used as probes that either avoid or do not affect the binding of CIIIB1(12) (Fig.2 A). Fig. 2 C shows that binding of USF2a to element AB was not competed out by oligonucleotides ABM1 and ABM2 containing mutations in the E-box motif, which abolish the binding of CIIIB1 (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations ABM3 to ABM6, which do not affect CIIIB1 binding (12Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), competed out USF2a binding. Furthermore, as expected, USF1 and USF2a bound to oligonucleotide ABM6 but not to oligonucleotide ABM1 (Fig. 2 D). To evaluate the potential role of USF in the transactivation of the human apoA-II promoter, cotransfection experiments were performed in HepG2 cells using USF1 or USF2a expression vectors and a vector expressing the CAT gene under the control of the wild-type proximal apoA-II promoter (AB plasmid) shown in Fig.3 A, as well as AB plasmid derivatives containing the mutated forms ABM1 and ABM6 (Fig.3 B). This analysis showed that USF2a transactivated 4.5-fold and 13-fold the proximal AB promoter with 50 ng and 500 ng of plamid, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained by cotransfection with USF1 (data not shown). Cotransfection with a truncated mutant USF2a protein, TDU2, that lacks the NH2-terminal activation domain but contains normal DNA binding and dimerization domains had no effect on the minimal apoA-II p"

Bartonella bacilliformis is the only bacterium known to invade human red blood cells, and it and other species ofBartonella are responsible for several maladies, including Carrion's disease (Oroya fever, verruga peruana), cat scratch disease, trench fever, bacilliary angiomatosis, and bacilliary endocarditis (1Ihler G.M.

This report attracted our attention, because one of these two genes, ialA (for invasion-associated locus) codes for an open reading frame containing a small array of highly conserved amino acids we have called the Nudix box (4Bessman M.J.

The Nudix box is represented in all three kingdoms, Archaea, Prokaryota, and Eukaryota, from viruses to humans. Recent BLAST (6Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (70663) Google Scholar) searches have uncovered over 200 putative proteins containing the Nudix motif in 60 species, and we are systematically studying the members of this primordial and widely distributed family. This communication describes the cloning of ialA, and the expression, purification, and partial characterization of the invasion-associated protein, IalA, as an enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of dinucleoside 5′-polyphosphates. All biochemicals were from Sigma. Enzymes used in standard cloning procedures were from Life Technologies Inc., Stratagene, or U. S. Biochemical Corp., except the Pfu DNA polymerase from Perkin-Elmer. Oligonucleotide primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies. E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells and pET11b were obtained from Novagen. E. coli HB101 cells were from our laboratory stock. pGroESL, from George H. Lorimer, DuPont, contained the groEL and groES genes, a T7 lacpromoter, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. Sephadex G-100 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The ialA gene (GenBankTMaccession number L25276) from B. bacilliformis KD583 (ATCC number 35685) was amplified from genomic DNA with forward primers incorporating an NdeI site and reverse primers incorporating a BamHI site. The insert was prepared by digestion withNdeI and BamHI followed by gel purification. The pET construct, pIALa, was prepared by ligation of the insert into theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET11b to regulate expression of the ialA gene with a T7 lacpromoter, and the insert was verified by sequence analysis. The pIALa was used to transform E. coli strains HB101 to test lethality and HMS174(DE3) for expression. The pIALa-transformed HMS174(DE3) cell line was then transformed with pGroESL. Eight liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 64 μg/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated with 80 ml of an overnight culture of HMS174(DE3) cells containing pIALa and pGroESL. The culture was incubated at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.3, then transferred to 22 °C. At an A 600 of 0.6, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 22 °C for an additional 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed by suspension in about 10 volumes of an isotonic saline solution, centrifuged again, and frozen at −80 °C. About 2 g of cells were obtained per liter of culture. Freezing the cells was essential for preparing the extract. The frozen cells were suspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 1 mm EDTA), and the supernatant, which contained the IalA protein, was collected after centrifugation (Fraction I). A 10% streptomycin sulfate solution was slowly added to Fraction I to a final concentration of 1%, while the fraction was stirred on ice. After approximately 15 min, the supernatant was collected after centrifugation (Fraction II). Fraction II was brought to 40% saturation by the slow addition of solid ammonium sulfate. After 15 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and discarded, and additional ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give a 60% saturated solution. This precipitate, containing the IalA protein, was collected and dissolved in a volume of buffer A representing a 15-fold concentration of the starting material (Fraction III). Fraction III was loaded onto a 2.5 × 60-cm Sephadex G-100 column and eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The fractions containing purified IalA protein were combined, concentrated by pressure filtration in a Centriplus 10 microconcentrator, and stored at −80 °C (Fraction IV). This assay measures the conversion of a phosphatase-insensitive substrate to a phosphatase-sensitive product. The standard incubation mixture contained in 50 μl: 1 mmsubstrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmZnCl2, 3 units of calf alkaline intestinal phosphatase, and 0.1–1.5 milliunits of enzyme. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 8 mm EDTA and analyzed for inorganic orthophosphate by the method of Ames and Dubin (7Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under these conditions. Cloning of the ialA gene, and transformation of the expression host, HMS174(DE3), with pIALA produced a new, highly visible protein band of about 20 kDa in extracts of induced cultures when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, all of the newly expressed protein was present in the insoluble fraction (inclusion body) of a low speed centrifugation, making it unsuitable for enzyme purification. Accordingly, we explored procedures for increasing the solubility of recalcitrant proteins, and we found that the combination of growing the cells at a reduced temperature, and in the presence of chaperonins co-expressed from a second plasmid, produced significant quantities of soluble IalA protein. The partial purification of the IalA protein was facilitated by the ease with which it was extracted from the cells. Merely freezing and thawing the centrifuged packed cell mass causes the soluble IalA protein to leak out with the retention of most of the other proteins. This observation is reminiscent of another of the Nudix proteins we have studied, Orf17, a dATPase from E. coli (8O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.F. Mildvan A.S. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24649-24654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which also appears in the supernatant after a freeze-thaw cycle. Whether this behavior is merely a coincidence or reflects some functional commonality is at present conjectural. Fig.1 shows the appearance of a new protein species after induction of a plasmid carrying the ialA gene. Also shown is Fraction IV, purified according to the protocol described under “Methods.” This fraction was used for all of the experiments described in this paper. Our experience with other members of the Nudix hydrolase family of enzymes told us that the substrate of the IalA protein would probably be a nucleoside diphosphate derivative. However, none of the substrates of our previously discovered enzymes such as NADH (9Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (70663) Google Scholar) of the protein data banks using the Nudix box region of IalA as the query was not very informative, because it uncovered over 100 open reading frames, including those we had identified previously. However, when the entire amino acid sequence of the protein was used to probe the data base, homologous regions outside of the Nudix signature sequence narrowed the search. A Clustal sequence alignment (12Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55732) Google Scholar) of the top three BLAST matches to IalA ofBartonella is shown in Fig. 2. The plant proteins from Lupinus (13Maksel D. Guranowski A. Ilgoutz S.C. Moir A. Blackburn M.G. Gayler K.R. Biochem.

D. Walsh and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observation. We therefore examined whether the IalA invasion protein also belonged to this family by assaying extracts of cells carrying the plasmid for diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase activity. Fig. 3shows the appearance of the enzyme after induction. In the control culture containing the plasmid without the ialA insert, no commensurate activity was detected. After purification of the newly discovered enzyme, the substrate specificity was examined as shown in Table I. In both the diadenosine and diguanosine series, the tetraphosphate appears to be the preferred substrate, although more extensive kinetic measurements will be required to compare all the members of the series. As mentioned previously, none of the other compounds including nucleotide sugars, NADH, nucleoside triphosphates, or ADP-ribose, favored, by other members of the Nudix family, are significant substrates.Figure 3Expression of diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphatase in E. colipIALa.

In order to ascertain the pathway of hydrolysis of adenosine tetraphosphate, a scaled up standard reaction mixture (without alkaline phosphatase) was allowed to proceed until approximately 70% of the initial substrate was hydrolyzed. The products and remaining substrate were separated by high performance liquid chromatography as shown in Fig. 4. The disappearance of Ap4A 2The abbreviations used are: Ap4A, adenosine 5′-tetraphospho-5′-adenosine. Other members of the family are abbreviated in an analogous manner. was accompanied by the commensurate appearance of ATP and AMP. Neither inorganic orthophosphate nor pyrophosphate is produced during the course of the reaction, and the following equation may be written: Ap4A + H2O → ATP + AMP. The products formed from the other substantial substrates were analyzed by paper electrophoresis according to Markham and Smith (14Markham R. Smith J.D. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Gp4G, as expected, yielded GTP and GMP. When the pentaphosphates were analyzed, the products were found to be the triphosphate (ATP or GTP) and the respective diphosphate (ADP or GDP). With the hexaphosphate, Ap6A, ATP was the sole product. Thus, the feature common to all the reactions is the obligatory formation of a nucleoside triphosphate as one of the products, arguing that a nucleophilic attack by H2O is directed at the γ phosphorus atom in each of the substrates. This is in contrast to the MutT dGTPase and Orf 17 dATPase, also members of the Nudix hydrolase family, which catalyze nucleophilic attacks on the β phosphorus as shown by NMR analysis of the products of dGTP or dATP hydrolyzed in H218O (8O'Handley S.F.

It would be of interest to do similar studies with the dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolase since the amino acid motif of the nucleotide binding site and catalytic center is common to all members of the Nudix hydrolase family. It is worth noting that the enzyme described here differs from the dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolase recently reported by Cartwright and Mclennan (16Cartwright J.L. Mclennan A.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: S580Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Their protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae also contains the Nudix signature. However, it forms multiple products from Ap6A (ADP, Ap4, AMP, Ap5) and Ap5A (ADP, ATP, AMP, Ap4), and it also hydrolyzes ATP and Ap4, which are not substrates for the enzyme described in this paper. On the other hand, the specificity of the Bartonella enzyme seems to parallel, most closely, the Ap4A pyrophosphatase purified and characterized from human placenta (17Lazewska D. Starzynska E. Guranowski A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and shown to have the Nudix motif (18Thorne N.M.H. Hankin S. Wilkinson M.C. Nunez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein appears to be monomeric, eluting from a gel filtration column at a position corresponding to 20 kDa. It has a broad pH optimum between 7.5 and 9.0 and requires a divalent metal ion for activity. At pH 9.0, it has optimal and approximately equal activity in 10 mmMg2+ or 1 mm Zn2+, and it is about 50% as active in 3 mm Mn2+. The purified enzyme (Fraction IV) has a specific activity of 40 μmol/min/mg or ak cat of about 14/s. What role does the hydrolysis of dinucleoside polyphosphates play in the invasion of red cells by B. bacilliformis? The dinucleoside polyphosphates themselves are an interesting group of cell signaling molecules broadly distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and implicated in a wide variety of physiological responses, including stress or heat shock (“alarmones”), neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, cardiovascular regulation (for review, see Ref. 19Baxi M.D. Vishwanatha J.K. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1995; 33: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and in cell differentiation and apoptosis (20Vartanian A. Prudovsky I. Suzuki H. Dal Pra I. Kisselev L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). With this plethora of diverse targets, it has been difficult to assign specific mechanisms to their modes of action. However, thought-provoking correlations are evident. We have seen that Suramin (number 8986, The Merck Index), a powerful anti-helminthic, anti-parasitic drug is a potent inhibitor of the Ap4A pyrophosphatase, reducing its catalytic rate 50% at 10 μmconcentration. 3G. B. Conyers and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. Rotlanet al. have seen similar effects in extracts of rat brain (21Rotlan P. Rodriguez-Ferrer A.C. Asensio A.C. Oaknin S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Suramin has also been shown to inhibit purinergic neurotransmission (22Mallard N. Marshall R. Sithers A. Spriggs B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 220: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), ADP-induced platelet aggregation (23Hourani S.M.O. Hall D.A. Nieman C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory action potential (24Ohno N. Ito K.M. Yamamoto Y. Suzuki H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 249: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that adenine nucleotides, implicated as signaling molecules in these processes, are also involved in cell invasion. It is also noteworthy that B. bacilliformis is a member of the alpha proteobacteria and closely related phylogenetically to other intracellular parasites, including Rickettsia, Brucella, Rhizobium, and Agrobacterium. Several lines of evidence, including 16 S RNA sequencing (25Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), chaperonin homologies (26Viale A.J. Arakaki A.K.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), point to the Rickettsia as the most likely antecedents of mitochondria by invading eukaryotic cells. We have recently identified an open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number Z82300) in Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus, containing the Nudix box and highly homologous to the enzyme described in this paper. We plan to determine whether it also is a dinucleoside pyrophosphatase in order to assess how general the linkage is between invasiveness and homologues of IalA. In addition, our identification of the product ofialA as a dinucleoside pyrophosphatase should help in uncovering the role of the second gene associated with invasion,ialB.

https://openalex.org/W2026451921,"Expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc stimulates cell proliferation in the presence of the appropriate survival factors and triggers apoptosis in their absence; this dual capacity ensures that cell growth is restricted to the correct paracrine environment and is thereby strictly controlled. Recently our laboratory demonstrated that c-Myc-induced apoptosis requires the CD95 death receptor pathway and that insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signalling suppresses this killing. To investigate further the links between c-Myc and IGF-1 pathways in CD95-induced apoptosis, we examined the effects of c-Myc and a downstream IGF-1 survival kinase, Akt, on killing mediated by CD95 and its recruited effector proteins (FADD and caspase-8). Here, we show that c-Myc activation does not exacerbate killing induced by FADD or pro-caspase-8, which narrows the point at which c-Myc exerts its action downstream of the interaction of CD95 with its ligand and upstream of FADD. We show further that activated Akt suppresses CD95-induced apoptosis and that Akt exerts its activity at a point downstream of FADD but upstream of caspase-8. These results restrict the possible mechanisms by which CD95-induced apoptosis is modulated by death signals and survival factors."
https://openalex.org/W2084982464,"The critical residues involved in targeting and processing of the soybean alternative oxidase to plant and animal mitochondria was investigated. Import of various site-directed mutants into soybean mitochondria indicated that positive residues throughout the length of the presequence were important for import, not just those in the predicted region of amphiphilicity. The position of the positive residues in the C-terminal end of the presequence was also important for import. Processing assays of the various constructs with purified spinach mitochondrial processing peptidase showed that all the −2-position mutants had a drastic effect on processing. In contrast to the import assay, the position of the positive residue could be changed for processing. Deletion mutants confirmed the site-directed mutagenesis data in that an amphiphilic α-helix was not the only determinant of mitochondrial import in this homologous plant system. Import of these constructs into rat liver mitochondria indicated that the degree of inhibition differed and that the predicted region of amphiphilic α-helix was more important with rat liver mitochondria. Processing with a rat liver matrix fraction showed little inhibition. These results are discussed with respect to targeting specificity in plant cells and highlight the need to carry out homologous studies and define the targeting requirements to plant mitochondria.

Processing with a rat liver matrix fraction showed little inhibition. These results are discussed with respect to targeting specificity in plant cells and highlight the need to carry out homologous studies and define the targeting requirements to plant mitochondria. The role of the presequence in targeting proteins to mitochondria has been well established for a variety of species using chimeric constructs containing passenger proteins and deletion studies where removing the presequence abolished mitochondrial import (1Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 2Glick B. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 21-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This process requires the presence of cytosolic factors (3Lithgow T. Hoj P.B. Hoogenraad N.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Mihara K. Omura T. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) and recognition event(s) at the surface of the mitochondria (6Roise D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Inside the mitochondria precursors proteins are processed to a mature form by specific peptidase(s), which requires information located within the presequence for correct recognition of the cleavage site (1Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 7Schneider G. Sjöling S. Wallin E. Wrede P. Glaser E. von Heijne G. Proteins. 1998; 30: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the sequence of a large number of presequences are known, no consensus sequence for mitochondrial targeting and subsequent processing are defined. This is because of large variations in the length of presequences, which display no primary amino acid sequence homology (7Schneider G. Sjöling S. Wallin E. Wrede P. Glaser E. von Heijne G. Proteins. 1998; 30: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However mitochondrial targeting presequences share some common features such as enrichment of positively charged amino acids and a lack of negatively charged amino acids and display an enrichment for alanine, leucine, and serine (7Schneider G. Sjöling S. Wallin E. Wrede P. Glaser E. von Heijne G. Proteins. 1998; 30: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore they are normally predicted to have the ability to form an amphiphilic α-helix (8von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial presequences can be roughly divided into two domains, an N- and a C-terminal domain (8von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 9Sjöling S. Glaser E. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 7: 1-4Google Scholar). The N-terminal has the potential to form the α-helix and is proposed to function in targeting of the precursor (10Roise D. Epand R. The Amphipathic Helix. CRC Press, London1993Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain contains the information necessary for proper cleavage of the presequence (10Roise D. Epand R. The Amphipathic Helix. CRC Press, London1993Google Scholar) but does not exhibit any preference to a secondary structure (11Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of both domains are independent of each other, but they may overlap (9Sjöling S. Glaser E. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 7: 1-4Google Scholar). Positive charges and the position of the positive charge appear to be important for mitochondrial targeting. Studies using site-directed mutants of rat ornithine transcarbamylase precursor (pOTC), 1The abbreviations used are: pOTC, ornithine transcarbamylase precursor; MPP, mitochondrial-processing peptidase; AOX, soybean alternative oxidase; PK, proteinase K. pig aspartate aminotransferase, and rat aldehyde dehydrogenase indicate the critical role of arginine residues located in the N-terminal part of the presequence for import (12Sztul E.S. Hendrick J.P. Kraus J.P. Wall D. Kalousek F. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Nishi T. Nagashima F. Tanase S. Fukumoto Y. Joh T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Human pOTC appears to be different; the mutation of some individual arginines (arginine 23) had a drastic inhibitory effect on import, whereas changing arginine 26 to glycine had no effect on import (15Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Pollock R.A. Rosenberg L.E. Cell. 1986; 44: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutagenesis of arginine 23 to glycine of rat pOTC affected processing but not import (12Sztul E.S. Hendrick J.P. Kraus J.P. Wall D. Kalousek F. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this discrepancy has not been resolved. Experiments whereby negatively charged residues are incorporated into the presequence also affected import (16Bedwell D.M. Strobell S.A. Yun K. Jongeward G.D. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggests that mitochondrial protein import depends on a net positive charge on the presequence that may be required at different stages of translocation (1Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), possibly through interaction with the acid bristle of the translocation pore, as suggested by Haucke and Lithgow (17Haucke V. Lithgow T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As there is no known primary structure homology at the cleavage site between different precursor proteins, it is intriguing how these sites are recognized and cleaved by the general mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). An arginine residue located two amino acids upstream of the start of the mature protein has been proposed to act as the processing signal (7Schneider G. Sjöling S. Wallin E. Wrede P. Glaser E. von Heijne G. Proteins. 1998; 30: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis studies outlined above indicated that the arginine residues involved in processing were not required for import. However certain arginine residues may overlap in function,e.g. human pOTC, where changing an arginine residue resulted in loss of import and processing (15Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Pollock R.A. Rosenberg L.E. Cell. 1986; 44: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Only a few studies have looked at the requirements for precursor targeting to plant mitochondria. Studies with the F1β presequence from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia showed that the first half of the 54 amino acid presequence could support mitochondrial targeting although at a much lower efficiency (18Chaumont F. Silva Filho M.D.C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Likewise, the superoxide dismutase from maize showed that only small deletions in the C-terminal region of the presequence could be tolerated (19White J.A. Scandalios J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3534-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Few studies have addressed the requirement for processing of precursor proteins in plants. The −2 arginine rule does hold for the soybean alternative oxidase precursor (20Whelan J. Tanudji M.R. Smith M.K. Day D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, processing of theN. plumbaginifolia F1β was inhibited by synthetic peptides, which had a predicted ability to form a helical structure, suggesting a structural requirement for processing in this case (21Sjöling S. Eriksson A. Glaser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32059-32062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore to define the requirements of a mitochondrial presequence for targeting and processing in plants, we have carried out studies with the soybean alternative oxidase precursor, an inner membrane protein responsible for cyanide-insensitive respiration (22Day D.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Siedow J.N. Wiskich J.T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have carried out site-directed mutagenesis with the authentic protein to avert any potential problems with the nature of the passenger protein and linker sequences (23Waltner M. Hammen P.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21226-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is the first study to investigate the role of specific residues required for plant mitochondrial import. Also it is the first investigation of the processing requirements of plant MPP by site-directed mutagenesis. The alternative oxidase (AOX) from soybean contains a presequence of 41 amino acids. Mutagenesis was performed using altered site-directed mutagenesis (Promega, Madison, WI) or quick-change site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) kits as per the manufacturer's instructions, and mutants were confirmed by sequencing.35S-Labeled alternative oxidase precursor protein was synthesized as described by Whelan et al. (24Whelan J. Smith M.K. Meijer M. Yu J.W. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1469-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mutations introduced were designated by the position relative to the start site of the mature protein, followed by the three-letter abbreviation for the amino acid introduced, i.e. −2Gly means the amino acid glycine two residues upstream of the start of the mature protein. A list of the mutations is shown in Fig.1 C. Mitochondria were isolated from 7-day-old soybean (Glycine max L. Merr, c.v. Stevens) cotyledons as described by Day et al. (25Day D.A. Neuburger M. Douce R. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 12: 219-228Crossref Google Scholar). Import of the soybean alternative oxidase mutants was performed as by Whelan et al. (20Whelan J. Tanudji M.R. Smith M.K. Day D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from approximately 30 g of tissues (26Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar). In vitro mitochondrial imports were performed similar to the soybean mitochondrial imports, except that dithiothreitol was omitted, as import was found to be lower in the presence of dithiothreitol with rat liver mitochondria, and the 20-min incubation of the reaction was performed at 30 °C. The results were analyzed using a MacBAS 1000 according to manufacturer's instructions (Fuji). Import studies with all mutant precursor proteins were also accompanied by a valinomycin control (see Fig. 2) to ensure that all PK-protected protein generated was dependent on a membrane potential (data not shown). Isolated rat liver mitochondria were resuspended in fractionation buffer (1 mmmethionine, 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). The suspension was cooled on ice for 5 min before sonication. Sonication was performed 3 times on a Microtip (Branson) setting of 4 for 10 s with a 2-min cooling on ice inbetween. The fractions were separated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and diluted 2-fold for use in processing assays. Processing mix contained the following: 20 μg of rat matrix fraction, 1 mm methionine, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm EDTA in a final volume of 10 μl. N-Ethylmaleimide was added to the rat matrix fraction to 5 mm, a concentration that inhibited the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase but not the MPP (27Isaya G. Kalousek F. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 87-103Google Scholar, 28Brunner M. Klaus C. Neupert W. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 73-86Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of dithiothreitol to 10 mm to inactivateN-ethylmaleimide. The mix was then incubated with 2 μl of radiolabeled precursors. The samples were analyzed similar to the import assay. Processing of the soybean alternative oxidase and the mutant precursors was performed using purified spinach MPP (29Eriksson A. Sjöling S. Glaser E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 221-231Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Western analysis was carried out with 40 μg of purified mitochondria using antibodies to the alternative oxidase (30Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of imports was performed as indicated by Dessi and Whelan (31Dessi P. Whelan J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Quantitations of imports were determined by densitometric analysis on the raw image scans using the MacBas v2.0 software (Fuji). The efficiency of import and processing was calculated based on density of precursor and mature bands. The percentage of import was calculated as follows (−PK and +PK denotes bands in the non-PK-treated and PK-treated samples, respectively. [mature+precursor(+PK)][mature+precursor(−PK)]Equation 1 The percentage import of the wild type precursor protein was set to 100% and that of the mutant precursor proteins was calculated relative to the wild type. Import values that are less than 5% are not indicated on the figures even though the band(s) is present on the figures. Processing of the wild type and mutants were calculated as follows. [mature][mature+precursor]Equation 2 The percentage of wild type processing was set to 100%, and the percentage of processing of the mutants was calculated relative to the wild type. All data taken fell within the linear range of the MacBAS 1000, and all assays were carried out at least three times. The AOX presequence was analyzed using MITOPROT (32Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) and Robson-Garnier analysis (33Gornier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar) to determine the amphiphilicity and secondary structure, respectively. The AOX presequence has the potential to form an amphiphilic α-helix (32Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A) between residues 9 and 25 followed by no predictable structure after residue 26 (Fig.1 B), in agreement with the two-domain structure of mitochondrial targeting presequences (8von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 9Sjöling S. Glaser E. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 7: 1-4Google Scholar). To demonstrate the requirement for the presequence in mitochondrial targeting of the AOX, the mature AOX form (AOX ΔP) was constructed. This was not imported into isolated soybean and rat liver mitochondria (Fig.2, A and B,lanes 6 to 8) under conditions that clearly supported the import of the wild type AOX (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 1 to 3). (The identity of the additional bands P′ and M′ will be discussed with the deletion mutants below.) From this experiment it was concluded that the presequence was responsible for targeting the AOX to the mitochondrion in a membrane potential-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 4 and 5), and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to determine critical residues for import and processing in plants and animals (Fig. 1 C). The −2 arginine was the main focus as it is common to other precursor proteins (34Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Import using isolated soybean mitochondria showed that the greatest effect was seen with the −2Gly and −2Thr, where at least 30% inhibition was consistently observed (Fig.3 A, TableI (note that the import efficiencies are normalized as indicated under “Materials and Methods” because of different precursor translation efficiencies). The mature form generated upon import with these two mutants had a slower mobility (higher M r) compared with the wild type AOX, indicating that processing upstream of the correct site had taken place. When the processing site was deleted (Δ−1+1 mutant), import proceeded normally, except this time the mature form generated had a greater mobility (lower M r) compared with the control. An overall affect of the various −2 mutations was the accumulation of imported precursor forms, up to 40% in the case of the −2Gly,−2Thr,and Δ−1+1 mutants.Table IImport and processing efficiency of the precursor proteins used in this studyPrecursorPlantAnimalImportProcessingImportProcessingWild-type100100100100−2Gly65−16−80−100−−2Leu8020−8085−2Lys80080100−2Ala9011−100−80−−2Thr70−080−80−−2Phe8009065−2Gln80090−85−−2His801380−75−+2Gly65239070Δ−1+11002670+85+−4Arg100+608080−2Gly,−4Arg70568085−10Gly65708050−2,−10Gly35960=45=−2,−10Gly,−4Arg355740=50=−7Ser,−2Gly75−6580−75−−7Ser,−2Thr50−090−65−−20Gly7007075−30Gly7509065−35Gly751690100−20,−30Gly2060050−20,−35Gly40302070−30,−35Gly2501065−20,−30,−35Gly0100075AOX 9–36300750AOX Δ1–171510045100The import efficiencies refer to the combined amount of the imported mature and precursor product. The mutants are outlined in Fig.1 C, and the symbols used are as outlined in Figs. 3 and 4. For Plant, import was with soybean cotyledon mitochondria and processing was with purified spinach MPP. For Animal, import was with rat liver mitochondria and processing was with rat liver mitochondrial matrix fraction. Open table in a new tab The import efficiencies refer to the combined amount of the imported mature and precursor product. The mutants are outlined in Fig.1 C, and the symbols used are as outlined in Figs. 3 and 4. For Plant, import was with soybean cotyledon mitochondria and processing was with purified spinach MPP. For Animal, import was with rat liver mitochondria and processing was with rat liver mitochondrial matrix fraction. Imports with the −2 mutant precursor proteins were also carried out with isolated rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 3 B, Table I). In agreement with the soybean mitochondria experiments, no complete inhibition of import was observed, and import was inhibited by 20% with most mutants. However, in the case of rat liver mitochondria, the −2Gly, −2Ala, −2Thr, −2Gln, and −2His mutants had slower mobility, and the Δ−1+1 mutant had a faster mobility (Fig. 3 B). Similar to soybean, for some mutants, significant amounts of imported precursor form was observed (Fig. 3 B). Processing studies of the −2 mutants were also conducted using isolated spinach MPP (35Glaser E. Eriksson A. Sjöling S. FEBS Letts. 1994; 346: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and a rat matrix fraction (36Conboy G.J. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The wild type AOX was efficiently processed by the isolated spinach MPP but except for the +2Gly and Δ−1+1 mutants, most of the −2 mutants inhibited processing drastically (Fig.4 A, Table I). In contrast, processing using the rat matrix fraction was not affected except for the −2Phe mutant (Fig. 4 B, Table I). The AOX presequence contains three glycine residues at positions −4 to −6 and a −10 arginine (a putative processing signal) (37Isaya G. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A −4Arg could not complement the inhibition of import seen with the −2Gly (Fig.5 A), and even though the efficiency of processing (in the import assay) was not increased with the −2Gly,−4Arg mutant compared with the −2Gly mutant, the fidelity of processing was restored (Fig. 3 A and 5 A). The −10Gly mutant decreased import by 35%, similar to the inhibition seen with the −2Gly (Fig. 5 A). The double mutant −2,−10Gly inhibited import by ∼70%, and this could not be restored by the presence of an arginine as shown in the −2,−10Gly,−4Arg mutant (Fig.5 A, Table I). Therefore the position of the −2 arginine residue is important as well as the positive charge; if charge alone was the only parameter, it would be expected that the −2,−10Gly,−4Arg would be imported with a similar efficiency to the single mutants −2Gly or −10Gly. The AOX presequence contains a −10 arginine, a putative processing signal for two-step processing by MPP and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase, respectively (37Isaya G. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A −7 serine residue is considered important for two-step processing (38Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore we changed this −7 residue to a serine to see if the −10 arginine could act as a processing signal. It was found the −7Ser,−2Gly mutant had the effect that the majority of the product was processed upon import into soybean mitochondria (Fig. 5 A). However it had a slower mobility than the wild type AOX, indicating processing upstream of the correct site, possibly using the −10 arginine as a processing signal. In the case of rat liver mitochondria, a similar effect was seen with the −2,−10Gly mutants in that import was inhibited; however, only by 40% compared with 70% with soybean cotyledon mitochondria (Fig.5 B, Table I). Again, the presence of a −4Arg could not restore processing of the −2Gly in the import assay (Fig.3 B), but the mature form generated with the −2Gly,−4Arg mutant was similar to that with wild type AOX (Fig. 3 B and5 B). In the import experiments with rat liver mitochondria, the −7Ser could restore the processing efficiency in the import assay with the −2Gly (−7Ser,−2Gly mutant) and to a lesser degree with the −2Thr mutant (Fig. 3 B and 5 B). In the rat liver import assays, precursors containing the −2Gly mutation, except the −2Gly,−4Arg mutant, the mature form generated had a slower mobility compared with the wild type. This is in contrast to the soybean import assays where only the −2Gly and −2Thr mutants had this effect. However, in rat mitochondrial import, the presence of the −10Gly mutation with the −2Gly affected the formation of the mature product, whereby a slower mobility mature form was generated (denoted by a double minus sign). This suggests that in the presence of the −2Gly mutant, the wild type −10 arginine acted as a processing signal. The presence of a −7Ser with the −2Gly (−7Ser,−2Gly mutant) appears to have increased the efficiency at which the rat mitochondria utilized the −10 arginine residue as a processing signal in the import reaction. A serine in the −7 position would be predicted to change the residues to that of the consensus required for −10 arginine processing in animals (7Schneider G. Sjöling S. Wallin E. Wrede P. Glaser E. von Heijne G. Proteins. 1998; 30: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The −10Gly mutant alone had little effect on the mobility of the product obtained (Fig. 5 B). The role of residues in the −2 to −10 region was also analyzed in processing reactions (Fig. 4). In contrast to the import studies, the −4Arg mutant restored processing with spinach MPP, processing of the −2Gly mutant (16%) was increased by greater than 3-fold to approximately 56% by the −4Arg mutant, and the processed product generated had the same mobility as wild type AOX. The processing of the −2,−10Gly mutant was increased from 9 to 57% in the −2,−10Gly,−4Arg mutant. The ability of the −4Arg to restore significant processing to both these mutants but have no effect on import indicates that these arginine residues play a critical role in import distinct from a role in processing. Similar to what was seen with the import assays into soybean, the −7Ser mutant could restore processing of the −2Gly mutant but not the −2Thr mutant. In contrast to purified spinach MPP, processing by the rat matrix of the −10Gly mutant was inhibited by 50%, and the −2,−10Gly mutant was also inhibited by greater than 50%, generating a lower mobility product (Fig. 4 B). The other notable difference compared with spinach MPP was that the −4Arg did not restore the processing efficiency of the −2,−10Gly (but did change the product to that similar to wild type AOX), and the −7Ser did not restore the processed product of the −2Gly to the same mobility as wild type AOX. This may be because of the fact that the −10 arginine can act as a processing signal with rat matrix but not with spinach MPP. From import experiments using both soybean and rat liver mitochondria, it was evident that changing any single positive residue at the −20, −30, or −35 position had some (≤25%) inhibitory effect (Fig. 6) similar to the level seen with changing the −2 or −10 arginines individually (Figs.3 or 4). Changing two positive residues inhibited import into both soybean and rat liver mitochondria, overall more so in the latter (Fig.6, Table I). For rat liver mitochondrial import, complete inhibition was seen with the −20,−30Gly mutant, and inhibition was almost complete with the −30,−35Gly mutant. This is much greater than the expected additive effect seen with the individual mutants. The double mutants did inhibit import into soybean mitochondria, but it was notable that import efficiency was twice as high compared with rat liver mitochondrial import (Fig. 6, Table I). The triple mutant completely abolished import with both sets of mitochondria. Processing by purified spinach MPP was significantly inhibited by each of the changes of the N-terminal positive residues. It would appear that the double mutant, which included the −20 position (i.e. −20,−30Gly, or −20,−35Gly), relieved this inhibition of processing to some extent compared with the single mutant (Fig. 4). The −30Gly mutant was not processed at all by spinach MPP, compared with 60% efficiency with the −20,−30Gly mutant. In contrast the −20, −30Gly mutant was processed at the least efficiency (along with the −10Gly) with rat liver matrix of all the mutants tested (Fig.4, Table I). The triple mutant −20,−30,−35Gly was processed by rat liver matrix and spinach MPP (Fig. 4, Table I), so the inhibition of spinach MPP seen with the single and double mutants was relieved by the triple mutant. This indicates that the inhibition of processing seen with spinach MPP by changing positive residues in this region of the presequence may have been a result of changes in the overall structure of the presequence rather than any of the positive residues playing a specific role in bi"
https://openalex.org/W1997286248,"To understand the mechanism underlying the regulation of the Ca2+-binding protein regucalcin gene expression, we characterized the 5′-flanking region of the rat regucalcin gene. The transcriptional start site of the rat regucalcin gene was determined by the cap site hunting method with rat liver cap site cDNA. The 5′-flanking region of the rat regucalcin gene ligated to a luciferase reporter gene possessed functional promoter activity in rat H4-II-E hepatoma cells. 3′- and 5′-deletion analyses indicated the sequence required for basal functional promoter activity of the rat regucalcin gene. The promoter activity of the rat regucalcin gene was enhanced by treatment with Bay K 8644, dibutyryl cAMP, phorbol esters, insulin, and dexamethasone. Using gel mobility shift assays, we found that nuclear proteins from H4-II-E cells specifically bind to the 5′-flanking region of the rat regucalcin gene. Moreover, gel mobility shift assays revealed that Bay K 8644, dibutyryl cAMP, phorbol esters, and insulin stimulated the binding of nuclear factors to the 5′-flanking region of the rat regucalcin gene in H4-II-E cells. These results suggest that Bay K 8644-, dibutyryl cAMP-, phorbol ester-, and insulin-inducible nuclear factors mediate the stimulatory effect of each regulator on promoter activity of the rat regucalcin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2019651649,"Neurogranin/RC3 (Ng), a postsynaptic neuronal protein kinase C (PKC) substrate, binds calmodulin (CaM) at low level of Ca2+. In vitro, rat brain Ng can be oxidized by nitric oxide (NO) donors and by oxidants to form an intramolecular disulfide bond with resulting downward mobility shift on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The oxidized Ng, as compared with the reduced form, is a poorer substrate of PKC but like the PKC-phosphorylated Ng has a lower affinity for CaM than the reduced form. To investigate the physiological relevance of Ng oxidation, we tested the effects of neurotransmitter,N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), NO donors, and other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and oxidized glutathione on the oxidation of this protein in rat brain slices. Western blot analysis showed that the NMDA-induced oxidation of Ng was rapid and transient, it reached maximum within 3–5 min and declined to base line in 30 min. The response was dose-dependent (EC50 ∼100 μm) and could be blocked by NMDA-receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and by NO synthase inhibitorN G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and N G-monomethyl-l-arginine. Ng was oxidized by NO donors, sodium nitroprusside,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, andS-nitrosoglutathione, and H2O2 at concentrations less than 0.5 mm. Oxidation of Ng in brain slices induced by sodium nitroprusside could be reversed by dithiothreitol, ascorbic acid, or reduced glutathione. Reversible oxidation and reduction of Ng were also observed in rat brain extracts, in which oxidation was enhanced by Ca2+ and the oxidized Ng could be reduced by NADPH or reduced glutathione. These results suggest that redox of Ng is involved in the NMDA-mediated signaling pathway and that there are enzymes catalyzing the oxidation and reduction of Ng in the brain. We speculate that the redox state of Ng, similar to the state of phosphorylation of this protein, may regulate the level of CaM, which in turn modulates the activities of CaM-dependent enzymes in the neurons.

Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 131-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ng resembles a presynaptic PKC substrate neuromodulin (Nm, also known as GAP-43, F1, or B-50) in its high affinity binding of calmodulin (CaM) at low levels of Ca2+ (for review, see Refs. 1Gerendasy D.D.

Phosphorylation of these two proteins by PKC weakens their binding affinities for CaM. In addition to the PKC-mediated regulation, both rat brain Ng and Nm are potential targets of nitric oxide (NO) and other oxidants (9Hess D.T. Patterson S.I. Smith D.S. Skene J.H.

The endogenously formed oxidants, such as reactive nitrogen (nitric oxide, NO) and oxygen (superoxide, O·̄2, and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2), and redox stress are thought to play important roles in both physiological and pathological responses (20Schreck R.

Some of these responses are due to a direct effect of these oxidants and others arise from the reaction of NO with superoxide (O·̄2) (26Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Protein thiols are critical sites of interaction with free radicals and their intermediates. Oxidation of thiol on a protein by H2O2 forms sulfenic acid (RS-OH), which in turn interacts with a free thiol group to form disulfide products (28Winterbourn C. Metodiewa D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and with NO to form S-nitrosothiol and subsequent disulfide formation (27Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Kim S.Y. Vodovotz Y.

S-Nitrosation and subsequent disulfide formation of proteins are important physiological processes involved in the regulation of blood pressure, host defense, and neurotransmission (30Schmidt H.H.H.W. Water U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). In this study we are attempting to answer the question if rat brain Ng in intact cells can be oxidized by the commonly recognized oxidants such as NO donors, hydrogen peroxide, and oxidized glutathione, and more importantly, if any physiological agent that is known to stimulate the production of oxidant will enhance the oxidation of this protein. Since oxidation of rat brain Ng results in a preferential formation of intramolecular disulfide bond and leads to an increase in the electrophoretic mobility upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE (10Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this unique feature serves as a convenient assay to monitor the oxidation of this protein by immunoblot analysis. Here, we demonstrate that rat brain Ng in the brain slices can be oxidized by several exogenously added oxidants. Furthermore, addition of neurotransmitter,N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), to the brain slices caused a transient oxidation of this protein, and these effects of NMDA can be blocked by its antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5), as well as by NO synthase inhibitor,N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA). Oxidation/reduction of Ng can also be shown in rat brain extracts, in which the oxidation of this protein is stimulated by Ca2+and the oxidized form can be reduced by NADPH. The following materials were obtained from the indicated sources: S-nitrosoglutathione (SNOG), (±)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), NMDA, NADPH,l-NAME,N G-nitro-d-arginine methyl ester (d-NAME), and l-NMMA from Calbiochem; H2O2 from Fisher; oxidized glutathione (GSSG), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), glutathione (GSH), AP5, and ascorbic acid from Sigma; dithiothreitol (DTT) from ICN; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG from Bio-Rad. Brain from adult Sprague-Dawley rat (200–250 g) was removed immediately after decapitation and placed in ice-cold pH 7.4 artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glucose, bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2) for 3–5 min. Cortical slices (400 μm thickness) were prepared using a Vibratome 1000 sectioning device with the brain submerged in ice-cold ACSF bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The slices were maintained in ACSF in a storage bath for 1–3 h at 30 °C to allow recovery from possible damage during slicing. Each slice was transferred to a 20 ml scintillation vial containing 1 ml of ACSF and various concentrations of NO donors, and other oxidants. Incubation was carried out at 30 °C in a shaking water bath under 95% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere. To determine the reversal of Ng oxidation, brain slices were washed three times with 1 ml of ACSF in 15 min and then further incubated with 1 ml of ACSF containing DTT, reduced glutathione, or ascorbic acid. Each slice was homogenized in the cell lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Extracted protein (60–80 μg) was analyzed for Ng oxidation by immunoblot analysis. Slices were kept at 30 °C in a storage bath containing ACSF for ∼3 h, and the solution was changed three times during storage. Ng in these slices was mostly in the reduced form (>90%). These cortical slices were incubated at 30 °C in 1 ml of ACSF for 3 min with increasing concentrations of NMDA from 100 to 500 μm for dose response or with 250 μm NMDA at the indicated times for the time course experiments. To examine the effects of NMDA antagonist, AP5, the slices were preincubated with 0–500 μm concentration of this compound for 10 min before the addition of 250 μm NMDA. To test the effects of NO synthase inhibitors, l-NAME andl-NMMA, on the NMDA-induced Ng oxidation, brain slices were incubated with 0–200 μm concentration of the inhibitors for 15 min, then 250 μm NMDA was added for 3 min. Adult rat brain, after removal of cerebellum and brain stem, was homogenized in 4 volumes (v/w) of ice-cold 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was either used directly after keeping on ice for 2 h or added EDTA and ascorbic acid immediately after centrifugation to final concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively. In the absence of EDTA and ascorbic acid, Ng in the brain extract is spontaneously oxidized. For testing the effects of Ca2+ and NADPH on the oxidation and reduction of Ng, the extract containing KPO4/EDTA/ascorbic acid was used and for testing the effect of reduced glutathione on the oxidized Ng, the extract containing KPO4 only was used. Conversion of the reduced Ng to the oxidized form was analyzed by applying the sample (containing 60–80 μg of protein/lane in SDS gel sample buffer without mercaptoethanol and tracking dye) to a 10–20% gradient SDS (0.1%) gel, which had been prerun at 40 mA/slab gel for 15 min. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot analysis was done using rabbit anti-rat brain Ng polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL reagent (5Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Chen H.-C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the conversion of the reduced Ng to the oxidized form was done by scanning the x-ray film and the data analyzed using the Fotodyne Gel-Pro Analyzer program. The extent of Ng oxidation was calculated by dividing the intensity of the oxidized form with the sum of the oxidized and reduced forms. To ensure that equal amount of protein from each sample was applied to the gel, the intensity of immunoreactive band corresponding to neuromodulin, which cross-reacts with our Ng polyclonal antibody (10Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was served as internal standard in the same blot. Data for multiple comparisons versus a control were analyzed with Bonferroni's t test and significance was accepted for p < 0.05. Ng expression in rat brain increases during development, and its level reaches maximum 2–3 weeks after birth (31Watson J.B. Battenberg E.F. Wong K.K. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 32Repressa A. Deloulme J.C. Sensenbrenner M. Ben-Ari Y. Baudier J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3782-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult rat brain slices were used to test the effect of NMDA on the oxidation of Ng. NMDA caused a dose-dependent oxidation of Ng in these slices (Fig. 1, panel A). Maximal response was seen at 250 μm and at a higher concentration, 500 μm, no further increase was seen. The EC50 was ∼100 μm. A 3–6-fold increase in oxidation of this protein was observed following exposure to 250 μm NMDA for 3 min. At this concentration, the NMDA-induced oxidation of Ng was transient, it reached a maximal level within 3–5 min and declined to base line after 30 min (Fig. 1,panel B). Pretreatment of brain slices with NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5, for 10 min blocked the NMDA-induced oxidation of Ng (Fig. 2). AP5 at concentrations over 250 μm completely blocked the enhanced oxidation of Ng by the same concentration of NMDA. Pretreatment of brain slices with NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the NMDA-induced oxidation of Ng (Fig. 3, panel A). The oxidation induced by 250 μm of NMDA was completely inhibited by 100 μm of l-NAME; the same concentration of the inactive enantiomer, d-NAME, was ineffective. Furthermore, the inhibition of the NMDA-induced oxidation of Ng by 100 μml-NAME could be blocked by over 500 μml-arginine. Since NO synthase also generates O·̄2, we tested the effect of another inhibitor l-NMMA, which inhibits NO but not O·̄2production (33Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-NMMA inhibited the NMDA-induced Ng oxidation dose-dependently (Fig. 3, panel B), suggesting that NO, rather than O·̄2, is the primary active species for Ng oxidation. These results demonstrate that the oxidation of Ng in the neurons is triggered by the transient production of NO following NMDA binding to its receptor.Figure 2Effect of preincubation with AP5 on the NMDA-mediated oxidation of Ng in the brain slices. Rat brain slices were incubated with ACSF under 95% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere and increasing concentrations of AP5 for 10 min before the addition of 250 μm NMDA. After additional 3 min of incubation, the slices were kept frozen at −70 °C and homogenized with lysis buffer. Proteins (80 μg) were separated by nonreducing 10–20% gradient SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the oxidized and reduced Ng detected by immunoblot. The extent of oxidation was quantified by densitometric scanning of the film. Each set of data represents the average ± S.E. of six separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Effect of NO synthase inhibitorl-NAME and l-NMMA on the NMDA-mediated oxidation of Ng in brain slices.

Incubation of brain slices with NO donors (SNP, SNAP, and SNOG), GSSG, and H2O2 all resulted in the oxidation of Ng (Fig. 4). Among these compounds, SNP, which contains a NO group with strong NO+ character (34Noack E. Murphy M. Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, London1991: 445-489Google Scholar), appeared to be the most potent; approximately 20–30% of Ng was converted to the oxidized form containing intramolecular disulfide bond in 30 min at 0.1 mm. The same concentration of the light-inactivated SNP was less effective than the freshly prepared SNP in oxidizing Ng. For example, at 0.1 mm, the freshly prepared SNP caused a 36% oxidation of Ng versus 5% for the light-inactivated SNP. The high potency of SNP in causing Ng oxidation was further demonstrated by an effective oxidation of this protein in the brain slices (up to 10–20%) even at 20 μm (data not shown). The S-nitrosothiols, SNAP and SNOG, which release NO in the presence of reduced sulfhydryl compounds to form mixed disulfide (35Singh S.P. Wishnok J.S. Keshive M. Deen W.M. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), were less potent than SNP. Significant oxidation of Ng was seen at a 0.5 mm concentration of these compounds. Previously, we showed that SNAP and SNOG, when tested in vitro at 5 mm, were ineffective in oxidizing Ng (10Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Mahoney C.W. Pak J.H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28798-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the potencies of these NO donors in oxidizing Ng in the brain slices are different from those seen in vitro using purified Ng. It seems that the effects of these compounds in the brain slices may be mediated by other unknown intermediate(s). At 0.1 mm, both H2O2 and the GSSG were ineffective in oxidizing Ng in the brain slices (Fig. 4). Oxidation of Ng by these two oxidants were seen at 0.5 mm. The effects of GSSG and H2O2 in the brain slices are apparently mediated by different mechanisms. H2O2 is freely diffusible through cell membrane, and it can oxidize Ng directly or indirectly after conversion to other reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radical OH⋅ (37Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Second Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar) and the superoxide anion, O·̄2, through a secondary effect (38Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSSG, on the other hand, is not permeable to the cell membrane and its oxidation potential is either transmitted through other intermediate(s) or by transport of the cystine moiety inside the cells following extracellular breakdown of GSSG (39Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SNP-mediated oxidation of Ng in the brain slices could be reversed by reductants. Incubation of the brain slices with 0.1 mm SNP for 30 min resulted in approximately 30–40% oxidation of Ng. Following washing of the slices with ACSF for 15 min and replacing the medium with fresh ACSF containing 1 mmDTT, ascorbic acid, or GSH for additional 30 min, the oxidized Ng was reduced (Fig. 5, lanes 4-6). Among these three reductants, DTT appears to be the most potent. This reductant is also very effective in reducing purified oxidized Ng in vitro. GSH may either function as antioxidant in the medium to promote Ng reduction inside the cell or by repletion of intracellular GSH through uptake of the breakdown products and intracellular resynthesis of GSH. Ascorbate cannot reduce the oxidized Ng in vitro, thus, it may function as an antioxidant, for instance to reduce thiyl radicals (40Wardman P. von Sonntag C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), produced by oxidation of Ng with NO that leads to the formation of disulfide. Replacement of the medium with ACSF without reductant did not cause a significant reversal (Fig. 5, lane 3); the extent of oxidation of Ng was comparable with that treated with 0.1 mm SNP during the entire 75 min of incubation (Fig. 5,lane 2). The Ng in the control slice incubated with ACSF alone showed only basal level of oxidation (Fig. 5, lane 1). Ng present in the rat brain extract prepared by homogenization in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was spontaneously oxidized when kept on ice for over 2 h (Fig.6, panel A, 0 min sample). Incubation of the extract with 3 mm GSH resulted in a time-dependent reduction of Ng. A near complete reduction of the oxidized Ng was seen after 30 min (Fig. 6,panel A). Ng in the brain extract prepared by homogenization in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and followed by the addition of 1 mm EDTA and 10 mmascorbic acid showed a partial oxidation. The partially oxidized Ng was used to demonstrate the interconversion between the oxidized and reduced forms by either the addition of Ca2+ or NADPH. In the presence of KPO4/EDTA/ascorbic acid, the ratio of the oxidized and reduced Ng remained nearly the same upon incubation at 30 °C for up to 30 min (Fig. 6, panel B). Addition of 1.1 mm CaCl2 to the extract containing 20 mm KPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm ascorbic acid resulted in a rapid oxidation of Ng (Fig. 6, panel C). Previously, we have shown that Ng in the brain extract is completely dissociated from CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (5Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Chen H.-C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the free Ng becomes susceptible to oxidation by an unknown mechanism, even in the presence of 10 mm ascorbic acid. Incubation of the partially oxidized Ng in 20 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm ascorbic acid with 2 mm NADPH resulted in a reduction of this protein (Fig. 6, panel D), suggesting the presence of a Ng reductase. NADPH alone is ineffective in reducing the purified oxidized Ng (data not shown). This study provides the first demonstration that rat brain Ng in intact cells is subjected to modification by oxidation and reduction. The redox of Ng in the neurons is likely a physiological event, since NMDA can induce a transient oxidation of this protein. Rat brain Ng has a high propensity to form a intramolecular disulfide bond, resulting in a downward mobility shift on nonreducing SDS-PAGE; oxidation of this protein in rat brain may conveniently serve as an indicator for the generation of oxidants in neurons. Based on our previous mutagenesis study (36Mahoney C.W. Pak J.H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28798-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we have predicted that Ng oxidation results in intramolecular disulfide bond formation between Cys-3, Cys-4, or Cys-9 and Cys-51. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis showed that there were two pairs of disulfide bond in the oxidized Ng (data not presented). The resulting oxidized Ng, with its N- and C-terminal ends brought together by the disulfide bond, becomes more compact than the reduced Ng. The calculated molecular weight of rat brain Ng is 7500, but it migrates as a M r 14,000–17,000 protein on SDS-PAGE depending on the conditions of electrophoresis. The oxidized Ng has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 10,000 on nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Oxidation of the purified Ng in vitro(10Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in rat brain slices as induced by neurotransmitter NMDA and by the various oxidants, and that seen in the crude rat brain extracts, all result in the formation of the apparent M r = 10,000 intramolecular disulfide form. It seems that formation of the intramolecular disulfide bonds of rat brain Ng is a kinetically favorable reaction. Free radicals and redox stress are thought to participate in cellular signaling (41Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Ng in the brain slices is oxidized by the addition of NMDA, NO donors, and several oxidants. The intramolecularly disulfide-bridged form of Ng has a lower affinity for CaM and becomes a poorer substrate of PKC than the reduced form (10Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both the phosphorylation and oxidation of Ng seem to have a similar consequence in reducing the affinity of this protein for CaM and thus render CaM available for many CaM-dependent enzymes, including CaM-dependent protein kinases, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclases, NO synthase, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase, calcium pumps, CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase, and cytoskeletal proteins. Thus, the various oxidants either generatedin situ, as in the case of NO from NMDA treatment, or present extracellularly may transduce their signals by oxidation of Ng and modulate the level of CaM. The phosphorylated Ng can be dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and by calcineurin (42Seki K. Chen H.-C. Huang K.-P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme(s) responsible for the reduction of the oxidized Ng has yet to be identified. Nonetheless, there seems to be an enzyme system in the brain that can efficiently reduced the oxidized Ng as demonstrated by the transient effect of NMDA and that seen in the crude rat brain extracts. In the rat brain slices, the oxidant-induced oxidation of Ng can also be reduced by exogenously added reductants, such as DTT, ascorbate, or GSH, suggesting that these reductants can influence the intracellular redox state in favor of the reduction of the oxidized Ng. Both DTT and GSH can reduce the oxidized Ng directly in the in vitroexperiments, however, ascorbate cannot. Similarly, in the crude rat brain extracts, DTT (data not presented) and GSH are effective in reducing the oxidized Ng but not the ascorbate. It seems that these reductants may either reduce the intracellularly oxidized Ng directly or serve as antioxidants and thus favor the reduction of Ng by other enzyme(s). In this respect, it is interesting to note that addition of NADPH to the crude rat brain extracts containing endogenously oxidized Ng causes a reduction of Ng, although NADPH itself is not effective in reducing the purified Ng. It appears that there is a Ng reductase in the neurons that utilizes NADPH as electron donor to reduce the oxidized Ng. The Ng thiol-disulfide redox resembles those of thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, both are small molecular weight proteins (8000–12,000) containing redox-active thiols (43Holmgren A. Holmgren A. Branden C.-I. Jornvall H.L. Sjoberg B.-M. Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Systems: Structure and Function. Raven Press, New York1986: 1-9Google Scholar). Ng does not exhibit any sequence homology to these proteins, including the short sequence regions containing redox active Cys residues. A major function of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin is to serve as a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (44Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In the case of thioredoxin, the reduced cofactor is regenerated by a specific NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (45O'Donnell M.E. Williams C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13795-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidized glutaredoxin is reduced directly by cellular GSH, and the resulting GSSG is, in turn, reduced by NADPH via the glutathione reductase (46Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of Ng oxidation is best illustrated by the NMDA-induced transient oxidation of Ng in rat brain slices, in which oxidation of Ng is inhibited by the receptor antagonist, AP5, as well as by the NO synthase inhibitors, l-NAME andl-NMMA. It has been shown that activation of NMDA receptors and the subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i stimulate NO synthase (47Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar, 48Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 49Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar), which generates both O·̄2 and NO (33Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since both l-NAME, which inhibits O·̄2 and NO production, and l-NMMA, which inhibits NO but not O·̄2 production, are effective in inhibiting the NMDA-induced oxidation of Ng, we infer that NO is the primary active species for the oxidation of Ng. Thus, Ng oxidation serves as a downstream target of the NO signaling pathway. Our results on the reversible oxidation/reduction of Ng further support the contention that the redox states of a protein may involve in the regulatory processes of NMDA. The transient nature of Ng oxidation following treatment with NMDA is indicative for the short burst of NO production after the administration of this neurotransmitter. Ng is a neuron-specific protein; its phosphorylation by PKC has been linked to the induction of LTP in rat hippocampal slices (11Ramakers G.M.J. De Graan P.N.E. Urban I.J.A. Kraay D. Tang T.

Oestreicher A.B. De Graan P.N.E. Reymann K.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The tetanus-induced LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors (50Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.J. McLennan H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) and an elevation of [Ca2+]i (51Lynch G. Larson J. Kelso S. Barrionuve G. Schottler F.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 817-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which result in the activation of PKCs and presumably stimulate phosphorylation of Ng located at the postsynaptic dendritic spine and shaft (53Watson J.B. Sutcliffe J.G. Fisher R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Ng was reported to be only at 60 min, but not at other time points tested (15, 30, and 120 min), after tetanus-induced LTP (11Ramakers G.M.J. De Graan P.N.E. Urban I.J.A. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of presynaptic PKC substrate, B-50/GAP-43/neuromodulin, reached maximum within 15–30 min (11Ramakers G.M.J. De Graan P.N.E. Urban I.J.A. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As the activation of NMDA receptors also stimulates NO synthase (47Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar, 48Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar) and causes oxidation of Ng, it is likely that Ng is oxidized during the early phase of tetanic stimulation that renders Ng a poor substrate of PKC (10Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the oxidized Ng functions similarly as the phosphorylated Ng in elevating the free CaM levels at the postsynaptic sites, where the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II is also located. The activation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II has been linked to the postsynaptic mechanism for the enhancement of synaptic transmission during LTP; thus, the oxidation of Ng may potentiate the stimulatory effect during the early phase of LTP."

The designer protein hyper-IL-6 (H-IL-6) fuses the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) through an intermediate linker with IL-6. The intracellular pathways that are triggered by H-IL-6 are not defined yet. Therefore, we studied the molecular mechanisms leading to H-IL-6-dependent gene activation. H-IL-6 stimulates haptoglobin mRNA expression in HepG2 cells, which is transcriptionally mediated as assessed by run-off experiments. The increase in haptoglobin gene transcription correlates with higher nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 and its DNA binding. As H-IL-6 stimulates STAT3-dependent gene transcription, we compared the molecular mechanism between IL-6 and H-IL-6. Transfection experiments were performed with a STAT3-dependent luciferase construct. The same amount of H-IL-6 stimulated luciferase activity faster, stronger, and for a longer period of time. Dose response experiments showed that a 10-fold lower dose of H-IL-6 stimulated STAT3-dependent gene transcription comparable with the higher amount of IL-6. Cotransfection with the gp80 and/or gp130 receptor revealed that the effect of H-IL-6 on STAT3-dependent gene transcription is restricted to the gp80/gp130 receptor ratio. High amounts of gp130 increased and high amounts of gp80 decreased the effect on H-IL-6-dependent gene transcription. To investigate the in vivo effect of H-IL-6 on gene transcription in the liver, H-IL-6 and IL-6 were injected into C3H mice. H-IL-6 was at least 10-fold more effective in stimulating the DNA binding and nuclear translocation of STAT3, which enhances haptoglobin mRNA and protein expression. Thus H-IL-6 stimulates STAT3-dependent gene transcription in liver cells in vitro and in vivo at least 10-fold more effectively than IL-6. Our results provide evidence that H-IL-6 is a promising designer protein for therapeutic intervention during different pathophysiological conditions also in humans.

Our results provide evidence that H-IL-6 is a promising designer protein for therapeutic intervention during different pathophysiological conditions also in humans. Cytokines are important to maintain several physiological and pathophysiological functions in vivo. Binding to a specific membrane receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways, which trigger a variety of intracellular events. IL-6 is a cytokine with pleiotropic functions in the immune system, hematopoietic cells, hepatocytes, and the nervous system. It belongs to a family consisting of IL-6, 1The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; H-IL-6, hyper IL-6; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino} ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; H-IL-6, hyper IL-6; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino} ethanesulfonic acid. CNTF, LIF, OSM, IL-11, and CT-1. All these family members interact with a ligand binding domain that confers specificity. The different ligand binding domains are all linked to the signal transducer gp130 (1Hirano T. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. Academic Press, London1994: 145-168Google Scholar, 2Mackiewicz A. Koj A. Sehgal P.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 762: 1-52PubMed Google Scholar). Three members of the Janus tyrosine kinase family, Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk, are constitutively associated with the intracellular domain of gp130 (3Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). IL-6 associates with the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R, gp80). Binding of IL-6 to its receptor induces homodimerization of gp130 resulting in autophosphorylation of the associated Jak kinases, which in turn phosphorylate gp130. Phosphorylation of gp130 creates docking sites for SH2 domains containing signaling molecules (5Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5012) Google Scholar). At least two signaling cascades have been characterized that either trigger STAT3 or mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (6Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fuijtani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 6: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (584) Google Scholar). After association with the gp130 receptor, STAT3 becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 705 through Jak kinases (7Sasse J. Hemmann U. Schwartz C. Schniertshauser U. Heesel B. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 results in homo- or heterodimerization of STAT3 and its nuclear translocation (8Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). In the nucleus STAT3 binds to target sequences in different promoters and enhances gene transcription (8Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). In pro-B cells, STAT3 is required for bcl-2 induction, and thus has an anti-apoptotic effect. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which also diverges at the intracellular domain of gp130, involves the activation of rasand is essential for cell cycle progression and induction of DNA synthesis (6Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fuijtani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 6: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, IL-6 induces the synthesis of acute phase plasma proteins, which play a protective role during the acute phase response (9Trautwein C. Böker K. Manns M.P. Gut. 1994; 35: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding sites for STAT3 are located in most of the promoters of the acute phase genes, and originally STAT3 was also called acute phase response factor (APRF) (10Wegenka U.M. Lütticken C. Buschmann J. Yuan J. Lottspeich F. Müller-Esterl W. Schindler C. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3186-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Besides the role of IL-6 in inducing the acute phase response, there is evidence that through IL-6, STAT3 is also activated during liver regeneration (11Cressmann D.E. Diamond R.H. Taub R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Niehof M. Rose-John S. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1854-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Additional, recent experiments in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 knockout mice show that IL-6 is essential to induce cell cycle progression during liver regeneration. In both mice there is a lack of DNA synthesis after hepatectomy that can be prevented by IL-6 injection (13Cressmann D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAnglis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 14Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Therefore, IL-6 and, thus, the activation of the intracellular-signaling cascades that diverge at the gp130 transducer molecule are essential to maintain and restore liver function during different conditions. Assembly of IL-6 with the IL-6 receptor and the gp130 molecule requires the association of three different molecules (15Taga T. Hibi M. Hirato Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 16Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The on-off rate on the cell membrane and the availability of each partner might be a rate-limiting step. A designer protein (H-IL-6), which fuses IL-6 to the soluble IL-6 receptor through an intermediate linker, might also be of therapeutic benefit in humans, for example during infection or liver injury (17Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P.G. Kallen K.-J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in studying the effect of H-IL-6 on gene transcription in vivo and in vitroin liver cells. We show that H-IL-6 is severalfold more potent in vivo and in vitro in activating STAT3-dependent gene transcription. The effect on gene transcription is dependent on the gp80/gp130 ratio on a given cell. Therefore, H-IL-6 could be of therapeutic benefit during different pathophysiological conditions also in vivo. Recombinant H-IL-6 was synthesized in yeast cells as described earlier (17Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P.G. Kallen K.-J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The H-IL-6 protein was purified from yeast supernatants by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purified H-IL-6 fraction was visualized by running on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. Human IL-6 was produced inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (18Van Dam M. Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Brakenhoff J. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15285-15290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 serum concentrations obtained from the liver vein were measured essentially as described previously (12Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Niehof M. Rose-John S. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1854-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). C3H mice were either stimulated with H-IL-6 or IL-6 intraperitoneally by the doses indicated. Tissue for Northern blot analysis or preparation of liver nuclear extracts was perfomed at different time points after injection. At each time point at least three animals were used in parallel. For preparation of nuclear extracts the pooled livers were rinsed in freezing phosphate-buffered sulfate, and liver nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (19Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All the steps were performed at 4 °C. Nuclear proteins were aliquoted and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection into HepG2 cells was performed as described previously (19Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The reporter construct used in these experiments represents the promoter of the α-macroglobulin gene linked to a luciferase reporter gene (20Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For H-IL-6 and IL-6 stimulation experiments, cells were cultured with 1% fetal calf serum for 24 h after transfection. Cotransfection of the reporter gene construct with the gp130 and IL-6 receptor expression vector was performed with the amounts indicated. Cells were stimulated with H-IL-6 or IL-6 in the amounts and for the time points indicated. Luciferase activity was measured as described earlier (21Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold, Germany). The relative luciferase activity was normalized by cotransfecting a Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression vector. The results, which are shown, represent the normalized luciferase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 hepatoma cells using the Dignam C method as described previously (22Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Liver nuclear proteins or 20 μg of serum were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (19Trautwein C. Rakemann T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in 1% SDS, 20% methanol, 400 mm glycine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 4 °C for 2 h at 200 mA. STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 was visualized using polyclonal antibodies supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and haptoglobin by using a polyclonal rabbit antibody supplied from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). For gel retardation assays, liver nuclear extracts were used as indicated. The binding reaction was performed for 20 min on ice (22Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For binding assays, an oligonucleotide spanning the STAT3 site in the α2-macroglobulin promoter was used as a 32P-labeled probe. The oligonucleotides (sense 5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTA-3′ and antisense 5′-GATCTAGGAATTCCCAGAAG-3′) were purchased from Naps (Göttingen, Germany). Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (22Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). “Supershift” experiments were performed with nuclear extracts prepared at the time points indicated. Complex formation for supershift experiments was performed with either an antibody directed against STAT3 purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or antibodies directed against STAT1, which were a generous gift from Thomas Decker (Vienna, Austria). Total RNA was isolated by the guanidium isothiocyanate method from the liver of the mice or from HepG2 cells at the time points indicated. Northern blot analysis was performed as described before, according to standard procedures (19Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total RNA was analyzed through a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, followed by transfer to Hybond N membranes (Amersham). The haptoglobin and GAPDH cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]ATP according to random priming (Boehringer Mannheim). The hybridization procedure was performed as described previously (19Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Run-off experiments were performed essentially as described before (12Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Niehof M. Rose-John S. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1854-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 5 × 107isolated nuclei were incubated in reaction buffer (5 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.15m KCl) containing 10 ml of 100 mm ATP, 10 ml of 100 mm CTP, 10 ml of 100 mm GTP, and 10 ml of 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP for 30 min at 30 °C. RNA was extracted, precipitated, and dissolved in TES buffer exactly as described. 2 μl of the labeled RNA was counted in a scintillation vial. For hybridization, 6 μg of cDNA was denatured and fixed on nylon membrane in a total dilution volume of 100 ml TES buffer. DNA was fixed for 1 h at 80 °C. Prehybridization was performed for 1 h, 65 °C in hybridization buffer (20 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 2× Denhardt's solution). Hybridization was performed by adding the RNA-equivalent of 2 × 106 counts/ml in hybridization buffer in a 5-ml polypropylene tube at 65 °C overnight. After extensive washing in 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS, a final RNase digestion (8 ml of 2× SSC and 8–10 mg/ml RNase A) was performed. For quantification, exposure was performed on a Fuji image plate. After subtraction of the vector control signal, counts of the haptoglobin signal were distributed through the GAPDH value and set to 1. The values at different time points after IL-6 or H-IL-6 treatment were shown as fold activation compared with the pretreatment level. Quantification of results was performed with a Fuji imager as described before (19Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several intracellular pathways are located downstream of the intracellular domain of the gp130 molecule (6Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fuijtani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 6: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We were interested in studying whether H-IL-6 can stimulate gene expression on a transcriptional level in liver cells. Therefore HepG2 cells were stimulated with H-IL-6, and the mRNA expression was studied after different time points. Northern blot analysis showed that after 10 ng/ml H-IL-6 haptoglobin mRNA expression was increased for up to 96 h (Fig. 1 A). Quantitative analysis was performed by comparing the haptoglobin signal with the GAPDH signal. These results showed that 1 h after H-IL-6 stimulation, haptoglobin mRNA expression was already more than 5-fold enhanced to the pretreatment level. The most prominent increase was found 15 h after stimulation exceeding the pretreatment level more than 120-fold (Fig. 1 B). In further experiments, run-off analysis was performed to demonstrate that the effect on haptoglobin mRNA expression is transcriptionally mediated. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, the transcription rate of the haptoglobin gene was already more than 16-fold enhanced 45 min after H-IL-6 stimulation. At later time points, the transcription rate of the haptoglobin gene decreased. However 15 h after stimulation, the transcription rate was still more than 6-fold higher compared with the pretreatment level. Thus these results showed that H-IL-6 stimulates haptoglobin mRNA expression via higher gene transcription. H-IL-6 induces higher transcription of the haptoglobin gene. The transcription rate of the haptoglobin gene during the acute phase response in the liver is controlled via STAT3, and therefore its nuclear expression was studied following H-IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 2 A). Higher STAT3 expression was immediately found after H-IL-6 stimulation, and the effect lasted for up to 9 h. Increased nuclear translocation of STAT3 was associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2 B). Before stimulation, no tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was detected in the nucleus and a clear increase in intensity of the STAT3 tyrosine-phosphorylated band was obvious 5 min after stimulation. Strong STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for up to 1 h after H-IL-6 stimulation. A weak signal, higher than the pretreatment level, was still detected for up to 12 h. H-IL-6 stimulation of HepG2 cells also increased the DNA-binding of STAT3 versus its cognate DNA. As shown in Fig. 2 Cby gel shift experiments, new complex formation was detected 5 min after stimulation and no DNA binding was detected again 6 h after treatment with H-IL-6. STAT3 binding to the cognate DNA was confirmed by supershift experiments (Fig. 2 D). The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that H-IL-6 triggers STAT3 translocation and haptoglobin gene transcription to maximal levels during the first hour after stimulation. However, because of the accumulation of haptoglobin mRNA levels, maximal haptoglobin mRNA expression was found only 15 h after stimulation. These results indicate that up to this time point the increase in haptoglobin mRNA levels is higher than its subsequent degradation. H-IL-6 stimulates nuclear STAT3 translocation, and this increase is associated with higher haptoglobin mRNA transcription. We performed further experiments to investigate whether H-IL-6 and IL-6 have comparable effects on STAT3-dependent gene transcription. Thus we transfected HepG2 cells with a STAT3-dependent reporter gene construct and stimulated the cells with 10 ng/ml of IL-6 or H-IL-6. Cells were harvested at different time points after stimulation (Fig.3 A). 1 h after stimulation the reporter activity in the cells activated with H-IL-6 was more than 10-fold higher compared with the pretreatment level and at least 2-fold higher compared with the level found in the IL-6-stimulated cells at the same time point. At all later time points H-IL-6 leads to at least 2-fold higher luciferase activity compared with the cells stimulated with IL-6. Because the half-life of the luciferase protein is around 3 h, the high luciferase activity found 24 and 48 h after H-IL-6 administration indicates that there is still an increased transcription rate after these intervals. Additionally, when the luciferase activity of the H-IL-6 treated cells was compared with those treated with IL-6, these results showed that at later time points the difference increased even more. Therefore, the absolute luciferase activity after H-IL-6 treatment at the different time points was set at 100%. The activity after IL-6 stimulation was expressed as percentage of the H-IL-6-treated cells at the same points. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the relative percentage of the luciferase activity of IL-6-treated cells decreased with time (51% after 4 h versus 38% after 48 h), which indicates that after H-IL-6 stimulation the effect on gene transcription was not only stronger but also more prolonged compared with the IL-6 treatment. In further experiments the dose-dependent effect of H-IL-6 on STAT3-dependent gene transcription was assessed. The cells were harvested 4 h after stimulation. As shown in Fig.3 C in the range between 0.1 and 10 ng, a 10-fold higher dose of IL-6 compared with H-IL-6 leads to similar effect on gene transcription. When 100 ng/ml of each protein were used there was no further increase in gene transcription compared with 10 ng/ml of IL-6 or H-IL-6. However the difference on gene transcription between IL-6 and H-IL-6 remained the same (Fig. 3 C). To further understand the mechanism that is responsible for the increased effect of H-IL-6 compared with IL-6 on gene transcription, we performed cotransfection experiments with either the gp130, gp80/IL-6R or both receptors (Fig. 4, A andB). First, the cells were treated with H-IL-6 when increasing amounts of the gp130 receptor was cotransfected with the STAT3-dependent reporter gene construct (Fig.4 A). These experiments revealed that by increasing the amount of gp130, the luciferase activity could be further stimulated. A 30% increase in luciferase activity was found when 1 μg of the gp130 plasmid was used. When the highest amount (4 μg) of the gp130 plasmid was cotransfected the maximal luciferase activity dropped again but was still 15% higher compared with the level when no gp130 was cotransfected. In contrast to the gp130 experiments, cotransfection of the gp-80/IL-6R construct with the STAT3-dependent reporter plasmid leads to a direct reduction of luciferase activity after H-IL-6 stimulation compared with the level when no gp80/IL-6R was added. When gp130 and gp80/IL-6R were cotransfected and stimulated with H-IL-6, low amounts of the plasmids led to a reduction in luciferase activity compared with the cells that were not transfected with both receptors. The same cotransfection experiments with the different receptor combinations were performed when the cells were stimulated with IL-6 (Fig. 4 B). Cotransfection of increasing amounts of the gp130 receptor with the STAT3-dependent reporter gene showed the following results compared with the initial activity when no receptor was added (control). 500 ng of gp130 receptor resulted in a 19% increase compared with control. In contrast, when 100, 1,000, or 4,000 ng were transfected, luciferase activity was −14%, −4%, and −28%, respectively. Cotransfection experiments of lower amounts (100, 500, and 1,000 ng) of the gp80/IL-6R plasmid led to an increase in luciferase activity that was maximal with 500 ng (+77%). However, when 4,000 ng of gp80/IL-6R were cotransfected, the activity of the STAT3-dependent reporter construct decreased again. A similar kinetic was found when both receptors were cotransfected. Low amounts of gp80 and gp130 increased, and high amounts decreased luciferase activity (Fig.4 B). The in vivo relevance of H-IL-6 was still unclear. As our results in cell culture experiments showed, mainly that gp130 is essential for the interaction with H-IL-6, additional cells may bind the molecule. Therefore it seemed possible that in vivo activation of STAT3-dependent gene transcription in liver cells might be less effective. 4 μg of H-IL-6 or 40 μg of IL-6 were injected intraperitoneally into C3H mice according to the in vitro results where H-IL-6 was 10-fold more active. At different time points after injection IL-6 serum levels were determined in the liver vein, and haptoglobin mRNA expression was measured in the liver. As shown in Fig. 5, A andB, haptoglobin mRNA increased to similar levels when 10-fold higher amounts of IL-6 were injected compared with H-IL-6. After normalization with the GAPDH signals, some of the time points (1, 6, and 12 h) determined after IL-6 stimulation were higher compared with the corresponding time points after H-IL-6 injection (Fig. 5 C). As H-IL-6 might have a different half-life in vivo compared with IL-6, the IL-6 serum concentration was measured in the liver vein (Fig. 6, A and B). The IL-6 serum concentration after H-IL-6 injection was more than 10-fold lower compared with the levels found after IL-6 administration 0.5 h after injection. At later time points, the difference between the H-IL-6- and IL-6-treated animals was even more dramatic. For example, after 3 h the IL-6 concentration in the H-IL-6-treated animals was more than 20-fold lower compared with the IL-6 treated mice. The haptoglobin protein expression in the serum of the mice was determined by Western blot analysis. Time and dose kinetic experiments were performed with 20 μg of serum. Four different doses of either IL-6 or H-IL-6 were used. As H-IL-6 was 10-fold more active in inducing haptoglobin mRNA expression, the dose kinetics were started with a 10-fold lower amount of H-IL-6 compared with IL-6. As shown in Fig.7, A and B, the mice were stimulated for 4 h with 0.04, 0.4, 4, or 40 μg of IL-6 and 0.004, 0.04, 0.4, or 4 μg of H-IL-6. These results showed that a 10-fold lower amount of H-IL-6 had a similar effect on haptoglobin serum expression as did the higher IL-6 concentration (see Fig. 7,A and B). The dose kinetic experiments indicated that H-IL-6 was 10-fold more active than IL-6, therefore time kinetic experiments were performed with either 40 μg of IL-6 or 4 μg of H-IL-6. Fig. 7, Cand D, shows that in vivo the 10-fold lower amount of H-IL-6 induced at least the same strength in haptoglobin expression in the time kinetic experiment as the higher amount of IL-6. Denistometric evaluation revealed that after 6 h, haptoglobin expression was nearly 2-fold after H-IL-6 compared with IL-6 stimulation. At later time points, the kinetic of 40 μg of IL-6 and 4 μg of H-IL-6 was not significantly different. Loading of the gels was checked by Coomassie staining (data not shown). Therefore, the experiments as shown in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 demonstrated thatin vivo H-IL-6 was at least"
https://openalex.org/W2049274272,"It has been previously demonstrated that the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) of clathrin-coated vesicles is reversibly inhibited by disulfide bond formation between conserved cysteine residues at the catalytic site on the A subunit (Feng, Y., and Forgac, M.

Proton transport and ATPase activity of the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase are now shown to be inhibited by the nitric oxide-generating reagent S-nitrosoglutathione (SNG). TheK 0.5 for inhibition by SNG following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C is 200–400 μm. As with disulfide bond formation at the catalytic site, inhibition by SNG is reversed upon treatment with 100 mm dithiothreitol and is partially protected in the presence of ATP. Also as with disulfide bond formation, treatment of the V-ATPase with SNG protects activity from subsequent inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, as demonstrated by restoration of activity by dithiothreitol following sequential treatment of the V-ATPase with SNG andN-ethylmaleimide. Moreover, inhibition by SNG is readily reversed by dithiothreitol but not by the reduced form of glutathione, suggesting that the disulfide bond formed at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase may not be immediately reduced under intracellular conditions. These results suggest that SNG inhibits the V-ATPase through disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues at the catalytic site and that nitric oxide (or nitrosothiols) might act as a negative regulator of V-ATPase activity in vivo.

Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the V-ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles can be reversibly inhibited by disulfide bond formation between two conserved cysteine residues (Cys-254 and Cys-532) located at the catalytic site on the 73-kDa A subunit (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we have presented evidence that at least 50% of the V-ATPase in native clathrin-coated vesicles exists in the reversibly inactivated, disulfide-bonded state (27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It had been reported that V-ATPase activity in rat renal tubules is sensitive to nitric oxide (28Tojo A. Guzman N.J. Gard L.C. Tisher C.C. Madsen K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar), but whether this effect was directly on the V-ATPase and the mechanism of inhibition is unknown. We now report that the nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione can directly and reversibly inhibit the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles and that the properties of this effect suggest that inhibition results from disulfide bond formation at the catalytic site of the enzyme. Calf brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Phospholipids were obtained as chloroform solutions from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Acridine orange was obtained from Molecular Probes. S-Nitrosoglutathione (SNG),N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), dithiothreitol (DTT), adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), valinomycin, and most other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Clathrin-coated vesicles were isolated from calf brain as described previously (20Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Following dissociation of the clathrin coat by treatment with 0.5m Tris (pH 7.0), the V-ATPase was solubilized with polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and purified by density gradient sedimentation on 15–30% glycerol gradients as described previously (20Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purified V-ATPase had a specific activity of 10–12 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein at 37 °C. Reconstitution of the purified V-ATPase into phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol was carried out by cholate dialysis as described previously (20Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase was measured using a coupled, spectrophotometric assay in solubilization buffer (50 mmNaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EGTA) containing 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.25 mg/ml NADH, 8 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactic dehydrogenase, 2 μmvalinomycin, and 2 μm carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone at 37 °C as described previously (20Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proton transport in clathrin-coated vesicles and reconstituted vesicles was measured by acridine orange fluorescence quenching using a Perkin Elmer LS-5 spectrofluorimeter in solubilization buffer (see above) containing 0.5 mm ATP, 1.0 mmMgSO4, and 2 μm acridine orange, as described previously (20Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The assay buffer for measurement of proton transport in reconstituted vesicles also contained 2 μm valinomycin to dissipate any membrane potential generated. Where indicated, coated vesicles (1 mg of protein/ml) or purified, reconstituted V-ATPase (6 μg of protein/ml) were treated with SNG or hydrogen peroxide in solubilization buffer at the concentrations shown for 30 min at 37 °C. Treatment with NEM (100 μm), DTT (5–100 mm), and the reduced form of glutathione (5–20 mm) were carried out in solubilization buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. It was previously observed (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that disulfide bond formation between Cys-254 and Cys-532 at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase A subunit results in reversible inactivation of both proton transport and ATPase activity. In addition, approximately 50% of the V-ATPase in native clathrin-coated vesicles exists in this disulfide-bonded state (27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) despite the fact that the A subunit is located on the cytoplasmic face of the V-ATPase complex (29Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Adachi I. Puopolo K. Marquez-Sterling N. Arai H. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 967-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that V-ATPase activity in vivo might be regulated by disulfide-bond formation (27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of this inhibitory disulfide bond by molecular oxygen in vitro required prolonged incubation times (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we were therefore interested in whether any naturally occurring oxidants could induce its formation. Fig.1 shows that proton transport in intact clathrin-coated vesicles is inactivated by incubation with either SNG (a nitric oxide-generating reagent) (31Jansen A. Drazen J. Osborne J.A. Brown R. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 154-160PubMed Google Scholar) or hydrogen peroxide. These results are consistent with previous reports that V-ATPase activity in renal tubules is sensitive to nitric oxide (28Tojo A. Guzman N.J. Gard L.C. Tisher C.C. Madsen K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar) and that V-ATPase activity in Neurospora (32Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and yeast (25Liu Q. Leng X.H. Newman P. Vasilyeva E. Kane P.M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11750-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. The studies in Neurospora in fact indicated that the V-ATPase is sensitive to a number of oxidizing agents, including nitrate (32Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, the results in Fig. 1demonstrate that the inactivation induced by SNG or hydrogen peroxide can be largely reversed by treatment with the reducing agent DTT, a property shared with the inhibitory disulfide bond formed between active site cysteine residues (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the experiments carried out in Fig. 1 measure proton transport in intact coated vesicles, it was possible that SNG might be exerting its inhibitory effect indirectly, for example, by inhibiting a chloride channel required for acidification. Such modulation of acidification in coated vesicles through alteration of chloride channel activity has in fact been demonstrated for protein kinase A-dependent changes in acidification (33Mulberg A.E. Tulk B.M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20590-20593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, because V-ATPase activity was previously measured in crude renal tubules of undefined integrity (28Tojo A. Guzman N.J. Gard L.C. Tisher C.C. Madsen K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar), the same explanation could apply to that study. To address this question, the effect of SNG on activity of the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase was tested. As shown in Fig. 2, SNG inhibits both proton transport and ATPase activity of the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase, with 50% inhibition observed following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 200–400 μm SNG. Moreover, in both cases, inhibition is reversed by subsequent incubation with DTT. 2Proton transport by the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase was also inhibited by the nitric oxide-generating reagent 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1), with 50% inhibition observed at 300–400 μm. Reversal of inhibition by DTT was less complete than with SNG, however, suggesting that secondary effects (besides disulfide-bond formation) may occur with this reagent. These results indicate that SNG is directly inhibiting the V-ATPase and that this inhibition is reversed by treatment with reducing agents. Because the reversibility by DTT is a property shared with the inhibitory disulfide bond formed between cysteine residues at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether inhibition of the V-ATPase by SNG could be protected in the presence of ATP, as shown for disulfide bond formation (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, partial protection from inhibition by SNG was observed in the presence of ATP, suggesting that SNG was inducing the formation of an inhibitory disulfide bond at a nucleotide protectable site. To further test the relationship between inhibition by SNG and the inhibitory disulfide bond formed at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase, we tested the ability of treatment with SNG to protect V-ATPase activity from inhibition by NEM. Previously shown, disulfide bond formation between Cys-254 and Cys-532 causes partial protection of V-ATPase activity from inhibition by NEM (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified, reconstituted V-ATPase was first incubated in the presence or absence of 2 mm SNG for 30 min at 37 °C followed by incubation in the presence or absence of 100 μm NEM for 30 min at 4 °C. Reconstituted vesicles were then directly assayed for proton transport or incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 100 mm DTT. Fig.4 shows that whereas reconstituted vesicles treated directly with NEM showed inhibition of proton transport that was not reversed by subsequent treatment with DTT (Fig.4, bars 5 and 7), pretreatment of vesicles with SNG caused a partial protection from the inhibitory effects of NEM, as indicated by the partial restoration of activity by subsequent treatment with DTT (Fig. 4, bars 6 and 8). These results suggest that SNG inhibits V-ATPase activity through disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues at the catalytic site, although they do not rule out the possibility that inhibition occurs byS-nitrosylation of the active site cysteine residue, a process that has been shown to occur in other proteins (34Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). If an inhibitory disulfide bond is formed at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase in vivo, why is it not immediately reduced at the high concentrations of reduced glutathione found in the cytoplasm of cells? One possibility is that this regulatory disulfide bond is protected from reduction by one or more accessory polypeptides that are lost during purification of the V-ATPase. Alternatively, this disulfide bond may not be readily reduced by glutathione. To test this, purified, reconstituted V-ATPase, which had been inactivated by treatment with 2 mm SNG, was subsequently incubated with various concentrations of a reducing agent. As shown in Fig.5, DTT was considerably more efficient at reversal of the inhibition induced by SNG than glutathione. This result suggests that once formed in vivo, the inhibitory disulfide bond formed at the catalytic site of the V-ATPase may not be rapidly reduced by cytosolic glutathione, but rather may be cleaved by an internal thio-disulfide exchange, as previously suggested (22Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What are the possible functions for nitric oxide inhibition of V-ATPase activity in vivo? Nitric oxide has been suggested to regulate proton flux across the apical membrane of intercalated cells in the kidney, which play an important role in acid base balance (28Tojo A. Guzman N.J. Gard L.C. Tisher C.C. Madsen K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide has also been shown to inhibit cytoplasmic pH regulation by V-ATPases in rat peritoneal macrophages (35Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Sudsbury R.A. Rotstein O.D. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although the observed similar effects of a cGMP analog suggest that at least part of this effect may be through the more conventional effects of nitric oxide on guanyl cyclase. It is possible that nitric oxide synthase associated with the plasma membrane may serve to keep plasma membrane-associated V-ATPases in an inactivated state, so they only become activated by reduction following internalization and delivery to endocytic compartments. In fact, some isoforms of nitric oxide synthase have been shown to localize to the plasma membrane (36Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, nitric oxide has been implicated as an important modulator of long term depression of synaptic transmission (37Shibuki K. Okada D. Nature. 1991; 349: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), and it is possible that inhibition of the V-ATPase in synaptic vesicles (which is required for neurotransmitter uptake into these organelles) may contribute to this effect. It should be noted that, because some effects of nitric oxide (such as stimulation of guanyl cyclase) can be observed at submicromolar concentrations of nitric oxide (34Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar, 37Shibuki K. Okada D. Nature. 1991; 349: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that nitric oxide levels ever reach concentrations necessary to globally inhibit V-ATPases. Rather, V-ATPases may be inhibited by locally high concentrations of nitric oxide or nitrosothiols generated by nearby nitric oxide synthases. Interestingly, it has been found that a mutation in the pathway for cysteine biosynthesis in yeast gives a phenotype characteristic of a V-ATPase knockout, and that this phenotype can be suppressed by a mutation in one of the A subunit cysteine residues participating in disulfide bond formation at the catalytic site (38Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28149-28157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This study suggests that V-ATPase activity may be sensitive to the oxidation state of the cell and supports the model that vacuolar acidification may be regulated by disulfide bond formation in vivo (27Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional work will be required, however, to elucidate the role that nitric oxide might play in controlling the oxidation state of the V-ATPase in the cell.

The yield of DNA strand exchange reactions driven by both Escherichia coli RecA protein and its human homolog HsRad51 protein was inversely related to the GC content of oligonucleotide substrates, but at any given GC composition, HsRad51 promoted less exchange than RecA. When 40% of bases were GC pairs, the rate constant for strand exchange by HsRad51 was unmeasurable, whereas the rate constants for homologous pairing were unaltered relative to more AT-rich DNA. The ability of HsRad51 to form joints in the absence of net strand exchange was confirmed by experiments in which heterologous blocks at both ends of linear duplex oligonucleotides produced joints that instantly dissociated upon deproteinization. These findings suggest that HsRad51 acting alone on human DNA in vivo is a pairing protein that cannot form extensive heteroduplex DNA.

These findings suggest that HsRad51 acting alone on human DNA in vivo is a pairing protein that cannot form extensive heteroduplex DNA. Human Rad51 protein (HsRad51) is a member of the universally distributed class of RecA proteins that play important roles in homologous recombination and recombinational repair (1Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, the RecA proteins play roles in recombination, post-replication repair, and the repair of double-strand breaks (2Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, members of this class play roles in meiotic recombination, double-strand break repair (3Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 4Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), and possibly immunoglobulin switch recombination (5Li M.-J. Peakman M.-C. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Ward D.C. Radding C.M. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10222-10227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the mouse, the requirement of Rad51 for embryonic survival (6Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 7Lim D. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) reveals a vital role that has not been found in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. RecA protein from Escherichia coli promotes a search for homology by a single strand of DNA, and initiates an exchange between that strand and homologous duplex DNA. To carry out those complicated interactions, RecA protein forms a helical nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA; and Rad51 from Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Homo sapiens form nucleoprotein filaments that resemble the one formed by RecA (8Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 9Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Once the nucleoprotein filament has been formed, RecA requires no cofactors other than ATP to promote a rapid search for homology and an extensive strand exchange. Yeast, frog, and human Rad51, as well as human Dmc1, a homolog that is specifically expressed in meiosis, are DNA-dependent ATPases that carry out homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions that resemble those catalyzed by RecA protein (10Sung P.

None of the eukaryotic enzymes appears to manifest the kinetic barrier to binding to duplex DNA (15Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in the case of RecA favors the loading of protein on single-stranded DNA; all hydrolyze ATP at a rate that is at least an order of magnitude lower than hydrolysis by RecA, and all promote recombination reactions much more slowly than RecA (10Sung P.

Observations on human Rad51 showed that both phases of the recombination reaction, homologous pairing and strand exchange, are markedly slower than the corresponding phases of the RecA reactions (13Gupta R.

The experiments reported here show that human Rad51 can catalyze homologous recognition and the formation of homologous joints in the absence of net strand exchange and suggest that the function of Rad51 itself is limited to recognition of homology and initiation of strand invasion. These studies may provide insights into the roles of other components of the recombination machinery in eukaryotes, the underlying mechanism of homologous recognition, and the regulation of recombination.

RecA was purified as described (30Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single-stranded oligonucleotides used in this study were designated as either (−)- or (+)-strand. For example, A16(−) is a single-stranded oligonucleotide while A16(+) is its complementary strand. In the experiments reported here the strand used to form Rad51 or RecA filaments was designated as the (−)-strand. Sequences of 83-mer oligonucleotides A16(−) (16% GC) and W16(−) (40% GC) have been described earlier (13Gupta R. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GC10(−) was derived from A16 and has a 10-base pair heterologous substitution at the 5′ end (GGGCGGGCGG) and a similar 10-base pair heterologous substitution at the 3′ end (GGCGGGCGGG). To minimize secondary structure, we used GCG software and required that each 83-mer have fewer than 10 successive intrastrand hydrogen bonds separated by less than 4 unpaired bases. Addition of a six-carbon primary amine linker, subsequent labeling of the linker with fluorescein and rhodamine, purification of labeled oligonucleotides, and preparation of duplexes were done as described earlier (29Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The (−)- and (+)-strands contained a linker at the 3′ and 5′ end, respectively. All DNA concentrations refer to moles of nucleotide residues, except for stoichiometric ratios for duplex DNA, which are expressed as moles of protein per mole of base pairs. The protein was purified from E. coli DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.) carrying plasmid pEG932 (13Gupta R. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). IPTG-induced cells (120 g) were lysed in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% sucrose, 1 mg of lysozyme/ml, 0.5 m KCl) followed by mild sonication. The lysate obtained on centrifugation was fractionated by addition of ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation. The precipitate, redissolved in buffer R51 (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol), was passed through Q-Sepharose (100 ml) pre-equilibrated with buffer R51. The column was washed, and bound proteins were fractionated by gradient elution with 50–800 mm KCl in buffer R51. Fractions containing HsRad51 were pooled, dialyzed, and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Gel HT, 100 ml) in buffer R51. HsRad51 protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 20–500 mm potassium phosphate in buffer R51. The dialyzate of fractions containing HsRad51 was loaded on a Mono-Q (HR10/10) column. A steep gradient of 50 mm to 1m KCl in buffer R51 eluted HsRad51 at approximately 350 mm KCl. Fractions containing HsRad51 were pooled, dialyzed, and passed through 10 ml of a native DNA cellulose column. HsRad51 protein eluted at approximately 300 mm KCl when a gradient elution of 50 mm to 1.2 m was used. Pure HsRad51 fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. A single band of approximately 38 kDa could be seen on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of concentrated HsRad51 (Fig. 1). Recombination reactions mediated by RecA or HsRad51 acting on oligonucleotide substrates were assayed by gel electrophoresis as described before (13Gupta R. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). HsRad51 or RecA (1.2 μm) was incubated with 3 μm single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide in 15 μl of reaction buffer R (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmDTT, 2 mm ATP, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin /ml, 1 mm MgCl2). After an incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, MgCl2 was increased to 30 mm, followed by the addition of homologous duplex DNA (2.5 μm) labeled at the 5′ end of the (−)-strand with [γ-32P]ATP. After an hour of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 3 μl of stop solution (final concentration of 0.5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol) and subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 16 V/cm for 1.5 h in TBE buffer. The gel was dried, and reaction products were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. Annealing was assayed as described (13Gupta R. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled (−)-strand oligonucleotides at 3 μm were incubated with 1.2 μm RecA or HsRad51 in reaction buffer R containing 1 mmMgCl2 for 5 min. Complementary (+)-strands were then added at 3 μm to the respective tubes and incubated further for 1 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of stop solution containing 30 μm unlabeled (−)-strand and electrophoresed through 12% polyacrylamide. Products were quantitated by use of a PhosphorImager. HsRad51 or RecA (1.2 μm) were preincubated with 3 μm5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotides in buffer R (total volume 15 μl), as mentioned above for 5 min at 37 °C. DNase I (final concentration of 0.15 units/μl) was then added and incubation was continued for 2 min. The reaction was ended by addition of stop solution containing 25 μg of yeast tRNA. DNA was then precipitated by addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and acid soluble radioactivity in the supernatants was measured. Reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin /ml, 6 mm MgCl2, 1.0 μCi of [3H]ATP, and 0.5 mm ATP. HsRad51 or RecA (1.3 μm) was incubated with 30 μmsingle-stranded oligonucleotides at 37 °C and the reaction was arrested at different time intervals by the addition of ATPase stop solution (final concentration of 1 mm ATP, 1 mmADP, 25 mm EDTA). Three μl of the reaction mixture was processed for detection of ATP hydrolysis by thin layer chromatography as described (30Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was expressed as moles of ATP hydrolyzed per mole of protein/min. Pairing or strand exchange were detected by two separate fluorometric assays as described before (13Gupta R. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For pairing, 1.2 μm HsRad51 or RecA was preincubated with 3 μm 3′ fluorescein-labeled (−)-strand in reaction buffer R (total volume 150 μl) at 37 °C for 5 min. MgCl2 was then increased to 30 mmfollowed by the addition of duplex that contained rhodamine at the 5′ end of the complementary (+)-strand. In the strand exchange reaction, the (−)-strand used to form filament was unlabeled, whereas the duplex had fluorescein at the 3′ end of the (−)-strand and rhodamine at the 5′ end of the (+)-strand. Quenching in fluorescein intensity in the pairing assay and enhancement in the strand exchange assay were monitored every 2 s at 520 nm upon excitation at 493 nm. Quantitation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) due to homologous pairing was done as described (13Gupta R. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To detect the FRET signal, the spectrum was taken from 502 to 620 nm upon excitation at 493 nm, before the addition of duplex and after the reaction is completed. Five different substrates with varying GC content were made to explore the effect of base composition on pairing and strand exchange by HsRad51 and RecA proteins: A16 (16% GC), C16 (25% GC), R16 (50% GC), W16 (40% GC), and G16 (71% GC). In the design of these oligonucleotides, we minimized secondary structure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded oligonucleotides by HsRad51 or RecA were paired with homologous duplex oligonucleotides for 1 h prior to assaying the yields of the reactions by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A). For both RecA and HsRad51 the yields were inversely related to GC content of the substrates (Fig. 2 A), but at any given GC content the yield of reactions mediated by Rad51 was lower than that by RecA. The parallel functions that fit the respective data on HsRad51 and RecA suggest that a common mechanism is responsible for the inverse effect of GC content on strand exchange; but the existence of parallel functions instead of a single function suggests that the effect of base composition is not exclusively attributable to secondary structure in the single-stranded DNA. In other words, there is a common effect of GC content, but each of the two proteins contributes to a quantitatively different outcome. Either of two general explanations might account for the common effect of GC content on the yields of reactions by HsRad51 and RecA. (a) Nucleoprotein filaments might form differently as a function of the GC content of single-stranded DNA. (b) By its stabilizing effect on duplex DNA, high GC content might affect the ability of HsRad51 and RecA to carry out any of the steps that are potentially involved in the conversion of parental homoduplex substrate into the product heteroduplex DNA, including, among others, the exchange of base pairs and the final displacement of one parental strand. We examined the effect of GC content on three different indices of interactions of HsRad51 and RecA with single-stranded DNA: ATP hydrolysis, protection of single-stranded DNA from digestion by DNase I, and annealing of complementary strands (Table I).Table IInteractions of HsRad51 and RecA with single-stranded DNA versus GC contentSubstrate DNAATP hydrolysis (k cat)DNase I protectionAnnealingHsRad51RecAHsRad51RecAHsRad51RecA% GCmol/mol/min%%160.93091957570400.83192949580710.91480828772Hydrolysis of ATP, protection from digestion by DNase I, and annealing of complementary strands, were all measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Hydrolysis of ATP, protection from digestion by DNase I, and annealing of complementary strands, were all measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the case of HsRad51, we could detect no difference in catalytic rate constants (turnover number) among a set of substrates with varying GC content. In the case of RecA protein, there was a reproducible decrease in k cat at the highest content of GC residues (Table I). We determined the amount of DNase I that was sufficient to convert the32P label present at the end of these 83-mer oligonucleotides into a form that is soluble in acid. HsRad51 or RecA were allowed to form filaments on these oligonucleotides (at a ratio of protein to nucleotide residues of 1:2.5) in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of DNase I, and incubation for 2 more minutes. As shown in Table I, both HsRad51 and RecA protected all three oligonucleotide substrates. There appeared to be some increased digestion of the substrate with the highest GC content, but there was no discernible trend that correlated with base composition. The assay for acid solubility of label at the end of an oligonucleotide should be sensitive because only a few cuts need to be made by DNase I to make the label acid-soluble. For annealing reactions, filaments formed on the three single-stranded oligonucleotides were paired with their respective32P-labeled complementary strands for 1 min, and annealed products were monitored by gel electrophoresis after deproteinization. For both Rad51 and RecA, the yields of the annealing reactions were similar at the varying GC compositions of the oligonucleotide substrates (Table I). In aggregate, these data do not reveal a systematic effect of GC content that is sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect of GC content shown in Fig. 2. The pairing and exchange activity of HsRad51 was checked at different concentrations of MgCl2 in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, with oligonucleotides A16 (16% GC) and G16 (71% GC) as substrates. We observed, as expected, a stimulatory effect of MgCl2 at low concentrations and an inhibitory effect at high concentrations (31Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Williams J.G.K. Osber L. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7565-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3). There was, however, a clear difference between the effect of Mg2+ concentration on GC-rich DNA versus AT-rich DNA. High concentrations of Mg2+ were more inhibitory to reactions with GC-rich DNA than AT-rich DNA. This observation is consistent with the interpretation that high GC content inhibits pairing and strand exchange either because it stabilizes secondary structure in single-stranded DNA or because it stabilizes the secondary structure of parental duplex DNA, either of which would be augmented further by high concentrations of Mg2+. One expects a thermodynamic effect of mismatched bases on the yield of products of pairing and strand exchange, reflecting the net gain or loss of Watson-Crick base pairs in the reaction. We designed experiments in which strand exchange promoted by HsRad51 resulted in either a net loss, a net gain, or no change in the number of base pairs. This was accomplished by varying the strand in which base substitutions were located. When substitutions were located in the single strand used to make filaments and these were reacted with perfectly paired duplex DNA (Table II, row 1), the product of strand exchange contained mismatched base pairs, which results in a net energetic loss. As expected, the yield of the reaction decreased as the number of mismatches increased (Table II, row 1). By contrast, when base substitutions were located in the (+)-strand of the duplex substrate and the latter was reacted with filament containing a (+)-strand that lacked substitutions, the reaction produced a net increase in Watson-Crick base pairs and the yield increased as the number of mismatches increased (Table II, row 2).Table IIEffect of destabilizing mismatches on isoenergetic strand exchanges catalyzed by HsRad51The variants of oligonucleotide W16 were constructed to have 0, 2, 6, or 7 evenly spaced mismatches in the strand designated by a thin line. In each case the strand used in the Rad51 filament, with (upper row) or without (middle and last row) mismatches, was the complement of the bottom strand shown in the diagrams. The strand exchange reaction was carried out and analyzed as described under “The Gel Assay for Pairing and Strand Exchange” (see “Experimental Procedures”). The filaments were formed on 3 μm single-stranded oligonucleotides and were reacted with 2.5 μm homologous duplexes. The first two rows are controls. The upper row shows the reaction in which mismatches were present in the filament strand, resulting in the conversion of a perfectly matched duplex substrate into mismatched heteroduplex.

https://openalex.org/W2335417572,"The growth suppressive properties of the tumor suppressor protein p53 are activated upon DNA damage. The activation of p53 is reflected in increased p53 levels which are, at least in part, the result of an extended half-life of the protein. Although this suggests that stabilization of p53 is an intrinsic feature of p53 activation, the mechanisms involved in p53 degradation and stabilization are poorly understood. Here we report on the identification of an internal deletion mutant of wild-type p53, termed Δ62–96, which can be stably expressed in various cell lines. This deletion mutant has a turnover rate similar to wild-type p53 and its stability is upregulated by treatment with UV light. In cell lines that express endogenous mutant or no p53, however, Δ62–96 appears to be stable, strongly indicating that these cell lines have lost the ability to degrade p53. Further characterization of Δ62–96 by mutational analyses defines sequence and structural requirements for p53 degradation and indicates that none of the known p53 phosphorylation sites is essential with respect to p53 stability regulation upon UV-irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2320474741,"Bcl-2, Bax and p53 gene products have been linked to programmed cell death pathways. p21WAF1 has been shown to mediate p53-induced cell cycle arrest and to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase activity. We have analysed the expression of these genes and apoptosis induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in several human breast cancer cell line. We found up-regulation of p21WAF1 and Bax expressions, however, the expressions of p53 and Bcl-2 genes remained unchanged in TPA-treated cells. Furthermore, DNA ladder formation and PARP cleavage were observed after treatment for 24 h, indicating apoptotic cell death. Flow cytometry with 7-amino actinomycin D staining showed that the number of apoptotic cells increased with longer treatment of TPA. From these results, we conclude that TPA is not only a tumor promoter, but also induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. TPA-induced apoptosis appears to be mediated through a p53-independent pathway, and the up-regulation of p21WAF1 and Bax may be the molecular mechanisms by which TPA induces apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2325610284,"The BKJ gene was originally identified based on its specific transcriptional activation in jun-transformed avian fibroblasts. We now show that BKJ is a direct transcriptional target of the AP-1 transcription factor components Jun and Fos. The complete structural organization of the quail BKJ gene was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis and transcriptional mapping. The gene contains three exons with the coding region confined to the third exon. A major mRNA species of 0.8 kb and a minor one of 1.3 kb are produced by variable usage of two transcriptional initiation sites. The BKJ promoter region contains two authentic AP-1 binding sites. By transactivation of reporter gene constructs and direct binding of Jun recombinant protein, the proximal AP-1 element was shown to be essential for BKJ promoter activation. Using polyclonal antiserum directed against recombinant BKJ protein, the activation of BKJ in jun-transformed avian fibroblasts was also demonstrated at the protein level. BKJ is a novel gene related to the avian β-keratin gene family whose members display highly specific expression patterns during embryogenesis and epidermal development. Activation of BKJ in fibroblasts by retroviral or deregulated cellular jun or fos alleles may contribute to cell transformation."

To discriminate between both possibilities, we analyzed repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers at single base resolution in yeast cells lackingRAD26, the homolog of the Cockayne syndrome B gene. Disrupting RAD26 affects nucleotide excision repair of transcribed DNA irrespective of the chromatin context, resulting in similar rates of removal for individual cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers throughout the transcribed strand. Notably, repair of transcribed sequences in between core nucleosomal regions is less efficient compared with nontranscribed DNA at these positions, pointing to a nucleotide excision repair impediment caused by blocked RNA polymerase.

Spivak G.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 2Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Studies in Escherichia coli have provided a frame of reference for such a mechanism by the identification of a molecular matchmaker that physically links RNAP transcription and nucleotide excision repair (NER). It was shown that the mfd encoded transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF) is able to release blocked RNAP and via interaction with UvrA stimulates efficient targeting of the E. coli NER machinery to the damaged template (3Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Consequently, cells lacking TRCF fail to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) preferentially from transcribed strands (4Selby C.P. Witkin E.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In human cells, a TCR-deficient phenotype has been associated with Cockayne syndrome (CS), whereas in yeast Rad26, the Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) homolog has been implicated in TCR (5Van Hoffen A.

Primarily based on the resemblance in the molecular defect and the limited sequence similarity between CSB/RAD26 andmfd, it has been proposed that the encoded proteins operate as the eukaryotic analogs of the TRCF either to disrupt or to modify the RNAPII-DNA interaction at the site of base damage and to recruit NER proteins providing a molecular basis for the enhanced repair rate of the transcribed strand. An alternative hypothesis that implicates CSB/Rad26 as an intrinsic component in the transcription machinery has been suggested to explain the phenotypic complexity of patients suffering from CS (7Vermeulen W. van Vuuren A.J. Chipoulet M. Schaeffer L. Appeldoorn E. Weeda G. Jaspers N.G. Priestley A. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Stefanini M. Mezzina M. Sarasin A. Bootsma D. Egly J.-M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cold.

Hypothetically, any protein required for efficient transcription by RNAPII, e.g. transcription-initiation or elongation factors, could instigate a TCR deficiency when mutated. In such a scenario, a failure to efficiently transcribe through a template molecule will automatically reduce or abrogate the damage-signaling function of RNAP simply because the complex does not encounter the damage within a certain time frame. Although not easily reconciled with the notion that both yeast and human can cope with the complete absence of Rad26/CSB, this hypothesis has recently gained impetus by the observations that CSB cells display a reduced level of transcription (8Balajee A.S. May A. Dianov G.L. Friedberg E.C. Bohr V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4306-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and that purified CSB enhances elongation by RNA polymerase in vitro(9Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based on the present biochemical and genetic data the question of whether Rad26/CSB is a bona fide repair factor or a general transcription efficiency factor is unanswered, especially because both scenarios predict a reduction in the rate of lesion removal from transcribed DNA when the encoding genes are mutated. However, we reasoned that the two scenarios can be distinguished by the characteristics of repair when analyzed at nucleotide resolution. If a TCR defect in rad26 cells results from impaired transcription, in other words from the absence of RNAPII-mediated damage detection, then lesions in the transcribed strand are repaired by the same mechanism that operates on lesions in the nontranscribed strand i.e. global genome repair (10Verhage R. Zeeman A.-M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.d. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because this mode of repair in the URA3 nontranscribed strand is highly influenced by the chromatin environment of the damage (11Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 5046-5056Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Tijsterman M. de Pril R. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), this should also be observed for repair of lesions in the transcribed strand in rad26 mutant cells. However, if a TCR defect results from a deficiency to act upon stalled RNAPII molecules at the site of base damage, the stalled polymerase will still be the substrate to act upon in subsequent steps of NER. Because uniform repair rates for individual damages in the transcribed strand in wild type cells indicates that RNA polymerase II-mediated damage recognition is not profoundly influenced by the sequence or chromatin context (12Tijsterman M. de Pril R. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8027-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), this model predicts that individual lesions will be equally affected by a Rad26 deficiency, and similar repair rates for differently positioned dinucleotides will be observed. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae NER proficient (RAD +) strain used for this study is W303-1B, genotype: MATα ho can1-100 ade2-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3-1, which was rendered URA3 by transformation of a linear polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the complete locus. Uracil prototrophs were checked by Sanger sequencing for proper recombination at its chromosomal position. Subsequently the rad26 disruption was introduced into this background by one-step gene replacement. Strains were kept on selective YNB (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 2% bacto agar) supplemented with the appropriate markers. Cells were grown in complete YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone, 2% glucose) at 28 °C under vigorous shaking. Cells diluted in chilled phosphate-buffered saline were irradiated with 254 nm UV light (Philips T U V 30W) at 70 J/m2, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in complete medium, and incubated for various times in the dark at 28 °C prior to DNA isolation. DNA samples (25 μg) were digested with appropriate endonucleases and, precipitated, and URA3 fragments were isolated and end-labeled as described previously (14Tijsterman M. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3499-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using fragment-specific oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request). CPDs were identified using T4endoV. DNA samples were divided in two equal parts. One was incubated with T4endoV, the other was mock treated. Samples were subjected to spin column chromatography and lyophilized to small volumes. Approximately equal amounts of cpms were loaded on 6% denaturing acrylamide gels alongside Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions to identify the CPD positions. After drying, autoradiograms were prepared from the gels. Multiple autoradiograms were obtained with different exposure times to allow signal determination within the linear range of Kodak X-OMAT™-AR scientific imaging films for each individual photoproduct. Autoradiograms were scanned (UMAX™, Astra 1200S) at 600 dpi and analyzed using Image master™ software (Pharmacia). Background levels were subtracted, and gel band intensities were corrected for loading variations. OD values were plotted against repair time for lesions that gave sufficient signal to background ratios. Repair half-times ( t12), defined as the time at which 50% of the initial damage (signal att = 0) was removed, were derived from these plots. We first analyzed whether the absence of Rad26 had any effect on the removal of DNA damage from the nontranscribed strand of the yeastURA3 locus. Fig. 1 Ashows an example of repair analysis of UV-induced CPDs performed on theURA3 nontranscribed strand in rad26 mutant cells. Slow repair coincides with the internal protected region of positioned nucleosomes, whereas lesions in linker DNA or at the boundaries of the nucleosome are removed more efficiently. For example, lesions induced at sequences occupied by the core of nucleosome U2 (exemplified by thearrows in Fig. 1 A) persist even after 2 h of repair, whereas most flanking sequences are repaired after 80 min. When the kinetics of individual dimer sites were determined from multiple independent repair experiments, no significant difference was detected between repair of the nontranscribed strand inRAD + versus rad26 cells (Table I). This indicates that (i) nontranscribed DNA is repaired independent of Rad26, in line with previously published data (6Van Gool A. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C.

The values shown are the average of two independent experiments for each genetic background. Open table in a new tab Quantitative measurement of CPD repair rates along parts of theURA3 nontranscribed (nucleotides +100 to +240 and +430 to +550 relative to the start codon ATG, designated +1) in repair proficient (RAD+) versus rad26Δ mutant cells irradiated with 70 J/m2 UV light. Repair half/time values, defined as the time at which 50% of the initial CPD signal was removed, were calculated for individual CPD positions. The values shown are the average of two independent experiments for each genetic background. We then monitored repair of CPDs in the URA3 transcribed strand. Fig. 1 B shows, as expected, that the rate at which CPDs are removed from the transcribed strand is severely affected whenRAD26 is disrupted. Whereas CPDs are removed with a t12 of approximately 8 min inRAD + cells, the t12 inrad26 cells increases to 52 min, when individual dimer sites are averaged. However, in contrast to repair of the nontranscribed strand where lesions only at core nucleosomal regions persist after 120 min, here, all dimer sites are still visible after 120 min of repair. To allow a visual comparison between the repair patterns of the nontranscribed and the transcribed strands in rad26 cells, we determined the repair kinetics along both strand over an approximately 550-base pair DNA region, occupied by nucleosomes U2–U4 (15Tanaka S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and plotted the repair half-times above the corresponding dinucleotide sequence (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to the high level of repair heterogeneity on the nontranscribed strand, repair of individual dimer sites in the transcribed strand is markedly more homogeneous and not influenced by the chromatin environment of the damaged DNA and in this respect resembles repair in NER proficient cells. This indicates that the transcribing polymerase, also in the absence of Rad26, is capable of suppressing the inhibitory effect of chromatin at the core regions of positioned nucleosomes and thus favors an explanation in which RNAP II transcription proceeds normally and is blocked when it encounters a CPD in the transcribed strand, irrespective of the exact position of the lesion. As this blocked transcription complex constitutes an equal obstacle for each individual dimer site in subsequent steps of NER, similar repair kinetics for individual lesions will result. Importantly, Fig. 1 C also demonstrates that at certain positions in the transcribed strand, for instance nucleotides −50 to −10, 220 to 250, and 540 to 570, CPDs are removed significantly slower than at neighboring sequences in the opposite, nontranscribed strand. The observation that CPDs positioned in between core nucleosomal regions, where global genome repair can operate efficiently, are removed faster from the nontranscribed strand as compared with the transcribed strand indicates that NER at these in principle more accessible sequences is obstructed in the transcribed strand. Our in vivo data strongly suggest that Rad26 is required for the efficient processing of NER blocking transcription complexes. Whether this feature resides in the Rad26 protein itself or in additional factors that are required/recruited remains elusive. Purified CSB, the human homolog of Rad26, on its own was not able to dissociate stalled RNAPII in a defined in vitro system (19Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, Rad26 and CSB contain DNA-dependent ATPase activity (16Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and belong to the Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases. The notion that some members of this gene family are implicated in remodelling specific DNA-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 18Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) supports a function of Rad26/CSB in modifying DNA/RNAPII contacts at the site of transcriptional arrest. In such a scenario, alternative routes to destabilize (or displace) RNA pol II might compensate for the loss of CSB/Rad26 in TCR. Previously, we have reported that efficient removal of CPDs from a small but distinct region immediately downstream of transcription initiation does not depend on Rad26, because these lesions are repaired strand-specifically in rad26 mutants (13Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8027-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made for human CSB and more recently CSA cells (20Tu Y. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Tu Y. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), demonstrating that Rad26/CSB is required for efficient TCR only during the elongating stages of RNAPII transcription. In the light of the results presented here, these data could indicate that Rad26/CSB is not essential for the alleviation of NER inhibition due to stalled RNAPII complexes prior to the point where the transition from transcription-initiation to competent transcription-elongation occurs. The question of whether this is a direct result of the presence of TFIIH in the transcription machinery during the first steps of nascent mRNA synthesis (as discussed in Ref. 13Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8027-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or alternatively results from a less stable RNAPII-damaged DNA complex when the polymerase is still in its initiation mode is unanswered at present time and probably awaits the development of an in vitro TCR system that has not been established yet with eukaryotic factors. Finally, one can envisage that the processing of stalled RNAPII complexes is not confined to NER substrates but can also extend to base excision repair substrates and even to naturally occurring pause sites. The observation that some forms of oxidative damage (which are generally not repaired by NER but by base excision repair) are not repaired strand specifically in CS cells (22Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) indicates that the function of CS extends to a broader substrate range that might ultimately be just a stalled RNA polymerase, irrespective the cause of stalling. Consequently, a subtle transcription-elongation defect could result when Rad26 in yeast or CSB in humans is mutated. Maybe more important than the inefficient removal of lesions from transcribed DNA, a failure to recover trapped RNA polymerase II complexes as suggested by our in vivo repair analysis might contribute to the complex clinical phenotypes observed in Cockayne syndrome (7Vermeulen W. van Vuuren A.J.

FEN-1 has specific endonuclease activity for repairing nicked double-stranded DNA substrates that have the 5′-end of the nick expanded into a single-stranded tail, and it is involved in processing Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Magnesium is a cofactor required for nuclease activity. We used small-angle x-ray scattering to obtain global structural information pertinent to nuclease activity from FEN-1, the D181A mutant, the wild-type FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex, and the D181A·34-mer DNA flap complex. The D181A mutant, which has Asp-181 replaced by Ala, selectively binds to the flap structure, but has lost its cleaving activity. Asp-181 is thought to be involved in Mg2+binding at the active site (Shen, B., Nolan, J. P., Sklar, L. A., and Park, M. S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9173–9176). Our data indicate that FEN-1 and the D181A mutant each have a radius of gyration of ∼26 Å, and the effect of Mg2+ on the scattering from the proteins alone is insignificant. The 34-mer DNA fragment was constructed such that it readily forms a 5′-flap structure. The formation of the flap conformation of the DNA substrate was evident by both the extrapolatedI o scattering and radius of gyration and was supported by NMR spectrum and nuclease assays. In the absence of magnesium, the FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex has anR g value of ∼34 Å, whereas the D181A·34-mer DNA flap complex self-associates, suggesting that a significant protein conformational change occurs by addition of the flap DNA substrate and that Asp-181 is crucial for proper binding of the protein to the DNA substrate.

The importance of the DNA metabolic reactions, involving the structure-specific nucleases, is best illustrated by the human genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (11Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and identical to the activity in RNA primer removal that is necessary for in vitro mammalian DNA replication. In its endonuclease role, FEN-1 recognizes the phosphodiester backbone of a 5′-flap single strand and tracks down this arm to the cleavage site, the junction where the two strands of duplex DNA adjoin a single-stranded arm (1Murante R.S.

FEN-1 does not cleave bubble substrates, single-stranded 3′-flaps, heterologous loops, or Holliday junctions, but acting as an exonuclease, FEN-1 will hydrolyze double-stranded DNA substrates containing a gap or 3′-overhang. FEN-1 endonuclease activity is independent of 5′-flap length, and endonuclease and exonuclease activities cleave both DNA and RNA without the need for accessory proteins (19Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A.

The biological significance of the FEN-1 gene (RAD27 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and rad2 inSchizosaccharomyces pombe) is emphasized by genetic analysis in yeast. The yeast FEN-1 mutants display severely impaired phenotypes such as UV sensitivity, deficient chromosome segregation, conditional lethality, and accumulation in S phase (15Murray J.M. Tavassoli M.

The yeastrad27 null mutant is a strong mutator, and the majority of mutations found are duplications. This is probably because unexcised flap strands in Okazaki fragments displaced by upstream DNA polymerization are subsequently annealed to the downstream complementary sequence. This part of the sequence will be duplicated in the next generation of DNA replication (30Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). FEN-1 activity requires afree 5′-end of the flap DNA strand. For instance, secondary structure formation of the single-stranded DNA into a hairpin structure is known to prevent the enzyme's function (31Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). At risk motif sequences such as trinucleotide repeats have a higher probability to form these structures. Indeed, the same FEN-1 null mutant displays length-dependent CTG tract destabilization and a marked increase in expansion frequency (32Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 33Schweitzer J.K. Livingston D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, FEN-1 is a key enzyme for maintaining genome integrity, and mutations in FEN-1 may give rise to a number of genetic diseases such as myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, several ataxias, fragile X syndrome, and cancer (30Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 32Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). As the role of FEN-1 in DNA replication and repair is becoming more clear, it is important to structurally characterize this enzyme to better understand how it functions either as an exo- or endonuclease. To examine the structure-function relationship of FEN-1 in its nuclease capacity, we have studied the effect of magnesium on its conformation in aqueous solution, as observed by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Experiments were also done with a D181A mutant of FEN-1, which still selectively binds to the 5′-flap DNA structure, but has lost its catalytic ability (34Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (and references therein): 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3332-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We show that no measurable structural change was evident in either FEN-1 or the D181A mutant due to the presence of Mg2+. A DNA fragment was constructed so that it readily adopts a 5′-flap conformation. When measurements of FEN-1 and the D181A mutant were performed in the presence of the 34-mer DNA flap fragment, the FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex was seen to be more compact than the D181A·34-mer DNA flap complex, which indicates that the wild-type FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex is in a cleavage-ready conformation. A time course scattering measurement showed that magnesium was able to activate the cleavage of the FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex, and the protein was found to completely release the remaining single- and double-stranded portions of the DNA products. Protein expression and purification were essentially carried out according to Nolan et al. (36Nolan J.P. Shen B. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After FEN-1 was eluted from the column using elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5m NaCl, and 300 mm histidine), it was further dialyzed in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and then concentrated in a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). Final protein concentrations used were ∼6 mg/ml in the SAXS study for both the wild-type and D181A mutant proteins, in which 10 mmMg2+ was either present or absent. Wild-type and D181A mutant protein concentrations were ∼4.7 mg/ml for the protein·DNA flap complex studies, and the protein and DNA had a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Final concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin γ-globulin as a standard. Binding of the two proteins to the flap DNA substrate was confirmed by gel shift assay after labeling the 5′-end of the substrate with 32P. The purity of the concentrated protein samples was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gave single bands as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. The flap endonuclease activity of the proteins was assayed via a flow cytometry-based nuclease assay system (36Nolan J.P. Shen B. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) before and after each SAXS measurement. Activity was also observed by time-resolved SAXS measurements by activating the endonuclease with Mg2+ in the presence of the flap DNA substrate. An oligonucleotide (5′-CCCCCCATGCTACGTTTTCGTATACGTTTTCGTA-3′) was synthesized by the solid-phase phosphoramidite method using an Applied Biosystems synthesizer. The oligonucleotide was designed to form a 5′-flap substrate, which contains two Watson-Crick duplex arms folded by TTTT loops (37Blommers M.J.J. Haasnoot C.A.G. Hilbers C.W. van Boom J.H. van der Marel G.A. NATO Adv. Sci. Inst. Ser. Ser. E Appl. Sci. 1987; 133: 78-91Google Scholar) and a 10-base-long 5′-flap single strand (see Fig.1 b). It was purified by eluting the material through a POROS R2/H reverse-phase chromatography column, followed by eluting through a POROS HQ/M anion-exchange chromatography column if necessary, equipped with a Bio-Cad Workstation 700E (PerSeptive Biosystems). The purity was analyzed using a Tris borate/EDTA-urea gel (Novex) and found to be >98% pure. NMR spectroscopic analysis was used to establish the formation of the flap structure as shown in Fig. 1 b. Electrophoretic mobility shift and flap endonuclease assays were used to determine the suitability of the newly designed substrate for structural analysis. SAXS data were reduced as described elsewhere (38Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 39Blechner S.L. Olah G.A. Strynadka N.C.J.

For elastic scattering processes, Q is equal to 4πsinθ/λ, where θ is half the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident and scattered x-rays. Guinier (40Guinier A. Ann. Rev. Physiol. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar) and the indirect Fourier transform (41Moore P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar) analyses were used to calculate R g, forward scatter (I o), and the vector distribution function (P(r)). Aggregation was ascertained fromI o, which was expected to be proportional to the molecular mass (39Blechner S.L. Olah G.A. Strynadka N.C.J. Hodges R.S. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11326-11334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lysozyme was used as a standard for scalingI o with the implicit assumption that lysozyme has the same mean scattering density as FEN-1 and the D181A mutant. Interparticle interference contribution to the scattering at the concentrations used was assumed to be negligible since preliminary measurements from the samples at concentrations between 0.5 and 6 mg/ml scaled linearly and gave the same R g values.P(r) is the frequency of all interatomic vectors within the scattering particle weighted by the product of their scattering powers. The zeroth and second moments ofP(r) are equal to I o andR g, respectively, and the maximum linear dimension of the scattering particle (d max) was determined from the corresponding value at which the P(r) function goes to zero. SAXS measurements were done using the instrument described elsewhere (38Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The instrument configuration used nickel-filtered 1.542 x-rays produced from a 1.5-kilowatt sealed tube copper target source and was line-focused by a single mirror giving a full width at a half-maximum of 0.74 mm and a full height of 26 mm as measured at the detector. A 4-inch-long position-sensitive linear detector (TEC Model 210Q) was placed 64 cm from the sample. Measurements spanned a Q range of 0.015–0.27 Å−1. The net scattering from the samples was calculated by subtracting a normalized buffer spectrum measured in the same sample cell. Time course SAXS measurements, whereby data were recorded for 30 min at subsequent intervals, was used to track endonuclease activation after addition of magnesium to protein/DNA substrate samples. Typically, measurements at these protein concentrations require ∼6 h for sufficient statistics; however, 30-min scans were good enough for observing changes inI o. SAXS from at least two separate sample preparations were measured for all measurements. Measurements were made at 10 °C. P(r) analysis of the data collected included a deconvolution of the slit geometric contribution to the scattering. Omission of this correction results in a systematic ∼0.3-Å smallerR g for FEN-1, well within the statistics of the data measured in this report (0.5–1.0 Å; 1 S.D.). Guinier analysis of the data collected was not deconvoluted for instrument geometry. Magnesium is an essential cofactor for many enzymes involved in DNA metabolism such as DNA polymerases, nucleases, and ligases. This divalent metal, commonly ligated by acidic amino acid residues in nucleases, attacks water molecules to produce a nucleophile that can break phosphodiester bonds (34Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (and references therein): 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Chelating of the metal ions out of human FEN-1 can inactivate the enzyme completely. It has been hypothesized that activation of the enzyme by adding Mg2+to the reaction requires conformational changes in the enzyme before it can cleave the DNA substrate (36Nolan J.P. Shen B. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed small-angle x-ray scattering from wild-type FEN-1, the D181A mutant, and their complex with DNA substrate to determine their global structure and possible conformational changes upon addition of the Mg2+ cofactor. To perform SAXS experiments, it was necessary to develop an experimental approach to produce a large quantity of flap DNA substrate. Unfortunately, the conventional approach, which utilizes annealing of three independent oligonucleotides, was inadequate for this purpose due to its low yield. To overcome this problem, we designed a single oligonucleotide that has a high propensity to form the flap DNA structure, as shown in Fig.1 b (see “Experimental Procedures”). We used NMR spectroscopy and gel mobility shift and flap endonuclease assays to determine that the newly designed oligonucleotide forms a predicted flap DNA substrate. NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of a double-stranded region registered by A=T and G≡C base pairs and showed the presence of a TTTT loop, and wild-type FEN-1 was able to bind to DNA and yielded a correct cleavage product with an expected size of the released flap strand (10 bases) (data not shown). Based upon all of these results, we concluded that the new flap DNA substrate could be used for our further study described. Fig. 2 shows Guinier plots calculated for FEN-1 and the D181A mutant as well as for FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap and D181A·34-mer DNA flap complexes. Each sample gives a Guinier region that can be fit with a straight line with reduced χ2below 1 (Table I). Molecular masses calculated for the protein samples from I o and using the lysozyme standard were within 10% of the expected value of 43,416 Da. In addition, there was no significant upturn at low Q in the scattering profiles, except for the D181A·34-mer DNA flap complex. The D181A·34-mer DNA flap complex sample had the same concentration as the FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex and gave an extrapolated I o value consistently ∼10% larger than that found for the FEN-1·34-mer DNA flap complex. This increase in I o indicates slight aggregation of the D181A·34-mer DNA flap complex samples. The R g andd max parameters in Table I were calculated from combinations of two to four scattering measurements using different sample preparations. Guinier plots of log(I·Q)versus Q 2 showed a linearQ region (0.03–0.08 Å−1) with a negative slope, from which the radius of gyration of cross-section (R c) could be calculated. A linear region in such a plot suggests that the proteins have an elongated shape, at least in one dimension. The R c values are also tabulated in Table I.Table IX-ray scattering data from FEN-1 and D181ASampleConcGuinier analysisP(r) analysisR gR cR gd maxmg/mlÅÅFEN-1−Mg2+5.826.4 ± 0.412.7 ± 0.726.8 ± 0.782+Mg2+5.926.6 ± 0.912.6 ± 0.926.2 ± 0.484D181−Mg2+626.4 ± 0.512.9 ± 1.026.1 ± 0.586+Mg2+625.9 ± 0.612.5 ± 0.726.1 ± 0.78834-mer DNA−Mg2+220.4 ± 0.510.1 ± 2.020.2 ± 0.460+Mg2+221.8 ± 0.69.3 ± 2.021.4 ± 0.370FEN-1 · DNA (1:1), −Mg2+4.734.4 ± 0.913.1 ± 0.434.4 ± 0.7104D181A · DNA (1:1), −Mg2+4.740.6 ± 0.913.9 ± 0.943.9 ± 0.8138R g and R c were calculated from the scattering data using Guinier analysis. R g andd max were calculated usingP(r) analysis. FEN-1 and the D181A mutant alone give approximately the same R g,R c, and d max values in both the absence and presence of Mg2+, suggesting that Mg2+either induces no conformational change or induces a localized or global conformational change that is not measurable within the precision of these measurements. The 34-mer DNA in the presence of Mg2+ aggregates as shown by a 16.6% increase inI p, therefore, the larger R g andd max values observed relative to the case without Mg2+ are not necessarily attributable only to a Mg2+-induced conformational change in the DNA substrate. The D181A · 34-mer DNA flap complex has a consistently ∼10% larger I o relative to the FEN-1 · 34-mer DNA flap complex, suggesting that slight aggregation occurs in the mutant · DNA substrate complex. Thus, the scattering data show that the D181A mutant possibly binds and interacts differently with the DNA fragment compared with wild-type FEN-1. Open table in a new tab R g and R c were calculated from the scattering data using Guinier analysis. R g andd max were calculated usingP(r) analysis. FEN-1 and the D181A mutant alone give approximately the same R g,R c, and d max values in both the absence and presence of Mg2+, suggesting that Mg2+either induces no conformational change or induces a localized or global conformational change that is not measurable within the precision of these measurements.

Thus, the scattering data show that the D181A mutant possibly binds and interacts differently with the DNA fragment compared with wild-type FEN-1. Fig. 3 shows the R gvalues calculated from the P(r) analysis of the individual measurements for the proteins alone in the presence and absence of magnesium. Also, a comparison of theP(r) functions is given in Fig.4. The P(r) functions have a single peak at ∼27 Å and are fairly symmetric, suggesting that the proteins are globular (ellipsoidal). Modeling the data with one ellipsoid using a Monte Carlo modeling method described elsewhere (42Mecklenburg S.L. Donohoe R.D. Olah G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) gave dimensions for FEN-1 of a = 13.6 ± 0.2 Å, b = 32.4 ± 1.0 Å, andc = 45.1 ± 1.0 Å for the best fit. The scattering profile generated from this model also gave anR c value consistent with the R cvalue determined from the Guinier plots. Within the statistics ofR g measurements, it is evident that magnesium has no effect on FEN-1 or the D181A mutant in the absence of DNA. The fact that Mg2+-induced conformational changes was not observed is probably because the Mg2+ binding causes a localized instead of global conformational effect or the induced global conformational changes are quite small.Figure 4P(r) functions for FEN-1 (a) and the D181A mutant (b) in the absence of DNA. Black is in the absence of Mg2+, and gray is in its presence. TheP(r) functions are fairly symmetric, indicating that the two proteins are globular (ellipsoid shape) in solution and are not affected by the presence of Mg2+ or by replacement of Asp-181 by alanine. Single ellipsoid modeling against FEN-1 showed it to have dimensions of a = 13.6 ± 0.2 Å,b = 32.4 ± 1.0 Å, and c = 45.1 ± 1.0 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we examine the effect of Mg2+ on the DNA substrate by both scattering and modeling. Scattering profiles andP(r) functions from the free 34-mer DNA fragment in the absence and presence of Mg2+ are shown in Fig.5. In the absence of Mg2+, the P(r) function showed a peak at ∼16 Å and decreased approximately linearly out to ∼60 Å.

https://openalex.org/W2088940183,"The importance of intraerythrocytic organic phosphates in the allosteric control of oxygen binding to vertebrate hemoglobin (Hb) is well recognized and is correlated with conformational changes of the tetramer. ATP is a major allosteric effector of snake Hb, since the absence of this nucleotide abolishes the Hb cooperativity. This effect may be related to the molecular weight of about 32,000 for this Hb, which is compatible with the dimeric form. ATP induces a pH-dependent tetramerization of deoxyHb that leads to the recovery of cooperativity. This phenomenon may be partially explained by two amino acid replacements in the β chains (CD2 Glu-43 → Thr and G3 Glu-101 → Val), which result in the loss of two negative charges at the α1β2 interface and favors the dissociation into dimers. The ATP-dependent dimer ↔ tetramer may be physiologically important among ancient animal groups that have similar mutations and display variations in blood pH that are governed by these animals′ metabolic state. The enormous loss of free energy of association that accompanies Hb oxygenation, and which is also observed at a much lower intensity in higher vertebrate Hbs, must be taken into consideration in allosteric models. We propose that the transition from a myoglobin-like protein to an allosteric one may be of evolutionary significance.

We propose that the transition from a myoglobin-like protein to an allosteric one may be of evolutionary significance. In vertebrates, hemoglobin (Hb) exists as a tetramer in its intraerythrocytic environment, and it is this form that is involved in the classic structural change from a low to a high O2affinity molecule in the presence of increasing O2concentrations. This phenomenon, known as cooperativity, is reflected in the sigmoidal shape of the O2 saturation curve. Protons and organic phosphate are important in the physiological transport of O2 in most vertebrate groups, since they stabilize the low affinity form of Hb (1Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Yu C.I. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated an oxygen-induced dissociation of snake Hb at physiological pH and Hb concentration, as well as in the presence of high levels of organic phosphate (3Matsuura M.S.A. Ogo S.H. Focesi Jr., A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 683-687Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The structural basis of this phenomenon is the replacement of amino acid residues β-CD2–43 and β-G3–101 at the α1β2interface which is responsible for tetramer stabilization. These key residues, normally both glutamic acid, are replaced by threonine and valine, respectively, in snake Hb (4Matsuura M.S.A. Fushitani K. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5515-5521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This loss of negative charges would disturb the interface contact, leading to a pronounced tendency of Hb to dissociate into dimers. Since these residues are also replaced in most hemoglobins from ectothermic animals (5Maruyama T. Watt K.W.K. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Abbasi A. Wells R.M.G. Brittain T. Braunitzer G. Biol. Chem.

The physiological role of such Hb dissociation is considered in the present investigation. Adult snakes of both sexes weighing 200–400 g were obtained from the Instituto Butantã (São Paulo) and were kept in the laboratory until bleeding. The hemolysate was prepared as described by Rossi-Fanelli and Antonini (10Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 77: 428-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and was freed of salts and small organic molecules by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (2.0 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (11Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), to produce “stripped” Hb. The redox titrations were carried out according to Antonini et al. (12Antonini E. Wyman J. Brunori M. Taylor J.F. Rossi-Fanelli A. Caputo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 907-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five milliliters of Hb solution (140 μm as heme) were deoxygenated in a tonometer and then transferred anaerobically, with continuous flush of N2, to the titration half-cell, which contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl plus 0.1 m NaCl (pH range: 7.0–8.0). Thionin was added as a mediator in a molar ratio to protein of 2–4%. The oxidation of deoxyHb was performed by the stepwise addition of a degassed solution of 5 mm potassium ferricyanide. The measured electrode potentials were refereed to the normal hydrogen electrode (13Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1960Google Scholar). The oxidation-reduction potential at 50% of oxidation provided the midpoint potential ( E12). The experiments were performed at 20 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer of different pH values containing 0.1 m NaCl, using a tonometric-spectrophotometric method (14Riggs A.F. Wolbach R.A. J . Gen. Physiol. 1956; 39: 585-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was 80 μm (as heme). To gain insight into the possible physiological role of pH and ATP in the subunit assembly of snake (Helicops modestus) Hb, we investigated the Hb-O2 equilibrium as a function of proton concentration in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig.1). Stripped snake Hb showed a high affinity for O2 and no allosterism, in accordance with a molecular mass compatible with the dimeric form (3Matsuura M.S.A. Ogo S.H. Focesi Jr., A. Comp. Biochem.

In the presence of organic phosphates, the molecule became cooperative (nH = 2) with a low O2 affinity at a pH up to 7.4. With increasing pH, the Hb gradually lost cooperativity, suggesting a weakening of the electrostatic interaction between ATP and Hb. As a result, the latter tended to assume the properties of stripped Hb. The pH sensitivity cannot be attributed exclusively to a classic Bohr effect in view of the dimerization process that is also present. Based on these unusual findings, we investigated the redox potential of snake Hb under the same conditions as those used for the O2equilibrium curves in order to better understand the Hb properties in the presence of ATP at different pH values. This approach, applied to either tetrameric Hbs or myoglobins, has been employed to show the conversion of the deoxy to the met form and its close correlation with oxygenation equilibrium curves, since the potentiometric curves share similarities with the equilibrium ligand binding curves for Hb (12Antonini E.

The redox potential of stripped Hb did not change with a pH of up to 7.6, but decreased at higher pH values. The resulting curve was similar to that of myoglobin and corroborated our expectation that stripped Hb is dissociated even in the deoxygenated form. The progressive decrease inE h observed with increasing pH in both stripped and ATP-Hb is correlated to the extend of water ionization on the sixth coordinate of heme iron (18Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers in Biology. 21. North-Holland Research Monographs, North-Holland, Amsterdan1971: 153-186Google Scholar). ATP dramatically changed the redox equilibrium profile. In the presence of ATP, theE h value at pH up to 7.22 was constant and higher than in the absence of the nucleotide. However, theE h value decreased sharply in the pH range of 7.22–7.38. This observation is consistent for a tetrameric Hb in which the classic allosteric model is found. The redox equilibrium curve at pH > 7.80 superposed the stripped Hb curve, indicating the complete release of ATP from its binding site. In the pH range of 7.38–7.80, the redox potential presented a curve compatible with equilibrium between dimers and ATP-bound tetramers. From Fig.2 A we estimated the quantitative contribution of the different molecular forms of Hb (Fig. 2 B). The dissociation of tetrameric Hb into dimers was observed primarily between pH 7.38 and 7.55 and varied from 0 to 80%. The inset in Fig. 2 A shows the corresponding Hill plots of the redox equilibrium. At pH 7.0, the oxidated Hb retained its tetrameric form, indicating that ATP remains bound independently of the degree of oxidation. At pH 7.80, the Hb dissociated and had the samen H values as stripped Hb. However, at pH 7.38, the biphasic behavior indicated that above 50% of oxidation, R-met Hb became very unstable and immediately dissociated into dimers. The substantial differences in the Hb properties described above assume a great significance when the physiological state of ectothermic vertebrates are considered. Several studies have reported large blood pH changes when ectothermic animals are subjected to different temperature or stress conditions (21Malan A. Wilson T.L. Reeves R.B. Respir. Physiol. 1976; 128: 29-47Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 181-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Stinner J.N. Grguric M.R. Beaty S.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 815-823PubMed Google Scholar). In such situations, the proton concentration would be particularly important in influencing the binding of ATP to Hb, thereby altering the protein′s O2affinity. These functional properties may be present in a large array of animals from related groups, since the replacement of amino acid residues at key positions of α1β2 contact is present (5Maruyama T.

Fig. 3 proposes a general model for O2 transport by snake and other related vertebrate Hbs in which the ATP plays a central role. In the dormancy state, when low O2 transport is required and the blood pH is increased, the Hb exists in a dimeric form that acts as a reserve supply of O2 in a manner similar to myoglobin. In stress or high activity, the decrease in pH promotes ATP-induced tetramerization and allosterism, thereby resulting in a significant O2 release. Thus in this dynamic interchange, ATP and pH changes serve to integrate the physiology of O2 supply. This novel model provides new insight into O2 transport when compared with higher vertebrates in which the cooperative ligand binding of Hb is based on a switching between quaternary states of the Hb tetramer with different O2 affinities (24Perutz M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 327-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). From a thermodynamic aspect, the classic T-R model of Monod-Changeux-Wyman (MCW model) does not take into account the free energy of association between αβ dimers (25Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6142) Google Scholar). This situation was considered by Weber (26Weber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7098-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that O2 binding to human Hb is a first order reaction that is inconsistent with the two-state model. It is noteworthy that the dissociation of snake Hb is an extreme example of decreasing the Gibbs energy of association between dimers, since progressive oxygenation is linked with dissociation into more reactive dimeric species. Thus, the presence of the classic R state is theoretical and difficult to detect experimentally (Fig. 1), except in metHb obtained by redox potential experiments (Fig. 2 A). In Fig.4, we propose a diagram of the Gibbs free energy of O2 binding with snake ATP-Hb in comparison with stripped human Hb. The most striking feature is the inversion of the free energy of association between oxygenated dimers despite the presence of ATP. Moreover, the binding of the first/second O2 molecule results in a much higher affinity of tetrameric snake Hb to further O2 binding than is the case with human Hb. The evolutionary adaptation, study of Hb structure and function, has been extensively discussed (27Wood S.C. Am. Zool. 1980; 20: 163-172Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Perutz M.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1983; 1: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). The Agnatha, lampreys, and hagfish, the most primitive group of vertebrates, have monomeric Hb in which the O2 transport mechanism is accomplished by a dimer ↔ monomer transition. This disaggregation leads to a higher affinity state and allows cooperative behavior (29Wald G. Riggs A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1951; 24: 1269-1273Google Scholar, 30Briehl R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2361-2366Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 31Brittain T. O'Brien A.J. Wells R.M.G. Baldwin J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 93B: 549-554Google Scholar). The singular properties of snake Hb reported here may point to the origin of a stable dimeric molecule that could have important evolutionary implications for heme-heme interactions. The αβ dimeric form may represent an intermediary evolutionary stage of the classic allosterism of vertebrate Hbs, where ATP serves as a central allosteric mediator. The molecular properties of such Hbs may reflect the physiological functions of ectothermic Hb, particularly the adaptations to exogenous and endogenous factors such as ambient hypoxia, temperature, activity, and dormancy. Finally, the mechanism of dimer-tetramer transitions during O2 transport may represent an intermediate stage of evolution to the stable tetrameric Hb found in higher vertebrates.
