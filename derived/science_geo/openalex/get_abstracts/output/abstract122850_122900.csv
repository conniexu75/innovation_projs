https://openalex.org/W2010394923,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor which is expressed when mammalian cells are subjected to hypoxia and which activates transcription of genes encoding erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other proteins that are important for maintaining oxygen homeostasis. Previous studies have provided indirect evidence that HIF-1 also regulates transcription of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. In this paper we characterize hypoxia response elements in the promoters of the ALDA, ENO1, and Ldha genes. We demonstrate that HIF-1 plays an essential role in activating transcription via these elements and show that although absolutely necessary, the presence of a HIF-1 binding site alone is not sufficient to mediate transcriptional responses to hypoxia. Analysis of hypoxia response elements in the ENO1 and Ldha gene promoters revealed that each contains two functionally-essential HIF-1 sites arranged as direct and inverted repeats, respectively. Our data establish that functional hypoxia-response elements consist of a pair of contiguous transcription factor binding sites at least one of which contains the core sequence 5'-RCGTG-3' and is recognized by HIF-1. These results provide further evidence that the coordinate transcriptional activation of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes which occurs in hypoxic cells is mediated by HIF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2026823930,"The epitope on tau protein recognized by the monoclonal antibody Alz50 was defined through internal deletion mutagenesis and quantified by affinity measurements. The epitope is discontinuous and requires both a previously identified N-terminal segment and the microtubule binding region for efficient binding of Alz50. The interaction between these regions is consistent with an intramolecular reaction mechanism, suggesting that Alz50 binding depends on the conformation of individual tau monomers. The results suggest that tau adopts a distinct conformation when polymerized into filaments and that this conformation is recognized selectively by Alz50.

Alzheimer's disease paired helical filament Tris-buffered saline kilobase N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid. To place the many observations on Alz50 immunocytochemistry into a structural context, we reinvestigated its epitope selectivity in vitro. The results suggest that individual tau monomers adopt a specific conformation preceding or during filament formation that is selectively recognized by Alz50. All monoclonal antibodies were prepared from supernatants of hybridoma cells grown in serum-free medium. Supernatants containing Alz50 were pooled, precipitated with 45% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in TBS (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EGTA), and dialyzed twice against 100 volumes of TBS. The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation and redialyzed against 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, to precipitate the IgM. The resultant fine precipitate was resuspended in S300 buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 700 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EGTA), dispersed with 30 strokes of a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and loaded onto a 400-ml (2.6 × 100-cm) S300HR gel filtration column equilibrated and run in S300 buffer. The IgM fraction emerging in the void volume was pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50% glycerol, and 150 mM NaCl), and stored at −20°C until used. IgGs were purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

An expression plasmid for tau was constructed from full-length four-repeat tau (htau40) (14Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

For expression in bacteria, the resultant 1.3-kb PCR fragment was digested with NdeI/EcoRI and ligated into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of the E. coli expression vector pT7C. This derivative of pT7B (31Carmel G. Kuret J. Anal.

Open table in a new tab Antibody reactivity of individual tau deletion mutants was determined in a solid-phase expression assay (31Carmel G. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) cells containing tau expression plasmids were grown in a grid pattern on nitrocellulose filters, lysed over chloroform, and processed as described (31Carmel G. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using sheep anti-mouse IgG/IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (33Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Images were collected on x-ray film and quantified by laser densitometry (Bio-Rad). Histidine-tagged tau proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity and gel filtration chromatographies as described for other proteins (32Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of purified htau40 and all antibodies were estimated spectrophotometrically. The extinction coefficient for htau40 was calculated from amino acid content (A280 nm% = 1.46) (34Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), whereas the coefficients for mouse IgG (A280 nm% = 13.5) and mouse IgM (A280 nm% = 12.0) were taken from the literature (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of IgGs and IgMs were estimated assuming molecular masses of 160 and 950 kDa, respectively. The protein concentration of PHF preparations was assayed by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using recombinant tau as standard. Antibody affinity determinations were performed in duplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (36Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Reaction of fixed concentrations of antibody (0.04 nM Alz50, 0.025 nM Tau-5, 0.01 nM TG5, 0.5 nM MC1, and 0.01 nM Tau46.1 or 0.2 nM Tau-2) with varying concentrations of analyte (htau40 and PHF-tau) proceeded in blocking buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, and TBS) overnight at 4°C. For each antibody assayed, the concentration range of analyte varied from a minimum of at least 10-fold above the concentration of antibody binding sites (except where noted) to a maximum of approximately 100 nM. Under these conditions, analyte concentrations approximated a steady state. After this incubation, concentrations of unbound antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed in 96-well plates precoated with 250 ng of htau40/well and blocked with 5% nonfat milk/TBS. Captured antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as colorimetric substrate. Reactions were stopped with H2SO4 and quantified by absorbance measurements (490 nm). The resultant data was analyzed graphically as Scatchard plots of ν/a versus ν, where ν is the fraction of total antibody binding sites bound at a given concentration of analyte and a is the corresponding free analyte concentration (36Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Binding parameters were calculated from linear regression analysis of these plots. Dissociation constants (Kd) were derived from the negative slopes (reported ± 1 S.E. of the estimate), whereas the fractions of antibody binding sites occupied at saturating concentrations of analyte were calculated from the abscissa intercept (37Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The accessible content of tau in nondenatured PHFs was determined by solution-phase (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) immunoassays using pure htau40 as standard and Tau46.1, 5E2, Tau-5, and TG5 as primary antibodies. Because PHFs contain all six splice forms of tau, ranging from 351 to 441 amino acids in length, a mean molecular mass of 45 kDa was assumed for PHF-tau. To quantify the binding selectivities of a panel of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies, equilibrium binding experiments with both monomeric tau (htau40) and authentic affinity-purified PHFs were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all protein reagents used in binding experiments were of high purity (Fig. 1). The analysis began with four anti-tau IgGs known to bind continuous epitopes on tau independently of the state of tau phosphorylation: Tau-5 (22LoPresti P. Szuchet S. Papasozomenos S.C. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10369-10373Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), 5E2 (23Kowall N.W. Kosik K.S. Ann. Neurol. 1987; 22: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), Tau46.1 (24Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Lee G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and TG5 (see below). Results for Tau-5 binding to both htau40 and PHFs are illustrated in Scatchard format in Fig. 2. The resultant Scatchard plots are linear, indicating that the Tau-5 antibody interacts with tau via a single noncooperative binding site (37Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Furthermore, each plot revealed nearly complete fractional occupancy at saturating concentrations of analyte (tau), proving that essentially all antibody binding sites are accounted for and that the Tau-5 antibodies are fully active. The binding constants (Kd) calculated from these plots and summarized in Table II show that Tau-5 binds both monomeric htau40 and PHFs with nearly identical affinity. These results are consistent with Tau-5 binding a tau epitope that is presented nearly identically in monomeric and PHF-tau.Fig. 2Alz50 is selective for PHF-tau. The affinity of Tau-5 (top) and Alz50 (bottom) for purified recombinant htau40 (•) and PHF-tau (○) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are depicted as Scatchard plots in which ν is the fraction of bound analyte and a is the concentration of free analyte at equilibrium (25Vincent I. Rosado M. Davies P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Tau-5 binds both forms of tau with high affinity and complete saturation of available antibody binding sites (i.e. ν≈ 1 at saturating analyte concentration). In contrast, Alz50 binds PHF-tau more tightly than it binds htau40 and with occupation of only 50% of available antibody binding sites (see text for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table II.Affinity measurementsAntibodyhtau40 KdPHF KdRatioaRatio = Kd of tau binding/Kd of PHF-tau binding.

Values less than unity reflect selectivity for recombinant htau40, whereas values greater than unity reflect selectivity for PHF-tau. Open table in a new tab Binding data for Tau46.1, 5E2, and TG5 are also summarized in Table II. Although these antibodies bind tau with differing affinities, each retains the characteristics summarized above for Tau-5. Each antibody returned linear Scatchard plots and bound monomeric tau and PHFs with nearly identical affinities (Kd) and with essentially full occupancy of available antibody binding sites. Thus, antibodies that bind tau through simple continuous epitopes, such as Tau-5, Tau46.1, 5E2, and TG5, comprise a single class of reagent capable of detecting tau equally well in its monomeric or pathologically aggregated states. Like the Tau-5 class of antibody described above, the interaction of Alz50 with tau derived from normal brains, AD brains, and recombinant sources is well documented (13Ksiezak-Reding H. Leibowitz R.L. Bowser R. Davies P. Brain Res. 1995; 697: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). To quantify its selectivity for tau isoforms in solution relative to other tau antibodies, Alz50 was subjected to affinity measurements against both recombinant human tau and authentic PHFs as described above. The resultant Scatchard plots are illustrated in Fig. 2. Like the antibodies introduced above, Alz50 bound recombinant tau (Kd≅ 20 nM) with nearly complete saturation of available binding sites. Yet Alz50 differed by displaying a clear selectivity for PHF-tau, which it bound with an observed affinity of 0.32 nM (Fig. 2; Table II). Because this value approximates the concentration of antibody binding sites in the assay, it must be considered an upper limit for Kd (38Henderson P.J.F. Biochem.

IRL Press, NY1992: 63-176Google Scholar), so its true affinity for PHF may be even greater. The results indicate that the interaction of Alz50 with PHF-tau is nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater affinity than its interaction with recombinant monomeric tau. In addition, the stoichiometry of binding is reduced to ≈0.5 PHF-tau molecules/antibody binding site, perhaps reflecting steric hindrance between the decavalent Alz50 (an IgM) and the PHFs (which average 20 nm in width and 0.25 μm in length) (26Vincent I.J. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2878-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The behavior of Alz50 was paralleled by that of Tau-2, an IgG raised against bovine tau (21Papasozomenos S.C. Binder L.I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Tau-2 is known to react poorly with recombinant human tau (40Watanabe N. Takio K. Hasegawa M. Arai T. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) but strongly with the fibrillar pathology found in AD brains (41Papasozomenos S.C. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 375-388PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized in Table II, Tau-2 also is selective for the PHF conformation of human tau, which it binds with >10-fold higher affinity than it binds recombinant htau40. Similar behavior also is exhibited by MC1, a new IgG raised against PHF (25Vincent I. Rosado M. Davies P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Alz50, Tau-2, and MC1 form a second class of anti-tau antibody that reacts preferentially with tau epitopes when they are presented in the context of PHF. The affinity data confirms that nonphosphorylated recombinant tau contains the sequences necessary for Alz50 binding but suggests that unlike Tau46.1, 5E2, and Tau-5, factors other than primary structure mediate the high affinity interaction between PHF-tau and Alz50. To examine this possibility, the ability of anti-tau antibodies to bind either htau40 or htau40 denatured via boiling in dilute SDS was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3, antibodies that recognize continuous epitopes on tau, such as Tau46.1, react similarly with htau40 regardless of whether this analyte was subjected to SDS-mediated denaturation. Alz50 staining, however, is nearly destroyed by this treatment. Similar results were obtained when PHF-tau was substituted for htau40 as analyte. In this case, however, total Tau46.1 reactivity seems to increase after PHF denaturation (Fig. 4). Because the binding affinity of Tau46.1 for tau is insensitive to denaturation (Fig. 3), this increase in Tau46.1 reactivity probably results from more tau being accessible to it. These results suggest that a portion of tau molecules packed into PHFs are inaccessible to antibody until released by denaturation. Despite the increase in accessible tau, PHF denaturation still leads to a dramatic decrease in Alz50 reactivity (Fig. 4). Together these data suggest that the Alz50 epitope on human tau and PHF is denaturation sensitive, and therefore probably conformational in nature.Fig. 4Alz50 binds a conformational epitope on PHF. PHFs (3 ng) were spotted on nitrocellulose paper before (−) or after (+) incubation under denaturing conditions (5 min in boiling 0.1% SDS). The resultant filters were then probed with 0.1 nM Alz50 (□) or 1 nM Tau46.1 (▪) and developed using chemiluminescent detection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The signal obtained for each analyte/antibody pair in the absence of denaturation was defined as 100% reactivity for purposes of normalization. Bar, mean ± range of duplicate assays. The results show that Tau46.1 reactivity increases approximately 3-fold upon PHF denaturation, suggesting that a third of tau molecules packed into PHFs are inaccessible to antibody until the structure is disrupted by denaturation. Despite the increase in accessible tau molecules, Alz50 reactivity toward PHF drops dramatically after denaturation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the amino acid sequences on tau that serve as epitopes, a recombinant library containing random deletions in the htau40 coding sequence was constructed and screened for an ability to bind various monoclonal antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The approach of using deletions to map epitope boundaries was adopted because of its ability to identify both continuous and discontinuous epitopes on proteins of low secondary structure content such as tau. In addition, all tau deletion mutants made to date can be overexpressed solubly in E. coli at high levels, which facilitates analysis (data not shown). To validate this mapping approach, the library was first screened with two antibodies whose epitopes on tau are known: Tau46.1 (24Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y.

Results are illustrated graphically in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table III. For Tau-1, the segment Pro162-Gly210 identified by deletion mapping encompasses the previously described Tau-1 epitope (Pro189-Gly207) and its essential core sequence Gly192-Ser199 (42Liu W.K.

https://openalex.org/W1993343317,"We previously reported that sterol regulation of the rat fatty-acid synthase was lost when the DNA sequence between −73 and −43 of the promoter was deleted from a luciferase reporter construct (Bennett, M. K., Lopez, J. M., Sanchez, H. B., and Osborne, T. F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25578-25583). We also showed that there was a binding site for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in this region that contains a palindromic E-box motif (5′-CANNTG-3′). This is the consensus recognition element for basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper containing proteins such as the SREBPs. However, the SREBPs are unique basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper proteins that not only bind to a subset of E-boxes but also to the direct repeat SRE-1 element of the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter as well as to variant sites present in the promoters for key enzymes of both cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Based on the sequence of the variant SREBP recognition sites in these other promoters, we noted there was more than one potential recognition site for SREBP within the −73 to −43 interval of the fatty-acid synthase promoter. In the present studies we have systematically mutated these potential SREBP sites and have analyzed the consequences on sterol regulation, activation by exogenously supplied SREBPs, and binding by SREBPs in vitro. The results clearly show that the E-box element is not the SREBP recognition site in this region. Rather, there are two independent SREBP binding sites that flank the E-box, and both are required for maximal sterol regulation and activation by transfected SREBP protein. We previously reported that sterol regulation of the rat fatty-acid synthase was lost when the DNA sequence between −73 and −43 of the promoter was deleted from a luciferase reporter construct (Bennett, M.

There are two separate genes for the mammalian SREBPs, and one encodes alternatively spliced mRNAs; hence, several functionally distinct proteins could be expressed (3Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar, 4Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Consistent with the fact that all mammalian cells require cholesterol, the mRNAs for both SREBP genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues (3Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar, 4Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, a spliced variant of SREBP-1 called SREBP-1c/ADD1 was identified and shown to be induced upon differentiation of cultured pre-adipocytic cells into adipocytes (6Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). sterol regulatory element binding protein sterol regulatory element 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A cytomegalovirus FAS, fatty-acid synthase basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper low density lipoprotein. The SREBPs are unusual members of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) family of DNA binding-transcriptional regulatory proteins. They are anchored to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum through two membrane spanning domains under cholesterol replete conditions (7Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). When the sterol level of the cell drops below a certain threshold, which is dictated by the need of the particular cell, the amino-terminal half of the protein (~500 amino acids) is released through a coupled two-step proteolytic process (8Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The soluble amino-terminal fragment containing the transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and nuclear targeting signals is released from the membrane, and it enters the nucleus where it activates the appropriate target genes. Studies have demonstrated that both SREBP-1 and −2 are constitutively expressed at relatively equivalent levels and coordinately activated by proteolysis upon removal of sterols from the growth media of cultured cells (7Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). However, experiments in hamsters showed that mature SREBP-1 was constitutively expressed in the liver of hamsters maintained on a normal chow diet where levels of mature SREBP-2 were very low (9Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 expression and activity were induced in animals fed a diet that leads to a dramatic de-repression of hepatic cholesterol synthetic enzymes and a modest activation of the LDL receptor. In contrast, the concentration of nuclear SREBP-1 decreased in these animals. Thus, the functions of SREBP-1 and −2 are likely to be at least partially distinct. As mentioned above, a spliced variant of SREBP-1 was implicated in the differentiation of adipocytes in culture (6Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) which suggested that the SREBPs may play a more global role in lipid homeostasis than just being involved in cholesterol balance (5Osborne T.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene. Expr. 1995; 5: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To this end, we have recently demonstrated that the genes for fatty-acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase are regulated by sterol levels in cultured cells through novel binding sites for the SREBP proteins (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 13Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Further evidence in support of an essential role for the SREBPs in both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism comes from recent studies where forced overexpression of SREBP-1a in the liver of transgenic mice resulted in the activation of several genes in both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism with a concomitant increase in the accumulation of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides (14Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The most dramatically activated genes in these animals are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and lipoprotein lipase (14Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In another recent study the overexpression of a dominant negative form of SREBP1c/ADD1 inhibited adipocyte differentiation in culture. In addition, stable overexpression of the mature form of the wild type SREBP1c/ADD1 protein activated a subset of genes characteristic of the adipocyte program including FAS in normal fibroblasts (11Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). We showed that the 30-base pair sterol regulatory region in the FAS promoter bound SREBP-1 and contained a classic 5′-CANNTG-3′ E-box motif that is the hallmark binding motif for bHLH proteins (15Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, 16Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and we presumed it was the target for SREBP-1 in this region (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, another unique feature of the SREBPs is that they contain an atypical tyrosine residue in the basic domain at a key position that is occupied by an arginine in almost all other bHLHZip proteins. This single amino acid plays a critical role in allowing SREBP to not only recognize the consensus E-box which contains two half-sites in an inverted orientation but also the SRE-1 element in the LDL receptor which contains a direct repeat of two half-sites with one intervening base (3Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar, 10Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Additionally, SREBPs also bind to variant SRE-1 sites present in the promoters for HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (12Bennett M.K.

In the FAS sterol regulatory region we noted that there was a potential half-site element in addition to the two halves of the E-box (Fig. 1). To determine if SREBP-1 was acting through the E-box site or the half-site variant elements in the FAS promoter, we introduced a series of mutations targeted at the potential recognition motifs and evaluated the effects on sterol regulation, activation by ectopic expression of SREBP-1a and 2, and binding by purified SREBP-1a and −2 proteins. Our results indicate that the E-box contained in this sequence interval is not the target for SREBP binding or sterol regulation. Rather, there are two separate SREBP binding sites, and each one encompasses a distinct half of the E-box along with associated flanking residues. Both SREBP sites are required for maximal sterol regulation and activation by SREBPs. However, one site is more crucial than the other. We show that SREBP-1a and −2 each bind to both FAS sites in a similar but slightly different manner and that both SREBPs activate the FAS promoter. CV-1 cells were obtained from Dr. K. Cho at University of California, Irvine. HepG2 cells were obtained from the ATCC. All cell culture materials were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared by ultracentrifugation starting with newborn bovine serum as described (20Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and 25-OH cholesterol were purchased from Steraloids Inc., and stock solutions were dissolved in absolute ethanol. The rat FAS promoter FAS (−1594) CAT (21Moustaid N. Sakamoto K. Clarke S. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Steve Clarke (University of Texas at Austin). The FAS promoter fragment from −150 to −43 (here called wild type) or −150 to −73 (here called negative or NEG), respectively, were linked to a generic TATA box sequence positioned upstream of the luciferase coding sequence. These plasmids were described previously (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The mutations described in the figures were generated by PCR using the wild type FAS promoter DNA as template with Pfu polymerase and mutagenic oligonucleotides designed to introduce each specific multi-base point mutation. A specific 3′ mutagenic oligonucleotide of 30-40 bases was combined with a common 5′ primer that hybridized to the wild type FAS sequence beginning at −150. This was the same primer used to generate the original FAS −150 promoter plasmid that was efficiently regulated by sterols (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Each mutagenic primer was designed to hybridize to the wild type FAS sequence beginning at −43 and extend upstream with the desired mutations positioned accordingly. The PCR reaction product was digested with restriction enzymes and inserted upstream from the generic TATA box positioned in front of the luciferase coding sequence as mentioned above and described previously (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of each mutant clone was confirmed before initiating the transfection studies. CV-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on day 0 in 60-mm dishes at 125,000 cells/dish. On day 1 the cells were refed the same media and transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Precipitates contained 20 μg each of test plasmid and internal control CMV2 β-galactosidase plasmid that contains the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter fused to the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene plus 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 2 ml of solution. 0.5 ml were added to each of four dishes that were incubated for 12-16 h at 37°C and 7% CO2. The dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and duplicate dishes were refed either induced (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum) or suppressed (same but containing 12 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-OH cholesterol) media. Following a 24 h incubation the cells from duplicate dishes were harvested by scraping and were pooled. Soluble protein extracts were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles. For activation studies with over-expressed SREBP-1a, a CMV promoter expression clone encoding amino acids 1-490 of SREBP-1a was used, and it was described previously (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A similar expression clone encoding amino acids 1-481 of SREBP-2 was used to evaluate activation by SREBP-2. HepG2 cells were plated at 175,000 cells per dish and transfected the following day with the individual FAS-luciferase reporter construct and the CMV2 β-galactosidase as described above. Half of the dishes received 30 ng per dish of the SREBP-1a or −2 expression plasmid. The transfected cells were subjected to a glycerol shock 5 h after the transfection and cultured in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h prior to harvesting as described above. Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer with a luciferin reagent from Promega Biotec. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity in relative light units was divided by the β-galactosidase activity (activity/h) for each extract to give a normalized luciferase value. The data presented are from several independent transfections performed in duplicate for each plasmid (see figure legends for the number of individual experiments). Recombinant SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 proteins were purified by nickel chelation chromatography from a 6XHis containing fusion protein as described (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of the purified protein were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis performed with marker proteins followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. 32P DNA probes were prepared from the indicated plasmids incubated with SREBP and digested with DNase I as described (24Dynan W.S.

We previously identified a region between −73 and −43 upstream from the mRNA start site for the rat FAS gene as harboring an SREBP binding site that was critical for regulation of the promoter by sterol levels in cultured cells (12Bennett M.K.

Within this interval is a classic E-box element (see Fig. 1), and we postulated that the bHLHZip domain of SREBP probably recognized the E-box. However, based on our recent studies of the DNA recognition properties for SREBP-1 in the HMG-CoA reductase promoter (19Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we noted that there was the potential for more than one SREBP binding site within this region of the FAS promoter (Fig. 1). To define the sterol regulatory element and the binding site or sites for SREBP within this interval with more precision, we introduced several tri-base substitution mutations separately or in combination and evaluated the effects on sterol regulation, activation by ectopic expression of SREBPs, and binding by purified SREBP protein. The parent plasmid contained the wild type sequence from −150 through −43 fused to a TATA element upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. This plasmid contains all of the cis-acting information required for efficient sterol regulation and activation by SREBP-1 (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Within this parent construct, four separate mutations were introduced that alter each of four contiguous three base regions (referred to as A, B, C, and D in Fig. 1). We also mixed the separate mutations together in different combinations. Each mutant promoter construct was evaluated by a transient DNA transfection assay for sterol regulation in cultured CV-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the parent plasmid (wild type) was expressed and efficiently suppressed when sterols were added to the culture dish. A mutation that deletes the sequence from −73 to −43 was severely compromised for sterol regulation (NEG). These results are consistent with our earlier study (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The single mutants A and B were moderately defective for regulation. However, mutants C and D were severely defective for sterol regulation. When the A and B mutations were combined the resultant double mutant lost all sterol regulation. If the E-box was the sterol regulatory site then the effects of mutations B and C, which change each half of the E-box element, should be identical and both should be defective for regulation. Additionally, the effects of mutations A and D should be minimal or silent. Thus, the results in Fig. 1 are inconsistent with the E-box being the sterol regulatory site. To evaluate the effects of the above mutations on SREBP binding, we performed DNase I footprinting with recombinant SREBP-1a or −2 protein and end-labeled DNA probes prepared from the wild type promoter and several of the mutants analyzed in Fig. 1. The results of representative experiments are shown in Fig. 2. The DNase I-protected region corresponding to the wild type promoter when SREBP-1a was evaluated (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-6) is identical to what we reported previously (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 binding induces two prominent DNase I hyper-cleavage sites at the 3′ end of the footprint (see arrows on the left of Fig. 2A). A similar hyper-cleavage site is induced upon the binding of SREBP-1 to the SRE-1 of the LDL receptor promoter (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the HMG-CoA synthase promoter. 2K. Dooley and T. F. Osborne, unpublished observations. The protection pattern for SREBP-2 is similar, but the prominent SREBP-1 induced hyper-cleavage sites are not produced (lanes 7-12). The binding of SREBP-1 and −2 was evaluated on a subset of the mutant FAS constructs to correlate the results of the regulation studies of Fig. 1 with the binding of SREBP. The results for SREBP-1 binding are shown in Fig. 2B. When mutant C was used as a probe the footprint was reduced in size and was localized to the 3′ side of the wild type protected region (lanes 4-6). This result is consistent with mutant C destroying one recognition site for SREBP-1 but leaving one site completely unaltered. When either mutant A or B was analyzed (lanes 7-12), the region of DNase I protection was again reduced. Protection was maintained on the 5′ side of the footprint region seen with the wild type probe, but the protection on the 3′ side was lost and was replaced by a prominent hyper-cleavage site. The B/C and A/C double mutations resulted in a total loss of all SREBP binding (lanes 13-18), and the A/B double mutant abolished binding at the 3′ side but maintained binding at the 5′ side of the site (lanes 19-21). This pattern is identical to the results for either the A or B single mutant (compare to lanes 7-12). The A/B/C triple mutation abolished all SREBP-1 binding to the probe (lanes 22-24). Taken together the DNase I protection data are consistent with two independent recognition sites for SREBP-1 within this region; one disrupted by mutants A and B and the other disrupted by mutant C. SREBP-2 binding to the mutant FAS promoters was also evaluated, and the results were consistent with the results with SREBP-1a. The most significant results are presented in Fig. 2C. Similar to SREBP-1 (Fig. 2B), SREBP-2 protection over the 3′-half was largely abolished by the A/B double mutant but protection over the 5′-half was not altered (compare lanes 1-3 and 7-9). Similar results were obtained for each of the single mutants as well (data not shown). SREBP-2 binding to the mutant C resulted in the reciprocal result (lanes 4-6). Protection over the 5′-half was abolished, and the protection over the 3′-half was maintained. To further evaluate the possibility of two important SREBP recognition sites in this region, we assessed the activation of the mutant promoters by ectopically expressed SREBP-1 and −2 in a mammalian cell transfection assay (Fig. 3). The results for activation by an expression vector encoding the mature form of SREBP-1a (amino acids 1-490) are presented in Fig. 3A. The wild type FAS promoter was efficiently activated and consistent with our earlier studies (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); a mutant that deletes the sequence from −73 to −43 which removes the sterol regulatory region was unresponsive (NEG). The results for activation studies performed with the new mutants are consistent with the sterol regulation experiments of Fig. 1 (see Fig. 3A). Mutants A and B are partially and mutants C and D are severely defective for activation by SREBP-1a. Once again, the A/B double mutation is more defective than either single mutant alone, and the A/B/C triple mutant was unresponsive. The results for activation by an expression vector encoding the mature form of SREBP-2 (amino acids 1-481) are presented in Fig. 3B. The results for mutants A and B and the A/B double mutant are not statistically significant from the wild type. This is different than for SREBP-1 where the single mutants were partially defective for activation, and the A/B double mutant was severely crippled. The single mutants C and D are each severely defective for activation which is similar to the results for SREBP-1. SREBPs are weak activators of transcription by themselves and have been shown to synergistically activate promoters along with a ubiquitous transcription factor that binds to an adjacent site (1Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the FAS promoter this co-regulator is likely to be Sp1 since there is an Sp1 site beginning at −91, and we have shown that SREBP and Sp1 synergistically activate the FAS promoter (12Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To study this further we analyzed the effect of changing the distance between the SREBP binding region between −73 and −43 and the Sp1 site at −91. Two insertion mutations were constructed that add either 4 or 10 bases between the two elements, and the effects on both sterol regulation and activation by ectopic SREBP-1 expression were evaluated (Fig. 4). Both insertion mutations were totally defective for both sterol regulation (Fig. 4A) and activation by ectopically expressed SREBP-1a (Fig. 4B). This provides further evidence that both Sp1 and SREBP are required for efficient sterol regulation of the FAS promoter and that the distance and not helical phasing of the two sites is critical for optimal activity. In the present studies we demonstrate that the region of the rat fatty-acid synthase promoter required for sterol regulation contains two independent binding sites for sterol regulatory element binding proteins −1 and −2. The surprising find was that the classic bHLH DNA recognition element, the E-box, which is present in this region is not the binding site for the bHLH containing SREBP protein. Instead, each half of the E-box is contained within a different SREBP site (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). An alignment of the FAS sites identified here relative to known SREBP sites present in sterol regulatory elements contained in other promoters is presented in Fig. 5. This lineup reveals a high degree of sequence similarity between these FAS elements and other direct repeat SRE elements. Thus, SREBP probably recognizes all these sites in a similar manner. SREBPs are inherently weak activators by themselves, and they function synergistically with ubiquitous factors that bind close by to achieve a high level of promoter activation (1Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). There is a single SREBP site in the LDL receptor promoter that is required for efficient sterol regulation. Why are there two sites required in the FAS promoter? At least two SREBP sites are also required for sterol regulation in both the HMG-CoA synthase (26Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18480-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reductase promoters (19Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The difference with the LDL receptor may partially be due to the position of the SREBP site relative to the essential neighboring co-regulatory factor. In the LDL receptor promoter the Sp1 site is very close to the SREBP site. In fact, the footprints for the two individual proteins partially overlap. In the FAS promoter the co-regulatory Sp1 site is located 10 bases away, and in the synthase promoter the co-regulator is probably nuclear factor-Y and its recognition site is about 20 bases away from the nearest SREBP site. However, it is unlikely that the distance between the SREBP and co-regulatory sites alone can explain the entire effect since a single SREBP site is located about 20 bases away from the co-regulatory nuclear factor-Y site in the farnesyl-diphosphate synthase promoter (18Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although both of these FAS SREBP sites are required for maximal activation by SREBP-1 and sterol regulation, the site disrupted by mutations C and D which is closer to the upstream Sp1 site seems to be more critical (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). In fact, the 3′ site which is disrupted by mutants A and B is even less crucial for activation by SREBP-2 than by SREBP-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Insertion of 4 or 10 bases between the Sp1 and SREBP sites resulted in a loss of sterol regulation (Fig. 4) indicating that the spacing, but not helical positioning, of the sites is important for normal FAS promoter function. This observation coupled with the regulation and activation studies for the substitution mutants discussed above are consistent with the fact that SREBP and Sp1 must interact together for optimal promoter activity. A cis-acting site required for insulin regulation of the FAS promoter was mapped to a region that overlaps the two SREBP sites studied here (27Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same laboratory provided evidence that the ubiquitous bHLHZip protein upstream stimulatory factory binds to this region, presumably recognizing the E-box motif, and it was suggested that upstream stimulating factor might play a role in insulin regulation of FAS expression (28Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see how the mutations analyzed here affect insulin regulation to determine if insulin and sterol signaling are mediated through the same or different sites in the promoter. Through the use of an in vitro PCR-assisted DNA binding site selection assay, SREBP-1c/ADD1 was shown to prefer the palindromic E-box containing sequence 5′-ATCACGTGT-3′ and, presumably to a lesser extent, the direct repeat SRE-1 sequence 5′-ATCACCCCAC-3′ (10Kim J.B.

The preference for the CG dinucleotide in the center of the E-box is identical to that for Myc/Max, upstream stimulatory factor, and other Myc-related bHLHZip proteins although preferred outside flanking bases can differ slightly for these other proteins (29Blackwell T.K.

Surprisingly, the E-box palindrome is not contained within any natural sterol response regions that are known to bind the SREBPs (5Osborne T.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene.

The reason why a high affinity E-box has not been identified in a known SREBP sterol response element is unclear. However, since several SREBP-related bHLHZip proteins such as upstream stimulatory factor and Myc/Max would also bind to a high affinity 5′-CACGTG-3′ E-box if it was present, the direct repeat SRE element would ensure more precise regulation since it would be highly specific for the SREBP proteins.

Expression of a dominant interfering mutant of CDC42 (CDC42HsN17) prevented S. typhimurium -induced cytoskeletal reorganization and subsequent macropinocytosis and bacterial internalization into host cells. Cells expressing constitutively active CDC42 (CDC42HsV12) internalized an S. typhimurium mutant unable to trigger host cell responses. Furthermore, expression of CDC42HsN17 prevented S. typhimurium -induced JNK kinase activation.

In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of angiogenesis, we attempted to isolate and characterize human cDNAs induced during angiogenesis in vitro (8Zimrin A.B. Villeponteau B. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 630-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have identified the human homolog of Jagged as an angiogenesis-induced gene that is able to modify FGF-induced, but not VEGF-induced, angiogenesis in vitro. Since Jagged signaling is mediated by Notch receptor gene family members, these data implicate Notch signaling as a regulatory feature of the angiogenic process. Further evidence supporting a central role for the Notch receptor in cell differentiation is the identification of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) oncogene, int-3, as a truncated intracellular version of Notch 4 (9Uyttendaele H. Marazzi G. Wu G. Yan Q. Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2251-2259PubMed Google Scholar), a Notch family member whose proto-oncogene expression has been shown by in situ hybridization to be endothelial cell specific in both fetal and adult tissues (9Uyttendaele H.

The clone isolated was used to screen a cDNA library made in the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene) using RNA isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells plated on fibrin in the presence of crude FGF-1 for 1, 3, and 5 h. The overlapping cDNA clones obtained were sequenced using an ABI DNA synthesizer and assembled with the DNASTAR program. Analysis by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification was performed as described (8Zimrin A.B. Villeponteau B. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Adrenal cortex-derived bovine microvascular endothelial (BME) cells were provided by Drs. M. B. Furie and S. C. Silverstein (Columbia University, New York) and were grown in α-modified minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc. AG, Basel, Switzerland), supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated donor calf serum (DCS, Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (110 units/ml), and streptomycin (110 μg/ml). BME cells were subcultured at a 1:4 split ratio in 1.5% gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes or flasks (Falcon Labware, Becton Dickinson Company, Lincoln Park, NJ). The in vitro angiogenesis assay was performed as described (12Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) in 16-mm tissue culture wells (Nunclon, A/S Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). BME cells were seeded at 5.0-7.5 × 104 cells/well in 500 μl of α-modified minimal essential medium, 5% DCS. Upon reaching confluence (3 days), DCS was further reduced to 2%, and cells were treated with recombinant human FGF-2 (provided by Dr. P. Sarmientos, Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy), recombinant human VEGF (165-amino acid homodimeric species, PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), and oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides were added to the cells 2 h before cytokines on the first day of treatment. Medium and cytokines were renewed after 2 days, and oligonucleotides were added either every day or every other day during the 4-day assay period. Cultures were fixed in situ after a further 2 days with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and photographed. For quantitation, randomly selected fields measuring 1.0 × 1.4 mm were photographed in each well at a single level beneath the surface monolayer by phase contrast microscopy, using a Nikon Diaphot TMD inverted photomicroscope. In each experiment, invasion was quantitated from at least three photographic fields by determining the total additive length of all cellular structures that had penetrated beneath the surface monolayer either as apparently single cells or in the form of cell cords or tubes (13Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Results are shown as mean additive sprout length ± S.E. (in micrometers) for at least three experiments per condition. Mean values were compared using Student's unpaired t test, and a significant p value was taken as <0.05. In an attempt to identify the molecular events involved in the regulation of angiogenesis (12Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Folkman J. Haudenschild C. Nature. 1980; 288: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), we used a modified differential display procedure (8Zimrin A.B. Villeponteau B. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 630-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to isolate transcripts that were differentially expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells plated on fibrin in the presence of FGF-1 over the course of 24 h. One of the cDNAs that was amplified at 2 h was found to be highly homologous to the rat Jagged transcript (15Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), suggesting that we had isolated the human Jagged homolog. 2A human Jagged cDNA clone containing the presumed translation start site has been isolated and sequenced by Drs. S. Gray and S. Artavanis-Tsakonis (Yale University) and will appear in the GenBank™ data base with the accession number U61276. Our cDNA clone, which has minor sequence differences and a longer 3′-untranslated region, has been submitted and has accession number U77720. The sequence of the longest Jagged clone containing the two deletions has also been submitted and has accession number U77914. The predicted protein sequence includes a signal peptide, a DSL domain shared by the Notch ligands Delta, Serrate, LAG-2 and APX-1, 16 tandem epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a cysteine-rich region, a transmembrane domain, and a 125-base pair cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1a). The 5′ end of our 5444-base pair sequence corresponds to position 425 of the rat sequence, at the 14th codon of the predicted 21-residue signal peptide (15Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Two additional Jagged clones were also obtained containing identical deletions, 88 and 1307 base pairs in length. The first deletion is located in the middle of the cysteine-rich region and predicts a frameshift in the translation product, resulting in the insertion of 15 novel amino acid residues followed by a premature termination of the protein, effectively deleting the transmembrane and cytosolic domains from the Jagged translation product (Fig. 1a). To investigate the role of Jagged and Notch in endothelial cell behavior, we used RT-PCR analysis to evaluate the steady-state mRNA levels of Jagged and two related Notch proteins, human TAN-1, and human Notch group protein (Notch 2), in human endothelial cells on fibrin (Fig. 1b). We found that although the Jagged transcript was up-regulated in populations of human endothelial cells exposed to fibrin at the 3-h time point, the steady-state levels of the two Notch transcripts were not changed over the course of 24 h. These results were interesting because they suggest that the human endothelial cell population is able to express both the ligand, Jagged, and its receptor, Notch. Thus, the human endothelial cell may be able to complete an autocrine/juxtacrine signal using fibrin to activate the Notch signal transduction pathway by the regulation of the Jagged gene. Although we suggest the term “autocrine” as appropriate, our data do not allow us to distinguish between a homogenous population expressing both Notch and Jagged proteins or heterogeneous subpopulations of endothelial cells that display Notch, Jagged, both, or neither. To delineate a functional role for Jagged, we designed an antisense Jagged oligomer (16-mer), encompassing the Kozak consensus region, the ATG start codon, and the next three codons of the rat Jagged cDNA sequence. Similar strategies have previously proved useful as a means of repressing the translational efficiency of a wide variety of transcripts in vitro (16Scanlon K.J. Ohta Y. Ishida H. Kijama H. Ohkawa T.

Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We used an in vitro model of angiogenesis in which BME cells can be induced to invade a three-dimensional collagen gel within which they form a network of capillary-like tubes (12Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This model assays for endothelial cell migration, invasion, and capillary morphogenesis in which the angiogenic stimuli FGF (18Montesano R. Vassalli J.-D. Baird A. Guillemin R. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and/or VEGF (13Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) are able to initiate endothelial cell differentiation in vitro. We observed that the antisense oligomer to Jagged was able to qualitatively potentiate FGF-induced invasion of collagen gels as demonstrated by an increase in the network of cords (Fig. 2). Interestingly, this effect was not observed when invasion was induced by VEGF at similar concentrations (data not shown). Thus, the potentiating effect of the antisense oligomer to Jagged is restricted to capillary endothelial cell invasion induced by FGF. When added in the absence of either FGF or VEGF, the antisense oligomer induced the formation of cytoplasmic processes and increased the refractility of cell borders (Fig. 2). In semi-thin sections, cell cords induced within the collagen gels by FGF, both in the absence and presence of the antisense Jagged oligomer, contained lumina (data not shown). A quantitative evaluation of the ability of the antisense Jagged oligomer to potentiate the induction of angiogenesis revealed that the potentiating effect was more prominent if the antisense Jagged oligomer was added every day rather than every other day during the 4-day assay period. When added every day, the antisense Jagged oligomer potentiated FGF-2-induced invasion in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 10 μM oligomer (Fig. 3). FGF-induced capillary endothelial cell invasion was not significantly affected by three control Jagged (16-mer) oligonucleotides (a sense Jagged, a 3′-antisense Jagged (AS) and a mutated 5′-antisense Jagged (MUT) oligomer) added at 2 μM every day during the assay period. An analysis of the structure of the Notch protein provides some insight into the possible involvement of the Jagged-Notch signaling pathway in the process of angiogenesis in vitro. The predicted protein sequence of the Notch receptor contains a cytoplasmic region that has six tandem ankyrin repeats (19Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), a motif found in many functionally diverse proteins (20Bork P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), including members of the rel/NF-κB family (21Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and thought to be responsible for protein-protein interactions. Notch has been shown to interact with a novel ubiquitously distributed cytoplasmic protein deltex through its ankyrin repeats, a domain shown by deletion analysis to be necessary for activity (22Matsuno K. Diederich R.J. Go M.J. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2633-2644PubMed Google Scholar). Another probable component of the pathway is the protein Supressor of Hairless, which when coexpressed with Notch in Drosophila cells, is sequestered in the cytosol, but is translocated to the nucleus when Drosophila Notch binds to its ligand Delta (23Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of these signaling proteins in the regulation of endothelial cell migration is not known, the endothelial cell specificity of the Notch 4 transcript in vivo (9Uyttendaele H. Marazzi G. Wu G. Yan Q. Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2251-2259PubMed Google Scholar) argues that downstream effectors of Notch gene family members are likely to be involved. Because the sensitivity of the capillary endothelial cell to the antisense Jagged oligomer is specific for FGF receptor signaling, it is likely that Jagged-induced Notch signaling represents a process that is able to discriminate between the FGF receptor and VEGF receptor signal transduction pathways. Interestingly, EMB-5, an intracellular protein that binds to the C. elegans Notch protein, LIN-12, contains a Src homology domain (24Hubbard E.J. Dong Q. Greenwald I. Science. 1976; 273: 112-115Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) which may enable the Notch and FGF receptor signaling pathways to interact in the endothelial cell. RT-PCR analysis of the human EMB-5 homolog has demonstrated the presence of the EMB-5 transcript in human endothelial cells (data not shown). Furthermore, since Jagged-mediated signaling is involved in the attenuation of the signaling pathways responsible for the terminal differentiation of myogenic cells (15Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), it is also possible that Jagged-induced signaling mediated by one or more of the Notch gene family members may play an important role in the maintenance of endothelial cell organization in vitro. These observations may also be particularly applicable to breast tumor angiogenesis in that (i) the MMTV int-3 oncogene encodes the intracellular signaling domain of the endothelial cell-specific Notch 4 proto-oncogene (9Uyttendaele H. Marazzi G. Wu G. Yan Q. Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2251-2259PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) the MMTV int-2 oncogene encodes a secreted member of the FGF gene family, FGF-3 (10Wilkinson D.G. Peters G. Dickson C. McMahon A.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), (iii) the MMTV int-1 oncogene encodes wnt-1, a ligand for the Drosophila frizzled gene that signals through the disheveled gene product, a recently characterized Notch-binding protein (25Axelrod J.D. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Perrimon N. Science. 1996; 271: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and (iv) angiogenesis plays an significant role in the pathogenesis of invasive breast cancer (26Weidner N. Semple P.

During catalysis, a majority of NOS-1 binds self-generated NO and converts to a ferrous-NO complex, which causes it to operate at a fraction of its maximum possible activity during the steady state (Abu-Soud, H.

To examine how NO complex formation affects the O2 response of NOS-1, we measured rates of NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation versus O2 concentration in the presence and absence of L-arginine. In the absence of L-arginine, NOS-1 catalyzed simple O2 reduction, and its heme iron displayed a typical affinity for O2 (estimated KmO2≤ 40 μM, saturation at ~100 μM). In the presence of L-arginine, the rates of NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation were proportional to the O2 concentration over a much broader range (estimated KmO2 ~400 μM, saturation at ~800 μM), indicating that ferrous-NO complex formation altered the O2 response of NOS-1. Stopped-flow experiments revealed that the rate of ferrous-NO complex formation was relatively independent of the O2 concentration between 100 and 700 μM, while the rate of complex breakdown was directly proportional to O2 concentration. We conclude that the O2 sensitivity of the ferrous-NO complex governs the O2 response of NOS-1 and thus its activity during the steady state.

(6Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar). The phenomenological constant α′ describes the fraction of the membrane electric field between bulk solution and the Na+-binding site at the external face, α″ is its internal equivalent, and δ is the fraction of the membrane field sensed by the empty binding site on the carrier during translocation; microscopic reversibility requires that α′+α″+δ = 1 (7Läuger P.

The amino acid sequence identity among the SGLT1 isoforms from rat, rabbit, and man exceeds 87% (10Hirayama B.A. Lostao M.P. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Turk E. Wright E.M. Am. J.

The residues which differ for SGLT2 but are conserved throughout the SGLT1 subfamily must account for the different characteristics of SGLT2.

In this study of the functional mechanism for SGLT2, we found that, although SGLT1 and SGLT2 share many similar properties, there were a number of striking differences, including sugar specificity and Na+/glucose coupling.Substrate SelectivityThe reactivity of SGLT2 with αMG (K0.5αMG≈ 3 mM), glucose (K0.5Glc≈ 6 mM) and galactose (K0.5Gal≫ 20 mM), and its exclusion of 3-O-methyl-D-glucopyranoside, L-glucose and mannose, is entirely consistent with the substrate selectivity of the low affinity glucose transport system previously described by Turner and Moran (8Turner R.J. Moran A. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F406-F414PubMed Google Scholar, 9Turner R.J. Moran A. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 70: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) for brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbit outer cortex. SGLT2 reacted with its favored substrates (αMG, glucose) with much lower apparent affinity than SGLT1: K0.5αMG was 6-15-fold higher for SGLT2 than for the SGLT1 isoforms. That SGLT2 failed to react with either mannose or 2-deoxy-D-glucose indicated a requirement for the axial -OH at carbon-2 (C-2) in glucose, as was the case for SGLT1 (11Birnir B. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. Pflügers Arch. 1991; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, SGLT2 also required axial -OH at C-3 (as indicated by the exclusion of allose and 3-O-methyl-D-glucopyranoside) and at C-4 (as indicated by the weak interaction with galactose). Substrate recognition in SGLT2 may also involve hydrophilic interactions around C-6 since xylose and the L-enantiomer of glucose were both excluded.Phlorizin, the classical inhibitor of Na+-coupled glucose transport, is a phenyl-β-glucoside, which prompted us to investigate the interactions of a range of phenylglucosides with pig SGLT2. Our group previously determined for rabbit SGLT1 (14Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that conjugation of the phenyl ring to glucose in the β configuration decreased the apparent affinity but that this was partially restored by the addition of -OH at the C-4 in the phenyl ring (i.e. arbutin). Arbutin evoked a greater current in SGLT2 than did glucose (Fig. 5), suggesting that the phenyl ring can nest in a vestibule possessing both a hydrophobic and a polar region near C-4 of the phenyl ring. SGLT2, in contrast to SGLT1 (14Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), also tolerated one of the phenyl-α-glucosides, suggesting differences in the molecular architecture of the hydrophobic vestibule.Phlorizin potently inhibited the αMG-evoked currents mediated by SGLT2. The phlorizin inhibition constant (KiPz) for SGLT2 was ≈10 μM, higher than that for each of the SGLT1 isoforms (0.01-1.4 μM) (10Hirayama B.A. Lostao M.P. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Turk E. Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G919-G926PubMed Google Scholar, 15Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27099-27105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), consistent with the 10-fold lower affinity of SGLT2 for sugar.These studies indicate that the substrate binding site in SGLT2 is distinct from that of SGLT1 with respect to (i) the residues interacting with the sugar at C-3 and C-4, and (ii) the dimensions of the binding site vestibule. The characteristics of a pig SGLT2-pig SGLT1 chimera indicate that sugar binding is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein (16Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Kong C.-T. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10029-10034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In particular, the hydrophilic loops between putative membrane domains M10/11, M12/13, and M13/14 possess substituted residues in pSGLT2 which are otherwise conserved throughout the SGLT family and may underlie the observed differences in sugar binding.Mechanisms of Na+/Glucose CotransportDespite differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2 in Na+ coupling and voltage dependence, their steady-state properties were very similar. As for SGLT1 (13Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21407-21410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Li+ and H+ could each substitute for Na+ in driving sugar transport mediated by SGLT2, most effectively at hyperpolarized Vm. Na+ binding appears to be Vm-dependent and saturable with hyperpolarization. K0.5Na was more steeply voltage-dependent in SGLT1 than in SGLT2: K0.5Na for SGLT1 was ≈ 3-fold higher than SGLT2 at −150 mV, but 5-15-fold higher at −50 mV. However, in general the changes in K0.5 and Imax for SGLT2 arising from varying Vm or cosubstrate concentration were very similar to SGLT1.The data for SGLT2 are consistent with an ordered, simultaneous transport mechanism (Fig. 7) in which Na+ binds first. The K0.5 increased sharply with diminishing cosubstrate concentration, indicating that both substrates were translocated simultaneously, rather than consecutively in which case the K0.5 values are expected to decrease (17Jauch P. Läuger P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The order of binding, Na+ first, sugar second, was revealed by the Imax data: ImaxNa was dependent upon [αMG]o, but ImaxαMG was not affected by varying [Na+]o; i.e. saturating αMG could always drive the transporter to its maximal rate regardless of [Na+]o, whereas [αMG]o imposed a limitation upon the maximal rate of the transporter even at saturating Na+. The magnitude of the sugar-uncoupled Na+ influx being <8% of the maximal sugar-evoked current suggests that the preferred configuration for translocation across the membrane is the fully loaded “carrier-Na+-sugar” complex (Fig. 7, states 3 → 4).Thus SGLT2 and SGLT1 share a common mechanism in which the cation (Na+, Li+, and H+) binds before glucose, followed by a simultaneous translocation step, but with distinct Na+: glucose coupling stoichiometry, 1:1 for SGLT2 and 2:1 for SGLT1. Subtle differences in the shapes of the I/Vm curves for SGLT2 and SGLT1 imply that the rate-limiting steps may differ between the two transporters.Transient Charge MovementsThe characteristics of the presteady-state charge movements for pig SGLT2 (Fig. 4) were similar to those obtained for SGLT1 and the other Na+- and H+-driven transporters (see Table I in Ref. 18Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As for SGLT1,2 we attribute the transient currents to movement of SGLT2 charged particles within the transmembrane electric field since these transients are (i) absent in control-injected oocytes and (ii) abolished by the addition of sugar or the specific inhibitor phlorizin. Transient currents decayed with time constants of 3-7 ms, within the same range determined for the other cotransporters; in considering species differences, the SGLT2 time constants may not differ from SGLT1 (cf. 4-25 ms for the rat, rabbit, and human isoforms). Whereas V0.5 at saturating activator concentration for most other cotransporters ranged from −50 mV to 0 mV (including the SGLT1 isoforms), we estimated that V0.5 for SGLT2 at saturating Na+ (100 mM) was ≈+60 mV. This indicated that at resting membrane potential a greater proportion of the SGLT2 ligand binding sites are oriented extracellularly compared with the other cotransporters. For SGLT2, the shift in V0.5 brought about by a 10-fold increase in activator (Na+) concentration was ≈+100 mV, similar to that for other cotransporters. For both SGLT2 and SGLT1 (4Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar),2 the apparent valence (z) was ≈1 and did not change with [Na+]o.Using the relation Qmax = CT·z·e (for which e is the elementary charge) the density (CT) of functional SGLT2 carriers in the oocyte membrane was in the order of 1011/oocyte. The validity of estimating transporter density from charge movement data for transporters and ion channels expressed in oocytes was confirmed using freeze-fracture electron microscopy (19Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The turnover rate of the fully loaded transporter, given by Imax/Qmax, was ≈60s−1 and was similar to that determined for the other cotransporters. Thus we conclude that the presteady-state kinetic properties of SGLT2 are very similar to SGLT1.Model Predictions Resulting from Changing Na+/Glucose Coupling from 2:1 to 1:1Our conclusion that the kinetic behavior of SGLT2 is very similar to SGLT1 suggests a common mechanism, but with different stoichiometry. What changes in kinetic parameters should we expect as a direct result of reducing the Na+/glucose coupling stoichiometry from 2:1 (as for SGLT1) to 1:1 (as for SGLT2)? We simulated the six-state kinetic model of rabbit SGLT1 (6Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar, 12Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and determined the specific consequences of changing the Na+-coupling coefficient (n) from 2 to 1 (Fig. 8) without altering any other parameters. Allowing for some quantitative discrepancies that may arise from comparing SGLT homologues from different species, the n = 1 model predicts a number of changes which are consistent with experimental observations for pig SGLT2: (i) the observed reduction in K0.5Na and the reduced voltage dependence on K0.5Na (Fig. 8A). The rabbit model predicted K0.5Na to decrease by an order of magnitude upon decreasing n from 2 to 1, whereas the observed change for pig SGLT2 was 3-5-fold; however, this difference was reconciled by a reduction in k23o (the rate constant for external sugar binding) by an order of magnitude (see below for justification, and Fig. 3B); (ii) no change in the apparent affinity for αMG at negative Vm, and a less marked voltage dependence (Fig. 8B). This predicted voltage dependence was observed for rabbit SGLT1 when [Na+]o was low: when each were compared at 10 mM Na+, K0.5αMG for pig SGLT2 displayed significantly less voltage-dependence than that for rabbit SGLT1 (Fig. 6A of Ref. 6Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar). At all Vm, K0.5αMG was higher for SGLT2 than that predicted by the n = 1 model, but since the molecular architecture of the SGLT2 sugar binding site is discrete from that of SGLT1 (see above, and Fig. 5), we should not expect such a change to arise simply from the reduction in n; (iii) shifts in the I/Vm and Q/Vm relationships toward more positive Vm (Fig. 8, C and D). These predictions were consistent with presteady-state data, although the steady-state evoked currents in SGLT2 varied over the Vm range as for SGLT1 rather than shifting to depolarized Vm; (iv) a 50% reduction in Qmax (Fig. 8D), which may in part account for the lower sugar-dependent currents typically obtained for SGLT2 compared with SGLT1 assuming similar levels of expression; and (v) a reduction in z from 1.4 to 0.9 (Fig. 8D), close to the measured value for SGLT2. Thus, collectively, the kinetic properties of SGLT2 are largely accounted for by the change in Na+-coupling from 2 to 1.Fig. 8Model prediction of the effects of changing the 2 Na+: 1 αMG coupling stoichiometry of rabbit SGLT1 to 1:1. Presteady-state and steady-state currents were simulated (at 20°C) using the kinetic model for SGLT1 (6Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

These were compared with predictions using the n = 1 model with identical rate constants. A and B, apparent affinity constants for αMG and Na+ (at 100 mM Na+, and 2 mM αMG, respectively). C, predictions of the currents evoked by 2 mM αMG in 100 mM Na+, normalized according to Io, the current at saturating hyperpolarization (−200 mV). D, simulation of charge movements Q as a function of Vm; [Na+]o = 100 mM, [Na+]i = 10 mM, [αMG]o = [αMG]i = 0. Q was normalized by setting Qo (i.e. Q at extreme depolarized limits) for the n = 1 model equal to Qo for the n = 2 model. Simulated data predicted Qmax = 32 nC, z = 1.4, V0.5 = −15 mV for the n = 2 model; and Qmax = 16 nC, z = 0.9, V0.5 = +19 mV for the n = 1 model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Model Simulation of Presteady-state Kinetics and Steady-state Na+/αMG Cotransport Kinetics for SGLT2Presteady-state and steady-state currents for pig SGLT2 were simulated according to the six-state model (Fig. 7) assuming 1 Na+: 1 αMG coupling stoichiometry as suggested by Hill analysis; the model is otherwise identical to that proposed for SGLT1 (6Parent L.

We found that the model could account qualitatively for the steady-state (Fig. 3) and presteady-state (Fig. 4) phenomena without changing the rate constants for rabbit SGLT1 (12Panayotova-Heiermann M.

The kinetic data in the Vm range −150 to −50 mV indicated that the Na+ binding and charge transfer steps in the cycle were at saturation, since K0.5Na was Vm-independent within this range (at saturating αMG) and V0.5 was extremely positive. However, that the measured (but not predicted) I/Vm curves still displayed Vm dependence within this Vm range implies that the model requires an additional voltage-dependent step in the transport cycle, e.g. Na+ dissociation at the internal face (states 5 → 6).ConclusionWe have presented kinetic data demonstrating that Na+/glucose cotransport mediated by SGLT2 can be described by an ordered, simultaneous transport model in which Na+ binds first. In the absence of sugar, SGLT2 exhibited Na+-dependent transient charge movements which we attribute to reorientation of the charged carrier within the membrane. Taken together, these observations suggest that SGLT1 and SGLT2 share a common mechanism despite their functional differences. Among these apparent differences are the change in apparent Na+: αMG coupling from 2:1 for SGLT1 to 1:1 for SGLT2, and the reduction in K0.5Na observed for SGLT2. However, our model predicts that the reduced K0.5Na is a direct consequence of the change in Na+ coupling altering the rate k12 (according to Equation A1). Since this change need not involve a change in the rate constant k12o (which is a reflection of ligand binding affinity per se), it is likely that the Na+ binding site in SGLT2 is identical to one of the binding sites in SGLT1. The general reduction in apparent affinities for sugar and the effective exclusion of galactose suggests that the molecular architecture of the sugar binding site in SGLT2 is quite distinct from that of SGLT1. In ongoing structure-function studies of the Na+/glucose cotransporters, the challenge is now to identify the molecular basis for these functional differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2. INTRODUCTIONIn the proximal tubule of the kidney, reabsorption of filtered glucose at the apical membrane is mediated by one or more Na+/glucose cotransporters.

We determined the dependence of the steady-state kinetics on Na+ and αMG concentrations, and examined presteady-state charge movements associated with SGLT2. We have also extended our analysis of the substrate selectivity of SGLT2, its cation activation, and the effects of phlorizin upon both the uncoupled and the sugar-coupled Na+ pathways through the transporter."

In primary cortical neuron cultures, neurotoxic cell death and [3H]arachidonate metabolism was studied after adding glutamate and sPLA2 from bee venom. sPLA2, at concentrations eliciting low neurotoxicity (≤100 ng/ml), induced a decrease of [3H]arachidonate-phospholipids and preferential reesterification of the fatty acid into triacylglycerols. Free [3H]arachidonic acid accumulated at higher enzyme concentrations, below those exerting highest toxicity. Synergy in neurotoxicity and [3H]arachidonate release was observed when low, nontoxic (10 ng/ml, 0.71 nM), or mildly toxic (25 ng/ml, 1.78 nM) concentrations of sPLA2 were added together with glutamate (80 μM). A similar synergy was observed with the sPLA2 OS2, from Taipan snake venom. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocked glutamate effects and partially inhibited sPLA2 OS2 but not sPLA2 from bee venom-induced arachidonic acid release. Thus, the synergy with glutamate and very low concentrations of exogenously added sPLA2 suggests a potential role for this enzyme in the modulation of glutamatergic synaptic function and of excitotoxicity.

Free [3H]arachidonic acid accumulated at higher enzyme concentrations, below those exerting highest toxicity. Synergy in neurotoxicity and [3H]arachidonate release was observed when low, nontoxic (10 ng/ml, 0.71 nM), or mildly toxic (25 ng/ml, 1.78 nM) concentrations of sPLA2 were added together with glutamate (80 μM). A similar synergy was observed with the sPLA2 OS2, from Taipan snake venom. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocked glutamate effects and partially inhibited sPLA2 OS2 but not sPLA2 from bee venom-induced arachidonic acid release. Thus, the synergy with glutamate and very low concentrations of exogenously added sPLA2 suggests a potential role for this enzyme in the modulation of glutamatergic synaptic function and of excitotoxicity.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Secretory PLA2 are also present in the brain. The expression of sPLA2 type II is stimulated in the rat brain by ischemia/reperfusion (21Lauritzen I. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Brain Res. 1994; 651: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and in cultured astrocytes by inflammatory mediators (22Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9956-9960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, sPLA2 type II is stored in synaptic vesicles and released by depolarization or neurotransmitter stimulation, and its secretion is coupled with the activation of catecholamine release (23Matsuzawa A. Makoto M. Atsumi G. Imal K. Prados P. Inoue K. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sPLA2 causes activation of Glu release in the rat cerebral cortex (24O'Regan M.H. Smith-Barbour M. Perkins L.M. Phillips J.W. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 185: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). sPLA2 bind to cell surface receptors, the N type and the M type (25Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Neurotoxic sPLA2 from Taipan snake venom, OS2, and from bee venom bind to the N-type receptor with high affinity (25Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Other sPLA2s such as OS1, also purified from Taipan snake venom, display higher enzymatic activity than the sPLA2s OS2 and bee venom (2.7- and 7-fold higher, respectively) (25Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although OS1 binds with high affinity to M-type receptors (26Lambeau G.

Activation of cPLA2 mediates the formation of modulators of synaptic transmission such as free AA (8Bazan N.G. Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Allan G. J.

Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Allan G. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 791-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).

Glu, which causes excitotoxic neuronal damage, increases calcium influx through NMDA receptors in postsynaptic neurons, leading to PLA2-mediated AA release (34Dumuis A. Sebben M. Haynes J.-P.

Neurosurg. 1992; 76: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, the activation of two calcium-dependent cPLA2s (100 and 14 kDa) by Glu was reported (16Kim D.K. Rordorf G. Nemenoff R.A. Koroshetz W.J. Bonventre J.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other PLA2s are modulators of membrane PL metabolism and/or generate membrane fusogenic molecules, i.e. free fatty acids and lyso-PLs. However, non-AA-specific-sPLA2s contribute, together with the cPLA2, to modulate AA metabolism under physiological conditions and in primed conditions (5Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim.

For example, sPLA2 from Naja mocambique, as well as the PLA2 activator melittin, have previously been shown to promote neural injury, in vitro and in vivo (44Clapp L.E. Klette K.L. DeCoster M.A. Bernton E. Petras J.M. Dave J.R. Laskosky M.S. Smallridge R.C. Tortella F.C. Brain Res. 1995; 693: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The present study has tested the hypothesis that sPLA2 potentiates neurotoxicity by Glu by briefly exposing rat cortical neuronal cultures to this neurotransmitter in the presence of and in the absence of sPLA2. This hypothesis is supported in part by the observation that sPLA2 is released at synapses from vesicles that also store Glu (23Matsuzawa A. Makoto M. Atsumi G. Imal K. Prados P. Inoue K. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). sPLA2 from bee venom and Taipan snake venom OS2, ligands of the N-type sPLA2 receptor, and OS1 from Taipan snake venom, a ligand of the M-type sPLA2 receptor, have been used (25Lambeau G.

Our study has addressed the following: (a) the effect of Glu-activated cPLA2 and exogenously added sPLA2 on [3H]AA release from neuronal PLs; (b) the action of MK-801 on agonist-induced AA changes and neurotoxicity; (c) the neurotoxic potential of exogenously added sPLA2 (OS2 and bee venom sPLA2); and (d) the neurotoxic effect of the excitatory neurotransmitter Glu and sPLA2 when added to the cells simultaneously. [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,-3H]Arachidonic acid ([3H]AA, 185 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Silicagel GHL TLC plates were from Analtech, Inc. (Newark, DE). Bovine serum albumin fatty acid-free and lipid standards were from Sigma. Organic solvents (high pressure liquid chromatography grade) were from EM Science. sPLA2 from bee venom and OS1 and OS2 from Taipan snake venom were purified as described previously (25Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical neuronal cultures were established from 15-day-old rat embryos as described previously (46DeCoster M.A. Koening M.L. Hunter J.C. Tortella F.C. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 47Klette K.L. DeCoster M.A. Moreton J.E. Tortella F.C. Brain Res. 1995; 704: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in poly-L-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 48-well plates for toxicity experiments and 7.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates for lipid analysis. The cells were cultured in neuronal culture medium (NCM) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Astrocyte proliferation was prevented by adding cytosine arabinoside (10−5 M) at day 4 after plating, left on for 3 days, and then replaced with minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum. Cells were used for experiments at 14-21 days in vitro. The percentage of neuronal versus glial cells remained at approximately 80 versus 20%, respectively, as previously reported (48DeCoster M.A. Yourick D.L. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 12: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was used to quantitatively assess cell injury. Cells were treated as described previously (47Klette K.L. DeCoster M.A. Moreton J.E. Tortella F.C. Brain Res. 1995; 704: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and LDH release was measured 20 h after exposure to sPLA2 and/or Glu. Briefly, cells were exposed for 45 min at room temperature to highly purified sPLA2 from bee venom and snake venom (OS1 or OS2) and/or Glu (80 μM) in Locke's solution without magnesium. Locke's solution was exchanged with minimum essential medium without phenol red, and the cultures were returned to the CO2 incubator for 20 h at 37°C. Using similar cortical neuron culture, this procedure results in minimal LDH release before 12 h and maximal release by 20 h (49Frandsen A. Shousboe A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1990; 8: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The LDH release was assayed using the Sigma kit with the aid of a DU series 640 Beckman spectrophotometer equipped with a graphic video display. Cells were labeled overnight with [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/well, specific activity 184.6 Ci/mmol) in minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. 18-20 h later, the medium of cell cultures was replaced with minimum essential medium. The cells were exposed to Glu and/or sPLA2 as described previously and returned to the CO2 incubator for 2 and 20 h at 37°C. The supernatants were removed, and 750 μl of methanol was added to each well. The cells were scraped and transferred into a glass tube, and chloroform was added in the following proportion: chloroform:methanol, 2:1 (v/v). Lipids were extracted by sonication for 30 min, and the lipid extracts were washed following the procedure of Folch et al. (50Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots in duplicate were taken to determine total [3H]AA incorporation by liquid scintillation counting. Neutral lipids and total PLs were isolated by monodimensional TLC on precoated, 0.25-mm-thick, silica gel GHL plates using hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid, 40:60:1.3 (v/v/v), as a developing solvent. For the results presented in Table I, the composition of the chromatographic solvent was changed to 60:40:1.3 (v/v/v) in order to isolate cholesterol ester (CHE) from triacylglycerols (TAG) that run together in the first system. The results indicated that changes observed in previous experiments in the CHE plus TAG fraction were due mainly to TAG. Lipid standards were added to the samples as a carrier and were spotted in a parallel line on the TLC plate to individualize each lipid band. TLC plates were developed with iodine, lipid bands were scraped, and the radioactivity was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter.Table IPercentage of labeling of [3H]AA-lipids from neuronal cells in culture 20 h after treatment with sPLA2 and glutamateConditionLabelingTotalCHETAGFFADAGPL%%%%%dpm/wellControln = 85.8 ± 0.84.9 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.186.6 ± 1.3261,084 ± 10,723Glun = 48.2 ± 0.6*7.3 ± 0.5*1.3 ± 0.1*2.3 ± 0.2*80.8 ± 1.0*242,010 ± 15,687Glu + MK-801n = 46.7 ± 0.64.7 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.01.5 ± 0.286.1 ± 0.6261,186 ± 24,050sPLA2n = 49.9 ± 1.2*15.7 ± 1.3*2.3 ± 0.1*2.1 ± 0.370.1 ± 2.3*226,002 ± 11,425*sPLA2+ MK-801n = 47.5 ± 1.514.6 ± 2.2*2.3 ± 0.3*1.8 ± 0.273.8 ± 3.2*251,838 ± 14,374sPLA2+ GLUn = 47.4 ± 1.128.8 ± 4.0*4.0 ± 0.8*2.9 ± 0.1*56.9 ± 4.9*225,108 ± 15,953sPLA2+ GLU + MK-801n = 47.3 ± 0.713.5 ± 1.4*2.2 ± 0.8*2.5 ± 0.474.4 ± 1.2*229,122 ± 11,353OS2n = 311.3 ± 1.9*22.2 ± 3.7*4.7 ± 0.9*2.1 ± 0.1*59.6 ± 6.3*168,961 ± 50,967*OS2 + MK-801n = 26.2 ± 2.016.6 ± 4.12.3 ± 0.92.3 ± 0.172.6 ± 6.9224,448 ± 42,155OS2 + GLUn = 36.0 ± 0.332.8 ± 2.6*15.4 ± 3.3*3.8 ± 0.2*41.8 ± 5.8*173,664 ± 1144*OS2 + GLU + MK-801n = 25.0 ± 0.514.8 ± 3.02.5 ± 0.62.1 ± 0.075.5 ± 4.1233,448 ± 13,950 Open table in a new tab The significance of the data was evaluated with Student's t test for unpaired data. Statistical values were considered significantly different when p ≤ 0.05. Neurotoxicity of sPLA2 from bee venom, added alone or with Glu (80 μM) to primary neuronal cortical cultures, was studied by measuring LDH release (Fig. 1). A neurotoxic concentration of Glu (47Klette K.L. DeCoster M.A. Moreton J.E. Tortella F.C. Brain Res. 1995; 704: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) resulted in 92 ± 7% increase in LDH release compared with control cells (n = 54 from 10 different platings). No significant toxicity was observed with bee venom sPLA2 concentrations up to 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). At higher concentrations up to 103 ng/ml, the neurotoxicity displayed by sPLA2 was biphasic. First, there was a dose-dependent increase in LDH release (up to 500 ng/ml, EC50 = 7.1 nM), followed by a sharp 4.3-fold increase in LDH at 103 ng/ml (EC50 = 57 nM). The sPLA2 neurotoxicity at 100 ng/ml (7.1 nM) was similar to that of 80 μM Glu (Fig. 1). An additive neurotoxic effect was observed when cells were exposed simultaneously to 80 μM Glu and low (1-5 ng/ml) or high (50-103 ng/ml) sPLA2 concentrations (Fig. 1, inset). The combination of sPLA2 in a concentration range of 10-25 ng/ml with Glu led to a significant synergy on LDH release, resulting in values 2.3-2.4-fold higher than those of the additive effects of sPLA2 and Glu. The sPLA2 OS2 purified from snake venom was found to be more potent as a neurotoxin than the sPLA2 from bee venom. For example, at 25 ng/ml OS2 was approximately 2.7-fold more toxic than bee venom sPLA2 at the same concentration (Fig. 2). Furthermore, under conditions where the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 blocked 100% of 80 μM Glu toxicity, MK-801 partially blocked OS2, but not bee venom sPLA2-induced toxicity. OS1 did not evoke neuronal death even at 10 μg/ml (LDH percentage above control = 18 ± 9%). [3H]AA-prelabeled neuronal cells were exposed to different concentrations of bee venom sPLA2 for 45 min and further incubated for 20 h (Fig. 3). No differences were observed in total [3H]AA labeling recovered per dish at very low, nontoxic sPLA2 concentration (1 ng/ml). At higher concentrations (25-50 ng/ml), the recovery was decreased by 10% and by 20-30% at more toxic concentrations (500-103 ng/ml), reflecting cell loss and matching the neurotoxicity assays (Fig. 1). After 20 h the [3H]AA distribution displayed a concentration-dependent loss of [3H]AA-PLs paralleled by an increase in free [3H]AA, [3H]AA-TAG and [3H]AA-DAG. A significant loss in PL labeling was observed even at the lowest sPLA2 concentration (−7%, p < 0.05), reaching values 50% lower at the highest toxic concentrations (500-103 ng/ml). Up to 100 ng/ml sPLA2, the loss of [3H]AA from phospholipids (−29%) was paralleled by its active reesterification into TAG, which showed a 25% increase above the control value. Within this range of sPLA2 concentration, free [3H]AA showed a small yet significant gradual increase, reaching values 2- and 4.5-fold higher than controls at 1 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml, respectively. The [3H]AA-TAG labeling plateaued at 500 ng/ml sPLA2. This was paralleled by a large increase in free [3H]AA accumulation, which reached a value 20-fold higher than control. [3H]DAG labeling was very low, displaying the same pattern of changes as free [3H]AA and reaching a 2-fold increase in percentage of labeling at high sPLA2 concentration (500 ng/ml). To ascertain if [3H]AA released by bee venom sPLA2 was acylated into TAG and whether or not this correlated with neurotoxicity, the following experiment was performed. The [3H]AA metabolism as affected by a nontoxic concentration of sPLA2 (1 ng/ml) and by a toxic concentration of Glu (80 μM), added individually or combined, was studied at 2 and 20 h after treatment with the agonists (Fig. 4). sPLA2 induced a similar decrease in [3H]AA-PL labeling both at 2 and 20 h. Differences were observed, however, in the distribution of labeling between free [3H]AA and [3H]AA-TAG. Free [3H]AA accumulation was greater at 2 h, decreasing by 20 h concomitantly with an increase in [3H]AA-TAG. Glu alone triggered a similar loss in [3H]AA-PL compared with sPLA2 by 2 h; however, by 20 h, loss of [3H]AA from PL was 2.8-fold greater than at 2 h. After treatment with Glu alone, free [3H]AA and [3H]AA-TAG varied as a function of time (similar to when sPLA2 was added alone), with higher accumulation of free [3H]AA by 2 h and a preferential reesterification of [3H]AA into TAG by 20 h. sPLA2 and Glu added together greatly magnified the pattern of [3H]AA changes as a function of time. A synergy on free [3H]AA accumulation was observed due to an apparently less efficient esterification into TAG. By 20 h the level of free [3H]AA reached 1.8-2-fold higher values than when both agonists were individually added. The loss of [3H]AA from PLs was additive, as was the accumulation of [3H]AA-DAG induced at 2 and 20 h. The involvement of NMDA receptors on AA release from PLs induced by sPLA2 and Glu was investigated by preincubating cells with 300 nM MK-801 for 10 min prior to adding the agonists, followed by lipid analysis 20 h later. Both at low, nontoxic (1 ng/ml) (data not shown) and at higher (25 ng/ml) bee venom sPLA2 concentrations (Table I), MK-801 did not block the release of [3H]AA from PLs. The phospholipid labeling was decreased by 17% (p < 0.002), from 87% in controls to 70% in sPLA2-treated cells. Most of the [3H]AA released from PL (+11%) was found reesterified into TAG (5 versus 16% for control and sPLA2-treated, respectively) and to a lesser extent in CHE (+4%, p < 0.03), while free [3H]AA labeling was doubled (from 1 to 2%, p < 0.03). MK-801 pretreatment did not alter the profile of lipid labeling, i.e. the decrease in PLs and the parallel increase in TAG and free AA labeling. Glu (80 μM), although more toxic than 25 ng/ml bee venom sPLA2 (sPLA2 toxicity 29% compared with Glu; Fig. 1), induced only a 6% (p < 0.002) decrease in PL labeling concomitantly with increased labeling of TAG (+2%, p < 0.004), CHE (+2%, p < 0.02), and FFA (+0.4%, p < 0.03). MK-801 pretreatment blocked by 100% Glu-induced PL degradation and other lipid changes. Higher degradation of PLs was observed when bee venom sPLA2 and Glu were added together to the cells (−30%). Labeling of TAG increased by 24%, an"

INTRODUCTIONMitochondrial heme lyases catalyze the covalent attachment of heme to the apoforms of c-type cytochromes (1Gonzales D.H. Neupert W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 753-768PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dumont M.E. Hartl F.U. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). In this reaction two thioether bonds are formed between two cysteinyl residues in the cytochromes and the vinyl groups of heme. Only the reduced form of heme is a suitable substrate for the heme lyase enzymes (3Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At present, three examples of heme lyases have been studied in some detail (see below), namely the cytochrome c1 heme lyase (CC1HL) 2The abbreviations used are: CC1HLcytochrome c1 heme lyaseCCHLcytochrome c heme lyaseALASδ-aminolevulinic acid synthaseCC1HLSPVCC1HL in which the cysteinyl residue of the CPV motif has been converted to a seryl residueCC1HLΔCPVCC1HL from which the CPV motif has been deletedPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisF1ββ-subunit of F1-ATPase. of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Zollner A.

Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and Neurospora crassa (6Drygas M.E. Lambowitz A.M. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17897-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes are distinct in their substrate specificity in that each heme lyase can only convert its own apocytochrome substrate into the holo form.Our knowledge of the participation of heme lyases in the biogenesis of the cytochromes is limited to their role in the import of the apoproteins into mitochondria. CCHL, in addition to facilitating covalent heme attachment (7Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plays an important role in driving the import of apocytochrome c from the cytosol (9Dumont M.E. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). During or immediately after its reversible passage across the mitochondrial outer membrane, apocytochrome c associates with CCHL (10Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The energy gained from this specific complex formation is believed to trap apocytochrome c in the intermembrane space.CC1HL is involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c1 in a rather different manner. The precursor of the latter protein is synthesized in the cytosol with a bipartite signal sequence that, upon import into mitochondria (11Lill R. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is processed in two proteolytic steps (12Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Böhni P.C. Gibson J. Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Removal of the matrix-targeting sequence by the matrix-processing peptidase is followed by the cleavage of its intermembrane space sorting signal. The second processing step is catalyzed by inner membrane protease subunit 2 and has been shown to be strictly dependent upon heme attachment (12Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Böhni P.C. Gibson J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which is mediated by CC1HL (15Nicholson D.W. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10156-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, yeast cells lacking CC1HL accumulate the heme-free intermediate size form of cytochrome c1 and are deficient in the mature holo form (4Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism of how heme lyases participate in covalent heme attachment is poorly understood (see Ref. 16Lill R. Kispal G. Künkele K.P. Mayer A. Risse B. Steiner H. Heckmeyer P. Van der Klei I. Court D.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Proceedings of the NATO/ASI, Cell Biology: Molecular Dynamics of Biomembranes. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 137-155Google Scholar). For instance, it has never been shown that heme lyases catalyze the heme attachment reaction themselves. Moreover, heme binding to heme lyases has not been demonstrated. No information is available about the chemical nature of the binding sites for heme and for the apoproteins. Furthermore, it is not known whether the two thioether bonds are formed in a sequential or simultaneous manner.The heme lyases known to date share about 35% identical amino acid residues (50% similarity; see Ref. 4Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). Especially in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of these proteins, there are a number of conserved sequence blocks, suggesting that this part is particularly important for their function. The NH2 termini of the heme lyases do not display striking sequence conservation with the exception of CPX-sequences (X = V, M, I, L; hereafter termed CPV motif) present in all of these enzymes. This CPV motif is found two or three times at the amino termini of CCHL proteins and once at the amino terminus of yeast CC1HL (see Fig. 4A). The functional role of these CPV motifs in heme lyases has not been investigated so far. In two other proteins, similar motifs have been implicated to act as heme regulatory motifs. The transcriptional activator HAP1 (CYP1) contains seven CPV motifs (17Creusot F. Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Heme binding to these motifs causes dissociation of a HAP1-bound repressor factor, allowing HAP1 to bind to DNA thereby activating transcription (19Fytlovich S. Gervais M. Agrimonti C. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two copies of a similar motif (CPF) are present in the presequences of several mammalian δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) precursors. They were shown to confer heme inhibition of import of the ALAS precursor into mitochondria (21Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of such a sequence in heme binding to proteins.Using CC1HL as a model protein we show by several in vitro approaches that heme lyases can interact directly with heme. Thus, heme lyases are able to bind both substrates of the heme attachment reaction, namely the apoform of the cytochromes (10Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and heme (this study). A mutant CC1HL, in which the cysteinyl residue of the CPV motif has been converted to a seryl residue (termed CC1HLSPV) failed to interact with heme in these in vitro experiments, suggesting that the CPV sequence serves as part of the heme binding site. The crucial role of the CPV sequence in recruiting heme to CC1HL is supported further by the phenotype of a yeast strain expressing CC1HLSPV. Strongly reduced levels of mature holocytochrome c1 and an accumulation of the heme-free intermediate form underline the importance of the CPV motif for the heme attachment reaction.DISCUSSIONThe work described here contributes to the functional dissection of the molecular mechanism of heme attachment to the apo forms of c-type cytochromes. Using CC1HL as a model protein, we provide several lines of evidence that mitochondrial heme lyases bind heme. CC1HL was stabilized by heme against tryptic digestion; heme accelerated the refolding of denatured CC1HL severalfold, and the in vitro import of CC1HL precursor into the intermembrane space of isolated mitochondria was specifically inhibited by heme. Recently, it was shown that heme lyase forms a complex with the apopotein (10Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, both substrates of the heme attachment reaction can interact with the heme lyase protein. This makes it very likely that heme lyases themselves perform the catalytic function during thioether formation and therefore may contain the active site that promotes heme attachment.From our in vivo and in vitro studies, the conserved CPV sequence appears to represent an important yet not essential structural element required for proper function of mitochondrial heme lyases. CC1HL with an altered CPV motif no longer interacts strongly with heme in our biochemical experiments and is largely impaired in converting the intermediate apoform of cytochrome c1 to the holo form. Thus, as found with other CPV-containing proteins, this motif may be required for efficient binding of heme. How might heme binding to the CPV motif of heme lyases influence the process of covalent heme attachment to the cytochromes? One possibility is that the CPV motif forms part of the substrate binding site for heme. The higher affinity for heme will lead to an increased concentration of heme close to the active site, thereby explaining the observed higher specific activities of enzymes carrying the CPV motif. Another not mutually exclusive view for the function of the CPV motif is that the association of heme with this structural element properly positions the two vinyl groups of heme in the active site of the protein, thereby increasing the efficiency of the thioether formation with the cytochromes. In an attractive alternative model, the NH2 terminus of heme lyases containing the CPV motifs could serve as a flexible arm collecting heme and moving it into the active site of the enzyme. This model would readily explain why this part of heme lyases is important yet not essential for their catalytic function.A conformational alteration upon heme binding to CC1HL is evident from the stabilization of the protein against tryptic digestion in the presence of heme. This structural rearrangement is mediated through the CPV sequence, since proteins with alterations in this motif do not acquire resistance to trypsin. Changes in the conformation of heme lyases may be of importance for the catalytic action during heme attachment, e.g. by moving the reactive sulfhydryl and vinyl groups close to each other to allow the nucleophilic addition. It will be interesting to see whether conformational changes as a result of heme binding may be a general mechanism that is utilized by CPV-containing proteins to influence various biological processes involving regulatory circuits or substrate binding.The CPV consensus sequence can be regarded as a commonly used structural motif for noncovalent binding of heme to various proteins. Two such proteins have been investigated already. A particularly well studied case is the heme-dependent regulation of transcription by the HAP1 protein, which contains seven CPV consensus motifs (17Creusot F. Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). By the use of short peptides corresponding to such a motif, heme binding to the CPV sequence could be directly demonstrated in a spectroscopic study (36Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A second case of heme binding was reported for the precursors of ALAS which contain two copies of similar motifs in their mitochondrial targeting sequence. These CPF motifs were shown to confer heme inhibition of ALAS import into the organelles (21Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), similar to our observations with CC1HL. For the ALAS proteins this inhibitory effect by heme was suggested to play an important function in vivo and allow the fine tuning of the erythroid heme biosynthesis. It thus is thought to add another level of regulation to heme biosynthesis by inhibiting the mitochondrial uptake of the key enzyme of this process. Therefore the CPV motif was termed the heme regulatory motif (21Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In yeast it has been shown that expression of CC1HL is independent of heme (37Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems unlikely, yet not impossible, that in fungi heme exerts a comparable regulatory function in the biosynthesis of c-type cytochromes by controlling the import of heme lyases into mitochondria.A common feature of heme-binding proteins containing a CPV motif is the transient character of the interaction. In the case of heme lyases, binding of heme was too labile to allow retention of the proteins on heme-agarose resins (not shown). The loose association of heme with these proteins is quite different from the situation observed for heme binding to cytochromes, globin, or other heme-binding proteins (see e.g. 38Robertson D.E. Farid R.S. Moser C.C. Urbauer J.L. Mulholland S.E. Pidikiti R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. DeGrado W.F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), where a stable interaction is needed to ensure proper biochemical function. In the light of the findings presented here, a general view of the function of a CPV sequence may be that of a reversible heme binding site allowing for the transient interaction with this hydrophobic compound. Structural studies are now needed to understand the molecular nature of how heme is specifically recognized by the CPV sequence.The property of reversible association with heme via the CPV or a similar motif may have been utilized in a variety of proteins participating in diverse biological processes. Some examples of these proteins such as catalase, HRI kinase, and heme oxygenase-2 have already been discussed in some detail (36Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Further interesting CPV motif-containing proteins are found to be involved in the biogenesis of bacterial c-type cytochromes (for review, see Refs. 39Thöny-Meyer L. Ritz D. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 40Thöny-Meyer L. Loferer H. Ritz D. Hennecke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or in nitrite reduction (41Hussain H. Grove J. Griffiths L. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Ccl2 gene product of Rhodobacter capsulatus and its other bacterial homologs also contain a CPV motif. It is therefore tempting to speculate that these proteins represent the functional counterparts of mitochondrial heme lyases. Except for this short consensus motif, the mitochondrial and bacterial proteins do not exhibit significant similarity. This raises the interesting possibility that mitochondrial and bacterial heme lyases have evolved from different ancestral proteins yet use a similar mechanism to recruit heme to the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme. Direct biochemical studies will be necessary to test this important aspect of c-type cytochrome biogenesis. INTRODUCTIONMitochondrial heme lyases catalyze the covalent attachment of heme to the apoforms of c-type cytochromes (1Gonzales D.H. Neupert W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 753-768PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dumont M.E. Hartl F.U. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). In this reaction two thioether bonds are formed between two cysteinyl residues in the cytochromes and the vinyl groups of heme. Only the reduced form of heme is a suitable substrate for the heme lyase enzymes (3Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At present, three examples of heme lyases have been studied in some detail (see below), namely the cytochrome c1 heme lyase (CC1HL) 2The abbreviations used are: CC1HLcytochrome c1 heme lyaseCCHLcytochrome c heme lyaseALASδ-aminolevulinic acid synthaseCC1HLSPVCC1HL in which the cysteinyl residue of the CPV motif has been converted to a seryl residueCC1HLΔCPVCC1HL from which the CPV motif has been deletedPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisF1ββ-subunit of F1-ATPase. of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the cytochrome c heme lyases (CCHL) of both yeast (5Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and Neurospora crassa (6Drygas M.E. Lambowitz A.M. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17897-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes are distinct in their substrate specificity in that each heme lyase can only convert its own apocytochrome substrate into the holo form.Our knowledge of the participation of heme lyases in the biogenesis of the cytochromes is limited to their role in the import of the apoproteins into mitochondria. CCHL, in addition to facilitating covalent heme attachment (7Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plays an important role in driving the import of apocytochrome c from the cytosol (9Dumont M.E. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). During or immediately after its reversible passage across the mitochondrial outer membrane, apocytochrome c associates with CCHL (10Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The energy gained from this specific complex formation is believed to trap apocytochrome c in the intermembrane space.CC1HL is involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c1 in a rather different manner. The precursor of the latter protein is synthesized in the cytosol with a bipartite signal sequence that, upon import into mitochondria (11Lill R. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is processed in two proteolytic steps (12Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Böhni P.C. Gibson J. Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Removal of the matrix-targeting sequence by the matrix-processing peptidase is followed by the cleavage of its intermembrane space sorting signal. The second processing step is catalyzed by inner membrane protease subunit 2 and has been shown to be strictly dependent upon heme attachment (12Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Böhni P.C. Gibson J. Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which is mediated by CC1HL (15Nicholson D.W. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10156-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, yeast cells lacking CC1HL accumulate the heme-free intermediate size form of cytochrome c1 and are deficient in the mature holo form (4Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism of how heme lyases participate in covalent heme attachment is poorly understood (see Ref. 16Lill R. Kispal G. Künkele K.P. Mayer A. Risse B. Steiner H. Heckmeyer P. Van der Klei I. Court D.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Proceedings of the NATO/ASI, Cell Biology: Molecular Dynamics of Biomembranes. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 137-155Google Scholar). For instance, it has never been shown that heme lyases catalyze the heme attachment reaction themselves. Moreover, heme binding to heme lyases has not been demonstrated. No information is available about the chemical nature of the binding sites for heme and for the apoproteins. Furthermore, it is not known whether the two thioether bonds are formed in a sequential or simultaneous manner.The heme lyases known to date share about 35% identical amino acid residues (50% similarity; see Ref. 4Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). Especially in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of these proteins, there are a number of conserved sequence blocks, suggesting that this part is particularly important for their function. The NH2 termini of the heme lyases do not display striking sequence conservation with the exception of CPX-sequences (X = V, M, I, L; hereafter termed CPV motif) present in all of these enzymes. This CPV motif is found two or three times at the amino termini of CCHL proteins and once at the amino terminus of yeast CC1HL (see Fig. 4A). The functional role of these CPV motifs in heme lyases has not been investigated so far. In two other proteins, similar motifs have been implicated to act as heme regulatory motifs. The transcriptional activator HAP1 (CYP1) contains seven CPV motifs (17Creusot F. Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Heme binding to these motifs causes dissociation of a HAP1-bound repressor factor, allowing HAP1 to bind to DNA thereby activating transcription (19Fytlovich S. Gervais M. Agrimonti C. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two copies of a similar motif (CPF) are present in the presequences of several mammalian δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) precursors. They were shown to confer heme inhibition of import of the ALAS precursor into mitochondria (21Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of such a sequence in heme binding to proteins.Using CC1HL as a model protein we show by several in vitro approaches that heme lyases can interact directly with heme. Thus, heme lyases are able to bind both substrates of the heme attachment reaction, namely the apoform of the cytochromes (10Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and heme (this study). A mutant CC1HL, in which the cysteinyl residue of the CPV motif has been converted to a seryl residue (termed CC1HLSPV) failed to interact with heme in these in vitro experiments, suggesting that the CPV sequence serves as part of the heme binding site. The crucial role of the CPV sequence in recruiting heme to CC1HL is supported further by the phenotype of a yeast strain expressing CC1HLSPV. Strongly reduced levels of mature holocytochrome c1 and an accumulation of the heme-free intermediate form underline the importance of the CPV motif for the heme attachment reaction."

W., Mohr, D., Cleary, J., and Stocker, R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5756-5763). Interferon-γ inhibits human monocyte/macrophage-facilitated LDL lipid peroxidation via induction of cellular tryptophan degradation and production and release of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) (Christen, S., Thomas, S. R., Garner, B., and Stocker, R. (1994) J. Clin. Invest. 93, 2149-2158). We now report on the mechanism of antioxidant action of 3HAA. 3HAA directly reduced α-TO· in UV-exposed micellar dispersions of α-TOH or in LDL incubated with soybean 15-lipoxygenase (SLO), as assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. 3HAA did not inhibit SLO enzyme activity. Anthranilic acid, which lacks the phenoxyl group, was incapable of reducing α-TO·. 3HAA dose-dependently inhibited the peroxidation of surface phospholipids and core cholesteryl esters in LDL exposed to SLO, peroxyl radicals (ROO·), or Cu2+; oxidants that convert α-TOH to α-TO·. In all cases, sparing of LDL's α-TOH, but not ubiquinol-10 (CoQ10H2), was observed until the majority of 3HAA was consumed. Addition of 3HAA or ascorbate prevented further consumption of α-TOH and accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides when added to aqueous or lipophilic ROO·-oxidizing LDL after complete and partial consumption of CoQ10H2 and α-TOH, respectively. In contrast, addition of urate, an efficient ROO· scavenger incapable of scavenging α-TO·, did not efficiently inhibit ongoing lipid peroxidation. Oxidation of 3HAA-supplemented human plasma by aqueous ROO· resulted in the successive consumption of ascorbate, CoQ10H2, 3HAA, bilirubin, α-TOH, and urate. Lipid peroxidation was prevented as long as ascorbate, CoQ10H2, and 3HAA were present, but subsequently proceeded as a free-radical chain reaction concomitant with α-TOH, bilirubin, and urate consumption. Addition of 3HAA to aqueous ROO·-oxidizing plasma, after complete consumption of ascorbate and CoQ10H2, strongly inhibited ongoing lipid peroxidation and consumption of α-TOH, bilirubin, and urate immediately and as efficiently as did ascorbate. These findings demonstrate that 3HAA is a highly efficient co-antioxidant for plasma lipid peroxidation by virtue of its ability to interact with α-TO· in lipoproteins. Since interferon-γ is the principal inducer of tryptophan degradation and release of 3HAA by monocytes/macrophages, this may represent a localized extracellular antioxidant defense against LDL oxidation in inflammation. α-Tocopherol (α-TOH) can promote lipid peroxidation in human low density lipoprotein (LDL) unless co-antioxidants are present that eliminate the chain-carrying α-tocopheroxyl radical (α-TO·) (Bowry, V. W., Mohr, D., Cleary, J., and Stocker, R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5756-5763). Interferon-γ inhibits human monocyte/macrophage-facilitated LDL lipid peroxidation via induction of cellular tryptophan degradation and production and release of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) (Christen, S., Thomas, S.

Oxidatively modified LDL may be taken up by macrophages via the scavenger receptor to form lipid-laden or “foam cells,” a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions (3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 897-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidized LDL possesses an array of additional pro-atherogenic properties (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9934) Google Scholar, 3Goldstein J.L.

Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1990; 9: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and products derived from them may play a central role in LDL oxidation. In light of the likely pathophysiological relevance of oxidized LDL, a great deal of interest has focused on LDL lipid antioxidation. The “oxidation hypothesis” of atherosclerosis (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) implies that LDL antioxidants are potentially anti-atherogenic. Consistent with this, some (5Carew T.E. Schwenke D.C. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7725-7729Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 6Björkhem I.

Invest. 1994; 94: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) synthetic lipid-soluble antioxidants slow the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models.Human LDL contains a number of endogenous antioxidants, including α-tocopherol (α-TOH) and ubiquinol-10 (CoQ10H2). α-TOH, biologically and chemically the most active form of vitamin E (10Burton G.W. Ingold K.U. Acc. Chem. Res. 1986; 19: 194-201Crossref Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), is the most abundant lipid-soluble antioxidant in LDL extracts (11Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar) and as such has received the most interest with respect to research into “antioxidation” of LDL lipids. A number of studies using strongly oxidizing conditions have concluded that α-TOH is an efficient antioxidant for LDL (reviewed in Ref. 11Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). Indeed, when Cu2+ is used at a Cu2+-to-LDL ratio of 10-16:1, relatively small amounts of lipid hydroperoxides are formed until α-TOH has been consumed (11Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar) after which lipid peroxidation enters a rapid, “uninhibited” phase. Under such oxidizing conditions, enrichment of LDL with vitamin E increases the resistance of the lipoprotein toward oxidation (12Dieber-Rotheneder M. Puhl H. Waeg G. Striegl G. Esterbauer H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Reaven P.D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 601-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, the correlation between LDL's content of α-TOH and its resistance toward copper oxidation is poor (reviewed in Ref. 11Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar).Scheme IIStructure of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Most attention on LDL antioxidation has focused on dietary or synthetic antioxidants that either associate with the lipoprotein or are present in the aqueous phase of plasma. Comparatively, little attention has been given to the idea that cells may produce and release antioxidants and thereby contribute to the prevention of LDL lipid peroxidation in the extracellular space. This type of antioxidant defense may be advantageous as it principally allows for a site-specific and regulated response to, for example, an enhanced requirement for LDL antioxidation in the localized environment of the artery wall. Recently it has been demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) inhibits LDL oxidation facilitated by either murine (27Jessup W. Mohr D. Gieseg S.P. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or human monocyte/macrophages (28Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For murine cells, this inhibitory action of the cytokine appears to depend on cellular arginine degradation and production of nitrogen monoxide (NO·). In contrast, for human monocytes/macrophages, IFNγ induced tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine pathway and production and release of micomolar quantities of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA, 2-amino 3-hydroxy benzoic acid, Scheme II) was responsible for the inhibitory action of the cytokine (28Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In the current study we investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which 3HAA efficiently inhibits LDL lipid peroxidation. The results obtained show that this natural aminophenol interacts with α-TO· in peroxidizing LDL and as such represents a cell-derived co-antioxidant, the synthesis and release of which is regulated by IFNγ.RESULTSOur previous studies (28Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) indicated that 3HAA potently inhibited LDL oxidation facilitated by human monocytes/macrophages in Ham's F-10 medium, a transition metal-dependent oxidizing system. It was first tested whether 3HAA prevents transition metals in the Ham's F-10 medium from participating in redox reactions. 3HAA (10 μM) failed to prevent Ham's F-10-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate. Even when added at a 100-fold molar excess over the transition metal, 3HAA failed to inhibit Cu2+- or Fe3+-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate in phosphate buffer, whereas the transition-metal chelator, DETAPAC, efficiently inhibited such oxidation (not shown). These results indicate that the aminophenol does not prevent transition metals from participating in redox reactions. Furthermore, neither the absorption nor fluorescence spectra of 3HAA in phosphate buffer were altered upon addition of either Cu2+ or Fe3+ indicating that the aminophenol does not chelate transition metals (not shown).Reaction of 3HAA with α-TO·It was next investigated whether 3HAA was able to react with α-TO·, since under mild radical oxidizing conditions α-TO· mediates the peroxidation of LDL lipids (15Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6029-6040Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 17Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Exposure of micellar dispersions of α-TOH to UV light (Fig. 1A) or LDL to SLO (Fig. 1C) resulted in the formation of the α-TO· as characterized by a seven-line EPR spectrum with hyperfine coupling consistent with that previously reported for α-TO· (37Kalyanaraman B. Antholine W.E. Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Addition of 10 μM 3HAA to either UV light-exposed micellar dispersions of α-TOH (after the UV light was switched off) (Fig. 1B) or SLO-oxidizing LDL (Fig. 1D), resulted in the immediate quenching of the α-TO· EPR signal to below the limit of detection. No other g ≈ 2 radicals were observed on addition of 3HAA to α-TO·-containing solutions suggesting that the resulting putative 3-hydroxyanthranilyl radical was short-lived on the EPR time scale. It is known that radical-mediated oxidation of 3HAA results in production of the phenoxazinone cinnabarinic acid (38Christen S. Southwell-Keely P.T. Stocker R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8090-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, addition of 3HAA to α-TO·-containing micelles resulted in the consumption of the aminophenol and formation of cinnabarinic acid (not shown). Anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid), which differs from 3HAA only by the absence of the phenoxyl group, failed to quench the α-TO· EPR signal in either micellar dispersions or oxidizing LDL (not shown).Fig. 13HAA efficiently scavenges α-TO·.

Note, 3HAA was added after UV light was switched off. C and D, concentrated LDL (3.6 mg of protein/ml) was exposed to SLO (1 mg/ml). After 15-min incubation at 37°C, a 400-μl aliquot was removed and analyzed for α-TO· by EPR (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3HAA (10 μM) was then added to the LDL solution (D), which was then re-analyzed for α-TO·. Control LDL treated with phosphate buffer instead of 3HAA showed α-TO· at the same concentration as that shown in C. The concentration of α-TO· was 2 μM and 0.25 μM for the micellar dispersions and LDL, respectively, as judged by comparison of peak area with that of a stable nitroxide radical (10 μM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)3HAA did not directly inhibit SLO activity, as demonstrated by indistinguishable rates of SLO-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid in the absence and presence of the aminophenol (Fig. 2A). However, 3HAA potently and dose-dependently inhibited the accumulation of CE-O(O)H and consumption of α-TOH in LDL exposed to SLO (Fig. 2B), an oxidant that requires α-TOH for efficient LDL lipid peroxidation initiation (17Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar).Fig. 23HAA efficiently inhibits accumulation of CE-O(O)H in SLO-oxidizing LDL but does not inhibit SLO activity. For enzyme activity studies (A), linoleic acid (0.1 mM) was incubated with SLO (2 μg of enzyme protein/ml) in PBS at 25°C, and the increase in absorbance at 234 nm was measured in the absence (closed squares) or presence (open squares) of 3HAA (50 μM). For LDL oxidation studies (B), LDL (0.5 mg of protein/ml) was supplemented with SLO (8 μg/ml) and incubated at 37°C in the absence (circles) or presence of 3HAA at a final concentration of 1.25 (diamonds), 2.5 (triangles), 5.0 (inverted triangles), or 10 (squares) μM. At the time points indicated aliquots were taken and analyzed for CE-O(O)H (closed symbols) or α-TOH (open symbols).

Ingold K.U. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 15Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem.

Hence, for an aqueous compound to efficiently inhibit such lipid peroxidation, it must reduce α-TO· (see “urate paradox” in Ref. 15Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6029-6040Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the effect of exogenous 3HAA on the oxidation and antioxidation of freshly isolated LDL incubated with AMVN. Independent of the presence of 3HAA, CoQ10H2 was the first antioxidant consumed, and the accumulation of significant amounts of lipid hydroperoxides was not observed as long as CoQ10H2 was present. In the absence of 3HAA, the initial rapid consumption of CoQ10H2 was followed by concomitant consumption of α-TOH and oxidation of LDL's cholesteryl esters and phospholipids. Under these conditions, LDL's lipids oxidized as a radical-chain reaction with ≈25-30 and 7-8 molecules of CE-O(O)H and PC-OOH, respectively, formed per molecule of α-TOH consumed. These findings are in agreement with previous reports (14Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 15Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am.

A. 1991; 88: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and shows that AMVN-initiated LDL lipid peroxidation proceeds via TMP only after CoQ10H2 consumption. In the presence of 3HAA (5 μM), LDL's α-TOH was spared from consumption (Fig. 3A) and the accumulation of CE-O(O)H and PC-OOH was inhibited strongly until the majority of the aminophenol was consumed (Fig. 3B). In contrast, CoQ10H2 was almost completely consumed before any significant loss of 3HAA was detected, indicating a lack of interaction between these two antioxidants (Fig. 3A). Another natural aminophenolic antioxidant, 3-hydroxykynurenine (40Christen S. Peterhans E. Stocker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2506-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), exhibited a similar inhibitory efficacy as 3HAA, while urate (10 μM) was not capable of inhibiting AMVN-initiated lipid peroxidation (not shown).Fig. 33HAA efficiently inhibits AMVN-initiated LDL lipid peroxidation. Freshly isolated LDL (0.85 mg of protein/ml) was supplemented with 0.5 mM AMVN and incubated at 37°C in the absence (closed symbols) or presence of 3HAA (open symbols). At the indicated times, aliquots were removed and analyzed for antioxidants (A); α-TOH (diamonds), CoQ10H2 (triangles), and 3HAA (hatched squares) or lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) (B); CE-O(O)H (squares), PC-OOH (circles). 100% values for antioxidants were 8 molecules of α-TOH/LDL, 1.1 CoQ10H2 molecules/LDL, and 5 μM 3HAA. Results are representative of three independent experiments, and the levels of LOOH are expressed as molecules per LDL particle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)3HAA Dose-dependently Inhibits AMVN- and Cu2+-initiated LDL Lipid PeroxidationAs with SLO, 3HAA dose-dependently inhibited AMVN- (Fig. 4, A and B) and Cu2+-initiated (Fig. 4, C and D) LDL lipid peroxidation, as indicated by inhibition of both the consumption of α-TOH and the accumulation of CE-O(O)H. In each case, inhibition was noted until the majority of the aminophenol was consumed (not shown). The observation that 3HAA also spared α-TOH from consumption during Cu2+-initiated LDL oxidation provided further support for an interaction between the two antioxidants; Cu2+ rapidly converts LDL's α-TOH to α-TO· (41Yoshida Y. Tsuchiya J. Niki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Fig. 43HAA dose-dependently inhibits LDL oxidation initiated by AMVN or Cu2+. LDL (0.5 mg of protein/ml) was supplemented with AMVN (1.25 mM; A and B) or copper ions (Cu2+:LDL ratio of 5:1; C and D) and incubated at 37°C in the absence (circles) or presence of 3HAA at a concentration of 1.25 (diamonds), 2.5 (triangles), 5.0 (inverted triangles), or 10 (squares) μM. At the time points indicated aliquots were taken and analyzed for CE-O(O)H (A and C) and α-TOH (B and D). Results are representative of four independent experiments, and the levels of CE-O(O)H and α-TOH are expressed as molecules per LDL particle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Addition of 3HAA to LDL during AAPH- or AMVN-initiated OxidationIf 3HAA inhibits LDL lipid peroxidation by reductive elimination of the α-TO·, it would be expected that addition of the aqueous aminophenol to oxidizing LDL, after partial consumption of α-TOH, would result in an immediate cessation of both α-TOH consumption and lipid peroxidation, regardless of whether the oxidation is initiated from within (i.e. by AMVN-derived lipophilic ROO·) or outside (i.e. by AAPH-derived aqueous ROO·) the lipoprotein particle. Indeed, addition of 3HAA to either AAPH- or AMVN-oxidizing LDL, prevented further consumption of α-TOH and completely inhibited the accumulation of CE-O(O)H (Fig. 5). 3HAA inhibited both processes as efficiently as the known co-antioxidant, ascorbate. Also, a small though reproducible increase in the amount of α-TOH was noted upon addition of 3HAA or ascorbate (Fig. 5, A and C). In contrast to 3HAA and ascorbate, urate was incapable of inhibiting both CE-O(O)H formation and α-TOH consumption in AMVN-oxidizing LDL (Fig. 5, A and B). When added to AAPH-oxidizing LDL, urate almost completely inhibited consumption of α-TOH (Fig. 5C), yet it failed to efficiently inhibit CE-O(O)H formation (Fig. 5D). This “urate-paradox” (15Bowry V.W. Stocker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6029-6040Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar) is consistent with urate's inability to scavenge preformed α-TO· in oxidizing LDL even though it is an efficient scavenger of aqueous ROO·.Fig. 53HAA interrupts ongoing LDL lipid peroxidation initiated by AAPH or AMVN. LDL (0.5 mg of protein/ml) was supplemented with AMVN (1.0 mM; A and B) or AAPH (0.5 mM; C and D) and incubated at 37°C. After 240 and 140 min incubation with AMVN and AAPH, respectively (i.e. when ≈70-80% of LDL's α-TOH was still present), 20 μM of either 3HAA (open triangles), ascorbate (open circles), or urate (open diamonds) were added. The corresponding control samples (no additives) are shown in closed squares. At the indicated times, aliquots were taken and analyzed for CE-O(O)H (A and C) or α-TOH (B and D). Results are representative of four independent experiments, and the levels of CE-O(O)H and α-TOH are expressed as molecules per LDL particle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasma ExperimentsThe relative efficacy of 3HAA to inhibit AAPH-initiated lipid peroxidation in human blood plasma was next examined. In the absence of 3HAA, ascorbate (Fig. 6A) and CoQ10H2 (Fig. 6B) were initially consumed, during which time detectable lipid peroxidation was prevented (Fig. 6C). This is consistent with a previous observation (42Frei B. Stocker R. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9748-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), although CoQ10H2 consumption was not reported. After complete consumption of ascorbate and CoQ10H2, lipid peroxidation proceeded as a radical chain in the presence of α-TOH, bilirubin, and urate as reported previously (17Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 42Frei B. Stocker R. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9748-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Approximately, 22 CE-O(O)H molecules were formed per molecule of α-TOH consumed. 3HAA neither affected the time to onset nor rate of disappearance of ascorbate or CoQ10H2, and its consumption commenced immediately after complete depletion of these antioxidants (Fig. 6, A and B). More importantly, 3HAA efficiently inhibited the accumulation of CE-O(O)H and consumption of α-TOH, bilirubin, and urate for as long as the aminophenol was present (Fig. 6). Thus, in 3HAA-supplemented plasma, the sequential AAPH-initiated consumption of antioxidants was ascorbate > CoQ10H2 > 3HAA > bilirubin > α-TOH ≈ urate.Fig. 63HAA inhibits AAPH-initiated oxidation of whole blood plasma. Plasma was incubated with 15 mM AAPH at 37°C in the absence (closed symbols) and presence (open symbols) of 3HAA. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and analyzed for (A) the aqueous antioxidants ascorbate (circles), 3HAA (hatched squares), bilirubin (inverted triangles), and urate (diamonds); (B) the lipophilic antioxidants CoQ10H2 (triangles) and α-TOH (circles); (C) CE-O(O)H (squares). The 100% values for the antioxidants were 43 μM ascorbate, 1.1 μM CoQ10H2, 30 μM 3HAA, 18 μM α-TOH, 8 μM bilirubin, and 364 μM urate. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To more clearly delineate 3HAA's antioxidant activity from that of ascorbate and CoQ10H2, the aminophenol was added to AAPH-oxidizing plasma following complete consumption of ascorbate and CoQ10H2, i.e. at a time where lipid peroxidation and consumption of bilirubin, α-TOH, and urate were ongoing. Addition of 3HAA resulted in an immediate and complete inhibition of accumulation of CE-O(O)H (Fig. 7C) and PC-OOH (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, addition of 3HAA also efficiently inhibited the consumption of α-TOH (Fig. 7B), bilirubin, and urate (Fig. 7A). After complete consumption of the added 3HAA, peroxidation of plasma lipids and consumption of antioxidants proceeded at rates similar to those prior to addition of the aminophenol. Interestingly, the time required for complete consumption of 100 μM 3HAA was greater than that for 100 μM ascorbate (not shown), resulting in a comparatively longer period of inhibition of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant consumption. This is consistent with 3HAA scavenging 2.7 radicals per 3HAA molecule (38Christen S. Southwell-Keely P.T. Stocker R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8090-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) versus 2.0 radicals per ascorbate molecule. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when 3HAA-supplemented plasma was oxidized by AMVN, except that CoQ10H2 consumption preceded that of ascorbate (not shown) (see also Ref. 23Neuzil J. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together these results show that 3HAA, but neither α-TOH, bilirubin, or urate, provided a “sec"

In this work, we addressed the issue of whether GT elements are involved in cell type-specific transcriptional regulation. We found that the inactivation of GT-1 site-mediated transcription in roots is correlated with the absence of the GT-1 binding activity in root extracts. In addition, the mutation of the related GT-1 (from the pea rbcs-3A) and the S1F (from the spinach rps1) sites resulted in an increase of their transcriptional activity in roots that contain a distinct GT element-binding factor, referred to as RGTF. Although specific to GT elements, RGTF has a different sequence requirement and a lower sequence specificity than GT-1. Interestingly, RGTF has a higher binding affinity to the mutant GT-1 and S1F sites than to the wild-type sequences. This correlation suggests that RGTF may have some role in transcriptional regulation in roots. Furthermore, root cellular protein extracts contain an inhibitory activity that prevents GT-1 from binding to DNA. This helps to explain the absence of the GT-1 binding activity in roots in which the gene of GT-1 is expressed.

INTRODUCTIONThe expression of nuclear genes encoding both photosynthetic and plastid ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) 2The abbreviations used are: r-proteinribosomal-proteinGUSβ-glucuronidase. is highly mesophyllous cell-specific. Plastid r-protein genes provide a good system to define cis-acting promoter elements and their binding factors involved in cell type-specific regulation. The transcription of these genes is highly activated in the leaf mesophyllous cells, compared with amyloplast-containing root cells and chromoplast-containing flower and fruit cells (1Franzetti B. Zhou D.-X. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4153-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Lagrange T. Franzetti F. Axelos M. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2614-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Li Y.-F. Zhou D.-X. Clabault G. Bisanz-Seyer C. Mache R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast to photosynthetic genes, the transcriptional activation of r-protein genes in the mesophyllous cells is light-independent (3Li Y.-F. Zhou D.-X. Clabault G. Bisanz-Seyer C. Mache R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This specific pattern of transcriptional regulation of the r-protein genes suggests the existence of either specific transcriptional activators in chloroplast-containing cells and/or repressors in nonphotosynthetic cells. Studies on the rps1 gene coding for the r-protein CS1 have led to the identification of a promoter sequence that is specifically recognized by a leaf factor, known as S1F (4Zhou D.-X. Li Y.-F. Rocipon M. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23515-23519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the S1F binding site had a negative function in regulating the rps1 promoter in root cells and in protoplasts (4Zhou D.-X. Li Y.-F. Rocipon M. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23515-23519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Villain P. Clabault G. Mache R. Zhou D.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It looked likely that the S1F binding site was involved in the cell type-specific regulation of the rps1 gene.Interestingly, the S1F binding site found also in other r-protein genes (2Lagrange T. Franzetti F. Axelos M. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2614-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is related to the GT-1 binding site of the pea rbcs-3A gene as shown by competition binding assays (5Villain P. Clabault G. Mache R. Zhou D.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GT-1 binding site initially identified as Box II by Fluhr et al. (6Fluhr R. Kuhlemeier C. Chua N.-H. Science. 1986; 232: 1106-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and five other similar sequences found in the pea rbcs-3A gene (7Green P.J. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2543-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) have been shown to play an important role in the light-regulated transcription of the gene (8Kuhlemeier C. Cuozzo M. Green P.J. Goyvaerts E. Ward K. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4662-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sequences homologous to Box II have also been found within upstream regions of numerous other genes including ones not regulated by light (9Gilmartin P.M. Sarokin L. Memelink J. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Specifically, cis-elements involved in tissue-specific (52/56 box in the pollen-specific lat52) (10Eyal Y. Curie C. McCormick S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), defense-related (SBF-1 binding sites in the soybean chs15) (11Lawton M.A. Dean S.M. Dron M. Kooter J.M.

Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and circadian clock-controlled (CGF site in cab2) (13Anderson S.L. Teakle G.R. Martino-Catt S.J. Kay S.A. Plant J. 1994; 6: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) transcriptional regulation have been shown to be related to the GT-1 binding site as demonstrated by competition binding assays (Table I). These GT-1 binding site (Box II)-related elements are known as GT elements. The sequences of the defined GT elements show much variation when compared with the pea rbcs-3A gene Box II core sequence GGTTAA (Table I). This core sequence has been shown to be required for the GT-1 binding in vitro (14Green P.J. Youg M.-H. Cuozzo M. Kano-Murakami Y. Silverstein P. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4035-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the light-responsive function in vivo (15Lam E. Chua N.-H. Science. 1990; 248: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One common characteristic to all GT elements is a core sequence rich in nucleotides T and A rather than G and T, as indicated by the name. The flanking sequences are quite divergent. The diversity of GT elements suggests that a single binding factor such as GT-1 can bind to many related GT elements. Alternatively, there may be different GT element-binding proteins with different specificities and functions. A few GT element-binding factors have been characterized, among which GT-1 and GT-2 have been cloned (12Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Perisic O. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). GT-1 and GT-2 are related proteins with one or two trihelical DNA-binding motifs, each of which recognizes different degenerated GT elements. For example, each of the two trihelical domains of GT-2 has a higher binding affinity to either GT2 or GT3 boxes of the rice phya gene, but both domains bind only poorly to the GT-1 site (18Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas the trihelix of GT-1 has at least a 20-fold higher affinity to Box II than to any other tested GT elements (19Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the genes for both GT-1 and GT-2 are expressed in all parts of the plants and are not regulated by light (17Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that either the transcriptional activity of the factors is regulated by post-translational modification or additional factors may be needed to regulate their activity.Table IA compilation of related GT elementsMotifGeneSequenceFactorReferenceBox IIrbcs-3AGTGTGGTTAATATGGT-114Green P.J.

Second, we have examined whether root cells contain any distinct GT element binding activity. Further, we have tried to find out how the transcription repression in roots mediated by GT elements is achieved. The results presented in this paper describe a novel mechanism of differential cell type-specific transcription mediated by GT elements.DISCUSSIONThe highly cell type-specific nature of the expression of genes encoding both the photosynthetic and the plastid ribosomal proteins indicates that internal developmental signals are involved in the regulation. These internal signals include both cell identity and a possible “chloroplast factor,” which seems to be important to couple gene expression of photosynthetic proteins with the presence of chloroplasts in the cell (23Susek R.E. Ausubel F.M. Chory J. Cell. 1993; 74: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, the expression of nuclear genes encoding plastid r-proteins is not dependent on the presence of chloroplasts (24Harrak H. Lagrange T. Bisanz-Seyer C. Lerbs-Mache S. Mache R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, cell type-specific transcription factors are likely to be involved in the regulation of both types of nuclear genes. Promoter studies have shown that the GT-1 binding site is a cis-element with several copies in the promoters of both photosynthetic and ribosomal protein genes (5Villain P. Clabault G. Mache R. Zhou D.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gilmartin P.M. Sarokin L. Memelink J. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the GT-1 site confers light responsiveness to a chimeric promoter construct (15Lam E. Chua N.-H. Science. 1990; 248: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Data presented in this article show that the mutation of the GT-1 site decreased the promoter activity about 3-4-fold in leaves, indicating that the GT-1 site has a positive function in transcription in leaves. On the other hand, this mutation provoked an increase of transcription activity in roots (Fig. 1). Similar results were previously obtained with the S1F binding site in activating transcription in roots, although the mutation of the S1F binding site within a short rps1 promoter fragment did not affect the promoter activity in leaves (5Villain P. Clabault G. Mache R. Zhou D.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The divergence between the GT-1 and the S1F sites concerning their activity in leaves is not understood at present. However, these data together support the notions that the GT-1 binding site is involved in leaf cell activation and that in roots wild-type GT elements have lower transcription activity than their mutant versions. Based on these data only, one can make the conclusion that GT elements are root negative transcription elements.Gel shift assay analyses of root protein extracts have led to the identification of an additional GT element-binding protein, RGTF, which has 1.5-2 times higher binding activity to the mutant sequences than to the wild types of both the GT-1 and the S1F sites. This higher RGTF binding activity of the mutant sequences is well correlated to their higher transcriptional activity in roots. The higher root transcriptional activity of the mutant GT elements was presumably due to the fact that the mutations have created higher affinity binding sites of RGTF than the wild-type sequences. This suggests that the GT-1 site is not an optimal or a major binding site of RGTF. Based on the relatively low root activity of the wild-type Box II, or even of mutant 5 (Fig. 1), we suggest that the transcriptional activation activity of RGTF is relatively weak.RGTF seems not to be a highly sequence-specific DNA-binding factor, based on the observations that it recognizes most of the dinucleotide substitution mutants of the GT-1 binding site (Fig. 3, B and C). However, the RGTF binding activities of those degenerative Box II sequences differ over 10-fold when comparing the strongest (mutant 5) to the weakest (mutant 7) (Fig. 3B). The two nucleotides AA in the core sequence (GGTTAA) of Box II are crucial for the binding of RGTF. Substitutions of AA by CC decreased by about 5-fold the binding activity compared with the wild-type sequence (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the GG to CC changes in the core sequence increased the RGTF binding activity about 1.7-fold (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that, although with a relatively low binding specificity, RGTF has specific binding sequence requirements. These binding features of RGTF might allow it to bind to a large spectrum of promoter sequences. RGTF seems not to be a root-specific factor. It was detected also in leaf extracts (Fig. 6, lane 6), especially when the GT-1 binding activity was inhibited (Figs. 5, 6, 7), suggesting that RGTF may be a kind of general factor existing in different cell types. It is unlikely that the GT-1·Box II complex seen in gel shift assays with leaf extracts contains also RGTF, since the mobility of the leaf complex was not affected by the competition of the Box II mutant 5 sequence, which is specific to RGTF but not to GT-1 (Fig. 6, lanes 8 and 9). Therefore, the binding of RGTF seems to be GT-1-independent. It is also unlikely that RGTF is a different form of GT-1, since RGTF binds to different sequences. RGTF might play some role in ensuring a lower but adequate level of expression in nonmesophyllous cells of GT element-containing genes including plastid r-protein and photosynthetic genes. Lower transcriptional activity of Box II in roots correlates with the absence of the GT-1 binding activity in root protein extracts. This strongly suggests that GT-1 is a leaf-specific activator. Based on the results obtained from the cloned tobacco or Arabidopsis GT-1 factors, GT-1 is transcribed in roots (17Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Harrison M.J. Lawton M.A. Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The absence of GT-1 binding activity in root extracts can be explained by modifications at either post-transcriptional or post-translational levels. The data shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7 demonstrated that a root cellular activity could inhibit the binding activity of GT-1. This root inhibition seems to be specific to GT-1, since the root extracts gave rise to similar shifted bands as the leaf extracts when incubated with 32P-labeled Arabidopsis GBF binding sites (G-box) (Ref. 25Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3415-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; data not shown). The studies with calf alkaline phosphatase or a phosphatase inhibitor (KF) showed that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may not be involved in the inhibition, although our data do not rule out the possibility that specific phosphatases insensitive to KF are involved. It is not clear at this stage whether the inhibitory activity is localized in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of root cells, since the root extracts we used in this study are whole cellular protein extracts. Nevertheless, this inhibitory activity seems to be root cell-specific. Gel shift assays performed with leaf whole protein extracts gave rise to the same shifted band as leaf nuclear extracts (data not shown).Based on the above discussion, we would reason as follows (Fig. 8). In leaf (mesophyllous) cells, GT-1 binds to Box II or related GT elements and strongly activates transcription. In root cells, the binding activity of GT-1 is prevented by an inhibitor, and the transcriptional activation mediated by GT-1 is abolished. However, RGTF can bind to GT elements and very moderately activate transcription to ensure an adequate expression of different genes in roots. The activation strength would depend on the binding affinity of RGTF to the element. This mode of regulation might help to determine the fine tuning of expression of individual genes in root cells. INTRODUCTIONThe expression of nuclear genes encoding both photosynthetic and plastid ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) 2The abbreviations used are: r-proteinribosomal-proteinGUSβ-glucuronidase. is highly mesophyllous cell-specific. Plastid r-protein genes provide a good system to define cis-acting promoter elements and their binding factors involved in cell type-specific regulation. The transcription of these genes is highly activated in the leaf mesophyllous cells, compared with amyloplast-containing root cells and chromoplast-containing flower and fruit cells (1Franzetti B. Zhou D.-X. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4153-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Lagrange T. Franzetti F. Axelos M. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2614-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Li Y.-F. Zhou D.-X. Clabault G. Bisanz-Seyer C. Mache R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast to photosynthetic genes, the transcriptional activation of r-protein genes in the mesophyllous cells is light-independent (3Li Y.-F. Zhou D.-X. Clabault G. Bisanz-Seyer C. Mache R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This specific pattern of transcriptional regulation of the r-protein genes suggests the existence of either specific transcriptional activators in chloroplast-containing cells and/or repressors in nonphotosynthetic cells. Studies on the rps1 gene coding for the r-protein CS1 have led to the identification of a promoter sequence that is specifically recognized by a leaf factor, known as S1F (4Zhou D.-X. Li Y.-F. Rocipon M. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23515-23519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the S1F binding site had a negative function in regulating the rps1 promoter in root cells and in protoplasts (4Zhou D.-X. Li Y.-F. Rocipon M. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23515-23519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Villain P. Clabault G. Mache R. Zhou D.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It looked likely that the S1F binding site was involved in the cell type-specific regulation of the rps1 gene.Interestingly, the S1F binding site found also in other r-protein genes (2Lagrange T. Franzetti F. Axelos M. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2614-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is related to the GT-1 binding site of the pea rbcs-3A gene as shown by competition binding assays (5Villain P. Clabault G. Mache R. Zhou D.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GT-1 binding site initially identified as Box II by Fluhr et al. (6Fluhr R. Kuhlemeier C. Chua N.-H. Science. 1986; 232: 1106-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and five other similar sequences found in the pea rbcs-3A gene (7Green P.J. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2543-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) have been shown to play an important role in the light-regulated transcription of the gene (8Kuhlemeier C. Cuozzo M. Green P.J. Goyvaerts E. Ward K. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4662-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sequences homologous to Box II have also been found within upstream regions of numerous other genes including ones not regulated by light (9Gilmartin P.M. Sarokin L. Memelink J. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Specifically, cis-elements involved in tissue-specific (52/56 box in the pollen-specific lat52) (10Eyal Y. Curie C. McCormick S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), defense-related (SBF-1 binding sites in the soybean chs15) (11Lawton M.A. Dean S.M. Dron M. Kooter J.M. Kragh K.M. Harrison M.J. Yu L. Tanguay L. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), light-repressed (the GT-2 binding sites in the rice phya) (12Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and circadian clock-controlled (CGF site in cab2) (13Anderson S.L. Teakle G.R. Martino-Catt S.J. Kay S.A. Plant J. 1994; 6: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) transcriptional regulation have been shown to be related to the GT-1 binding site as demonstrated by competition binding assays (Table I). These GT-1 binding site (Box II)-related elements are known as GT elements. The sequences of the defined GT elements show much variation when compared with the pea rbcs-3A gene Box II core sequence GGTTAA (Table I). This core sequence has been shown to be required for the GT-1 binding in vitro (14Green P.J. Youg M.-H. Cuozzo M. Kano-Murakami Y. Silverstein P. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4035-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the light-responsive function in vivo (15Lam E. Chua N.-H. Science. 1990; 248: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One common characteristic to all GT elements is a core sequence rich in nucleotides T and A rather than G and T, as indicated by the name. The flanking sequences are quite divergent. The diversity of GT elements suggests that a single binding factor such as GT-1 can bind to many related GT elements. Alternatively, there may be different GT element-binding proteins with different specificities and functions. A few GT element-binding factors have been characterized, among which GT-1 and GT-2 have been cloned (12Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Perisic O. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). GT-1 and GT-2 are related proteins with one or two trihelical DNA-binding motifs, each of which recognizes different degenerated GT elements. For example, each of the two trihelical domains of GT-2 has a higher binding affinity to either GT2 or GT3 boxes of the rice phya gene, but both domains bind only poorly to the GT-1 site (18Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas the trihelix of GT-1 has at least a 20-fold higher affinity to Box II than to any other tested GT elements (19Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the genes for both GT-1 and GT-2 are expressed in all parts of the plants and are not regulated by light (17Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that either the transcriptional activity of the factors is regulated by post-translational modification or additional factors may be needed to regulate their activity.Table IA compilation of related GT elementsMotifGeneSequenceFactorReferenceBox IIrbcs-3AGTGTGGTTAATATGGT-114Green P.J.

Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), it has been assumed that CrmA inhibits apoptosis by blocking the activity of caspases within the transfected cells (16Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 17Los M. Vandecraen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W.

However, cotransfection of crmA cDNA poorly inhibits cell death induced by overexpression of some caspases such as caspase-2 (ICH-1 (18Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J.

Also, CrmA inhibits the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by purified caspase-3 (CPP32) only poorly (15Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, it remains to be determined whether the inhibition of apoptosis by CrmA results solely from the blockade of caspase(s). We have established a cell-free system in which isolated nuclei undergo morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis when exposed to cytoplasmic extracts (S/M extracts) from chicken DU249 cells committed to apoptotic cell death (22Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Using this in vitro system, PARP was identified as the first confirmed substrate for any caspase in apoptotic cells (23Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that lamin cleavage during nuclear apoptosis in vitro requires an enzyme distinct from the PARP-cleaving caspase (24Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and showed that Mch2 can act as a lamin protease (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E.

Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), revealed at least five distinct labeled polypeptides, which we termed prICE1-prICE5 (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E.

Here we show that rabbitpox virus (RPV) CrmA/SPI-2 inhibits the caspase(s) catalyzing the cleavage of lamin A and the disintegration of nuclei into apoptotic body-like fragments in the cell-free system. Peptides RLVEIDNGKQR (D peptide) and RLVEIANGKQR (A peptide) were synthesized based on the apoptosis-specific cleavage site within human lamin A (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The polyhistidine tract coding region of pET-16b (Novagen) was amplified using primers SM280 (5′-GAAGGAGATATATCATGAGCCATC-3′) and SM281 (5′-GGAATTCCCATGGCCATATGACGACCTTCG-3′), digested with BspHI and EcoRI, and inserted into pTM1 (26Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) that had been digested with NcoI and EcoRI. The RPV Spi2 open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA using primers RM233 (5′-GGGCCATGGATATCTTCAGGGAAAT-3′) and SM229 (5′-GGACCCGGGTTAACAATTAGTTGTTGGAGAGC-3′) and digested with NcoI and SmaI. The swinepox virus Spi7 open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA using primers RM231 (5′-CCGGATCCCCATGGATGTTTTTTTGAAACTG-3′) and RM230 (5′-GCGGATCCTTACATAGGAGAGATGATTTT-3′) and digested with NcoI and BamHI. The fragments were inserted into the multiple cloning site within the pTM1 vector under the control of the T7 promoter (26Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and in frame with the polyhistidine tract to construct pTM1-His-Spi2 and pTM1-His-Spi7, respectively. Recombinant viruses were generated by transfecting pTM1-His-Spi2 and pTM1-His-Spi7 plasmids into sub-confluent CV-1 cells (ATCC) using LipofectACE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were co-infected with vaccinia virus (VV) strain WR at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. The resulting progeny virus was plaqued on Rat2 thymidine kinase− cells (ATCC) under 0.5% agarose and selected with 100 μg/ml 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. Three days post-infection, well isolated plaques were picked and subjected to two subsequent rounds of plaque purification. The resultant thymidine kinase− recombinant viruses (VV-His-Spi2 and VV-His-Spi7) were further selected with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, expanded, and titered. Confluent RK-13 cells (ATCC) in a 150-mm dish were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 5 of either VV-His-Spi2 or VV-His-Spi7, both in the presence of vTF7-3 (ATCC VR-2153) that expresses the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. At 16-19 h post-infection, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, at 4°C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The cell suspension was supplemented with 250 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 M NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50% glycerol, placed on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 4800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The cleared supernatant from five 150-mm dishes was loaded onto a column packed with 3.5 ml of His-Bind resin (Novagen) that had been charged with 50 mM NiSO4 and equilibrated with binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9). The proteins were eluted with binding buffer that was supplemented with imidazole at 60, 100, and 200 mM, plus aprotinin (400 ng/ml) and 5% glycerol. This was followed by a wash with stripping buffer (100 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9). Protein purity was monitored by silver staining. Fractions containing CrmA/SPI-2 and SPI-7 were concentrated using Microsep 10K centrifugal concentrators (Filtron) at 10,000 × g. Purified CrmA/SPI-2 and SPI-7 were dissolved at 300 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml in serpin solvent (200 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 400 ng/ml aprotinin, 5% glycerol) and stored at −80°C. Cytoplasmic extracts from preapoptotic chicken DU249 cells (S/M extracts) were prepared as described previously (22Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). For CrmA/SPI-2 inhibition, S/M extracts (10-25 mg/ml) were preincubated at 37°C for 25 min with 10% serpin solvent, with CrmA/SPI-2 (1-30 μg/ml), with SPI-7 (1-20 μg/ml), or with 100 μM YVAD-cmk (Bachem). Incubations were performed in the presence of an ATP regeneration system consisting of 2 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate (Calbiochem), and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase. Nuclei (1.5 × 106) isolated from HeLa S3 cells as described (22Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) were added to 10 μl of the pretreated S/M extracts, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 90 min. Nuclei in 1 μl of the mixtures were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, a fluorescent probe for DNA, to assess morphological changes. Proteins were recovered from 3 μl of the reaction mixtures to analyze cleavage of PARP and lamin A by immunoblotting as described (24Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Nuclear DNA was recovered from 6 μl of the mixtures by a standard method (27Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to analyze DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis. S/M extracts were preincubated with 100 μM YVAD-cmk, 100 μM TLCK, 0.5% methanol (solvent for TLCK), 30 μg/ml CrmA/SPI-2, 20 μg/ml SPI-7, or 10% serpin solvent for 15 min at 37°C. In other experiments, S/M extracts were pretreated for 1 min on ice with 5 mg/ml of the D peptide, with 5 mg/ml of the A peptide, or with phosphate-buffered saline containing 7% Me2SO to control for solvent effects. YV(bio)KD-aomk (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) was added to the pretreated S/M extracts and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Labeled proteins were electrophoresed in 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ECL (Amersham Corp.). We first examined whether RPV CrmA/SPI-2 affects the apoptotic morphological changes of nuclei in our cell-free system. In the presence of CrmA/SPI-2, the initial condensation of chromatin proceeded uninterrupted. However, overall shrinkage of nuclei and the disintegration of the nuclei into apoptotic body-like fragments were blocked in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D-G). At 30 μg/ml of CrmA/SPI-2, the nuclear apoptotic changes were halted at an intermediate stage, with the chromatin condensed against the periphery of the nuclei (Fig. 1G). In contrast, SPI-7, another poxvirus serpin predicted to have Asp at its P1 site 2R. W. Moyer, unpublished observations. did not affect the progression of apoptotic changes in vitro (Fig. 1H). Despite this blockade of the morphological changes at an intermediate stage, CrmA/SPI-2 did not affect the internucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA at any concentration tested (Fig. 2, lanes 4-8). SPI-7 also had no significant effect on DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2, lane 9). YVAD-cmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor at the concentration used here, completely blocked both the morphological changes in nuclei (Fig. 1I) and DNA ladder formation (Fig. 2, lane 10), as described previously (23Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the cell-free system is not affected by CrmA/SPI-2. DNA recovered from HeLa nuclei treated as in Fig. 1 was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. HeLa nuclei were incubated in MDB buffer supplemented with 10% serpin solvent (lane 1), in MDB buffer with 30 μg/ml CrmA/SPI-2 (lane 2), or in S/M extracts pretreated with 10% serpin solvent (lane 3), with CrmA/SPI-2 at indicated concentrations (lanes 4-8), with 20 μg/ml SPI-7 (lane 9), or with 100 μM YVAD-cmk (lane 10).

Cleavage of PARP was not significantly inhibited at any concentration of CrmA/SPI-2 (Fig. 3, upper lanes 4-7), consistent with a recent report that showed a very poor inhibition of PARP cleavage in apoptotic osteosarcoma cell extracts by cowpox virus-derived CrmA/SPI-2 (9Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage of nuclear lamin A, another hallmark of apoptosis (28Ucker D.S. Meyers J. Obermiller P.S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1583-1592PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar), was inhibited by the CrmA/SPI-2 protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, lower lanes 4-7). In contrast, SPI-7 did not inhibit either PARP or lamin A cleavage (data not shown). In control experiments, proteolysis of both PARP and lamin A was blocked by YVAD-cmk, consistent with the cleavage of both substrates by caspases (Fig. 3, lane 8). Recent studies revealed that the cleavage of both PARP (15Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and the 70-kDa protein component of the U1 small ribonucleoprotein particle (30Tewari M. Beidler D.R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) are inhibited by transfection of the crmA cDNA into cells. However, those experiments do not necessarily mean that the CrmA-sensitive protease(s) are directly responsible for the observed effects; the results could be explained equally well if CrmA inhibits an upstream protease whose action leads to the activation of downstream proteases that cleave PARP and the U1 70-kDa protein. Further experiments suggested that the inhibition of lamin A cleavage by CrmA/SPI-2 in our cell-free system is likely to be mediated by direct inhibition of a caspase. This conclusion is based on the use of YV(bio)KD-aomk (25Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which covalently derivatizes residues within the active site of active caspases, enabling them to be revealed directly on immunoblots using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ECL (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Incubation of S/M extracts with YV(bio)KD-aomk revealed five labeled polypeptides ranging from 19.5 to 17.5 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1). We previously termed these species prICE1-prICE5 (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Labeling with YV(bio)KD-aomk was used to assess the effects of a series of inhibitors on the activities of prICE1-prICE5. These results are most consistent with the conclusion that prICE5 is the endogenous lamin protease in S/M extracts. Competition experiments using a peptide spanning the cleavage site within PARP had previously suggested that prICE1 is a PARP-cleaving caspase (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A.

This peptide had no effect on the binding of YV(bio)KD-aomk to prICE4 and prICE5 (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G.

CrmA/SPI-2 inhibited the binding of YV(bio)KD-aomk to prICE5 and, to a lesser extent, prICE4 (Fig. 4B, lane 5), whereas in a control experiment, SPI-7 had no effect (Fig. 4B, lane 6). We previously demonstrated that the cleavage of recombinant human lamin A by S/M extracts is inhibited by a peptide spanning the cleavage site within human lamin A (RLVEIDNGKQR = D peptide) but not by a mutant peptide in which the P1 residue (Asp) was mutated to Ala (RLVEIANGKQR = A peptide) (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, the D peptide preferentially inhibited the binding of YV(bio)KD-aomk to prICE5 (lane 2), whereas the A peptide had no significant effect (lane 3). In control experiments, the labeling of prICE1-prICE5 was inhibited by 100 μM YVAD-cmk (Fig. 4A, lane 2), a broad spectrum inhibitor of caspases at this concentration. The data of Fig. 4 show competitions between noncovalent inhibitors (CrmA/SPI-2 and the cleavage site peptides) and the covalent inhibitor YV(bio)KD-aomk. We have been unable to observe effective competition at the high concentrations of YV(bio)KD-aomk required to label prICE2 and prICE3, and therefore the effect of lamin cleavage site peptides, CrmA/SPI-2, or SPI-7 on the activity of these two caspases is not known (data not shown). Because the cleavage of lamin A in S/M extracts is inhibited by TLCK (24Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), CrmA/SPI-2 (Fig. 3, lanes 4-7) and the peptide corresponding to the cleavage site in lamin A (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), the caspase that is inactivated by these three inhibitors, prICE5, is most likely a lamin-cleaving enzyme. The fact that TLCK and CrmA/SPI-2 inhibit both the cleavage of lamin A and the completion of morphological apoptosis in S/M extracts suggests that the activity of the lamin protease (probably prICE5) is required for completion of morphological apoptosis. This makes excellent sense given the structural role of the lamin intermediate filament network in providing a structural support for the nuclear envelope. Lamin cleavage may thus serve not only to release lamin-chromatin interactions as previously suggested (24Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) but also to render the nuclear envelope malleable so that it can be packaged into condensed apoptotic bodies. Accumulating evidence suggests that apoptosis is mediated by combinations of caspases acting in concert (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D.

Further studies of the effects of inhibitors such as CrmA/SPI-2 on caspases active in apoptosis may ultimately provide us a means of controlling apoptotic cell death in order to suppress unwanted apoptosis in a tissue-specific manner (31Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar) or to induce apoptosis in selected cell populations (32Fisher D.E.

To help elucidate further the mechanism by which ZAP-70 regulates these initial events, we used a dominant-negative mutant approach. We overexpressed in the Jurkat T-cell line ZAP-70 mutated on Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 in the putative regulatory loop of its kinase domain. This mutant inhibited TCR-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells by interfering with both intracellular calcium increase and Ras-regulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Moreover, TCR-induced phosphorylation of pp36-38, thought to play a role upstream of these pathways, was found to be reduced. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type ZAP-70 induced constitutive activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. The ZAP-70 mutant studied here could be phosphorylated on tyrosine when associated to the TCR ζ chain and was able to bind p56lck. This result demonstrates that Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 are not responsible for the Src homology domain 2-mediated association of p56lck with ZAP-70. Our data are most consistent with a model in which recruitment to the TCR allows ZAP-70 autophosphorylation and binding to p56lck, which in turn phosphorylates Tyr-492 and/or Tyr-493 with consequent up-regulation of the ZAP-70 kinase activity.

According to the crystal structure (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), six nucleotide-binding sites are present between subunits α and β, three catalytical mainly on β and three noncatalytical on α. The detailed mechanism by which F-ATPases synthesize ATP and couple ATP hydrolysis to proton pumping is still unknown, but it is generally accepted that two to three of the six nucleotide-binding sites participate cooperatively in the reaction and that ion flux through the F0 portion of the enzyme causes conformational changes that are relayed into F1 to drive ATP liberation. The binding change model of ATP synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 2Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 6Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) envisages a functional cycling between these catalytic sites. Its structural correlate may be a rotation of γ relative to (αβ)3. This concept is supported by the recently published structure of F1 from bovine heart mitochondria at 2.8-Å resolution (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), by electron microscopy (11Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The identity and linkage of the other “stator” or “rotor” elements of F1 with their counterparts in F0, however, remain to be elucidated.Subunits γ, δ, and ϵ are thought to function at the interface between the membrane-embedded F0 and the extrinsic F1. They are instrumental for the coupling between ion movements through F0 and ATP release from F1 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D.

Purified subunit δ enhances the reconstitutional activity of CF1 lacking subunit δ (CF1(−δ)) in partially CF1-depleted thylakoids. This enhancement has been attributed to the plugging of open CF0 channels. Because of the reduced proton leak, the protonmotive force was restored, which activated both the reconstituted and remaining CF0CF1 (15Engelbrecht S. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 321-325Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14518-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Five Ser → Cys point mutants of chloroplast δ were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The engineered single Cys residues were modified with a sulfhydryl-specific dye or with heterobifunctional and photoactivable cross-linking reagents. We studied the topological and functional consequences of cross-linking δ to other F1 subunits. All mutant δ subunits were cross-linked to either the α or β subunit under all conditions employed. Cross-linking did not impair ATP hydrolysis by soluble CF1. ATP synthesis by CF0CF1 seemed to be impaired.DISCUSSIONWe engineered cysteines into subunit δ of spinach chloroplast CF0CF1 at sequence positions (Ser) 10, 57, 82, 160, and 166. The cysteines served as anchors for the maleimide function of photoactivable cross-linking reagents. The aim was 2-fold: 1) to gain information on the location of subunit δ in the complex and 2) to reveal the functional consequences of cross-linking on ATP hydrolysis with CF1 and ATP synthesis with CF0CF1.Structural ConsiderationsThe engineered cysteine residues reacted with the fluorescent reagent eosin-5-maleimide when δ was solubilized, but also when δ was incorporated into CF1. All but Cys-160 and Cys-166 were just as reactive when δ was incorporated into CF0CF1. This points to a rather peripheral location of δ, with most of the engineered Cys residues remaining solvent-exposed even after binding of δ to (CF0)CF1. The largely α-helical structure of subunit δ (84%) (37Engelbrecht S. Reed J. Penin F. Gautheron D. Junge W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1991; 46: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with many of the side chains pointing outwards and the expected exposed location of the polar hydroxyl group of Ser residues are compatible with this view. Our interpretation relied on two assumptions. 1) Eosin-5-maleimide does not penetrate into the protein interior; and 2) the reagent does not induce the dissociation of δ from the remainder of the complex. The hindered access of eosin-5-maleimide to Cys-166 in CF0CF1 makes the first assumption plausible, and the fact that δ was isolated together with CF1 from reconstituted washed NaBr vesicles supports the second.δ was cross-linked exclusively to α and β, and this allowed us to narrow down its position in CF0CF1. δ participates in the coupling of proton translocation through F0 and substrate conversion in F1. It functionally interacts both with F0 and with F1 (reviewed in Ref. 14Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Was δ cross-linked to one particular α/β pair, or was it “bridging” two or even all three α subunits, depending on the position of the engineered Cys residue? In view of the recently published structure of MF1 (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), the length of the cross-linker and the distribution of the cross-links (one between δ and β and four between δ and α) would seem to exclude the latter possibility. It is unlikely that δ traverses one complete β subunit, a distance of at least 50 Å (cf. Fig. 3 in Ref. 10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar). Instead, δ probably interacts with one single α/β couple.Where is δ located in CF1? The cross-linked fragments generated by cleavage at Cys residues contained the span β1-62 with δS10C→β and the span α1-192 with δS57C→α, δS82C→α, and δS166C→α. These segments are shown in light gray at the top of CF1 in Fig. 7. This implied that the amino-terminal portions of both subunits α and β were within ~10 Å of δ10, δ57, δ82, and δ166.According to the atomic structure of F1 (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), most of these portions of α and β are located at the periphery and at the top third of F1 (cf. Fig. 7). Taking the δ⇆ CF0-I cross-link (38Beckers G. Berzborn R.J. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) into account, this would imply the following. Subunit I (α in E. coli) protrudes from the membrane around the outside of F1 up to the point where it contacts δ. In view of the δS10C⇆β cross-link, Cys-10 is expected rather at the top of the F1 molecule. The mass of subunit δ (21 kDa) and its elongated shape (14Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in comparison with known proteins of similar size may allow for a length of ~45 Å. δ then could reach down to just below the height of the nucleotide-binding sites. Beckers et al. (38Beckers G. Berzborn R.J. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) concluded that δ is cross-linked to the C-terminal end of subunit I of CF0, which is built from one transmembrane stretch plus a hydrophilic headpiece. If its hydrophilic head is stretched out, subunit I would be long enough to contact δ. In our view, δ by itself is not part of the stalk linking F0 and F1.The data presented here are compatible with and expand results from other laboratories. Studies with E. coli F1 revealed an α⇆δ disulfide cross-link (39Bragg P.D. Hou C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Tozer R.G. Dunn S.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) involving δCys-140 (equivalent to Cys-141 in spinach δ) (41Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E. coli α contains Cys residues at positions 47, 90, 193, and 243. These residues correspond to positions 48, 91, 194, and 244 in spinach chloroplast α and to positions 47, 90, 201, and 251 in mature bovine heart mitochondrial α, respectively. We homology-built the E. coli sequence of subunit α into the Leslie-Walker structure (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar) 2A. G. W. Leslie, personal communication.; modeling was performed with WHATIF 4.99 (42Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). The modeled positions of the four Cys residues in E. coli α are as follows. Residues 47 and 90 are close together and rather exposed at the β-sheet on top of α, with Cys-90 sticking out just a little bit farther than Cys-47; Cys-193 and Cys-243 are both buried in the central domain not far from the nucleotide-binding region. The disulfide cross-link between EF1-δCys-140 and EF1-α thus pins the reactive sites on α down to residue 47 or 90. In a different approach, it has been shown that proteolytic digestion of the amino-terminal portion of both EF1-α (43Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6891-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MF1-α (44Hundal T. Norling B. Ernster L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) results in loss of the capability to bind EF1-δ or oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein. Taken together, these results identify the amino-terminal third of subunit α as the prime candidate for the binding of δ and oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein.The rather exposed position of δ on the outside of the upper half of the (αβ)3 assembly contrasts with conclusions inferred from immunological and proteolysis studies. A rather hidden location of δ within intact CF0CF1 has been postulated (27Engelbrecht S. Schürmann K. Junge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 45Berzborn R.J. Finke W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1989; 44: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, though, that antibodies are sterically or electrostatically excluded from the thylakoid membrane surface. An exposed location of δ within CF0CF1 is compatible both with the recently published 2.8-Å structure of mitochondrial F1 (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

When engineered and chemically modified δ was added to CF1(−δ), the activities of isolated CF1 were unaffected. The hydrolysis activity by solubilized and chemically modified CF1 was not impaired even after photolysis of the second function of the cross-linker. Cross-linked CF1 rebound to CF0 with about the same affinity as native CF1, and it restored photophosphorylation in partially CF1-depleted thylakoids (EDTA vesicles) to the same extent as non-cross-linked CF1. Preliminary data suggested that the ability of modified δ to functionally reconstitute ATP synthesis in NaBr vesicles might be impaired by photo-cross-linking.Recently, a large-scale (>200°) rotational motion in a few 10 ms of subunit γ relative to immobilized (αβ)3 of spinach CF1 was demonstrated (13Sabbert D.

According to the crystal structure (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), six nucleotide-binding sites are present between subunits α and β, three catalytical mainly on β and three noncatalytical on α. The detailed mechanism by which F-ATPases synthesize ATP and couple ATP hydrolysis to proton pumping is still unknown, but it is generally accepted that two to three of the six nucleotide-binding sites participate cooperatively in the reaction and that ion flux through the F0 portion of the enzyme causes conformational changes that are relayed into F1 to drive ATP liberation. The binding change model of ATP synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 2Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 6Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

This concept is supported by the recently published structure of F1 from bovine heart mitochondria at 2.8-Å resolution (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The identity and linkage of the other “stator” or “rotor” elements of F1 with their counterparts in F0, however, remain to be elucidated.Subunits γ, δ, and ϵ are thought to function at the interface between the membrane-embedded F0 and the extrinsic F1. They are instrumental for the coupling between ion movements through F0 and ATP release from F1 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D.

Purified subunit δ enhances the reconstitutional activity of CF1 lacking subunit δ (CF1(−δ)) in partially CF1-depleted thylakoids. This enhancement has been attributed to the plugging of open CF0 channels. Because of the reduced proton leak, the protonmotive force was restored, which activated both the reconstituted and remaining CF0CF1 (15Engelbrecht S. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 321-325Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Lill H. Engelbrecht S.

The engineered single Cys residues were modified with a sulfhydryl-specific dye or with heterobifunctional and photoactivable cross-linking reagents. We studied the topological and functional consequences of cross-linking δ to other F1 subunits. All mutant δ subunits were cross-linked to either the α or β subunit under all conditions employed. Cross-linking did not impair ATP hydrolysis by soluble CF1. ATP synthesis by CF0CF1 seemed to be impaired."

Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Multiple molecular forms of N-CAM are now known to be expressed from a single copy gene, depending on spatiotemporal stages of the cells (1Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The molecular diversity is produced by various modifications. One is due to an alternative splicing, which gives rise to three major forms of N-CAM with different membrane-anchoring modes, whose extracellular domains contain a tandem alignment of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and fibronectin-type (III) domains (1Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Modification by glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation of the protein core also results in great molecular diversity and consequent functional differences (1Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J.

Addition of polysialic acid (polySia), which is a unique homopolymer of α2→8-linked sialic acid (Sia), is the most important modification of N-CAM. Expression of polySia chains on N-CAM is developmentally regulated and negatively affects the adhesive properties of the cells (5Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 6Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Bitter-Suermann Finne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polysialylation occurs on N-glycan chains in the fifth Ig domain, where two of the three N-glycosylation sites have been shown to be polysialylated (7Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). neural cell adhesion molecule α2→6-sialyltransferase α2→8-sialyltransferase α2→8-polysialyltransferase endosialidase-treated PSgp immunoglobulin fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry gas-liquid chromatography high performance liquid chromatography sialic acid oligosialic acid polysialic acid polysialyl glycopeptide fraction prepared from embryonic chick brain homogenate thin-layer chromatography total correlation spectroscopy thiobarbituric acid. Interestingly, in embryonic vertebrate brain, N-CAM is the major carrier protein of polySia chains (8Cremer R.W. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W. Nature. 1994; 367: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The question why N-CAM is selectively polysialylated in embryonic brains remains unelucidated. It is possible that a particular protein sequence may play a role in determining the expression of polysialyl units on certain glycoproteins, as is the case with mannose-6-phosphate-bearing lysosomal enzymes (9Varki A. Reiman M.L. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and 4-O-sulfated GalNAc terminated glycoprotein hormones (10Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In a recent report on polysialylation of N-CAM, the importance of the domain organization of the protein was suggested, although the involvement of a specific protein sequence determinant was not ruled out (7Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also conceivable that the core glycan structure codes a signal for initiation of polysialylation. For example, the sulfotransferase responsible for 4-O-sulfation of terminal GalNAc is known not to recognize the peptide sequence of the acceptor glycoprotein hormones (11Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, a cryptic signal, which triggers initiation of polysialylation, could be present in the core glycan chain. We have recently demonstrated that biosynthesis of polysialic acid chains on O-glycans of fish egg polysialoglycoproteins involves at least three distinct sialyltransferase (ST)-catalyzed reactions and a KDN capping reaction (12Kitazume S.

Likewise the biosynthetic pathway for polysialic acid chain formation on N-glycans is presumably similarly complicated, and a series of transferases are probably involved besides those needed for core glycosylation. Much effort has been devoted to clarifying the biosynthetic mechanism of polySia chain formation in embryonic brains using partially purified enzyme preparations, and it is now known that the developmentally dependent up- and down-regulation of expression of enzyme activity parallels the polySia epitope expression (14McCoy R.D.

At least two distinct types of α2→8polySTs were shown to exist in rat brain (20Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 116-122Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how critical these enzymes are in the in vivo biosynthesis of polySia chains, and nothing is known about their substrate specificities or whether such enzymes are regulated by particular protein sequences or glycan moieties. To address these important problems, we are determining detailed structures of the glycan chains present in N-CAM molecules. In this paper we report the results of our studies on the structural determination of the polysialylated glycan chain(s) present in the embryonic form of chicken brain N-CAM. In 1982, Finne (22Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported some evidence suggesting the presence of both tri- and tetraantennary structures in the polysialylated glycan chains of N-CAM from fetal rat brains, although no further details were described. The present study has revealed several new structural features, not reported by the early pioneering work by Finne (22Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which include some possible candidates for polysialylation signals. Embryonic chick brains were excised from 3,200 14-day-old embryos (amber) and stored at −80°C. Endo-N (23Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R. Yu F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol.

Robbins (National institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), respectively. In one experiment, 100 brains (40 g) were homogenized in 120 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and mixed with 320 ml of methanol and 160 ml of chloroform by stirring for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min, the pellet was suspended in 300 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/methanol/chloroform (3:8:4, v/v), stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged. The pellet was suspended in 100 ml of ethanol and filtered to remove chloroform and methanol. The residue (about 15 g) was suspended in 380 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mM CaCl2, and incubated under toluene with 0.2 g of Actinase E (Kaken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C. After 24 and 48 h, 0.2 g each of Actinase E was added. After a 72-h incubation, the digest was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant prepared from 500 brains was applied to a column of DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0), and followed by stepwise elution with 1.0 liter each of 0, 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0 M NaCl in the equilibration buffer. The 0.6 M NaCl fraction was diluted with 2.0 liters of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column, eluted first with 0.2 M NaCl in the same buffer, and next with 900 ml of a linear gradient of 0.2-0.7 M NaCl in the same buffer. Elution profile was monitored by the TBA method (25Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 26Uchida Y. Tsukada Y. Sugimori T. J. Biochem.

The pooled fraction positive for poly-Sia was concentrated and applied on a Sephacryl S-200 column. Molecular weight markers used were dextran (Sigma; Mr 487,000, 72,200, 39,000, and 9,400) and galactose. The polySia-positive fraction was dialyzed and subjected to DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography. The column was eluted first with the equilibration buffer, and then with 900 ml of linear gradient of 0-0.7 M NaCl in the same buffer. The pooled polySia-positive fraction was desalted. PSgp (3.6 mg as Neu5Ac), prepared from 450 brains, was digested with 600 milliunits of Arthrobacter ureafaciens exosialidase (Nacalai Co., Kyoto, Japan) at 37°C for 72 h (27Iwasaki M. Inoue S.

The flow-through glycopeptide fraction was treated with 0.1 M NaOH for 30 min, neutralized with 0.1 M HCl, and redigested with 75 milliunits of the sialidase at 37°C for 30 h. The digest was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 column (eluted with 50 mM NH4HCO3) and the asialo-glycopeptide fraction, asialo-PSgp, was desalted. Asialo-PSgp was applied on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column, and eluted first with 2 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and next with 2 ml of 0.3 M NaCl in the same buffer. The 0.3 M NaCl fractions were pooled, rechromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 column, and desalted. PSgp (4 mg as Neu5Ac) from 500 brains was digested with total of 750 milliunits of Endo-N at 37°C for 72 h in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. During incubation an aliquot was examined at every 12 h for the absence of polymer by TLC (see below), and the enzyme (125 milliunits each) was added to the reaction mixture. Digestion continued until no further change in chain length of the released oligoSia was confirmed after prolonged incubation with additional enzyme. Endo-PSgp was separated from oligoSia by a Sephadex G-50 column and desalted. The oligoSia fraction obtained by Endo-N treatment of PSgp was incubated in 0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid at 70°C for 30 min and applied on a Sephadex A-25 column (equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The column was eluted with 5 ml each of 0, 0.05, 0.2 M NaCl in the same buffer. The 0.05 M NaCl fraction that contained Sia was desalted and subjected to preparative TLC. The Sia fraction was spotted on a 0.2-mm-thick silica gel plate (Kiesel gel 60, Merck) and developed in 1-butanol/1-propanol/water (5:10:3, v/v/v) (28Sato C. Kitajima K. Tazawa I. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23675-23684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slit of the plate was visualized by the resorcinol method (29Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), and the band corresponding to O-acetylated Neu5Ac was extracted with 10% ethanol for FAB-MS measurement. For quantitating O-Ac Neu5Ac, the oligoSia fraction was hydrolyzed as described above, and O-Ac Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac obtained by preparative TLC were analyzed by the TBA method (25Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 26Uchida Y. Tsukada Y. Sugimori T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Identification and quantitation of O-Ac Neu5Ac in PSgp were also made by fluorometric HPLC essentially according to the method of Hara et al. (30Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Taketomi Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A glycoprotein fraction isolated from carp eggs was used as a source for Neu5,7Ac2, Neu5,8Ac2, Neu5,9Ac2, and Neu5,7(8),9Ac3. 2S. Inoue, manuscript in preparation. A sialooligosaccharide isolated from the eggs of Tribolodon hakonensis (a dace) was used as a source for Neu4,5Ac2 (31Inoue S. Iwasaki M. Ishii K. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sia was determined by the mild acid hydrolysis-subsequent mild methanolysis/GLC (32Kitajima K. Inoue S. Kitazume S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The presence of polySia was analyzed by the following methods. Each sample (1.6 μg as Neu5Ac) was hydrolyzed in 0.05 M trifluoroacetic acid at 80°C for 0 to 3 h and released Sia was determined by the TBA method. The rate of hydrolysis of α2,8-linked polySia is shown to be significantly slower than that of α2,3- and α2,6-linkages of Sia. Incubation periods necessary for completion of hydrolysis were 3 h for polyα2,8-Sia and 30-45 min for α2→3- and α2→6-sialosides (33Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reactivity with H.46 antibodies was tested by the Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion method (34Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18269-18276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sample (10 μg of Neu5Ac) was partially hydrolyzed in 0.05 M trifluoroacetic acid at 80°C for 15 min. The hydrolysate was analyzed for formation of oligoSia by TLC (see below). Samples were spotted on 0.2-mm-thick silica gel plates (Kiesel gel 60, Merck), and developed in 1-propanol/25% ammonia/water (6: 1: 2.5, v/v). The plate was visualized by the resorcinol reagent (33Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sia was quantitated by the TBA method and the resorcinol method (25Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 26Uchida Y. Tsukada Y. Sugimori T. J. Biochem.

Carbohydrate composition and amino acid analyses were carried out as previously reported (35Nomoto H. Iwasaki M. Endo T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Matsumura G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Troy F.A. Cho J.-W. Lennarz W.J. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22712-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation analysis of glycopeptides and oligosaccharides was carried out according to Anumula and Taylor (37Anumula K.R. Taylor P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol and hexosaminitol acetates were quantitated by GLC analysis (38Taguchi T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Iwamatsu T. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2353-2362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate ion was determined by the HPLC analysis of acid hydrolysate of samples. Five to 10 nmol of each sample were hydrolyzed in vacuo in 6 M HCl at 110°C for 24 h and applied to a TSK gel IC-anion PW column, which was equilibrated with 0.5 mM sodium phthalate in solution containing 0.036% boric acid, 0.05% sodium tetraborate, 0.2% (w/v) sodium gluconate, 12% acetonitrile, and 3% (v/v) 1-butanol, and eluted with the same solution. Elution was monitored and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 265 nm using sodium sulfate solution as standard. PSgp from 50 embryonic brains was 14C-labeled by reductive methylation using H14CHO (DuPont NEN) (37Anumula K.R. Taylor P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Labeling experiment was carried out at the Radioisotope Center, University of Tokyo. N,N′-Di-[14C]methyl-labeled peptides (100 MBq) were hydrolyzed in vacuo in 6 M HCl at 110°C for 10 h. The hydrolysate was spotted on an 0.2-mm-thick silica gel plate, developed in ethyl acetate/pyridine/water/acetic acid (5:5:1:3, v/v/v/v), and analyzed for radioactivity on a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer. Authentic 14C-labeled amino acids were prepared (39Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22110-22114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Asialo-PSgp and Smith degradation products (see below) were desulfated by methanolysis. Samples were dried up in vacuo in a desiccator, and incubated in 0.5 M methanolic HCl at 25°C for 5 h. After the solvent was removed, the residue was dissolved in 200 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and loaded on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column. After washing the column with the same buffer, the flow-through fraction was desalted. Asialo-PSgp and Endo-PSgp (1.5-2.5 nmol) were dissolved in 19 μl of 26 mM sodium periodate, 0.53 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and kept in the dark at room temperature. After 6 h the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 3% ethylene glycol and stood for 30 min. The samples thus obtained were subjected to carbohydrate analysis. Asialo fetuin GP-I (40Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and A-1 (41Ishii K. Iwasaki M. Inoue S. Kenny P.T.M. Komura H. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1623-1630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as control. Asialo-PSgp (7.8 nmol) was incubated at 4°C in 12 μl of 30 mM sodium periodate, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, in the dark. After 24 h, 12 μl of the same solution was added. After another 24-h incubation, 7.2 μl of 50 mM sodium periodate were added. The reaction was stopped by adding 18.8 μl of 3% ethylene glycol. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, a 10-μl aliquot was analyzed for carbohydrate composition and the remaining 40-μl portion was reduced by adding 40 μl of 0.5 M sodium borohydride in 0.5 M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated at 4°C for 14 h. After adjusting pH to neutral with 1 M acetic acid, the solution was desalted and concentrated. The desalted sample was treated with 0.1 ml of 0.05 M HCl or 0.05 M methanolic HCl at 80°C for 1 h. Smith degradation products thus obtained were applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column to separate neutral products from sulfated products. The neutral fraction was desalted for carbohydrate analysis. The acidic fraction was subjected to a Sephadex G-25 column and analyzed for carbohydrate composition. Endo-PSgp (23 nmol) was also subjected to Smith degradation in the same way. Smith degradation products were separated into neutral from acidic fractions. The neutral fraction and the acidic fraction were desulfated before carbohydrate composition and methylation analyses. Endo-PSgp or PSgp (0.5 to 1 nmol) was digested with 0.5 unit of Salmonella typhimurium exosialidase (Takara Co., Kyoto, Japan) in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 37°C for 30 min. For O-Ac Neu5Ac, the perdeuterioacetylated sample was prepared for FAB-MS (42Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The perdeuterioacetylated sample was dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, and a 1-μl aliquot was added to the monothioglycerol matrix. The FAB mass spectrum was recorded using a VG Analytical ZAB-2S.E. FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 20-25 kV. Data acquisition and processing were performed using the VG Analytical Opus software. Permethylated derivatives of Smith degradation products of Endo-PSgp were similarly analyzed by FAB-MS. One-dimensional and two-dimensional 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AMX-500 NMR spectrometer at 23°C. Two-dimensional TOCSY was determined using a MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 100 and 50 ms. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts/million (ppm) relative to the methyl signal of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionate-2,2,3,3-d4. A fraction exhibiting a slow rate of hydrolysis of interketosidic linkages typical for that of α2→8-linked polySia chains was eluted under a single sharp peak at about 0.45 M NaCl on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography of the Actinase E digest of delipidated embryonic chick brain homogenate. This fraction was eluted from a Sephacryl S-200 column in the molecular weight region from 6,500 to 20,000. The pooled fraction was subjected to DEAE-Sephadex A-25 rechromatography and named as PSgp. The isolation of PSgp was confirmed by the binding activity with H.46 antibody and susceptibility to Endo-N digestion (data not shown). Exhaustive digestion of PSgp with Endo-N gave the glycopeptide fraction (Endo-PSgp) and free oligoSia with DP ranging from 1 to 9, which were detected by TLC analysis. The Endo-PSgp, Kav = 0.24, was separated from the oligoSia fraction (Kav = 0.37-0.64) by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. Endo-PSgp contained Asx and Ser in a molar ratio of 1.0: 0.61 relative to 3 mol of Man (Table I) and the N-terminal amino acids of Endo-PSgp were determined to be Asx and Ser in a molar ratio of 1.0: 0.85. These results suggested that Endo-PSgp consisted of a 1.0:0.85 mixture of glycoasparagine and glycopeptide having ±Ser-Ser-Asn sequence, in which the glycan chain was attached to the Asn residue. Polysialylated glycan chains have been shown to be linked to one or more glycosylated Asn residues present in the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of N-CAM (7Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the Ser-Ser-Asn sequence is located at the second site of glycosylation. Thus, at least 46% of the polySia-glycan chains are attached to the second site. No information on the possible polysialylation of the other two glycosylation sites was provided by the above data, but our results are not inconsistent with the recent report of mutant N-CAM expression experiments on transfected cells, where it is proposed that the second and third sites are heavily polysialylated (7Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Table I.Chemical composition of PSgp, Endo-PSgp, and asialo-PSgpPSgpEndo-PSgpAsialo-PSgpFuc0.801.20.51aPartial hydrolysis of Fuc residue occurred during exosialidase digestion at pH"

However, the combination of these two cytokines markedly down-regulated muscarinic M2 receptor protein and mRNA expression and uncoupled M2 receptors from adenylyl cyclase. There was no effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on the m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA stability, and nuclear run-on assays showed reduced m2 receptor gene transcription. Sequential cytokine addition suggests that the synergy involves postreceptor events. Although the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H8 provided a significant protection against receptor down-regulation, the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X had no effect. The ceramide analog C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) was without effect on m2 receptor expression. However, a strong synergistic effect was demonstrated when cells were treated with the combination of C2-ceramide and TNF-α or IL-1β. TNF-α and/or IL-1β combination also activated the 46- and 55-kDa c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases and to a lesser extent p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms. Cycloheximide abolished the TNF-α and IL-1β effect, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required for receptor down-regulation. These results suggest that the TNF-α and IL-1β synergize to induce transcriptional down-regulation of the M2 muscarinic receptor, which seems to be mediated through activation of both ceramide and cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathways.

Furthermore, these results suggest that M2 receptor expression is under the control of a cytokine network. Inflammation is an important component of the acute and chronic phases of asthma in humans. Cytokines released by immune and inflammatory cells infiltrating the airways are well recognized as key mediators in the orchestration and perpetuation of the chronic inflammation in asthma (1Arai K.-I. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 2Barnes P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S42-S49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many cytokines have been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma. Of particular interest, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor αILinterleukinMAPmitogen-activated proteinMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinasePKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKCprotein kinase C. and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) have been reported to be increased in asthma (2Barnes P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S42-S49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are released on mast cell degranulation, by antigen-stimulated T lymphocytes, or from cytokine-stimulated macrophages or monocytes, although other types can be stimulated to secrete TNF-α and IL-β (3Beutler B.

These pleiotropic cytokines are critical for the initiation of cytokine cascades that facilitate leukocyte recruitment through the induction of adhesion molecule expression and chemotactic protein (chemokine) production from multiple cell types (5Dinarello C.A.

Of the five cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes, the human lung expresses only three muscarinic receptor subtypes that are differentially distributed in the airways (8Barnes P.J. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Prejunctional M2 receptors regulating acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerves have been demonstrated in human airways (9Patel H.J. Barnes P.J. Takahashi T. Tadjkarimi S. Yacoub M.H. Belvisi M.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and in vivo studies suggest that they may be dysfunctional in patients with asthma (10Minette P.A. Lammers J. Dixon C.M.S. McCusker M.T. Barnes P.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Alteration of these M2 autoreceptors on parasympathetic nerves was also demonstrated in the guinea pig after ozone exposure, antigen challenge, and viral infection (11Fryer A.D. Jacoby D.B. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which the function of these receptors is altered in asthma are unclear. We have previously shown that M2 receptors can be down-regulated by muscarinic and β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (12Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Rousell J. Haddad E.-B. Mak J.C.W. Webb B.L.J. Giembycz M.A. Barnes P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 629-635PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that was not due to reduced m2 receptor gene transcription. These receptors can also be transcriptionally down-regulated by protein kinase C and by the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (14Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 781-787PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rousell J. Haddad E.-B. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7213-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To gain better understanding of the regulation of M2 receptors, particularly in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, and to identify potential endogenous modulators of M2 receptor function, we have examined the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on muscarinic M2 receptor gene expression in HEL 299 cells. HEL 299 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD; ATCC code CCL 137) and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (12Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Treatments, performed on cells at passage 9, were carried out such that cells could be harvested simultaneously at preconfluence. All the membrane preparation procedures were performed at 4°C. Cells were treated with human recombinant TNF-α and/or IL-1β (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom) washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution, harvested by cell scraping using ice-cold Tris buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4), and homogenized with an Ultra-Turax homogenizer. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in an appropriate volume of Tris buffer. [3H]N-Methyl-scopolamine (DuPont NEN) saturation curves were carried out as described previously (12Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding data were analyzed with the computerized nonlinear regression program LIGAND. Following stimulation, cells were washed, and the cAMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor Org 20241 (30 μM) was added to fresh media for 30 min at 37°C. From each group of treatments basal levels of cAMP were measured, as well as accumulation following forskolin exposure (100 μM) for 10 min in the presence and absence of carbachol (100 μM). Cyclic AMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (12Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following treatments, cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution, total RNAs were isolated, and mRNA was prepared using a PolyTract® mRNA isolation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of mRNA were size fractionated and blotted onto Hybond-N filters (Amersham Corp.) by capillary action using 20 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Cloned human m2 muscarinic receptor cDNA (a gift from Dr. N. J. Buckley, National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK) was labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham). Prehybridizations and hybridizations were carried out at 42°C as described previously (15Rousell J. Haddad E.-B. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7213-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Following hybridization, blots were washed to a stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min before exposure to Kodak X-OMAT-S film. To account for differences in loading or transfer efficiencies of the mRNA, the blots were hybridized with a 1272-base pair PstI fragment from rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. The intensities of the signals were then quantified by laser densitometry (Quantity One software; PDI Imageware Systems, New York, NY). For the measurement of gene transcription, nuclei were prepared, and in vitro transcription was performed with nuclei (5 × 107) using 300 μCi of [32P]UTP as described previously (14Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 781-787PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled RNAs were isolated and added to 2 ml of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.02 μg of poly(A), and 0.02 μg poly(G) RNA). Following 4 h of prehybridization in the above buffer, hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 72 h to 10 μg of the immobilized plasmid pGEM3Z as a control or to plasmids containing inserts of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and human m2 muscarinic receptor cDNAs. The filters were washed in buffer A (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml RNase A, and 10 units/ml RNase T1) at 37°C for 30 min and then in buffer B (10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.4% SDS) to a stringency of 55°C for 30 min and autoradiographed. Following treatments, cells were washed in Hank's balanced salt solution and then scraped into cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 1.5% deoxycholate, 20 mM Tris base, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mM NaF, and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate). Cytosolic proteins were boiled for 5 min subsequent to centrifugation for 15 min in sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −70°C until used for Western blot analysis and “in-gel” phosphorylation assay. The phosphorylation of p44 and p42 MAP kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) were identified and quantified by Western blot analysis using a PhosphoPlus™ MAPK antibody kit (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham) for 1 h at 300 mA in transblotting buffer (0.2 M glycine HCl, 25 mM Tris base, and 20% (v/v) methanol). Nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated MAP kinase proteins were run in parallel and served as negative and positive controls for immunodetection of MAP kinases. To block nonspecific antibody binding, membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-phospho-MAPK polyclonal antibody used at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking buffer in which nonfat milk was replaced with 5% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were washed with blocking buffer three times for 5 min each, incubated with a 1:1500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and washed, and protein detection was carried out using the CDP-Star™ chemiluminescent reagent. Membranes were drained from excess developing solution and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT-S film. To reprobe the membrane, antibodies were stripped using 100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.7, at 50°C for 10 min. Cytosolic proteins (10 μg) were size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein kinases or glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun(1-135) (Jun kinases). After electrophoresis SDS was removed by three 20-min washes with 20% propan-2-ol in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before a further 1-h wash with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). A protein denaturation step was followed by two washes for 30 min in buffer A containing 6 M guanidine HCl before renaturation by several washes in buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40 at 4°C over 18 h. The gel was then incubated in kinase assay buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 nM EGTA, 5 mM MgAc, and 25 μM ATP) containing 25 μCi of [γ32P]ATP for 1 h. Nonspecific radioactivity was removed by five washes with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate before drying under a vacuum and subsequent exposure to Kodak X-OMAT-S film for an appropriate time. We first sought to determine whether TNF-α and IL-1β are capable of affecting the expression of M2 muscarinic receptors in cultured human embryonic lung fibroblasts, a cell line that expresses the muscarinic M2 receptor subtype with no evidence of M1, M3, and M4 receptors. M2 muscarinic receptor protein was measured with the nonselective and hydrophilic muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine. TNF-α or IL-1β alone (10 ng/ml) had no effect on the density of muscarinic binding sites over the time points investigated (data not shown). However, a strong synergistic effect was demonstrated between IL-1β and TNF-α. Indeed, the combination of the two cytokines induced a time-dependent decrease in M2 muscarinic receptor density. This down-regulation was slow, with a 53 ± 4% loss of total receptors after 24 h of cytokine stimulation (Fig. 1). The affinity of [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine for the remaining binding sites was unaltered by the treatment. The muscarinic M2 receptor is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity via a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. To assess whether M2 receptor down-regulation was associated with a functional desensitization of the receptors, cAMP accumulation was measured in intact cells that had been treated with the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β for 24 h. In untreated cells, direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity with forskolin resulted in a marked increase (100-fold) in cAMP accumulation, which was significantly inhibited following co-stimulation with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (Fig. 2). However, this inhibition by carbachol was lost after stimulation of the cells with TNF-α and IL-1β for 24 h. The basal level of cAMP was not significantly different between control and cytokine-treated cells. To determine whether the effects of the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β on M2 muscarinic receptor protein could be extended to mRNA production, expression of the m2 muscarinic receptor gene was evaluated by Northern blotting. Whereas down-regulation of m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA was absent with either TNF-α or IL-1β alone, there was a dramatic and sustained decrease in down-regulation of m2 mRNA when the two cytokines were administered in combination (Fig. 3). The kinetics plot depicted in Fig. 3B shows that the m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA steadily decreased over time. This effect was apparent after 4 h of stimulation and reached a plateau of 89% of control at 14 h and was stable up to 24 h. To investigate the mechanism of the synergy between TNF-α and IL-1β, cytokines were added sequentially to HEL 299 cells. Cells were incubated for 2 h with TNF-α. They were then washed and cultured for 6 h with IL-1β and vice versa. Muscarinic m2 receptor mRNA expression was then assessed by Northern blot analysis. Using this protocol, we could not detect any significant down-regulation of m2 receptor mRNA (data not shown), suggesting that the role of IL-1β or TNF-α is not to sensitize HEL 299 cells to the stimulating action of the other cytokine. To gain further insight into the mechanism of m2 mRNA down-regulation, we measured the stability of the muscarinic m2 receptor mRNA and the rate of transcription of the muscarinic m2 receptor gene. To measure the half-life of the m2 mRNA, HEL 299 cells were exposed to the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β for 4 h. After this incubation period, cells were washed, and the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added. The results indicate that the m2 muscarinic half-life (~3-4 h) was not affected by the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β (data not shown). To measure the influence of the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β on the rate of m2 muscarinic receptor gene transcription, nuclear run-on assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 4, transcription of the m2 gene in cells that had been exposed to TNF-α and IL-1β for 24 h was reduced by 56% compared with vehicle-treated cells. This result indicates that TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced down-regulation of m2 muscarinic mRNA is due to an inhibition of transcription. To determine whether synthesis of a protein factor is necessary for TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced m2 receptor down-regulation, HEL 299 cells were exposed to the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). The result depicted in Fig. 5 indicates that although cycloheximide alone had no effect on m2 mRNA expression, it significantly protected against TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced m2 receptor mRNA down-regulation. This result suggests that the synthesis of at least one protein is required for M2 receptor down-regulation by TNF-α and IL-1β. We attempted to characterize the intracellular signaling pathways that may lead to receptor down-regulation. We have previously shown that PKC stimulation with the phorbol ester 4β-phorbol-13,14-dibutyrate induced a down-regulation of M2 muscarinic receptor protein and mRNA (15Rousell J. Haddad E.-B. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7213-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether this kinase participates in m2 receptor down-regulation, we attempted to block the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β with the specific protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. This compound did not antagonize the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on m2 receptor expression, thereby excluding this kinase in receptor down-regulation (Fig. 6). We also tested the possible involvement of other protein phosphorylation pathways in m2 muscarinic mRNA regulation. In HEL 299 cells IL-1β, but not TNF-α, induced a slight but significant increase in the level of intracellular cAMP (data not shown), which raises the possibility that PKA might be involved. Indeed, using the PKA inhibitor H-8, we have demonstrated a significant inhibition of TNFα- and IL-1β-induced m2 receptor down-regulation (Fig. 6). Several reports recently implicated the lipid second messenger ceramide in TNF-α and IL-1β signaling pathways (16Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 18Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis using the cell-permeable analog of ceramide, C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine). As shown in Fig. 7, C2-ceramide did not affect the steady-state levels of m2 mRNA. However, when C2-ceramide was co-incubated with either TNF-α or IL-1β for 24 h, a marked down-regulation was achieved (Fig. 7) implicating this pathway in m2 receptor down-regulation by TNF-α and IL-1β. The possibility that MAP kinases might be involved in the TNF-α and IL-1β signal transduction mechanisms was also investigated. Using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes tyrosine 204-phosphorylated MAP kinase p44MAPK and p42MAPK isoforms (ERK1 and ERK2, respectively), we showed that cell treatment with the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β stimulates the phosphorylation of both p42MAPK and p44MAPK, which was maximal around 10-30 min following cytokine exposure and resolved by 60 min (Fig. 8, A and B). A similar profile was observed when the cells were treated with ceramide or individual cytokines (data not shown). We have also confirmed the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by an in-gel phosphorylation assay using myelin basic protein as the substrate, suggesting therefore the involvement of this pathway in TNF-α and IL-1β signaling (Fig. 8C). The protein kinases that phosphorylate glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun(1-135) were also characterized by in-gel phosphorylation assays (Fig. 8D). Very little activity was detected in extracts from vehicle-treated cells. However, following cell exposure to the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β, two renaturable protein kinases with molecular masses of 46 kDa (JNK-46) and 55 kDa (JNK-55) were detected. The molecular masses of JNK-46 and −55 are presumably related to the previously described JNK-1 and −2, respectively (19Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barret T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 20Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31836-31844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The JNK-55 band was less intense than the JNK-46 band. Activation of both JNKs followed a similar time course (Fig. 8D). Unlike ERKs, JNKs activation was apparent after 5 min of stimulation and peaked at 20 min. A similar pattern of activation was also seen with individual cytokines (data not shown). The extent of JNK activation was more pronounced compared with the ERK response. TNF-α and IL-1β, along with other cytokines, are present in inflamed airways in asthma. Although the effects of these cytokines on the expression of other cytokines and adhesion molecules are well documented, comparatively little is known of the regulatory effects of these cytokines on muscarinic receptor expression. Because of the pivotal role played by M2 receptors in regulating acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerves and of the suggested alteration of their function in asthma, we have focused on delineating the interactions between cytokines and M2 receptors in an attempt to define potential endogenous modulators of M2 receptor expression. In the present report, we provide evidence that TNF-α and IL-1β synergize to induce down-regulation of muscarinic M2 receptors in HEL 299 cells by a mechanism that is dependent on de novo protein synthesis and mediated by decreased transcription of the m2 receptor gene. Furthermore, a role of PKA and ceramide pathways in this process is suggested. Our data indicate that the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β down-regulated M2 muscarinic receptor protein more slowly than could be accounted for by internalization of the receptor as a result of receptor phosphorylation. The effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on M2 muscarinic receptor protein was also demonstrated at the mRNA level. The down-regulation of m2 receptor mRNA preceded that of the receptor protein, suggesting that the decrease in the receptor protein is due to a decrease in the rate of receptor synthesis as a consequence of the decrease in the steady-state levels of its mRNA. Functional desensitization of M2 muscarinic receptors was also assessed in TNF-α- and IL-1β-treated cells. In control cells, cAMP generation with forskolin was significantly inhibited by co-stimulation with carbachol. However, this inhibitory effect of carbachol was lost in cells exposed to a combination of these two cytokines for 24 h, suggesting that M2 receptor down-regulation is accompanied by desensitization of the muscarinic response. Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was not significantly different between control and cytokine-treated cells, suggesting that the functional desensitization does not occur at the level of adenylyl cyclase activity. An interesting finding in this report was the synergistic action of TNF-α and IL-1β to induce down-regulation of M2 muscarinic receptors, which is a previously undescribed effect of these cytokines on muscarinic receptor expression. This setting may reflect the situation in vivo more closely, when both cytokines are likely to be present together in the inflamed airways. Synergism between TNF-α and IL-1β or interferon γ has been observed in several biological responses, including nitric oxide synthase induction (22Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), cytokine production such as IL-6 (23Elias J.A. Lentz V. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-8 (24Yasumoto K. Okamoto S.-I. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and adhesion molecule expression (25Horikoshi T. Ezoe K. Nakagawa H. Eguchi H. Hanada N. Hamaoka S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Barker J.N.W. Sarma V. Mitra R.S. Dixit V.M. Nickoloff B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mechanism of such synergy appears to vary according to the experimental model and may involve induction of TNF-α receptors (27Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Hass P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 28Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2441-2444PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, there was no synergy when HEL 299 cells were preincubated with TNF-α and followed by stimulation with IL-1β. This indicated that up-regulation of IL-1β receptor expression by TNF-α is not responsible for the synergy we observed. Similarly, preincubation of HEL 299 cells with IL-1β did not sensitize them to the stimulating effect of TNF-α. Furthermore, HEL 299 cells constitutively express TNF-α receptors, and the level of expression is not up-regulated by IL-1β (data not shown). It is therefore likely that the synergy observed between TNF-α and IL-1β on m2 muscarinic receptor expression involves postreceptor events. To characterize the intracellular signaling pathways leading to receptor down-regulation, we have investigated the involvement of PKA and PKC in this process. We have previously reported that PKC stimulation induces transcriptional down-regulation of M2 muscarinic receptors with a kinetic profile similar to that described here for the combination of TNF-α and IL-β (15Rousell J. Haddad E.-B. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7213-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether this kinase participates in m2 receptor down-regulation, we attempted to block the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β with the specific protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. This compound, at a concentration that was effective in inhibiting PKC-induced down-regulation of M2 muscarinic receptor protein and mRNA (15Rousell J. Haddad E.-B. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7213-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), did not antagonize the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β. We were thus unable to detect any apparent involvement of PKC in TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced m2 muscarinic receptor down-regulation. In HEL 299 cells, IL-1β but not TNF-α induced a significant increase in intracellular cAMP, in agreement with data obtained in several cell systems (29Chedid M.F. Shirakawa F. Naylor P. Mizel S.B. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4301-4306PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shirakawa F. Yamashita U. Chedid M. Mizel S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6802-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Mizel S.B. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2379-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to interfere with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway using the kinase inhibitor H-8. This inhibitor provided slight but significant protection against TNFα- and IL-1β-induced M2 receptor mRNA down-regulation, suggesting that PKA is involved, at least in part, in receptor modulation by TNF-α and IL-1β. This finding is in agreement with data showing that the PKA signal transduction pathway is important in TNF-α and IL-1β induction of IL-6 mRNA in human fibroblasts (32Zhang Y. Lin J.-X. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl., Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6802-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In view of the pleiotropic nature of TNF-α and IL-1β, it is not surprising that several alternative pathways can be activated by these cytokines. One potential phosphorylation pathway is represented by the lipid second messenger ceramide (16Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β and TNF-α rapidly increase the cellular content of ceramide produced following the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by two types of sphingomyelinases, a membrane-associated neutral and an endosomal acidic sphingomyelinase (17Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 18Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 33Pushkareva M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In several cell systems, ceramide mediates several TNF-α- or IL-1β-mediated processes, such as IL-6 (34Laulederkind S.J.F. Bielawska A. Raghow R. Hannun Y.A. Ballou L.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and cyclooxygenase-2 gene up-regulation (35Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of HEL 299 cells with N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), a cell-permeable analog of natural ceramide, did not affect the steady-state levels of m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA over the time course investigated, in an manner analogous to TNF-α and IL-1β alone. However, the combination of C2-ceramide either with TNF-α or IL-1β markedly down-regulated m2 receptor mRNA expression after 24 h of treatment to a extent comparable to that produced by the combination of the two cytokines. These results are consistent with a role for the ceramide pathway in m2 receptor down-regulation induced by the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β treatment. A further downstream signaling event known to be triggered by TNF-α and IL-1β is activation of the MAP kinase cascade, which comprises the ERKs and the JNKs (36Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3204) Google Scholar, 37Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). We investigated whether ERK1 (p44MAPK) and ERK2 (p42MAPK) isoforms could be activated by TNF-α and IL-1β in HEL 299 cells. Cell exposure to the combination of these cytokines phosphorylated and activated both the p42 and p44 MAP kinase isoforms in a manner similar to that achieved when the cells were stimulated with ceramide or individual cytokines. This result suggests that the activation of ERK may be involved in the signal transduction mechanisms triggered by TNF-α and IL-1β in HEL 299 cells, in agreement with published data (38Guy G.R. Chua S.P. Wong N.S. Ng S.B. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14343-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bird T.A. Sleath P.R. deRoos P.C. Dower S.K. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22661-22670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the finding that TNF-α and IL-1β alone or in combination also activated JNK1 and JNK2 to a greater extent to that seen with ERK isoforms suggests that the JNK pathway may be preferentially activated by cytokines. These results are in agreement with previous observations showing that the ERK module is primarily activated by mitogenic stimuli, whereas JNKs are mainly activated by ceramide, cellular stress such as UV irradiation, and cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β (19Dérijard B.

However, the absence of synergy between IL-1β and TNF-α at the level of ERK and JNK activation suggests that activation of MAP kinases is necessary but not sufficient to cause muscarinic m2 receptor down-regulation. Two mechanisms could account for TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA down-regulation: a decrease in transcription of the gene or an accelerated degradation of the mRNA, i.e. a decrease in mRNA stability. TNF-α and IL-1β had no effect on the muscarinic m2 receptor mRNA half-life measured with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, suggesting that the down-regulation of M2 muscarinic receptors is not due to a posttranscriptional modification of the m2 mRNA. Direct measurements of the transcription of the m2 gene suggest that there is a basal level of transcription of this gene, which can significantly be reduced by the combination of TNF-α and IL-1β. This result agrees with the transcriptional down-regulation of this receptor subtype with another multifunctional cytokine, transforming growth factor β1 (14Haddad E.-B. Rousell J. Mak J.C.W. Barnes P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 781-787PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that although many effects of transforming growth factor β1 (including up-regulation of extracellular matrix proteins and down-regulation of collagenase and transin/stromelysin genes) oppose those of TNF-α (43Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar), it also shares many other effects with TNF-α and IL-1β, including up-regulation of cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 and phospholipase A2 and down-regulation of β2-adrenergic receptor expression (44Jackson B.A. Goldstein R.H. Roy R. Cozzani M. Taylor L. Polgar P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 45Koto H. Mak J.C.W. Haddad E.-B. Salmon M. Xu W.B. Barnes P.J.

Physiol. 1994; 266: L187-L191PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown, using the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, that the synergism between TNF-α and IL-1β for m2 receptor mRNA down-regulation is not a primary event, since it does require intermediate expression of unknown proteins. TNF-α and IL-1β are known to induce the expression and release of several chemokines, including IL-8, in different cell types (47Kwon O.J. Au B.T. Collins P.D. Baraniuk J.N. Adcock I.M. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Immunology. 1994; 81: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have addressed the question of whether IL-8 could be part of an autocrine stimulation of HEL 299 cells to induce down-regulation by TNF-α and IL-1β. HEL 299 cells cultured with TNF-α and IL-1β for 24 h in the presence of anti-IL-8-neutralizing antibody did not provide any significant protection against m2 receptor mRNA down-regulation (data not shown). Moreover, we did not observe any synergy when cells were treated with the combination of TNF-α and IL-8 or IL-1β and IL-8 (data not shown). These results exclude any contribution of IL-8 to receptor down-regulation by TNF-α and IL-1β. The possibility, however, of the involvement of other″ secondary” cytokines in muscarinic m2 receptor down-regulation is not excluded. Alternatively, the observed synergy might also be at the level of the transcription-regulating proteins. Indeed, it has been shown that the regulation of the expression of several genes can involve cooperativity between different transcription factors (48Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 49Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter sequence of the m2 gene has not yet been characterized, so the potential role of transcription factors in regulating its expression is not yet known. In summary, we have demonstrated that TNF-α and IL-1β synergize to induce down-regulation of M2 muscarinic receptor protein and mRNA, which was associated with functional desensitization of the receptor protein. The M2 receptor mRNA down-regulation appeared to be mediated through a reduction in the rate of m2 receptor gene transcription, which may be dependent on the transcription and translation of unknown protein factor(s). Moreover, a role of PKA and ceramide pathways in M2 receptor regulation is suggested. Furthermore, our demonstration of the reduced gene transcription and function of M2 muscarinic receptors provides a mechanistic explanation of previous reports indicating altered function of these receptors in asthma. Our results also suggest that the expression of this receptor subtype may be under the control of a cytokine network. We thank Drs. Peter Sugden and Albert J.

Previously, based upon metal analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of purified recombinant enzyme, it has been suggested that CPO contains and requires copper for activity (Kohno, H., Furukawa, T., Tokunaga, R., Taketani, S., and Yoshinaga, T. (1996) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1292, 156-162). To examine this putative metal site in human CPO, the cDNA encoding human CPO was engineered into an expression vector with a His6 tag at its amino terminus, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity using nickel-nitroliotriacetic acid resin. Activity of the purified protein was monitored by a coupled fluorometric assay that employed purified protoporphyrinogen oxidase to convert protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin, thereby allowing the direct fluorescent determination of protoporphyrin IX produced. CPO has an apparent Km of 0.6 μM and an apparent Kcat of 16 min−1 with coproporphyrinogen III as substrate. Metal analysis of the enzyme was carried out via ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy metal analysis, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The data presented demonstrate that human CPO contains no metal center, that it is not stimulated in vitro by iron or copper, and that addition of these metals to cultures expressing the protein has no effect.

https://openalex.org/W2024689808,"On the basis of cDNA cloning, primer extension, and transfection experiments, we identified a novel 5′ exon of the human activin βA subunit gene, and found its enhancer and promoter regions as well as multiple transcription start sites. A series of deletion and mutation analyses of the enhancer sequences defined the 45-base pair core region (DR-1 core) containing two short elements with similarity to AP-1 (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element; TRE) and CREB/ATF (cyclic AMP response element; CRE) binding sites, both of which were necessary for full enhancer activity.

Inhibins were initially described as an inhibitory activity of follicle-stimulating hormone production, and for the most part they act in opposition to the activities of activins (15Ying S.-Y. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Although functionally antagonistic, both are structurally related, i.e. they are disulfide-bonded dimeric peptides sharing a common β-subunit. Inhibin was later shown to be composed of a specific α-subunit complexed with one of the two closely related β-subunits, whereas activin was found to be formed by a homo- or heterodimer of the two β-subunits. These three subunits are encoded by three separate genes, and the S1 nuclease analysis in adult rat tissues has shown that the expression of mRNAs encoding these subunits (α, βA, and βB) varies by severalfold in a tissue-specific manner (16Meunier H. Rivier C. Evans R.M. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Thus, differential subunit association results in the formation of dimers with opposing biological activities in a manner dependent on their sites of production. Since expression of the activin and inhibin subunit genes must each be precisely regulated, the identification of cis-acting elements that control the activin gene expression and the elucidation of how these elements are involved in the response to extracellular stimuli are of key importance. Recently, we reported that expression of the human activin βA gene is stimulated by the addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate8-Br-cAMP8-bromo-cyclic AMPbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTKthymidine kinaseAP-1(s)AP-1 single siteAP-1(w)AP-1 double site.

However, the DNA sequences that regulate expression of the gene have not been defined. Although several groups including ours have reported the cloning and sequence of the coding portion of the human activin βA gene (20Mason A.J. Schwall R. Renz M. Rhee L.M. Nikolics K. Seeburg P.

Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (CCL-121, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Flow Laboratories). Total RNA was extracted from HT1080 cells (that were treated with TPA at 100 ng/ml for 4 h) by using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. cDNA was synthesized using random primers (6-mer; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), followed by ligation to adapters containing EcoRI and NotI sites, digested with EcoRI, and finally ligated with EcoRI-digested, dephosphorylated λZAPII DNA (Stratagene). Screening of this library (7.5 × 104 plaques) with 32P-labeled human activin βA subunit probe (221-bp DraI fragment in Fig. 1A; bases 810-1824) (22Tanimoto K. Handa S. Ueno N. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) yielded five positive plaques. All five were purified, and the nucleotide sequence of their 5′-ends was determined. All of the fragments used in the constructions were excised from the genomic clone (22Tanimoto K. Handa S. Ueno N. Murakami K. Fukamizu A.

This fragment and a 972-bp BglII-EcoT14I fragment (bases 1-972) were inserted in the BglII/HindIII sites of pUCSV0CAT (23Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Seo M.S. Handa S.-i. Sagara M. Takahashi S.

To make phβACAT35, a 3.5-kb BamHI fragment (bases ~847) was blunt-ended by the fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment (TaKaRa), ligated with HindIII linker, digested with HindIII, and inserted in the HindIII site of pUC0CAT (24Fukamizu A.

For construction of 5′-deletion mutants of the activin 5′-upstream region, the 3.5-kb BamHI fragment (the same as that used for construction of phβACAT35) was inserted in the BamHI site of pBluescriptII KS(+) (Stratagene) in the reverse orientation. This plasmid was linearized with XbaI and PstI restriction enzymes, partially digested with exonuclease BAL31 (TaKaRa) for various lengths of time, treated with Klenow fragment to form blunt ends, and ligated in the presence of BglII linker. DNAs were transferred into Escherichia coli HB101. After determination of the 5′-deleted ends by DNA sequencing, the fragments were excised with BglII (sites were provided by linker sequence and the activin gene at position 1 (22Tanimoto K. Handa S. Ueno N. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). The deleted fragments were inserted in the BglII site, located upstream of the 1.9-kb BglII-HindIII fragment, of phβACAT19 to make phβACAT30, −29, −28, −26, and −24. The putative enhancer (DR-1; −275 to −89, Fig. 1A) and promoter (PR-2; −88 to +103) elements were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using phβACAT30 as a template. Oligonucleotides used to produce these fragments were synthesized on a MilliGen/Bioresearch Cyclone™ Plus oligonucleotide synthesizer. Each primer contains either BglII (in sense primers) or BamHI (in antisense primers) recognition sites. The positions of the synthetic oligonucleotides were as follows: 1S (−275/−257), 1A (−89/−106), 2S (−91/−76), 2A (+104/+86). The truncated or mutated DR-1 fragments were also synthesized by PCR.

The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were MΔT, MΔC, and MΔi for ΔT, ΔC, and Δi mutants, respectively. The DR-1 fragment and its derivatives, cut with BglII and BamHI, were inserted in the BglII site of the 5′-deletion construct (Fig. 5A) or p0/tk-CAT (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6) (17Tanimoto K.

To construct pDR1(+)ΔT/PR2(+)/CAT and pDR1(+)ΔC/PR2(+)/CAT, site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension method by using PCR. The positions of the upper strand sequences of mutagenic primers were as follows: M2ΔT (−162/−140), M2ΔC (−108/−129) (Fig. 1A). The PCR products, made with above primers combined with 1S and 2A, and pDR1(+)/PR2(+)/CAT as a PCR template, were excised with BglII and BamHI, gel-purified, and inserted into the BglII site of p0/tk-CAT.

Twenty-four hours prior to DNA transfection, HT1080 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm diameter dish in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Three hours before transfection, the dishes received fresh medium. Cells were transfected with the different constructs by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, exposed to the precipitate for 9 h, and kept in fresh medium (supplemented with drugs, if necessary) for 24 h. Cells were collected, and cell extracts were prepared by freezing and thawing and analyzed for CAT activity. HT1080 cells were co-transfected with a 5:1:1 molar ratio of the activin 5′-flanking region-CAT chimeric constructs, pSV2neo (26Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl.

Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar), cell extracts (20-50 μg for transient transfection and 20 μg for stable transfection assay) were incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h in 140 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 0.68 μCi/ml [14C]chloramphenicol (DuPont), and 580 μM acetyl coenzyme A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). [14C]Chloramphenicol and its acetylated products were separated by TLC. The TLC plate was exposed to RX film (Fuji). The conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form was measured using a FUJIX BIO-imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji). Primer extension experiments were performed by the method of Bodner and Karin (29Bodner M. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 50: 267-275Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (209) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Two oligonucleotide primers complementary to regions within exons 1 and 2 of the human activin βA gene were synthesized (PR3PX and HBA-6 in Fig. 1A, respectively). These primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo) and were purified on Sephadex G-50 chromatography (Pharmacia). The labeled primers (5 × 105 cpm) were mixed with 20 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from HT1080 cells or yeast tRNA (as a control) and precipitated with ethanol. The dried pellet was directly dissolved in 10 μl of hybridization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M KCl), and hybridization was carried out at 55°C for 60 min. After the addition of 24 μl of a reaction mix (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 100 μg/ml actinomycin D, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 10 units of Rouse-associated virus (RAV-2) reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa)), extension was performed at 37°C for 45 min. Free nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography (Pharmacia) followed by ethanol precipitation. The extended products were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8 M Urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel or on a standard sequence gel with appropriate molecular weight markers. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification of the protocol of Lee et al. (30Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration was 8-13 mg/ml. Probes were synthesized by PCR, purified by Ultrafree C3 filter (Millipore), and phosphorylated at both ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (5-10 μg) were preincubated for 20 min at 4°C in an 18-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) in the presence or absence of a 50-200-fold molar excess of a specific double-stranded competitor DNA. 0.32 ng (10,000 cpm) of a radiolabeled DNA probe were added and the incubation continued for 30 min at 4°C. The incubation mixture was loaded on a 3.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (1 × TBE: 89 mM Tris-HCl, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA) buffer, and electrophoresed at 4°C with a field strength of 10 V/cm with buffer circulation. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C overnight. For competition experiments, competitor DNA was incubated in the mixture prior to the addition of nuclear extract. Oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding sequences for AP-1(s) and CREB/ATF (31Verri A. Mazzarello P. Biamonti G. Silvio S. Focher F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5775-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer. The AP-1(w) fragment was simply made by ligating the AP-1(s) fragment on the plasmid vector. For supershift assays, 1-2 μg of antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included in the reaction mixture. The complete genomic structure (including a description of the number and organization of exons and introns) of the activin βA subunit gene has not been reported. Although more extended sequences lying 5′ to the translated region of the βA gene have been reported for the mouse (32Albano R.M. Groome N. Smith J.C. Development. 1993; 117: 711-723PubMed Google Scholar), rat (33Woodruff T.K. Meunier H. Jones P.B. Hsueh A.J. Mayo K.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and human (34Mason A.J. Niall H.D. Seeburg P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) cDNAs, the corresponding genomic sequences have not been defined. We previously cloned the gene for the human activin βA subunit and determined the nucleotide sequence extending from 1857 bp 5′ to the translation start codon (22Tanimoto K. Handa S. Ueno N. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, a computer-assisted homology search did not identify significant identities between either rodent 5′-untranslated region and this region of the human genomic sequences (not shown). We therefore considered the possibility that a previously unidentified 5′ exon might exist and that this hypothetical exon lay even further upstream of the activin βA-coding sequence. To test this hypothesis, we cloned activin βA cDNAs from a cDNA library of TPA-treated HT1080 cells, since we had previously found that TPA markedly induced the accumulation of mRNA encoding activin βA (17Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Tanimoto K. Tamura K. Ueno N. Usuki S. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several cDNA clones for human activin A were isolated that extended 5′ to the start of translation, and all of these clones contained the same untranslated sequences, although of varying length. Comparison of these untranslated sequences with our previously reported genomic sequences (22Tanimoto K. Handa S. Ueno N. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) defined the position of the first exon as lying beyond 145 bp upstream from the first nucleotide of the ATG initiation codon, since the cDNA sequences began to diverge from the genomic sequences at this point. The results presented here, in comparison with the sequences of the cDNA and genomic clones (22Tanimoto K. Handa S. Ueno N. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for the activin βA subunit, allowed us to derive the complete structure of this gene (Fig. 1B). The gene consists of three exons interrupted by two introns, apparently differing from the two-exon structure reported for the human α (21Stewart A.G. Milborrow H.M. Ring J.M. Crowther C.E. Forage R.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and βB subunit (35Mason A.J. Berkemeier L.M. Schmelzer C.H. Schwall R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) genes. The first exon of the activin βA gene contains the 5′-noncoding region, while exon 2 includes both 143 bp of noncoding and the initiation of coding sequences. Exon 3 contains the sequences encoding the mature, post-translationally processed βA subunit protein and the entire 3′-noncoding region, including several polyadenylation signals (17Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Intron 1 contains typical 5′-donor (gt(a/g)) and 3′-acceptor (cag) splice consensus sequences (Fig. 1A) (36Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar). To determine the transcription start site of the human activin A gene, we conducted primer extension analysis using two different primers, complimentary to sequences within exon 1 or 2 (Fig. 2A), and these yielded two major and several minor extension products that were in good agreement with each other (lanes 4 and 7 in Fig. 2B) and with the RNase protection assays (data not shown). No extension product was formed when yeast tRNA (lane 5) or RNA from noninduced HT1080 cells (lanes 3 and 6) were used. When the size of the products (Fig. 2B, lane 4) was compared with sequence ladders primed using the same primer on a high resolution sequence gel, multiple transcription start sites were detected (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Comparing the data obtained by both primer extension and RNase protection analyses, the band having the strongest intensity (an A located 143 bases 5′ to the initiation codon) was assigned position +1 (Figs. 1A and 2C). We determined the sequences of the putative 5′-flanking regions and found several nucleotide consensus motifs that are involved in transcriptional regulation of many genes (Fig. 1A). Possible TATA boxes (TATAAA and TACAAA) were found 29 and 47 bp, respectively, upstream of the major transcription start sites determined by primer extension analysis, a typical promoter feature of many eukaryotic genes. In addition, CCAAT boxes, another element often found in RNA polymerase II-governed promoters, are present at positions −270, −103, and −60. GATA and CACCC box binding sites, which are common structural and functional features of the promoters of many genes, are also present (37Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Two putative AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer or c-Jun·c-Fos heterodimer) binding sites (TPA response element; TRE) (T1 site, −201 to −195; T2 site, −153 to −147) (38Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B.

A major goal of molecular biology is to describe biological phenomena in terms of interaction between molecules. Recently, thanks to progress in structural biology, several quaternary structures of biomolecular complexes have been clarified, and now a number of biological events can be described precisely at the atomic level. Among them, DNA-repressor (1Harrison S.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), enzyme-inhibitor (2Bode W. Huber R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 45-52Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) have been most extensively investigated at the atomic level. Antigen-antibody interactions have been studied in detail not only from an immunological but also a biochemical viewpoint as a model of protein-ligand interaction. The most striking feature of antigen-antibody interactions is the creation of strict specificity and high affinity of antibodies for their antigens. It is known that unique conformations and special locations on the surfaces of proteinaceous antigens are recognized by antibodies (6Benjamin D.C. Berzofsky J.A. East I.G. Gurd F.R.N. Hannum C. Leach S.J. Margoliash E. Michael J.G. Miller A. Prager E.M. Reichlin M. Sercarz E.E. Smith-Gill S.J. Todd P.E. Wilson A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 2: 67-101Crossref Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Among the amino acids located on protein surfaces, it is believed that antibodies recognize charged residues by forming (1Harrison S.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) hydrogen bonds and (2Bode W. Huber R. Curr. Opin. Struct.

This system is advantageous for studying the mechanism of antigen-antibody interaction because the structure of the antigen-antibody complex has already been clarified by x-ray crystallographic analysis (10Padlan E.A.

The side chain of Lys97 in HEL interacts with the contact region of HyHEL10 and is recognized by HAsp32, HTyr33, and HTrp95. HAsp32 contributes to the interaction by formation of a salt bridge with Lys97 of HEL (10Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In this study, for elucidation of the role of the salt bridge in the antigen-antibody interaction, HAsp32 of the Fv fragment was replaced with Ala (HD32A), which deleted a carboxyl group; Glu (HD32E), which added a methylene group; or Asn (HD32N), which added an amino group. The interactions among antigen, HEL, and the engineered HyHEL10 Fvs were examined using the inhibition of HEL enzymatic activity and isothermal titration calorimetry. The contribution of the salt bridge to the interaction will be discussed thermodynamically here. All enzymes used for genetic engineering were purchased from Toyobo, Takara Shuzo, or Boehringer Mannheim. Hen egg white lysozyme was from Seikagaku Kogyo, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Micrococcus lysodeikticus for measuring the enzymatic activity of HEL was obtained from Sigma. HEL-Sepharose was prepared from CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia). Oligonucleotide DNA primers were synthesized by a 381-Å DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). A mutagenesis kit was obtained from Bio-Rad (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were of biochemical research grade. The method used for site-directed mutagenesis was followed as described previously (27Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Correctness of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a Bca-BEST sequencing kit (Takara). Secretory expression in E. coli and the affinity chromatography purification procedures using HEL-Sepharose were performed as described previously (26Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene. 1993; 129: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Measurements of CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant HyHEL10 Fv fragments (25 μM) were carried out using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Far- and near-UV CD spectra were measured using a cell with 1- and 10-mm optical path lengths, respectively, at pH 7.2 and 25°C. Measurement of inhibition of HEL enzymatic activity was done as described previously (28Tsumoto K. Ueda Y. Maenaka K. Watanabe K. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28777-28782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental condition was described in the legend to Fig. 1. Thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between HEL and the mutant Fv fragments were determined by microtitration calorimetry using an OMEGA titration microcalorimeter (30Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar) from MicroCal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). The experimental conditions were the same as those reported previously (27Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); The wild-type HEL at a concentration of 5 μM in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 200 mM NaCl in a calorimeter cell was titrated with a 125 μM solution of the mutant Fv fragments in the same buffer at five different temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40°C). The ligand solution was injected 16 times in portions of 7 μl during 15 s. Thermogram data were analyzed using a computer program (Origin) supplied by MicroCal, Inc. (30Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). The concentration of HEL was estimated using A2801% = 26.5 (31Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Enzymes. 1972; 7: 665-868Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar) and that of mutant HyHEL10 Fv fragments using A2801% = 20.6 (26Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene. 1993; 129: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All of the mutants were obtainable in the E. coli secretory expression system and were purified by affinity chromatography using HEL-Sepharose. The yield was about 10 mg/liter of culture. No difference in far- and near-UV CD spectra between wild-type and mutant Fv fragments was observed (data not shown), indicating that the overall structure of mutant Fv fragments is identical with that of the wild type. As described previously (28Tsumoto K. Ueda Y. Maenaka K. Watanabe K. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28777-28782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the HyHEL10 Fv fragment has complete inhibitory activity toward its antigen, HEL, in a Fv:HEL molar ratio of 1:1. Although the association constant of the interaction is high, a sigmoidal curve was observed (Fig. 1). This might be due to the dilution of Fv-HEL solution and the competition with the substrate in the measurements of HEL enzymatic activity. The inhibitory activities of the HAsp32-mutated Fv fragments were measured (Fig. 1). The inhibition profile indicated that the inhibitory activities for the D32N mutant and D32E mutant Fv fragments were slightly decreased and that for the D32A mutant Fv was significantly decreased, indicating that all mutations lowered the association. To estimate the thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between the Asp32 mutant HyHEL10 Fv fragments and HEL, we performed titration calorimetry of the association between the HAsp32 mutant Fv fragments and HEL (Fig. 2). The enthalpy change (ΔH) and binding constant (K) on antigen-antibody interaction were directly obtainable from the experimental titration curve shown in Fig. 2 (30Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar), and the heat capacity change (ΔCp) of the interaction was estimated from the temperature dependence of the enthalpy change. The Gibbs energy change (ΔG = −RT ln K) of binding was calculated from the binding constant, and the entropy change (TΔS = −ΔG +ΔH) on the association could also be estimated. Thermodynamic parameters at 30°C calculated from the titration curves are represented in Table I, and the temperature dependence of the enthalpy and entropy change is shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, respectively.Table I.Thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between HAsp32 mutant HyHEL10 Fv and HEL at 30° C, pH 7.2aExperimental conditions are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Uncertainties were the average of at least two experiments ± S.D. n, stoichiometry; K, binding constant; ΔG, ΔH, TΔS, and ΔCp, change in Gibbs energy, binding enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity, respectively.

Symbols used are the same as those in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On comparison of all of the mutant Fv fragments with the wild-type Fv fragment, the negative values of the enthalpy change of the interaction between each mutant Fv fragment and HEL were increased by 17-24 kJ mol−1 at 30°C. The binding constants were decreased only slightly in all mutants, resulting in a small change in Gibbs energy. The increases in the negative enthalpy change (−ΔΔH) for the mutant Fv fragments were completely compensated by the increase in negative entropy change (−TΔΔS), which was superior to −ΔΔH, suggesting that Asp32 contributed to the interaction by suppressing the decrease in entropy change (i.e. the entropy loss due to binding). From the temperature dependence of the enthalpy change shown in Fig. 3, the heat capacity change was estimated to be ~−2.2 kJ mol−1 K−1 for all the mutant Fvs, which was ~0.8 kJ mol−1 K−1 larger in negative value than that of the wild type (Table I). We discuss the result reported here on the supposition that the effect of any change of protonation upon complex formation by mutation is completely compensated by the deprotonation of buffer. Although the structure of free Fv fragment has not been determined, far- and near-UV CD spectra of free mutant Fv fragments are identical with that of wild-type Fv (data not shown), indicating that no difference in overall structure between wild-type Fv and mutants exists. This suggests that the difference in thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between mutant Fv and HEL from those of wild-type Fv does not originate from the reconstruction of the partly unfolded structure of the mutant protein in the free state. The data reported here indicated that deletion of the salt bridge in the HyHEL10-HEL interaction by mutation led to increased changes in both negative enthalpy and negative entropy. The negative Gibbs energy was slightly decreased in the same direction as the previously reported mutants (27Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest that although the interaction between HAsp32 mutant Fv and HEL is enthalpically more favorable than that for the wild-type Fv fragment, the entropic loss due to binding is also increased, indicating that deletion of the salt bridge is enthalpically favorable and entropically unfavorable. This means that the thermodynamic role of salt bridge formation is to decrease the entropic loss due to binding. Increased changes in both negative enthalpy and negative entropy by mutagenesis of the antigen-binding site of an antibody have also been observed in the mutant antibody-antigen Salmonella serogroup B O-polysaccharide interaction (20Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubic G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Sigurskjold B.W. Sinnott B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Substitution of HHis101, which is exposed to solvent and forms a hydrogen bond with O-4 of mannose, with Gly or Asp produces a dramatic increase of negative enthalpy change in the mutant antibody-antigen interaction. However, the unfavorable entropy change outweighs the enthalpic advantage, resulting in a 10-fold lower binding constant. In the case of the interaction between Y82F mutant FK506-binding protein (FKBP-12) and its ligand (FK506), large increases in negative enthalpy (−ΔΔH) and negative entropy (−TΔΔS) change have been observed in comparison with the wild-type FKBP-12 ligand interaction (32Connelly P.R. Aldape R.A. Bruzzese F.J. Chambers S.P. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Itoh S. Livingston D.J. Navia M.A. Thomson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1964-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The binding constant of the interaction between Y82F mutant FKBP-12 and its ligand is slightly decreased in comparison with the wild type. A crystallographic study of the complex formed between the wild-type FKBP-12 and its ligands has indicated that two water molecules are located in the hydroxyl group of Tyr82 in unliganded FKBP-12 and that on ligand binding these water molecules are lost and the hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand. From these experimental data, it has been suggested that the formation of a hydrogen bond with the ligands results in a large decrease of negative entropy change due to removal of the water molecules (32Connelly P.R. Aldape R.A. Bruzzese F.J. Chambers S.P. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Itoh S. Livingston D.J. Navia M.A. Thomson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1964-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A structural study of a free HEL has suggested that Lys97 is exposed and hydrated (33Maenaka K. Matsusima M. Song H. Sunada F. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the structure of a free HyHEL10 Fv fragment has not yet been determined, HAsp32 is thought from calculation to be exposed and hydrated (34Smith-Gill S.J. Mainhart C. Lavoie T.B. Feldman R.J. Drohan W. Brooks B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Novotny J. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because no water molecule is observed in the HyHEL10-HEL complex (10Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), the solvent molecules must be removed on binding of HEL. The increase in entropy change might originate mainly from the removal of solvent molecules on formation of the HyHEL10-HEL complex, because desolvation is accompanied by a considerable entropy advantage (36Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 660-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The present data indicate that a significant increase in negative enthalpy change is observed in the interactions between the three mutants and HEL. Substitution of the Asp at site 32 of VH with Glu resulted in a large increase in negative enthalpy and entropy, although both the enthalpy and entropy changes produced by dehydration of Asp or Asn are almost the same (37Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 639-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the entropic change of dehydration of the side chain of Ala is quite different from that of Asn (37Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 639-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the difference in the negative entropy changes of the interactions between HD32A Fv and HD32N Fv was only subtle (1 kJ mol−1 K−1 at 30°C; Table I). These results suggest that the changes in thermodynamic parameters produced by mutation cannot be understood merely by the changes in dehydration occurring upon binding. Why, then, is negative entropy change increased by mutation? According to the considerations of Murphy et al. (38Murphy K.P. Freire E. Paterson Y. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the total ΔS of binding is given asΔS=ΔSsolv +ΔSconf +ΔScratt (Eq. 1) where ΔSsolv is the change in entropy derived from solvent release upon binding, ΔSconf is the change in entropy resulting from conformational changes due to formation of the antigen-antibody complex, and ΔScrat is the cratic entropy change. ΔSsolv is given byΔSвolv =ΔCplnT/Ts(Eq. 2) (Ts = 386 K; Ts is the temperature at which the desolvation entropy change is considered to be zero), and ΔScrat can be considered a constant value (−0.033 kJ mol−1 K−1 (39Murphy K.P. Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Science. 1990; 247: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 40Baldwin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8069-8072Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). From their experimental data, they have suggested that the overall conformational entropy loss is, to a large extent, compensated by the desolvation entropy. On the basis of this viewpoint, the present data can be analyzed as follows. In the interaction between HEL and the wild-type HyHEL10 Fv fragment, ΔCp was estimated to be −1.42 kJ mol−1 K−1(Table I); and from Equation 2, ΔSsolv is calculated to be 0.36 kJ mol−1 K−1. From the present experimental data, the total entropy change is −0.14 kJ mol−1 K−1, and then ΔSconf is estimated to be −0.45 kJ−1 K−1 from Equation 1. On the other hand, as shown in Table II, in the interaction between HEL and each mutant HyHEL10 Fv fragment, ΔSsolv is estimated to be 0.54~0.57 kJ mol−1 K−1, which is 0.18~0.21 kJ mol−1 K−1 larger than that of wild-type Fv fragment. This indicates that the entropic advantage gained by desolvation is enhanced by the mutations. However, the total entropy change is about −0.22 kJ mol−1 K−1; thus, ΔSconf is calculated to be −0.72~-0.75 kJ mol−1 K−1, which is about 0.27~0.29 kJ mol−1 K−1 smaller than that of wild-type Fv fragment, indicating that the negative entropy change produced by the conformational change is significantly increased. This suggests that conformational changes are increased by the mutation and that the entropy loss due to the enhanced conformational changes is not completely compensated by the increased desolvation entropy change. Thus, the extra unfavorable ΔSconf (negative value) produces a decrease in affinity.Table II.Entropy change of the interaction between HEL and mutant HyHEL10 Fv fragments at 30° CaCalculations were done according to the method of Murphy et al.

Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) proposed the local folding coupling-specific ligand binding. According to their proposal, total entropy change can be described asΔS=ΔSHE+ΔSRT+ΔSolder (Eq. 3) where ΔSHE is the entropy change from hydrophobic interaction, and ΔSRT is that from rotational and translational change. Where ΔS = 0 at a particular temperature (Ts)0=ΔSHETs+ΔSRT+ΔSothors (Eq. 4) is obtained. ΔSHE (Ts) is related to the heat capacity change, and ΔSRT is considered to be constant (50 cal mol−1 K−1) (41Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). If the entropy change due to conformational changes is considered to be equal for each residue, the entropy change is calculated to be 5.6 cal mol−1 K−1, and thus division of ΔSothers by −5.6 yields the number of residues involved in the conformational changes:R=ΔScturr /−5.6(Eq. 5) We have found that in the HyHEL10-HEL interaction, the folding in the antibody HyHEL10 is induced by binding with HEL (26Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene. 1993; 129: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, the numbers of residues (R) involved in the folding induced by the association between the mutant Fv fragments and HEL were estimated according to the above proposal (Table III). The results indicated that R values were increased by substitution with Ala, Asn, or Glu at position 32 of VH, suggesting that local conformational changes for the interaction between mutant Fv and HEL are increased by the mutation if the mutant structures of VH are not affected by the substitutions. Thus, it can be concluded that a large proportion of the increased negative entropy change induced by mutation arises from increased structural change, suggesting that the salt bridge suppresses excess local conformational change upon binding.Table III.Entropic contributions to the conformational changes on binding of HAsp32 mutant HyHEL10 Fv with HEL and the number of residues participating in the changesMutantsTsaTemperature where entropic contribution to the interaction is zero.

The hydroxyl groups of the Tyr residues at sites 33, 50, and 58 form hydrogen bonds with the antigen, HEL. The changes in the thermodynamic parameters induced by removal of a hydroxyl group from each of the Tyr residues at positions 33 and 50 in HyHEL10 VH are as follows; 1) the negative values of both the enthalpy and entropy change are decreased by substitution; 2) the R number is decreased. These data indicate that hydrogen bonds created by complementary association of the antibody with the antigen are one of the major contributors to the gain in binding enthalpy. However, the data reported here indicate that the salt bridge makes a different thermodynamic contribution to the interaction."

These results indicate that GST 9.5 of forestomach is different among mammalian alpha class GSTs because (+)-anti-BPDE has been shown to be a poor substrate for alpha class rat or human GST isoenzymes.

In the presence of GSH, both rat liver cytosol and purified cytosolic rat liver GST isoenzymes reduce the binding of anti-BPDE to nuclear DNA (19Hesse S. Jernström B. Martinez M. Guenthner T.

GSTs belong to a superfamily of multifunctional isoenzymes that contribute to the detoxification processes through several different mechanisms, including (a) catalytic inactivation of a wide variety of xenobiotics through conjugation with GSH; (b) chemical removal of certain xenobiotics through non-catalytic binding; and (c) reduction of lipid- and DNA hydroperoxides through expression of GSH peroxidase II activity (20Mannervik B.

The cytosolic GST activity in mammalian tissues is expressed by multiple isoenzymes, which arise from binary combinations of identical or non-identical subunits (20Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat.

A species-independent classification of the cytosolic GST isoenzymes into four major classes, alpha, mu, pi, and theta, has been suggested on the basis of their structural, immunological, and functional properties (24Mannervik B.

Tissue-specific expression of GST isoenzymes/subunits is another interesting feature of this enzyme system (20Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GST isoenzymes belonging to different classes have been shown to exhibit overlapping yet distinct substrate specificities (20Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1985; 57: 357-417PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Specificities of human and rat GST isoenzymes in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE has been studied previously (14Jernström B. Martinez M. Meyer D.J. Ketterer B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernström B.

These studies have shown that while (+)-anti-BPDE is a poor substrate for alpha class rat and human GSTs, isoenzymes belonging to the pi class are highly efficient in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE (14Jernström B. Martinez M. Meyer D.J. Ketterer B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernström B.

In this communication, we report that an alpha class GST isoenzyme of the forestomach of female A/J mouse (designated as GST 9.5) is exceptionally efficient in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE. In fact, catalytic efficiency of GST 9.5 in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE is severalfold higher as compared with the pi class human GST isoenzyme. The significance of these findings in relation to cancer prevention is discussed. Female A/J mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The use of mice for the studies presented in this paper was approved by the Mercy Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee. Reduced glutathione (GSH), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), and epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B were purchased from Sigma. Reagents for chromatofocusing were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of anti-BPDE were procured from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository (Chemsyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa, KS). All other reagents were the same as described previously. 2Hu, X., Benson, P. J., Srivastava, S. K., Mack, L. M., Xia, H., Gupta, V., Zaren, H. A., and Singh, S. V. (1996) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 336, in press. GST isoenzymes of the liver and forestomach of female A/J mouse were purified by a protocol involving GSH-linked to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B affinity chromatography followed by chromatofocusing. GSH affinity chromatography was performed by the method of Simons and Vander Jagt (27Simons P.C. Vander Jagt D.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Details of GSH affinity chromatography and chromatofocusing have been described by us previously.2 During purification of the isoenzymes, the GST activity toward CDNB was monitored according to the method of Habig et al. (28Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). The homogeneity and classification of GST isoenzymes used for kinetic studies were ascertained by reverse-phase HPLC and Western blot analysis, respectively, as described by us previously.2 A reverse-phase HPLC method was employed to study GST-catalyzed conjugation of GSH with anti-BPDE. The quantitation of conjugate was performed by generating standard curves of GSH conjugates of (+)- and (-)-anti-BPDE. Briefly, GSH conjugates of (+)- and (−)-anti-BPDE of known specific radioactivity were prepared by reacting 33 nmol (+)- or (−)-anti-BPDE with 240 nmol of [3H]GSH (specific activity, 49.6 μCi/μmol) for 12 h at room temperature in tubes covered with aluminum foil. The unreacted anti-BPDE was removed by extracting three times with ethyl acetate saturated with 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2.5 mM KCl and 0.5 mM EDTA (TKE buffer). The unreacted GSH from the conjugate was separated by a solid-phase extraction procedure using an Extract-Clean C18 cartridge (Alltech, Deerfield, IL). Thin layer chromatography (Whatman LK6F silica gel plates 250 μm) followed by visualization of ninhydrin-positive spots were utilized to ascertain separation of anti-BPDE-GSH conjugates from unreacted GSH. The mobile phase for thin layer chromatography consisted of isopropyl alcohol:isobutanol:acetic acid:water (4:3:1:2). The Rf values for GSH and GSH conjugate of anti-BPDE were about 0.026 and 0.34, respectively. To generate standard curves, known amounts of (+)- and (−)-anti-BPDE-[3H]GSH conjugates (3.3-203 pmol and 9.9-119 pmol, respectively) were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC and monitored at 247 nm. Fractions corresponding to the anti-BPDE-GSH conjugates were pooled for scintillation counting. Correlation coefficients for standard curves of GSH conjugates of (+)- and (−)-anti-BPDE were 0.999 and 0.997, respectively. A Waters C18 reverse-phase column was used for the separation of GSH conjugates of (+)- or (−)-anti-BPDE. The column was pre-equilibrated with 78% solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 22% solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The GSH conjugates of anti-BPDE were eluted with 22% of solvent B in 0-3 min followed by a 22-24.5% gradient of solvent B in 3-8 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Under these conditions, the GSH conjugates of (+)- and (−)-anti-BPDE eluted at retention times of about 5.5 and 6.3 min, respectively. Representative HPLC profiles of GSH conjugates of (+)- and (−)-anti-BPDE are illustrated in Fig. 1. The purified GST isoenzymes were dialyzed against TKE buffer and stored at −20°C until used. GST activity toward CDNB was determined immediately before enzyme activity determination toward anti-BPDE. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 0.1 ml contained TKE buffer, 2 mM GSH, desired concentration of the (+)- or (−)-anti-BPDE, and appropriate amount of the GST isoenzyme protein. GST-catalyzed conjugation of GSH with anti-BPDE was determined as a function of varying enzyme protein concentration for each isoenzyme to optimize incubation conditions. For (+)-anti-BPDE, the GST isoenzymes were used at the following concentrations: alpha class hepatic mGSTA3-3, 200 μg/ml; pi class hepatic and forestomach mGSTP1-1, 14 μg/ml; mu class hepatic mGSTM1-1, 62 μg/ml; alpha class hepatic mGSTA4-4, 130 μg/ml, and alpha class forestomach GST 9.5, 14 μg/ml. We did not assign a name to forestomach GST 9.5, according to the nomenclature recently recommended by Hayes and Pulford (23Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar), due to lack of information on the structures of its subunits. For (−)-anti-BPDE, the concentrations of GST isoenzymes were the same as described above except for mGSTP1-1 which was used at a concentration of 280 μg/ml. The reaction was initiated by adding anti-BPDE, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 s at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by rapid mixing with 0.1 ml of cold acetone, and the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The GSH conjugates of anti-BPDE in the aqueous phase were quantitated by reverse-phase HPLC.2 A control without the enzyme protein was also included to account for non-enzymatic conjugation of GSH with anti-BPDE. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the GSH affinity purified GST preparations from the liver of female A/J mouse can be resolved into seven isoenzymes, which arise from different homo- or heterodimeric combinations of at least seven structurally distinct subunits.2 In liver, approximately 94% of the total GST activity is accounted for by four isoenzymes with pI values of 9.3 (alpha class mGSTA3-3), 8.8 (pi class mGSTP1-1), 8.6 (mu class mGSTM1-1), and 5.9 (alpha class mGSTA4-4).2 While constitutive expression of mGSTA3-3 is very low in the forestomach of female A/J mouse, mGSTP1-1, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4 of the liver and forestomach appear to be identical by the criteria of immunoreactivities with isoenzyme-specific antibodies, specific activities toward (+)- and (−)-anti-BPDE, N-terminal region amino acid sequence, and/or elution profile on reverse-phase HPLC.2 An additional alpha class heterodimeric GST isoenzyme with pI of 9.5 (designated as GST 9.5) is expressed in the forestomach, which was not detected in the liver.2 Similar to liver enzymes, GST 9.5, mGSTP1-1, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4 account for more than 95% of total GST activity in the forestomach of female A/J mouse. We, therefore, selected hepatic mGSTA3-3, mGSTP1-1, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4 and forestomach GST 9.5 to investigate the kinetics of the GST-catalyzed conjugation of GSH with anti-BPDE. The kinetic constants for murine GST isoenzymes in catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE are summarized in Table I. When concentration of (+)-anti-BPDE was varied (5-120 μM) at a fixed GSH concentration (2 mM), linear Lineweaver-Burk plots were obtained for each isoenzyme (plots not shown; the correlation coefficients were >0.97). Fig. 2 exemplifies the reverse-phase HPLC analysis of water-soluble products resulting from the reaction of 2 mM GSH with 120 μM (+)-anti-BPDE in the absence and presence of 14 μg/ml of forestomach GST 9.5. As can be seen, the nonenzymatic conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE was negligible, but this reaction was accelerated severalfold in the presence of GST 9.5 (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 exemplifies the relationship between the rate of GSH-(+)-anti-BPDE conjugation and the concentration of (+)-anti-BPDE in the presence of forestomach GST 9.5 and hepatic mGSTP1-1. As shown in Table I, the Vmax values for murine GST isoenzymes were in the order of GST 9.5 > mGSTP1-1 > mGSTM1-1 > mGSTA3-3 > mGSTA4-4. The Vmax value for forestomach GST 9.5 was approximately 131-, 4-, 40-, and 159-fold higher than the values for mGSTA3-3, mGSTP1-1, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4, respectively. The kcat value determined for GST 9.5 was approximately 5-200-fold higher as compared with other murine GST isoenzymes examined in the present study (Table I). The Km values for GST 9.5, mGSTA3-3, mGSTP1-1, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4, respectively, were 16-, 12-, 29-, 27-, and 49 μM. Calculation of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) revealed that while forestomach GST 9.5 was most competent in the conjugation of (+)-anti-BPDE with GSH, (+)-anti-BPDE appeared to be a poor substrate for two other alpha class mouse GST isoenzymes (mGSTA3-3 and mGSTA4-4). The catalytic efficiency of GST 9.5 in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE, as compared with mGSTA3-3, mGSTP1-1, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4, was higher by about 74-, 9-, 66-, and 625-fold, respectively (Table I). Exceptionally high catalytic efficiency of GST 9.5 toward (+)-enantiomer of BPDE indicates that this isoenzyme is different among the alpha class mammalian GSTs because (+)-anti-BPDE has been shown to be a poor substrate for rat and human alpha class GST isoenzymes (15Robertson I.G.C.

Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2220-2224PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for mGSTP1-1 of the forestomach were also estimated. Vmax, kcat, and Km values and catalytic efficiencies of hepatic and forestomach mGSTP1-1 isoenzymes were comparable (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters for mouse GST isoenzymes with (+)-anti-BPDE as the variable substrateIsoenzymeVmaxkcatKmCatalytic efficiency (kcat/Km)nmol·;mg−1·;min−1s−1μmmM−1·;s−1Forestomach GST 9.52232 ± 1622.016 ± 4125Hepatic mGSTA3-317 ± 10.0212 ± 21.7Hepatic mGSTP1-1515 ± 790.4029 ± 913.8Hepatic mGSTM1-156 ± 100.0527 ± 131.9Hepatic mGSTA4-414 ± 30.0149 ± 200.2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3The rate of conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE and (−)-anti-BPDE as a function of varying substrate concentration in the presence of forestomach GST 9.5 (•) and hepatic mGSTP1-1 (○).

For (+)-anti-BPDE, both isoenzymes were used at a concentration of 14 μg/ml. For (−)-anti-BPDE, the concentrations of mGSTP1-1 and GST 9.5 were 280 and 14 μg/ml, respectively.

These experiments were performed by using racemic anti-BPDE, and the results are summarized in Table II. The double-reciprocal plots were also linear for each GST isoenzyme when the concentration of GSH was varied (plots not shown). This is in contrast to the results obtained with purified rat liver GST isoenzymes where a nonlinear relationship was observed (14Jernström B. Martinez M. Meyer D.J. Ketterer B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Vmax value for forestomach GST 9.5 was about 7-159-fold higher as compared with other GST isoenzymes. The Km value toward GSH for forestomach GST 9.5 was about 33% higher as compared with that for hepatic mGSTP1-1 (Table II). The Km values for mGSTA3-3, mGSTM1-1, and mGSTA4-4 were 176-, 167-, and 197 μM, respectively. With the exception of mGSTA4-4, the Vmax values for other murine GST isoenzymes were lower by about 29% (for GST 9.5) to 79% (for mGSTM1-1) when racemic anti-BPDE was used as a substrate as compared with the values obtained with (+)-anti-BPDE (Table I). This may be attributed to the inhibition of GSH conjugation of (+)-anti-BPDE by the (−)-enantiomer, a phenomenon reported for hGSTP1-1 (16Robertson I.G.C. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Jernström B.

Fig. 3 exemplifies the rate of (−)-anti-BPDE-GSH conjugation at different concentrations of the (−)-anti-BPDE in the presence of forestomach GST 9.5 and hepatic mGSTP1-1. The (−)-anti-BPDE appeared to be a relatively poor substrate for each GST isoenzyme as compared to the (+)-enantiomer of anti-BPDE. However, the catalytic efficiency of forestomach GST 9.5 in the conjugation of GSH with (−)-anti-BPDE (8.8 mM−1·;s−1) was in the range observed for other compounds that are considered as good substrates of GSTs (30Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In general, the murine GST isoenzymes were about 2-20-fold more efficient in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE as compared with the (−)-enantiomer of anti-BPDE. The enantioselectivity was relatively more pronounced for mGSTP1-1 where the catalytic efficiencies toward (+)- and (−)-enantiomers differed by about 20-fold. It is noteworthy that the murine pi class mGSTP1-1 investigated in the present study was able to catalyze the conjugation of (−)-anti-BPDE with GSH. On the contrary, the corresponding human isoenzyme (hGSTP1-1) is unable to catalyze the conjugation of GSH with (−)-anti-BPDE (16Robertson I.G.C. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Jernström B.

These results are noteworthy because (+)-anti-BPDE has been reported to be a poor substrate for alpha class human and rat GST isoenzymes (14Jernström B. Martinez M. Meyer D.J. Ketterer B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernström B.

In the present study, the (+)-anti-BPDE appeared to be a rather poor substrate for the other two homodimeric alpha class mouse GST isoenzymes of the female A/J mouse tissues (mGSTA3-3 and mGSTA4-4). Further studies are needed to determine whether or not murine GST 9.5 exhibits a similar substrate specificity in catalyzing the conjugation of bay-region dihydrodiol epoxides of other PAHs, such as chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, etc. Similar to anti-BPDE, the anti-dihydrodiol epoxides of these PAHs possess the highest mutagenic and carcinogenic potency (31Wood A.W. Levin W. Ryan D. Thomas P.E. Yagi H. Mah H.D. Thakker D.R. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Wood A.W. Levin W.

Conformational Analysis of Cyclohexenes, Cyclohexadienes and Related Hydroaromatic Compounds. VCH Publishers, Inc., Weinheim1989: 269-298Google Scholar). Therefore, it is more than likely that the GST 9.5 of forestomach will be efficient in the detoxification of anti-dihydrodiol epoxides of other PAHs as well. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that GST 9.5 of forestomach is composed of two distinct alpha class GST subunits.2 The antibodies raised against alpha class mGSTA4-4 do not recognize mGSTA3-3 (34Zimniak P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 whereas both subunits of the forestomach GST 9.5 cross-react with these antibodies.2 While mGSTA3-3 of female A/J mouse liver is recognized by the antibodies raised against a mixture of human liver alpha class GST isoenzymes (GST alpha-epsilon), mGSTA4-4 does not cross-react with these antibodies.2 Interestingly, both subunits of the forestomach GST 9.5 are also recognized by the antibodies raised against alpha class human liver GST isoenzymes.2 These results indicate that the subunits of GST 9.5 are structurally different from those of mGSTA3-3 and mGSTA4-4 and suggest that an isoenzyme immunologically related to mouse GST 9.5 may be present in human liver. However, further studies are needed to identify the human orthologue of mouse GST 9.5 and to determine if the human isoenzyme is as efficient as murine GST 9.5 in the detoxification of anti-BPDE. The pi class human GST isoenzyme (hGSTP1-1) has been shown to be highly efficient in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE (16Robertson I.G.C. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2220-2224PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that the mouse pi class GST isoenzyme (mGSTP1-1) is comparatively less efficient in catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE as compared with the corresponding human isoenzyme. The catalytic efficiency of hGSTP1-1 toward (+)-anti-BPDE is about 2.0-fold higher as compared with the mGSTP1-1. Even though catalytic efficiency of mGSTP1-1 is relatively lower than that of hGSTP1-1, this isoenzyme is likely to play an important role in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE in mouse tissues. The pi class mGSTP1-1 accounts for approximately 21 and 23%, respectively, of total cytosolic GST protein in the liver and forestomach of female A/J mouse. On the other hand, the constitutive expression of GST 9.5 amounts to only about 5% of total cytosolic GST protein in the forestomach of A/J mouse. Therefore, it seems reasonable to postulate that high levels of mGSTP1-1 expression may overcome the relatively lower catalytic efficiency of this isoenzyme in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE. The relative contributions of the GST 9.5 and mGSTP1-1 to the overall detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE, however, remains to be determined. The results of the present study indicate that the kinetic properties of the pi class GST isoenzymes of rat (rGSTP1-1; Ref. 15Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), human (hGSTP1-1, Ref. 16Robertson I.G.C. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2220-2224PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse (present study) in the conjugation of GSH with anti-BPDE are different. For example, the Km value for hGSTP1-1 toward (+)-anti-BPDE is approximately 2.9-fold higher than that for mGSTP1-1. On the other hand, Km for mGSTP1-1 is about 2-fold higher as compared with that for rGSTP1-1. Second, the (−)-enantiomer of anti-BPDE is not a substrate for hGSTP1-1 (16Robertson I.G.C. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2220-2224PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mGSTP1-1 can catalyze the conjugation of (−)-anti-BPDE with GSH. The activity of rGSTP1-1 toward (−)-enantiomer of anti-BPDE has not been investigated. Finally, the rGSTP1-1, but not hGSTP1-1 or mGSTP1-1, shows a biphasic kinetics with GSH as the variable substrate (15Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). BP-induced cancer of the forestomach and lung in female A/J mouse has been used extensively as an experimental model in studies to identify naturally occurring inhibitors of PAH-induced neoplasia (35Dragsted L.O. Strube M. Larsen J.C. Pharmacol. & Toxicol. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 116-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Even though the mechanism by which chemoprotectors attenuate the carcinogenic effects of BP is not fully understood, increased detoxification of the carcinogenic metabolites of BP through induction of GST activity appears to be an important mechanism of their chemopreventive activity (23Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar, 26Benson A.M. Batzinger R.P. Ou S.-Y.L. Bueding E. Cha Y.N. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4486-4495PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sparnins V.L. Venegas P.L. Wattenberg L.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 493-496PubMed Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to postulate that the effectiveness of a chemoprotective agent against BP-induced carcinogenesis may, at least in part, be dependent upon its ability to increase the expression of GST isoenzyme(s) which is/are most efficient in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE. The results of the present study suggest that an agent that selectively induces GST 9.5 and/or mGSTP1-1 is likely to be a relatively more effective inhibitor of BP-induced carcinogenesis than those increasing expression of mGSTA3-3, mGSTA4-4, or mGSTM1-1, which have weak activity toward (+)-anti-BPDE. However, further studies are needed to test the validity of this contention. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that an alpha class mouse GST isoenzyme is highly efficient in the detoxification of both (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of anti-BPDE. The relatively high activity of GST 9.5 toward the (+)-enantiomer is noteworthy because (+)-anti-BPDE is the most active mutagen in vitro and the most potent carcinogen in vivo (6Wood A.W. Chang R.L.

Yagi H. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of mouse GST 9.5 is about 4.5-fold higher than that of human pi class GST isoenzyme (hGSTP1-1), which among human GSTs is most efficient in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE (16Robertson I.G.C. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Jernström B. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2220-2224PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not an orthologue of mouse GST 9.5 is expressed in human tissues remains to be seen. Also, the molecular basis for exceptionally high catalytic efficiency of the GST 9.5 in the conjugation of GSH with (+)-anti-BPDE remains to be understood. We thank Patrick J.

This contrasting EPR behavior caused by families of ligands such as imidazole/L-histidine or thiazole/2-aminothiazole confirms the conclusion derived from parallel optical and kinetic studies. The ligands resulting in the low spin complexes bind directly to the heme iron, while their cognate ligands induce the formation of high spin complexes by indirectly perturbing the heme structure and excluding the original axial heme ligand in the resting eNOS (V.

To further investigate the processes responsible for the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ during mastoparan stimulation and to examine the regulatory mechanism by which one could control the mastoparan actions, we used the mastoparan analogs Mas-7 and Mas-17 on SK-N-BE(2)C human neuroblastoma and other cells. The active mastoparan analog Mas-7 has been synthesized by substituting alanine for the positively charged lysine in position 12. This produced an enhancing effect on GTPase activity (34Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution with a neutral residue in the same place resulted in a loss of mastoparan activity, creating the inactive analog Mas-17 (30Legendre L. Yueh Y.G. Crain R. Haddock N.

In the present study, we suggest that Mas-7 induces the formation of pores permeable to Ca2+, Mn2+, Na+, EtBr, and lucifer yellow, in addition to the phosphoinositide turnover resulting in IP3 production and Ca2+ influx. Interestingly, the phosphoinositide turnover was regulated by PKC and Ca2+ entering from the extracellular environment. Carbamylcholine (carbachol) chloride, thapsigargin, (±)-sulfinpyrazone, Triton X-100, EGTA, EDTA, Trizma base, trichloroacetic acid, bovine serum albumin, and IP3 were obtained from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 4-α-PMA were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). [3H]IP3 was obtained from DuPont NEN, and fura-2/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mas-7 and Mas-17 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Human neuroblastoma clone SK-N-BE(2)C, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, and human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The medium was changed every 2 days, and cells were subcultured about once a week. Bovine chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands according to the method of Kilpatrik et al., (35Kilpatrik D.L. Ledbetter F.H. Carson K.A. Kirshner A.G. Slepetis R. Kirshner N. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained with DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% bovine calf serum and 1% antibiotics. The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2, as previously reported (36Suh B.-C. Kim K.-T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, SK-N-BE(2)C cells were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethylester (fura-2/AM) to a final concentration of 3 μM in complete medium and incubated at 37°C for 50 min with stirring. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the incubation medium was 0.3%. After the loading, the cells were pelleted and washed twice with Locke's solution (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 5.0 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) to remove the extracellular dye. Sulfinpyrazone was added to both the loading medium and the washing solution to a final concentration of 250 μM to prevent dye leakage (37Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the fluorimetric measurement of the [Ca2+]i, 1 × 106 cells were placed into a quartz cuvette in a thermostatically controlled cell holder at 37°C with continuous stirring. Fluorescence ratios were taken by dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm by an alternative wavelength time scanning method. The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ was calculated using the following equationCa2+i=KDR−Rmin/Rmax−RSe/Sb2 where Rmax and Rmin are the ratios obtained when fura-2 is saturated with Ca2+ or when EGTA is used to remove Ca2+, respectively. Sb2 and Sf2 are the proportionality coefficients of Ca2+-saturated fura-2 and free fura-2, respectively. Calibration of the fluorescence signal in terms of [Ca2+]i was performed according to Grynkiewicz et al. (38Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In extracellular Ca2+-free experiments, the Locke's solution did not contain Ca2+ ion but instead included 200 μM EGTA. IP3 mobilization in the cells was determined by competition assay using [3H]IP3 in binding to IP3 binding protein (39Downes C.P. Hawkins P.T. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine the IP3 production induced by Mas-7, SK-N-BE(2)C cells were grown in 6-well culture plates to about 95% confluency. The cells were then stimulated with the agonists for various periods of time. The reaction was terminated by removal of the medium followed by the addition of 0.3 ml of ice-cold 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing 10 mM EGTA. The plates were left on ice for 30 min to extract the water-soluble inositol phosphates. The extract was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and the TCA was removed by four extractions with diethyl ether. The final extract was neutralized with 200 mM Trizma base (Tris base) and its pH adjusted to about 7.4. 20 μl of the cell extract was added to 20 μl of assay buffer (0.1 M Tris buffer containing 4 mM EDTA, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 20 μl of [3H]IP3 (0.1 μCi/ml). Then 20 μl of a solution containing the binding protein was added. The mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of water and 1 ml of scintillation mixture were added to the pellet to measure radioactivity. IP3 concentration in the sample was determined by comparison with a standard curve and expressed as pmol/μg of protein. The IP3 binding protein has been prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Challiss et al. (40Challiss R.A. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The level of intracellular Na+ was assessed using SBFI/AM, the fluorescent sodium indicator (41Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and incubated in culture medium with 15 μM SBFI/AM, 0.2% pluronic acid, and 250 μM sulfinpyrazone at 37°C for 2 h with continuous stirring. The increase in cytosolic Na+ was measured as the increase in the fluorescence ratio determined at the dual excitation wavelength of 340 and 380 nm and the emission wavelength of 530 nm at 37°C. In the Na+-free Locke's solution, 154 mM choline chloride was added instead of NaCl. To calibrate the intracellular Na+ concentration, SBFI-loaded cells were bound to the experimental chamber and illuminated with ultraviolet light applied through the rear epifluorescence port of the Nikon Diaphot microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). At the end of each experiment, cells were treated with calibration solutions consisting of specific concentrations of Na+, Na+ ionophores gramicidin D (1 μM) and monensin (40 μM), and Na+/K+ pump inhibitor strophanthidin (100 μM). The final concentration of Na+ was obtained by mixing two solutions containing either NaCl or KCl (130 mM NaCl, or 130 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) in an appropriate proportion. The membrane permeabilization was determined with the help of fluorescent dyes. The EtBr influx was measured as described previously (42Chueh S.-H. Hsu L.-S. Song S.-L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 532-539PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in serum-free DMEM medium, then one-half million cells were aliquoted and centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in Locke's buffer solution containing 25 μM ethidium bromide. The membrane permeability to EtBr after the addition of the indicated reagents was determined by measuring the change in fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and the emission wavelength of 580 nm. The effect of Mas-7 on uptake of lucifer yellow, fura-2, and fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin was assessed as previously reported (43Steinberg T.H. Newman A.S. Swanson J.A. Silerstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8884-8888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Aliquoted 3 × 105 harvested cells were transferred to 24-well plates and incubated for 5 h to let the cells attach to the bottom. Then the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 5 min in Locke's solution with or without Mas-7 and fluorescent dyes at the following concentrations: 0.5 mg/ml lucifer yellow, 15 μM fura-2, 1 mg/ml Evans blue, and 0.04 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin. At the end of each treatment, the cells were washed in their wells twice with Ca2+-free Locke's solution and once with Ca2+ containing Locke's solution. Then, 300 μl of 3% (w/v) TCA containing Locke's solution was added to each well, stopping the reaction, and the plates were incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The extract was then transferred to a quartz cuvette, and the fluorescence was measured. Lucifer yellow fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and the emission wavelength of 521 nm; for fura-2, the wavelengths used were 340 and 510 nm; for fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin, the wavelengths used were 495 and 520 nm. The uptake of Evans blue was measured by absorbance at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. Cells loaded with fura-2/AM as described above were stimulated with Mas-7 in the presence of 25 μM Mn2+, and fluorescence quenching was measured. Fluorescence was excited at 360 nm, i.e. the isosbestic wavelength at which Ca2+ does not affect fura-2 fluorescence and at which, therefore, changes were caused by Mn2+ quenching (44Sage S.O. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 45Sage S.O. Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Emission was recorded at 500 nm. Values for maximal Mn2+ quenching in each preparation were determined immediately following the recording of the permeabilization of the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100. The formation of channels by Mas-7 was measured by the method of Kim et al. (46Kim Y.-K. Valdivia H.H. Maryon E.B. Anderson P. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1379-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, planar lipid bilayers were composed of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine dissolved in n-decane (20 mg/ml) in a 1:1 ratio. Bilayers were formed on a hole of 0.3 mm diameter in a Delrin cup. Mas-7 (10 μM) was added to the cis chamber containing Locke's solution without glucose. The trans solution was the modified Locke's solution (5.6 mM NaCl, 154 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5.0 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The cis solution was connected via an Ag/AgCl electrode and an agar/KCl bridge to the bilayer recording head-stage input of an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The trans solution was held at ground potential using the same electrode arrangement. Recordings were filtered through a low pass Bessel Filter (Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN) at 0.5 kHz. Data were analyzed by pClamp 6.02 software (Axon Instrument). The ability of Mas-7 to alter [Ca2+]i in SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells was examined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. We found that, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, Mas-7 caused a sustained elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. A high concentration of Mas-7 (50 μM) increased the [Ca2+]i rapidly (Fig. 1A), while treatment with a submaximal concentration (20 μM) of Mas-7 led to a slow increase in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). Interestingly, the Mas-7-induced response was partially inhibited by pretreatment with PMA, the PKC activator. Addition of Mas-17, an analog of mastoparan that does not activate G-proteins (34Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was ineffective in raising the [Ca2+]i. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, exposure of the cells to Mas-7 resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, which was completely abolished by PMA pretreatment (Fig. 1B). The concentration dependence of the [Ca2+]i rise induced by Mas-7 with or without PMA treatment is presented in Fig. 1C. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, maximal effective concentrations of Mas-7 raised the [Ca2+]i to over 1600 nM from a resting level of ~80 nM. The maximal and half-maximal (EC50) effective concentrations were 80 ± 15 μM and 28 ± 6 μM, respectively. It is noteworthy that, under these conditions, the elevated [Ca2+]i was sustained at all concentrations of Mas-7 tested. 4-α-PMA, the inactive analog of PMA, did not inhibit the Mas-7-induced [Ca2+]i rise, indicating that the effect is mediated by PKC (data not shown). We performed a similar analysis with regard to the effect on IP3 generation. We found that the peak IP3 generation is obtained 1 min after the addition of Mas-7 and that the effect is maintained for more than 20 min (Fig. 2A). Mas-17 was ineffective in eliciting IP3 production. Fig. 2 B shows that Mas-7 produced IP3 in a concentration-dependent manner, the maximal response and half-maximal response being obtained at 78 ± 25 and 28 ± 7 μM, respectively. The IP3 generation in response to variations in Mas-7 concentration occurred in a pattern similar to that observed for the [Ca2+]i rise. However, removal of extracellular Ca2+ decreased the Mas-7-induced IP3 production, and PMA treatment completely blocked the response. These data suggest that Mas-7 induces [Ca2+]i rise and IP3 production and that PMA treatment inhibits both responses. However, PMA treatment inhibits the [Ca2+]i rise and the IP3 production only partially in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Figs. 1C and 2B), while in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, it does so completely (Fig. 1B and 2B). To look into the mechanism of the [Ca2+]i rise during Mas-7 stimulation, we depleted the internal Ca2+ stores by pretreating the cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endomembrane Ca2+-ATPases. Incubation of the cells with 1 μM thapsigargin for 10 min increased [Ca2+]i and then the [Ca2+]i was slowly decreased and sustained to a slightly elevated level as we previously demonstrated (47Suh B.-C. Kim K.-T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The above thapsigargin treatment abolished a subsequent [Ca2+]i rise induction by carbachol treatment (Fig. 3A), indicating that the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores were depleted by the thapsigargin treatment. However, addition of Mas-7 after the thapsigargin treatment produced another [Ca2+]i rise although slightly lower than without the pretreatment (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that Mas-7 can evoke Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space by a second pathway, one that is separate from Ca2+-release activated channel. Furthermore, PMA treatment now could not prevent the Mas-7-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Mas-17 was not able to promote [Ca2+]i rise in thapsigargin-pretreated cells. We further tested whether the Mas-7 effect was reversible. When the cells were washed with Locke's buffer after 30 μM Mas-7 stimulation, they were again normally responsive to carbachol (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the washing out of Mas-7 did not affect the fluorescence intensity of the intracellular fura-2 (data not shown). These results indicate that Mas-7 acts on the plasma membrane, triggering a reversible Ca2+ response, and that the Mas-7-induced passages are not permeable to fura-2. Mas-7-mediated influx of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane was verified by measuring the unidirectional uptake of Mn2+ into fura-2-loaded SK-N-BE(2)C cells. The rate of fluorescence decrease, measured at the Ca2+-insensitive isosbestic point, provides a relative measure of the divalent cation permeability. Mn2+ slowly and steadily enters unstimulated cells. Fig. 4A shows that the rate of fura-2 quenching produced by the Mn2+ entry accelerates with the addition of 1 μM thapsigargin, revealing the activation of a divalent cation permeability pathway in the plasma membrane. The subsequent addition of Mas-7 markedly increased the rate of fluorescence quenching. The total fluorescence quenching possible was obtained after the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and is represented by a dotted line in Fig. 4A. The rate of fluorescence quenching is dependent upon the amount of Mas-7, while Mas-17 does not trigger the Mn2+ quenching effect at all (Fig. 4B). The concentration dependence of the Mas-7 effect seen in Fig. 4C shows that maximal and half-maximal stimulation of the Mn2+ influx occurs at 72 ± 12 and 24 ± 5 μM Mas-7, respectively. To test the selectivity for Ca2+ in the Mas-7-induced ion current, Na+ influx upon Mas-7 treatment was measured in cells loaded with SBFI/AM, a Na+-specific fluorescent dye. The treatment of cells with Mas-7 resulted in an increase of the [Na+]i in the SBFI-loaded cells (Fig. 5), indicating that Mas-7 induces the influx of Na+ in addition to that of Ca2+. The Mas-7-induced influx of Na+ was also sustained, similar to the [Ca2+]i rise. Mas-17 did not change the [Na+]i (data not shown). Also, the Mas-7-induced influx of Na+ was not obtained when extracellular Na+ was substituted with choline (dotted trace in Fig. 5). Monensin, a Na+-specific ionophore, was used as a positive control in the test of the [Na+]i elevation. These results reflect the ability of Mas-7 to regulate membrane permeability for a variety of ions. To test whether Mas-7 makes membrane pores, we examined the effect of Mas-7 on the uptake of EtBr. Fig. 6A shows that submaximal concentration (30 μM) of Mas-7 evoked rapid uptake of EtBr (314 Da). Digitonin, as a positive control, also induced EtBr uptake. The maximal effective concentration (80 μM) increased the fluorescence intensity to the digitonin-induced level (data not shown). The concentration dependence, as seen in Fig. 6B, strongly supports the conclusion that membrane pores are formed upon Mas-7 stimulation. To assess the pore size formed by Mas-7, we measured the permeability of various fluorescent dyes with different molecular weights. Mas-7 induced the uptake of lucifer yellow (457 Da) in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal and half-maximal concentrations seen at 75 ± 18 and 22 ± 5 μM, respectively (data not shown). However, Mas-7 did not induce the uptake of fura-2 (831 Da), Evans blue (961 Da), and fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (1,175 Da) even at the maximal effective concentration of 80 μM Mas-7 (data not shown). These results indicate that Mas-7 forms specific pores permeable to molecules at least up to 457 Da in size. The formation of membrane pores by Mas-7 was further investigated in a planar lipid bilayer in an effort to explain the entry of various ions and molecules into Mas-7-treated cells. Fig. 7A shows the planar bilayer recordings of Mas-7-induced channels in the cis solution containing Locke's solution and in the trans solution containing the modified Locke's solution with high K+. In three separate experiments, we observed two types of channels with different conductances. The current-voltage relationships of these two channels appeared linear with little voltage dependence, and the slope conductances were 290 and 94 pS (Fig. 7B). The arrows in Fig. 7A represent the current level contributed by both the closed state of the large conductance channel and the open state of the small conductance channel. The open probability of the 290 pS channel was 0.25 ± 0.12 (n = 3), however, the small conductance channel remained open most of the time and its closure is marked with an asterisk. We also looked at the effect of Mas-7 on [Ca2+]i rise and EtBr uptake in o"

Specifically, the external application of ethyl oleate (20 μM) to Sf9 cells expressing the recombinant Kv1.1 channel resulted in a decrease in the rise times of the macroscopic current (e.g. from 51.7 ± 13.1 to 12.8 ± 3.0 ms at 0 mV for 10-90% rise times) and a 10-mV hyperpolarizing shift (at 0 mV) in the voltage dependence of channel activation. These effects were dose-dependent (half-maximal effect at 7 μM), saturable and specific (i.e. fatty acid methyl esters were without effect). Although application of either ethanol or oleic acid alone did not result in alterations of the activation kinetics, the concomitant application of ethanol and oleic acid reproduced the effects of fatty acid ethyl esters with a temporal course which paralleled the intracellular accumulation of fatty acid ethyl esters in Sf9 cells. Moreover, application of fatty acid ethyl esters (but not ethanol) to rat hippocampal cells in culture produced similar effects on hippocampal delayed rectifier currents. Collectively, these results demonstrate that pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of metabolites of ethanol, fatty acid ethyl esters, modulate the function of a prototypic neuronal ion channel and thus likely contribute to the pathophysiologic sequelae of ethanol abuse in excitable tissues.

https://openalex.org/W1988565280,"Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, a key enzyme for phototransduction, contains α, β (Pαβ), and two γ (Pγ) subunits. In addition to catalytic sites, Pαβ has two classes of noncatalytic cGMP binding sites with different affinities (Kd values <100 nM and >1 μM). Pγ regulates Pαβ as an inhibitor of cGMP hydrolysis and as a stimulator of cGMP binding to the high affinity noncatalytic sites. Pγ release from Pαβ by the GTP-bound α subunit of transducin (GTP·Tα) interrupts these two functions. Here we describe a novel regulation of the Pγ release by [cGMP] and its physiological implication. We isolated Pγ mutants that exhibit abnormally one of these two functions, indicating the distinct domains in Pγ are involved to express these functions. When [cGMP] was high (~5 μM), Pγ responsible for the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis was preferentially released, and cGMP hydrolysis activity of Pαβ was increased about 10 times. When [cGMP] was low (less than ~0.5 μM), Pγ responsible for the stimulation of cGMP binding to the high affinity sites was released. The Pγ release resulted in the decrease of relative affinity of cGMP for the high affinity sites to at least (null)/1;10, followed by the rapid release of cGMP from one of the high affinity sites (apparent t1/2 = 3.8 s). cGMP (~5 μM) inhibited the extraction of Pαβ from rod membranes by a Mg2+-free hypotonic buffer. The inhibition of Pαβ extraction was not affected by Pγ, suggesting that Pαβ detects on the order of micromolar [cGMP] using low affinity noncatalytic sites on Pαβ. Because [cGMP] is ~5 μM in darkness and lowered by photoexcitation and phosphodiesterase concentration is ~30 μM in rod photoreceptors, it is possible that cGMP phosphodiesterase functions to increase cytoplasamic [cGMP] after [cGMP] is reduced to the illuminated level.

Since Bitensky and Miller suggested the involvement of cyclic nucleotides in phototransduction (1Miller W.H. Invest.

The resulting decrease of cytoplasmic [cGMP] leads to closure of cGMP-gated channels and hyperpolarization of photoreceptors. The closure of channels also blocks Ca2+ influx, while Ca2+ efflux by a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger continues. The resulting decline in the free [Ca2+] is believed to play a major role in the adaptation and recovery processes of photoreceptors by negative feedback regulation by [Ca2+] (4Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W.

By manipulating ionic strength in the reaction mixtures, we have recently suggested that Pγ expresses only one of these functions when Pγ is complexed with Pαβ (13Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we refer to the Pγ responsible for the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis as iPγ and the Pγ responsible for the stimulation of cGMP binding to the high affinity sites as sPγ. Using data showing that release of these Pγs is regulated by [cGMP], we propose a novel mechanism for the recovery of [cGMP] to the dark level. ROS membranes from dark-adapted Rana catesbiana, Pγ-less (activated) cGMP phosphodiesterase membranes, and frog Pγ were prepared as described (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of phosphodiesterase was measured as described (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M.

Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Pγ content measured by the Pγ-specific antibody was similar to the value obtained by the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of [3H]cGMP to Pαβ in various ROS membranes was assayed as described (7Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To ensure [3H]cGMP binding to the high affinity noncatalytic sites on Pαβ, 0.5 μM [3H]cGMP (12Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used in the presence of 1 mM IBMX and 2 mM EDTA. Under these conditions, ~5% (at most) of added cGMP was hydrolyzed. We have already shown that recombinant bovine Pγ has the same functions as frog Pγ (13Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To measure [3H]cGMP release from the high affinity sites on Pαβ, [3H]cGMP was loaded to the sites on Pαβγ2. Then, [3H]cGMP release was measured with or without 100 μM GTPγS using a filter method (11Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) without nonradioactive cGMP. The filter was washed with 2 ml of 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mM EDTA (×4). Each washing took about 2 s. Data were analyzed with a nonlinear curve-fitting program Igor Pro (Wave Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR) (14McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out more than three times, and the results were similar. Data shown were the representative of these experiments. In order to replace C-terminal 18 amino acids or N-terminal 16 amino acids, a frameshift mutation was introduced into bovine Pγ cDNA (15Ovchinnikov Y.A. Lipkin V.M. Kumarev V.P. Gubanov V.V. Khramtsov N.V. Akhmedov N.B. Zagranichny V.E. Muradov K.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the C-terminal frameshift mutation, the following primers were used for the first PCR reaction: up, 5′-GTCATCTGCTTTGGGAGGCCTTCA-3′ and down, 5′-CGGGGGTCGGATCCTAAGATGCCGTAC-3′. To amplify the mutant Pγ gene, the second PCR reaction was carried out with the purified product from the first PCR reaction and the following primer: 5′-GGAGGTTTTACATATGAACTTAGAACC-3′. The mutant contains the following amino acid sequence in its C-terminal: FGRPSTTWRCTRWPRTAS. For the N-terminal frameshift mutation, the following primers were used for the first PCR reaction: up, 5′-ACAAGCATATGAAACCGGGTGCCACCCAAGGC-3′ and down, 5′-GGGAGTGACGGGCCCCCCATCACC-3′. To amplify the mutant Pγ gene, the second PCR reaction was carried out with the purified product from the first PCR reaction and the following primer: 5′-GGGGTCGGATCCTAGATGATGCCGTACTG-3′. The mutant contains the following amino acid sequence in its N-terminal: MKPGATQGRDPVGHKGD. These amplified Pγ mutant gene products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into a NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-IIA (Novagene). The vector was transferred to Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagene) for expression of Pγ. The mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using the fmol DNA sequencing system (Promega). The protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification of recombinant Pγ was carried out as described (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pγ regulates Pαβ as iPγ and sPγ. We isolated Pγ mutants in which one of these functions was suppressed (Fig. 1). When the C-terminal 18 amino acids were replaced by a frameshift mutation, the mutant (C-18) stimulated cGMP binding similarly to wild type Pγ; however, the inhibitory activity was completely abolished. When the N-terminal 16 amino acids were replaced, the mutant (N-16) retained inhibitory activity like wild type Pγ. However, a 200-300 nM amount of this mutant Pγ was required to reach 50% of the maximal cGMP binding that was achieved with ~10 nM wild type Pγ. These observations indicate that different domains in Pγ are involved to express these functions. Because Pγ expresses only one of these functions when Pγ is complexed with Pαβ (Ref. 13Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and as shown below), these data suggest that Pγ binds to different sites on Pαβ to express these functions. It should be emphasized that a C-terminal-deleted (10 amino acids) mutant lost the iPγ activity as shown by many groups; however, the mutant also showed less stimulatory activity for the cGMP binding due to less interaction with Pαβ (data not shown). We also note that stimulation of cGMP binding by the C-18 mutant clearly indicates that high phosphodiesterase activity did not affect cGMP binding to the high affinity noncatalytic sites on Pαβ by reducing [cGMP], since cGMP hydrolysis was maximal for all concentrations of the mutant, while cGMP binding was dependent upon the mutant concentration. Phosphodiesterase is activated by GTP·Tα through iPγ release from Pαβ in amphibian ROS membranes (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yamazaki A. Stein P.J. Chernoff N. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8188-8194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the iPγ release can be distinguished from sPγ release by changing [NaCl] in a releasing buffer (0-200 mM) (13Yamazaki A. Yamazaki M. Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the change in the cytoplasmic ionic strength by light in frog ROS is not so drastic (18Somlyo A.P. Walz B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 183-195Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have investigated the possibility that cGMP is a physiological regulator for the release of functionally different Pγ from Pαβ. cGMP (1 mM) inhibited the total Pγ release regardless of [NaCl] in the releasing buffer (Fig. 2A). When the buffer contained less than 100 mM NaCl, the phosphodiesterase activity in membranes washed without cGMP was consistently higher than that washed with cGMP (Fig. 2B). When the buffer contained 150 mM NaCl, the maximum activation was achieved by the first washing without cGMP; however, in the presence of cGMP the full activation was accomplished after the third washing (Fig. 2C). These data unexpectedly indicate that the release of iPγ, i.e. the phosphodiesterase activation, is sensitive to cGMP. However, we emphasize that, in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, 60% of the maximum phosphodiesterase activity can be retained by the first washing even in the presence of 1 mM cGMP (Fig. 2C). Because less than 5 μM cGMP is hydrolyzed for photoexcitation (2Baylor D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1987; 28: 34-49PubMed Google Scholar), the suppression of phosphodiesterase activation by cGMP may be negligible under the physiological ionic conditions (18Somlyo A.P. Walz B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 183-195Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We note that the release of Tα was not affected by cGMP and that excess amounts of Tα were released for the Pγ release in each washing (data not shown). We also found that ~5 μM cGMP inhibited the total Pγ release in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM IBMX (data not shown). This result is consistent with data published by Arshavsky et al. (17Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we used 1 mM cGMP in this study to exclude the effect of cGMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase activated variously. In the absence of cGMP, the amount of Pγ released with 200 mM NaCl was 3.4 ± 0.5 times (n = 3) that of Pγ released without NaCl (Fig. 2A). Measurement of Pγ by the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis also indicated that the amount of Pγ released with 200 mM NaCl was 3.6 ± 0.9 times (n = 3) that of Pγ released without NaCl (data not shown). However, membranes washed with or without NaCl showed the activated, same level of phosphodiesterase activity (Fig. 2B). These observations indicate that only 30% (at most) of the total Pγ released functions as iPγ, and more than 70% of Pγ released is not responsible for phosphodiesterase inhibition. At present, we do not have a simple explanation for such an unequivalent release of the functionally different Pγ. We speculate that a portion of Pγ bound Pαβ, especially iPγ, may be GTP·Tα-insensitive (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to its phosphorylation (19Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Pγ cannot be released by GTP·Tα due to the loss of affinity for GTP·Tα (20Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the releasing buffer contained more than 100 mM NaCl, the ratio of the total Pγ released in the absence of cGMP to the Pγ released in the presence of cGMP was approximately 2 to 1 (Fig. 2A). However, phosphodiesterase activities in these membranes measured after Pγ release were identical (Fig. 2B). These observations indicate that 50% (at least) of the total Pγ released is sensitive to cGMP and that the Pγ is not iPγ. When ROS membranes were washed with a buffer containing only GTP, equilibrium [3H]cGMP binding to the high affinity noncatalytic sites on Pαβ in these membranes was increased by Pγ added (Fig. 3A). However, if the membranes were washed with a buffer containing GTP and cGMP, approximately 80% of the maximum [3H]cGMP binding was detected without adding Pγ and the added Pγ barely stimulated the [3H]cGMP binding. Both membranes had the same level of phosphodiesterase activity (data not shown). Five μM cGMP (with 1 mM IBMX) produced a similar effect, although the effect was smaller due to the possible hydrolysis of cGMP during washing (data not shown). These observations indicate that, when [cGMP] is high, iPγ, but not sPγ, is released readily. When [cGMP] is low, both iPγ and sPγ are released. Without Pγ, [3H]cGMP could not be loaded to the high affinity sites on Pαβ using 1 μM [3H]cGMP. However, in the presence of Pγ, various concentrations of [3H]cGMP (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μM) showed the similar level of equilibrium cGMP binding to the sites (data not shown). We note that cGMP binding with a Kd value ~1 μM can be measured under our conditions (7Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that the relative affinity of cGMP for the high affinity sites is reduced to (null)/1;10 (at least) by release of sPγ. We measured the time course of cGMP release from the high affinity sites on Pαβγ2 by GTP·Tα (Fig. 3B). Without GTPγS, [3H]cGMP, which had been loaded to the sites, was not released; however, with GTPγS, biphasic dissociation kinetics were observed (apparent t1/2 = 3.8 and 181 s, 20°C). These results suggest that two different high affinity sites are present on Pαβ and that GTPγS·Tα rapidly dissociates [3H]cGMP from one of the sites. We note that ~0.5 μM [3H]cGMP was present during the [3H]cGMP release, and nonradioactive cGMP was not added to chase [3H]cGMP from these sites. Thus, the real dissociation rate of [3H]cGMP may be faster than that measured under our conditions. Cote et al. (12Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have reported the relatively slow biphasic dissociation of [3H]cGMP from Pαβγ2 by GTPγS·Tα (apparent t1/2 = 25 and 264 s, room temperature) in the presence of cGMP (1 mM). Under their conditions the real rate of [3H]cGMP dissociation by GTPγS·Tα might be slower than these data, because 1 mM cGMP substantially stimulated cGMP release from Pαβγ2 without GTP·Tα (11Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We speculate that under their conditions the release of sPγ from Pαβ might be inhibited by 1 mM cGMP as shown above. Therefore, dissociation of [3H]cGMP from the high affinity sites on Pαβ might be suppressed. We studied the possibility that Pαβ detects [cGMP] by its low affinity noncatalytic cGMP binding site. When Pαβ was extracted from ROS membranes with a magnesium-free hypotonic buffer, cGMP specifically inhibited the Pαβ release (Fig. 4A). cAMP (100 μM) did not inhibit the release (data not shown). This inhibition was detectable as low as 5 μM cGMP and was not dependent upon Pγ, since this inhibition was not changed even after membranes were washed with GTP or GTP and cGMP (Fig. 4, B and C). These data indicate that Pαβ detects, directly or indirectly, on the order of micromolar [cGMP] and that cGMP binding to the high affinity sites is not involved in this detection. Previous data have shown that under similar conditions only noncatalytic sites on Pαβ are detected as cGMP binding sites by photoaffinity labeling (6Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V. Muradov K.G. Gubanov V.V. Li T. Johnston J.P. Volpp K.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12955-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Kd value for cGMP binding to low affinity noncatalytic sites is about 1-6 μM (6Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V. Muradov K.G. Gubanov V.V. Li T. Johnston J.P. Volpp K.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12955-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Km value of the Pαβ catalytic sites is about 0.3-1 mM. On the basis of these data, we propose that the low affinity noncatalytic sites on Pαβ serve as a sensor of the cytoplasmic [cGMP]. The binding of cGMP to these low affinity sites appears to inhibit the sPγ release by GTP·Tα from Pαβ through changing of Pαβ conformation, because a similar [cGMP] inhibits the release of sPγ as described above. The present data indicate that sPγ is released by GTP·Tα when [cGMP] becomes low, resulting in the rapid release of cGMP from one of the high affinity noncatalytic sites on Pαβ. We hypothesize that this cGMP release functions to promote recovery of [cGMP] to the dark level in amphibian ROS. We emphasize that hydrolysis of GTP bound to Tα measured by biochemical methods is slow (21Ting T.D. Ho Y.-K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8996-9007Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that GTP·Tα is still present after the turnoff of GTP·Tα-activated phosphodiesterase by Pγ phosphorylation (19Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GTP·Tα is expected to be present at the late stage of phototransduction. GTP·Tα may not release iPγ at the stage. We found that release of iPγ by GTP·Tα is inhibited by endogenous ADP-ribosylation of Pγ complexed with Pαβ (22Bondarenko V.A. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1996; 37: s238PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that this kind of mechanism may be functional when [cGMP] becomes low. Since [cGMP] is ~5 μM in darkness and Pαβ is estimated to be ~30 μM in concentration, cGMP released from one of the high affinity sites by GTP·Tα may be enough to increase cytoplasmic [cGMP] to the dark level, and less than 1.2 s is required to release ~5 μM cGMP from the site. Thus, it is possible that cGMP phosphodiesterase functions to increase cytoplasmic [cGMP] to the dark level when [cGMP] is reduced to the illuminated level. At present, we cannot compare the contribution of cGMP release from the high affinity site on Pαβ to that of cGMP synthesis by guanylyl cyclase for the recovery of [cGMP] to the dark level, because the precise data of the velocity of cGMP synthesis are not available.

The following observations were noted. First, regardless of the source of enzyme, bovine or rat, and catalytic conditions (unisite or multisite), the rates of hydrolysis depend on ATP concentration to the first power. Second, the first order rate constant for ATP hydrolysis remains relatively constant under both unisite and multisite conditions declining only slightly at high ATP concentration. Third, the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior with a single Vmax exceeding 100 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg of F1 (turnover number = 635 s−1) and a single Km for ATP of about 57 μM.

From the plasma membrane (~3 mg/ml protein concentration), the enzyme could be solubilized in active form using 10 mM 3-[(3-chlolamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate aided by 2 M NaCl and 10% glycerol (27% optimal solubilization yield). The supernatant from a 55% saturation (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> cut was fractionated onto a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column and enzymatic activity was eluted with a inverse gradient of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Following removal of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with PD-10 columns and fractionation with a Mono Q HR 5/5 column, a sharp peak of enzyme activity was eluted. Analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a major band at 106 kDa and, on isoelectrofocusing gel, a pI of 5.1. The activity was completely inhibited by CN<sup>−</sup> and N<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, suggestive of copper as a likely cofactor. Identification of the protein was confirmed by affinity labeling with <sup>14</sup>CN<sup>−</sup> and isoelectrofocusing.

Significant activity was noted toward many glycated amino acids (highest with ϵ-fructosyl lysine) but not with glycated proteins. The sequence of the first 16 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids and a search in various data bases revealed that this amadoriase enzyme is a novel protein. Based on its properties, this deglycating enzyme, which degrades Amadori products oxidatively into free fructosamine, is classified as fructosyl aminocaproate:oxygen oxidoreductase (EC 1.5.3)."

Surprisingly, despite the absence of the metal binding site in Arc5, this cis-peptide bond found in all legume lectin structures is still present, although the Asp residue has been replaced by a Tyr residue. Despite the high identity between the different legume lectin sequences, they show a broad range of quaternary structures. The structures of three different dimers and three different tetramers have been solved. Arc5 crystallized as a monomer, bringing the number of known quaternary structures to seven. Lectins, a class of sugar-binding proteins without enzymatic activity toward the bound sugar, are ubiquitous in nature and have been found in viruses, bacteria, plants, and animals. The most extensively studied class of lectins is undoubtedly the legume lectin class, found in the seeds of the legume plants (1Sharon N. Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). At present, the crystal structures of 10 different legume lectins have been solved and refined: pea lectin (2Einspahr H.

Despite the abundance of structural and biochemical information, the precise function of the legume lectins in the plant is still the subject of much debate. The two most likely functions are protection against predators (12Chrispeels M.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and interaction with the Rhizobium symbionts responsible for nitrogen fixation (13Diaz C. Melchers L. Hooykaas P.J.J. Lugtenberg B.J.J. Kijne J.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 579-581Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the seeds of the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, two lectins are found, called phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L) and phytohemagglutinin-E. The crystal structure of the former has recently been determined at a resolution of 2.8 Å (11Hamelryck T.W. Dao-Thi M. Poortmans F. Chrispeels M.J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, two polypeptides with highly related amino acid sequences are present in the seeds, namely arcelin and α-amylase inhibitor. In these so-called lectin-like proteins, respectively one and two loops essential for the sugar-binding capabilities of the legume lectins are deleted. The α-amylase inhibitor inhibits α-amylases of mammalian and insect origin but does not inhibit plant α-amylases. Arcelin is only present in a few wild accessions of the common bean and exists in six electrophoretic variants. The phytohemagglutinins, the α-amylase inhibitor, and arcelin are defense proteins that protect the bean against predators (12Chrispeels M.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism behind the toxicity of arcelin is as yet unknown. The four proteins are encoded by four tightly linked genes, and it is likely that these originate from a common ancestral gene through duplication. Arcelin-5 (15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has been reported to consist of a mixture of two major protein fractions, termed arcelin-5a (Arc5a, 32.2 kDa) and arcelin-5b (Arc5b, 31.5 kDa), and a third, minor fraction, termed arcelin-5c (Arc5c, 30.8 kDa). Arc5b and Arc5a contain one and two glycans, respectively, while Arc5c is not glycosylated. Two different arcelin-5 cDNA sequences were reported (15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), called arc5-I and arc5-II. They encode two polypeptides of 240 amino acids (26.8 and 27.0 kDa) with a high identity (96.9%, a difference of 8 residues in the N-terminal part of the chain). The arc5-I-encoded protein contains three potential glycosylation sites, while the arc5-II encoded protein contains only two. Arc5a and Arc5b are encoded by arc5-I and arc5-II, respectively, while Arc5c could be encoded by arc5-II or by a third copy of the arc5 gene with a much lower rate of expression. Arcelins are thought to provide resistance against the bean bruchid pest Zabrotus subfasciatus (16Osborn T.C. Alexander D.C. Sun S.S.M. Cardona C. Bliss F.A. Science. 1988; 240: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Among the arcelin variants, Arc1 and Arc5 appear to be the most promising in conferring insect resistance (33Kornegay J. Cardona C. Posso C. Crop Sci. 1993; 33: 589-594Crossref Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of arcelin-5 solved at a resolution of 2.7 Å. G. simplicifolia isolectin IV noncrystallographic symmetry phytohemagglutinin-L simulated annealing concanavalin B E. corallodendron seed lectin. Arcelin-5 was purified from seeds of the wild Phaseolus vulgaris (strain G02771) by chromatofocusing as described in Ref. 15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Protein solutions were made starting from the lyophilized protein. Suitable crystallization conditions were screened using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method: 5 μl of aqueous protein solution (varying between 5 and 10 mg/ml) was mixed with 5 μl of various bottom solutions and equilibrated against 0.5 ml of pure bottom solution. Small, needle-like crystals were obtained with a bottom solution consisting of 20% (w/v) PEG 4000 (Hampton Research), 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, in combination with a 5.0 mg/ml aqueous protein solution, incubated at room temperature. To obtain crystals suitable for data collection, the microseeding technique was used. A 10-μl drop containing many needle-like crystals was homogenized by vortexing, and a range of dilutions between 10−1 and 10−8 in undiluted bottom solution was made. One μl of these dilutions was subsequently added to the 10-μl drops with the aforementioned composition prior to equilibration. This resulted in a number of thin, plate-shaped crystals. The best results were obtained using the 107-fold dilution. One of the thus obtained crystals was transferred to a glass capillary and used for data collection. This was done on an Enraff-Nonius FAST area detector, using copper Kα radiation generated by a rotating anode x-ray generator, operated at 40 kV and 90 mA. Autoindexing was done with the MADNESS software packet (17Pflugrath J.W. Messerschmidt A. MADNESS Manual of FAST Diffractometer. Enraff Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands1989Google Scholar). The crystal was monoclinic and belonged to space group P21. The data were subdivided in bins of 3° and scaled and merged with the CCP4 programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA (18SERC Daresbury Laboratory Collaborative Computing Project 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). The coordinates of PHA-L (11Hamelryck T.W. Dao-Thi M. Poortmans F. Chrispeels M.J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were used as a model after removal of sugar, water, and metal atoms. PHA-L is a tetramer consisting of two canonical legume lectin dimers. Since Arc5 has been reported to be a dimer in solution (15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the identity between Arc5 and PHA-L is high (55%), molecular replacement was first attempted, however unsuccessfully, with a complete PHA-L canonical dimer. Conversely, two clear solutions were found using the PHA-L monomer as a model. Application of the found solutions to the model and visual inspection showed reasonable crystal packing contacts and the absence of significant sterical clashes. Since Arc5 is highly homologous to the legume lectins, the Arc5 sequence was submitted to the Swiss-Model service (20Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) for automated comparative modeling. This model was used for further refinement. During the refinement the PHA-L structure was often used to clarify pieces of the structure where the density was hard to interpret. The refinement was done with the program X-PLOR (version 3.1) (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) on a Cray J916/8-1024 supercomputer. Positional refinement was done with the simulated annealing protocol (SA) (4000 K, t = 0.01 ps). In order not to overfit the structure in the early stage of the refinement, the grouped B factor refinement protocol (one B factor for side chain atoms and one B factor for main chain atoms per residue) was used in the first four refinement cycles. After cycle 4, individual B factor refinement was applied, since the difference in free R factor between grouped and individual B factor refinement clearly justified this (free R factor = 32.0%, R factor = 24.7% for the grouped B factor refinement; free R factor = 31.0%, R factor = 23.6% for the individual B factor refinement). In accordance with the currently accepted refinement protocols (14Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), restrained noncrystallographic symmetry (weight = 300.0 kcal mol−1Å−2, σNCS = 1.0 Å2) was applied between the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. During the refinement, SA omit maps were extensively used to clarify parts of the structure with difficult to interpret electron densities. Model visualization and building were done using the program O (version 5.10.2) (35Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics INDIGO2 XZ workstation. The stereochemistry of the structure was monitored throughout the refinement with the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The coordinates of GS4, EcorL, and PHA-L, used for comparison with Arc5, are present in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under entries 1LEC, 1LTE, and 1FAT, respectively. Hydrogen atoms on the sugar residues, necessary for the determination of the torsion angles, were generated with X-PLOR. Hydrogen bonds were determined with the program HBPLUS (23McDonald I.K. Naylor D.N. Jones D.T. Thornton J.M. HBPLUS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College London1993Google Scholar). The figures were made with the programs MOLSCRIPT (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the native arcelin-5 protein was determined by gel filtration through a Superdex 200 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) fast protein liquid chromatography column (1.0 × 30 cm) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 M NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 50 mM Na 2HPO4, 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2) or acetate buffer (50 mM CH3COONa, pH 4.5) was used as the equilibration and elution buffer. A gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) with molecular weight markers ranging from 1.35 to 670 kDa was used. The R factor of the final structure for all 16,722 reflections between 2.7 and 10.0 Å is 20.6%, and the free R factor is 27.1%. The overall quality of the electron density is quite high. In the final cycles of the refinement it became clear that the conformation of the residues between Val36 and Pro42 differed between the two monomers in the asymmetric unit, due to different crystal contacts. The two regions were manually rebuilt and were not subjected to NCS during the final refinement cycles. This region in the first monomer is the only region in the structure that displays comparatively weak electron density. Nevertheless, all residues could properly be built into the structure. Because of the low resolution (2.7 Å), no waters were added to the structure during the refinement. The overall structure of Arc5 is similar to the structures of the other solved legume lectin structures and consists of a flat six-strand β-sheet, called the back sheet, packed against a curved seven-strand β-sheet, called the front sheet (see Fig. 1). Since NCS was used during the refinement, the two Arc5 monomers are virtually identical, with the exception of the region between Val36 and Pro42, due to crystal packing contacts. The structure contains 228 of the 240 amino acids of the mature protein: no electron density is observed for the terminal 12 amino acids. This can be due to C-terminal truncation or dynamic disorder of the C-terminal stretch in the crystal. Interpretable electron density for both monomers in the asymmetric unit was present for the glycan attached to Asn22, which consists of two GlcNAc and one Fuc residue (for further details, see below). A fourth sugar residue displayed only weak electron density and was subsequently not built into the model. Arc5 consists of two polypeptides with slightly different amino acid sequences; 8 of the 240 residues differ between the two sequences. Since a glycan attached to Asn22 could be refined at full occupancy with low B factors in both monomers present in the asymmetric unit, and given the fact that only the polypeptide encoded by the arc5-I gene contains a potential glycosylation site at position 22, we can safely conclude that the crystal mainly consists of Arc5a. Hence, the arc5-I-encoded sequence was used to build the structure. The region that is involved in crystal packing contacts (Val36-Pro42) contains four residues that differ between the Arc5a and Arc5b sequences (Gly37, Ser38, Glu40, and Leu41 for Arc5a; Thr37, Pro38, Gly40, and Asp41 for Arc5b). This is probably the reason why the Arc5 crystal mainly contains Arc5a. The Arc5 and PHA-L amino acid sequences have an identity of about 55%. The root mean square difference between the positions of the superimposable C-α atoms in Arc5 and the PHA-L monomers is about 1.1 Å. The differences between the two structures are mainly located in loop regions (Asn111-Asn116, Lys78-Ile82, and Gly207-Thr212) and the N-terminal β-strand (see Fig. 2). Most notable is the deletion of eight residues in the metal binding loop (Phe127-Arg130), as described in detail below. The Arc5 monomer contains one disulfide bridge, between residues 146 and 182. These two residues link the sixth strand of the flat front sheet and the seventh strand of the curved back sheet. Although Arc5 has been reported to be a dimer in solution (15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the here described crystal structure of Arc5 suggested that it crystallized as a monomer; no symmetric dimer is present in the crystal. The contact surfaces between the possible dimers in the crystal are of comparable size, and all of them resemble typical crystal packing contact surfaces. Gel filtration indicated that arcelin-5 can exist both as a monomer or as a multimer, eluting at positions corresponding with a molecular mass of 25 or 77 kDa, respectively. The sample used for crystallization consisted of purified protein that had first been lyophilized and then resuspended in water. In this sample only the monomer form was present. This was also the case when the lyophilized protein was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline or in acetate buffer. In a crude extract (partially purified albumins (15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and in a purified fraction that had never been lyophilized before, the protein existed as a mixture of monomers and multimers. The range of quaternary structures of the legume lectin family is extremely broad, despite the similarity of the monomers; at present three types of tetramers are known (concanavalin A, peanut agglutinin, and PHA-L/soybean agglutinin) and three types of dimers (EcorL, GS4, and the group of canonical dimers, e.g. lentil lectin). The monomeric Arc5 structure brings the number of known quaternary structures to seven. The presence of glycans has been invoked to explain the different quaternary structures of GS4 (6Delbaere L.T.J. Vandonselaar M. Prasad L. Quail J.W. Nikrad P.V. Pearlstone J.R. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Spohr U. Lemieux R.U. Trans. ACA. 1989; 25: 65-76Google Scholar) and EcorL (7Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In any case, the positions of the three potential glycosylation sites do not exclude the possibility of canonical dimer formation in Arc5. Different arcelins have been reported to have different quaternary structures; arcelin-1d and arcelin-2 have been reported to be dimers, while arcelin-1t, arcelin-3, and arcelin-4 have been reported to be tetramers (34Hartweck L. Vogelzang R. Osborn T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The two canonical lectin dimers in the PHA-L structure pack together via intercalation of the side chains of the two top β-strands of the flat back sheet. This intercalation is possible because the side chains of the residues involved are small (one central Ile and two flanking Ser residues). In Arc5, PHA-L-like packing would be impossible, because one of the two Ser residues present in the PHA-L dimer-dimer interface (Ser186) has been replaced by Lys181. Strikingly, all of the known sequences of the arcelins reported to be dimers possess this Lys residue (arcelin-5, −2, and −1, assuming that the reported sequence of arcelin-1 (16Osborn T.C. Alexander D.C. Sun S.S.M. Cardona C. Bliss F.A. Science. 1988; 240: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) is the sequence of arcelin-1d), while in the sequence of arcelin-4, which has been reported to be a tetramer, this Lys residue has been replaced by an Ala residue. In addition, the arcelin-1 and −2 sequences also possess a His residue in the position of the Ile residue in PHA-L. The arc5-I-encoded protein contains three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn22, Asn70, and Asn79), while the arc5-II-encoded one contains only two (Asn70 and Asn79). Electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that Arc5a contains two glycans, Arc5b contains one, and Arc5c contains none (15Goossens A. Geremia R. Bauw G. Van Montagu M. Angenon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interpretable density was only observed for the glycan attached to Asn22 (see Fig. 3). Asn22 is located in the loop that connects the first β-strand of the front sheet and the second strand of the front sheet. As mentioned before, the fact that the glycan can be refined with full occupancy indicates that mainly the arc5-I-encoded protein is present in the crystal, since the arc5-II-encoded sequence does not possess this glycosylation site. Since Arc5a contains two glycans, the other glycan has to be invisible due to its inherent flexibility. No electron density whatsoever is found for the two other potential glycosylation sites, so it is impossible to say where the other glycan is attached. Of the glycans attached to Asn22, only the three core residues were sufficiently visible. The electron density of these three visible sugar residues (GlcNAcβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc) indicate that the glycan is of the fucosylated, complex type. The Fuc residue bound α1→3 to the N-linked GlcNAc residue is exclusively found in plant N-glycans. The same sugar type is also present in the GS4 (6Delbaere L.T.J. Vandonselaar M. Prasad L. Quail J.W. Nikrad P.V. Pearlstone J.R. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Spohr U. Lemieux R.U. Trans. ACA. 1989; 25: 65-76Google Scholar) and EcorL (7Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) structures. In the former structure, only the same three core residues as in the Arc5 structure are visible, while in the latter structure a further four residues could be built in (Manα1→6(Manα1→3)(Xylβ1→2)Man attached by a β1→4 bond to the GlcNAc residue of the core), because the flexibility of the glycan was hampered by fortunate crystal packing interactions. In Arc5, the two GlcNAc residues of the glycan make four hydrogen bonds with three protein residues (Asn22, Arg43, and Lys101). No protein-sugar interactions are present for the Fuc residue. The glycan makes five internal hydrogen bonds. The three sugar residues are in the expected 4C1 conformation. Manual superposition of the GlcNAcβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc core, which the glycans from GS4, EcorL, and Arc5 have in common, revealed that the conformations of the GS4 and the EcoRL cores are virtually identical, while the conformation of the Arc5 core differs somewhat from them. Bouwstra et al. (24Bouwstra J.B. Spoelstra E.C. De Waard P. Leeflang B. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) studied the conformational characteristics in solution of the glycan attached to bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme from pineapple stem, with 1H and 13C NMR. The studied glycan resembles the EcorL glycan; only the α1→3-bound Man residue is absent. The φ and ψ torsion angles for both glycosidic bonds of the three-residue core, which the glycans from Arc5, GS4, EcorL, and bromelain have in common, are shown in Table III. The ψ and φ torsion angles are defined as (C1-O-Cx-Hx) and (H1-C1-O-Cx), respectively, where x = 3 for Fucα1→3GlcNAc and x = 4 for GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc. The difference between the Arc5 glycan and the other glycans lies mainly in the conformation of the Fucα1→3GlcNAc glycosidic bond.Table IIIThe φ and Ψ torsion angles (φ/Ψ) of the GlcNAcβ1→4(Fucα1→3) GlcNAc core of the glycan moieties of GS4, EcorL, Arc5, and bromelain (the latter) determined by NMR measurements on the glycan in solutionGS4EcorLArc5BromelaindegreesFucα1→3GlcNAc30/1845/1948/1045/30GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc51/747/1134/350/10 Open table in a new tab The fact that only the core GlcNAcβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc moiety is observed in both Arc5 and GS4 may be due to the inherent rigidity of this moiety. Imberty et al. (25Imberty A. Gerber S. Tran V. Pérez S. Glycoconjugate J. 1990; 7: 27-54Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Imberty A. Delage M. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. Pérez S. Glycoconjugate J. 1991; 8: 456-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) studied the conformations of the different disaccharides present in glycans using molecular modeling and energy calculations. For each disaccharide, a conformational energy map in function of the φ and ψ values was calculated. For the GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc disaccharide, six low energy conformations were found (A1-A6) (25Imberty A. Gerber S. Tran V. Pérez S. Glycoconjugate J. 1990; 7: 27-54Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Plotting the φ/ψ pairs of Arc5, GS4, EcorL, and bromelain on the energy map reveals that the four conformations cluster closely around the reported A1 energy minimum. For the Fucα1→3GlcNAc disaccharide, only three energy minima were found L1-L3 (26Imberty A. Delage M. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. Pérez S. Glycoconjugate J. 1991; 8: 456-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In general, this disaccharide is conformationally more restricted then the GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc disaccharide. Again the φ/ψ pairs of the four glycans cluster around a reported energy minimum (L1). It can be concluded that the results about the GlcNAcβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc conformation obtained from NMR measurements in solution, molecular modeling, and x-ray crystallography are in close agreement with each other. One of the common features of the legume lectin family is the presence of a metal binding site, in which two metal ions are bound (one Ca2+ ion and one transition metal ion, usually treated in the x-ray structures as Mn2+). Each metal ion interacts with four residues (Glu122, Asp124, Leu126, Asn128, Asp132, and His137 in PHA-L) and two water molecules (see Fig. 4). The side chains of two Asp residues bridge the two bound metal ions (Asp124 and Asp132 in PHA-L). The bound Ca2+ ion interacts via a water molecule with the side chain oxygen and the main chain carbonyl group of a conserved Asp residue and thus stabilizes a cis-peptide bond between this Asp residue and an Ala residue (Ala85-Asp86 in PHA-L). The sugar binding capabilities of the legume lectins depend on the presence of this cis-peptide bond and thus on the presence of the bound metals (9Banerjee R. Mande S.C. Ganesh V. Das K. Dhanaraj V. Mahanta S.K. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In Arc5, five of the six conserved metal ligands are missing or not appropriate for metal ligation. One Ca2+-ligating Asn residue (Asn128 in PHA-L) and one bridging Asp residue (Asp132 in PHA-L) are both situated in a deleted region in Arc5 and are thus absent. The two Mn2+-ligating His and Glu residues (His137 and Glu122 in PHA-L) have been replaced by Arg130 and Val123 in Arc5, respectively. The second bridging Asp residue (Asp124 in PHA-L) has been replaced by Asn125 in Arc5, thereby removing the stabilizing negative charge. Indeed, no evidence for bound metal ions can be found in the electron density. In addition, the highly conserved Asp residue (Asp86 in PHA-L) involved in the cis-peptide bond is replaced by Tyr85 in Arc5. Therefore, it is very surprising that a cis-peptide bond is still present between the residues Ala85 and Tyr85, despite the absence of the two bound metal ions. The cis-peptide bond is stabilized by the stacking of the Tyr85 residue with the nearby Phe127 residue and two main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds: between Thr205 O and Tyr85 NH (2.87 Å in monomer 1, 2.78 Å in monomer 2) and between Gly207 NH and Ala84 O (3.21 Å in monomer 1, 3.12 Å in monomer 2), the former being clearly the stronger one. The two phenyl rings from Tyr85 and Phe127 are at an angle of approximately 50°. The Phe127 equivalent residues in the legume lectins are often involved in hydrophobic interactions with the bound sugar. Fig. 5 shows an |Fo− Fc| SA omit map calculated with the two residues involved in the cis-peptide bond, their two neighboring residues (Ser83 and Gly86), and the interacting amino acids (Thr205-Gly207 and Phe127) deleted. The electron density around the Tyr85 side chain and the Ala84-Tyr85 main chain atoms is clearly visible and unambiguous, proving the presence of this cis-peptide bond. cis-Peptide bonds are quite rare; in Stewart et al. (28Stewart D.E. Sarkar A. Wampler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), only 0.36% of all of the peptide bonds in the set of proteins studied were found to be cis. Interestingly, Tyr is the residue most often involved in X-Pro cis-peptide bonds; 19 of the 76 (25.0%) Tyr-Pro bonds studied in (28Stewart D.E. Sarkar A. Wampler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) are cis, followed by Ser-Pro (11.0%) and Phe-Pro (9.6%). Non-X-Pro cis-peptide bonds are even rarer; only 0.05% were found to be cis. These rare non-X-Pro cis-peptide bonds are often involved in catalysis or play some other important functional role (29Herzberg O. Moult J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As far as we know, this is the first report of an Ala-Tyr cis-peptide bond. At present, the mechanism behind the toxicity of the arcelins toward insects remains obscure. The fact that the Ala84-Tyr85 peptide bond is still in the cis position, despite the absence of a metal binding site and the low frequency of cis-peptide bonds in proteins, might point to a possible involvement of these residues in the mode of action of this protein. It is also striking that in all five known arcelin sequences (Arc1, Arc2, Arc4, and Arc5 from P. vulgaris and a fifth arcelin-like protein from Phaseolus acutifolius (27Mirkov T.E. Wahlstrom J.M. Hagiwara K. Finardi-Filho F. Kjemstrup S. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) the Ala residue followed by an aromatic residue (Phe in the case of Arc4; Tyr in the four other cases) is found. Concanavalin B (ConB), a seed protein from Canavalia ensiformis, and hevamine, a chitinase from Hevea brasiliensis, show an interesting and striking analogy to the situation of Arc5 and the legume lectins. Despite a high sequence identity (40%), hevamine is active as a chitinase, while ConB appears to lack any enzymatic activity, due to the replacement of a catalytic Glu residue by a Gln residue and the partial deletion of the substrate binding region (30Hennig M. Jansonius J.N. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Dijkstra B.W. Schlesier B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yet ConB still possesses two non-proline cis-peptide bonds (Ser34-Phe35 and Trp265-Asn266) that are a conserved feature of this family of chitinases. In hevamine, the residues equivalent to Phe35 and Trp265 in ConB (Phe32 and Trp255) are part of a hydrophobic cluster that is involved in substrate binding. It has therefore been suggested that these cis-peptide bonds play a role in some unknown function of the ConB protein (30Hennig M. Jansonius J.N. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Dijkstra B.W. Schlesier B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The structure of arcelin-5, a defense protein from P. vulgaris related to the legume lectin class, has been solved at a resolution of 2.7 Å. Arc5 crystallized as a monomer whose structure is similar to the structure of the legume lectin monomers, although the metal binding loop is deleted. One of the most striking features of this structure is the conservation of a cis-peptide bond that is found in all of the legume lectins, despite the absence of a major portion of the metal binding site that stabilizes this bond in the legume lectins. While this cis-peptide bond is always between an Ala and an Asp residue in the legume lectins, the Asp residue has been replaced by a Tyr residue in Arc5. Inspection of the five available arcelin sequences revealed that they all possess an Ala residue followed by an aromatic residue (Tyr or Phe). Given the fact that only 0.05% of all non X-Pro peptide bonds are cis (28Stewart D.E. Sarkar A. Wampler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and that these cis-peptide bonds often fulfill some functional role (29Herzberg O. Moult J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the conservation of this feature suggests that it could be involved in the (unknown) mode of action of the protein. We hope that the availability of this structure will stimulate further research on the precise mechanism behind the toxicity toward insects of this interesting protein."

Essentially full yield cross-linking between β+γ and β+ϵ, or between α+γ and α+ϵ, was obtained in these mutants by Cu2+-induced disulfide bond formation, thereby trapping the enzyme in states with the small subunits interacting either with β or α subunits. The presence of the Trp for β Tyr-331 in both mutants allowed direct measurement of nucleotide occupancy of catalytic sites.Before cross-linking, Mg2+ATP could be bound in all three catalytic sites in both mutants with a Kd of around 0.1 μM for the highest affinity site and Kd values of approximately 2 μM and 30-40 μM for the second and third sites, respectively. In the absence of Mg2+, ATP also bound in all three catalytic sites but with a single low affinity (above 100 μM) in both mutants. Cu2+-induced cross-linking of ECF1 from the mutant βY331W:E381C/ϵS108C had very little effect on nucleotide binding. The binding affinities of the three catalytic sites for Mg2+ATP were not significantly altered from those obtained before cross-linking, and the enzyme still switched between cooperative binding and equal binding affinities of the three catalytic sites (when Mg2+ was absent).When the γ and ϵ subunits were cross-linked to α subunits, ATP binding in the highest affinity catalytic site was dramatically altered. This site became closed so that nucleotide (ATP or ADP) that had been bound into it prior to cross-linking was trapped and could not exchange out. Also, ATP or ADP could not enter this site, although empty, once the enzyme had been cross-linked. Finally, cross-linking of the γ and ϵ to the α subunits prevented the switching between cooperative binding and the state where the three catalytic sites are equivalent. We argue that the conformation of the enzyme in which the small subunits are at α subunits occurs during functioning of the enzyme in the course of the rotation of γ and ϵ subunits within the α3β3 hexamer and that this may be the activated state for ATP synthesis.

INTRODUCTIONThe Escherichia coli F1 ATPase is composed of five different subunits, α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ, in the stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits are hexagonally arranged, alternating around a central cavity in which the γ subunit is located (2Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the α and β subunits is similar, each has three domains, an upper (with respect to the F0 part) β-sheet domain, a nucleotide binding domain of 9 β strands and 9 α helices, and a COOH-terminal domain which is made up of 7 α helices in the α subunits and 6 α helices in the β subunits (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). This C-terminal α-helical domain includes the so-called “DELSEED” region (residues 380-386 in the E. coli numbering system).The 2.8 Å structure of MF1 shows three segments of the γ subunit (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The part of the γ subunit within the ring of α and β subunits is arranged as two α helices, one contributed by the N-terminal part, the other by the C-terminal part of the polypeptide. Both stretch from within the α3β3 domain to contribute a part of the stalk that links the F1 part to the F0. A third shorter α helix of the γ subunit (residues 82-99 in the E. coli numbering system) lies below the α3β3 barrel. Attached at the bottom of the ECF1, and contributing to the stalk, is the ϵ subunit. This subunit interacts with the α3β3 domain at one end (5Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).There is an emerging consensus that the γ and ϵ subunits are able to rotate with respect to the α3β3 domain as first demonstrated in our cryoelectron microscopy studies (12Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and later by cross-linking (8Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X.

Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Such a rotation is a likely part of the catalytic cooperativity in which three sites alternate in hydrolyzing or synthesizing ATP (18Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1440: 215-250Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 19Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rotational movements of the γ and ϵ subunits can be blocked in a mutant βE381C:ϵS108C by CuCl2, which induces almost full yield cross-linking between one β subunit and the ϵ subunit (via Cys-381 of β and Cys-108 of ϵ) and a second β and the γ subunit (via Cys-381 of this β and the intrinsic Cys-89 of the γ subunit) (14Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20568-20574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effect of this cross-linking is to fully inhibit ATPase activity.Recently, a mutant αS411C:ϵS108C has been described, in which a Cys is introduced into the α subunit at the equivalent position to Cys-381 of the β subunit (14Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Under oxidizing conditions, there is cross-linking in this mutant between one α and the ϵ and a second α and the γ subunit, again with full inhibition of activity. The mutant αS411C:βE381C:ϵS108C has also been constructed. This mutant showed a nucleotide dependence of disulfide bond formation, with cross-linking of γ and ϵ to β subunits preferred when ADP is in catalytic sites, and cross-linking of the small subunits to α subunits, predominating with ATP bound. The combination of results from these different mutants suggests that the γ-ϵ domain rotates relative to the α3β3 domain in 60° steps, with the dwell time on α versus β subunits determined by nucleotide occupancy.In any rotational mechanism of catalysis, there should be a direct relationship between the interaction of the small subunits with the three α-β pairs and the nucleotide binding properties of their respective catalytic sites. We have recently used the mutant βE381C:ϵS108C to address this issue (21Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By laser-photoactivated reaction of [3H]-2-azido-ATP (+ Mg2+) to ECF1 1The abbreviations used are: ECF1soluble portion of the Escherichia coli F1F0 ATPaseDTTdithiothreitolMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidTNP·ATP2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine-5′-triphosphate. over a wide range of concentrations, we were able to relate nucleotide affinities to the interaction of γ and ϵ subunits with the different β subunits. The high affinity site for nucleotide was localized to that β subunit which fails to cross-link with γ or ϵ subunits in the mutant after Cu2+ treatment. The second site to be occupied by ATP was the β that cross-links to the ϵ subunit, and the lowest affinity site was on the β subunit that links to the γ subunit.To further explore the relationship between the positioning of the small subunits and the nucleotide-binding affinities, we have now conducted experiments in which ATP and ADP ± Mg2+ have been bound to mutants αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C and βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C both before and after cross-linking. In these experiments, advantage was taken of the introduced Trp-for-Tyr replacement in catalytic sites to monitor nucleotide binding (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSThe experiments described here exploit the two mutants of ECF1 ATPase, βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C (called here the βE381C mutant) and αS411C:βY331C:ϵS108C (αS411C mutant), respectively. Each contains sites for cross-linking (see later), along with the mutation βY331W, which allows nucleotide binding in catalytic sites to be followed by the fluorescence change of this introduced Trp residue (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the binding of ATP was measured in the βE381C mutant in the presence of Mg2+, three binding sites for ATP were observed, as shown in Fig. 1A, with the first and third sites differing in binding affinities by a factor of close to 500 (Table I). Fig. 1A also includes a titration of the fluorescence quenching on binding of ATP + Mg2+ to the αS411C mutant. There was binding of 3 mol of ATP/mol of ECF1 with affinities similar to those obtained with the mutant containing βE381C (Table I). The binding affinities of the three catalytic sites of the βE381C and αS411C mutants for ADP + Mg2+ are also listed in Table I. The same pattern of one high affinity site and two sites of lower, but equal affinity was obtained for both mutants.Table I.Binding of ligands to the ECF1 from the mutant βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C and αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C as determined by fluorescence signal of βW331LigandPreparationKd1Kd2Kd3μMMgATPβE381C mutant0.092.140.3MgATPβ-γ, β-ϵ X-linkedaX-linked, cross-linked.βE381C mutant0.26.950.8MgATPβ-γ, β-ϵ X-linked βE381C mutant after addition of MgATPcEnzyme was cross-linked in the presence or 2 mM ATP or ADP + 2 mM MgCl2 and subjected to 3 Sephadex centrifugation steps before the titration experiment.0.37.351.1MgADPβE381C mutant0.2421.521.5MgADPβ-γ, β-ϵ X-linked βE381C mutant0.3523.123.1MgADPβ-γ, β-ϵ X-linked βE381C mutant after addition of MgADP0.3823.523.5ATPbGrüber and Capaldi (21).βE381C mutant100.3100.3100.3ATPβ-γ, β-ϵ X-linked βE381C mutant130130130MgATPαS411C mutant0.051.433.1MgATPα-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant0.8118.3MgATPα-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant after addition of MgATP3.221.5MgATPα-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant0.7717.9MgATPα-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant after addition of MgATP3.020.1MgADPαS411C mutant0.1821.521.5MgADPα-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant17.117.1MgADPα-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant after addition of MgADP22.522.5ATPαS411C mutant80.580.580.5ATPα-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant1.146.5ATPα-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant after addition of MgATP6.855.1a X-linked, cross-linked.b Grüber and Capaldi (21Grüber G.

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Binding after Fixing the Conformation of the Enzyme by Cross-linkingIn addition to a Trp introduced into the catalytic site region, the two mutants each have Cys residues incorporated. The mutation βE381C places a Cys in the so-called DELSEED region of the β subunit. The mutation αS411C introduces a Cys at the equivalent position to βE381 within the α subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, CuCl2 treatment induces high yield cross-linking by disulfide bond formation in the βE381C mutant between one β and the γ subunit (involving the Cys at 381 and intrinsic γ Cys-87), and a second β and the ϵ subunit (β Cys-381 and Cys-108 of ϵ). CuCl2 treatment, in turn, causes cross-linking of one α to the γ and a second to the ϵ subunit in the αS411C mutant. In both mutants, there is cross-linking between an α and the δ subunit, which has no effect on activity (14Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), is highly nucleotide dependent. However, at the concentration of CuCl2 used here, along with the time of cross-linking chosen, there was an essentially full yield of all cross-linked products under any of the nucleotide conditions chosen. This disulfide bond formation caused full inhibition of ATPase activity, which was completely recovered on addition of DTT (result not shown).Fig. 2CuCl2 induced cross-linking of the ECF1 from the mutant βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C, and αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C. 0.2 mg ATPase from the mutant βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C (lanes 1 and 2), and αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C (lanes 3-6), respectively, in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v) were supplemented with 2 mM MgCl2+ 2 mM ATP. After 10 min at room temperature, 10 μM (lane 4) or 100 μM of CuCl2 (lanes 2, 5, and 6) were added and incubation carried out for 2 h. The control containing no CuCl2 is shown in lanes 1 and 3. 30 μg of enzyme were applied per lane after addition of DTT-free dissociation buffer (lanes 1-5) or after incubation of 20 mM DTT for 10 min (lane 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A titration of the fluorescence quenching on binding ATP + Mg2+ to the βE381C mutant after first treating the enzyme with CuCl2 to form the β-γ and β-ϵ cross-linked products is shown in Fig. 1A. It can be seen from these plots, and by the Kd values for the three binding sites (Table I), that the interaction of ATP + Mg2+ after cross-linking is very similar to that of non-cross-linked enzyme. In addition, the binding affinities of the three catalytic sites in the βE381C mutant for ADP + Mg2+ were not affected by prior cross-linking (Table I).A titration of the fluorescence quenching on binding of ATP + Mg2+ to the αS411C mutant is shown in Fig. 1B. With this mutant, ATP binding to enzyme cross-linked prior to titration with nucleotides was very different from that obtained with untreated enzyme. As shown, there was binding of only 2 mol of ATP in the presence of Mg2+, with binding affinities in the range for the second and third sites obtained with non-cross-linked enzyme from this mutant. The highest affinity site is apparently missing. The same was true on binding of ADP + Mg2+, 2 mol of ADP only could be bound and with binding affinities much lower than expected for the high affinity site (Table I). As shown in Table I, enzyme, in which the α-ϵ cross-link alone had been created by using CuCl2 concentrations and times of incubation in which disulfide bond formation between α and γ was very slow, gave the identical results to those obtained with enzyme in which both α-ϵ and α-γ cross-linked products were present.Trapping of ATP in the Tight Site in the αS411C MutantFor the experiments described so far, enzyme was freed of tightly bound nucleotide by two Sephadex centrifuge columns prior to cross-linking and subsequent titration with ATP. In another set of experiments, cross-linking was induced by CuCl2 addition to enzyme in the presence of ATP + Mg2+. Fig. 3A shows the fluorescence spectrum of the αS411C mutant, which had been cross-linked in the presence of ATP + Mg2+ and then unbound nucleotide removed by three successive Sephadex centrifuge column steps (curve 2). For comparison, a spectrum of enzyme freed of catalytic site nucleotide (curve 1) and of mutant after binding of three moles of ATP (curve 3) are shown. These results indicate that one ATP molecule has been trapped in the enzyme by the cross-linking reaction. ADP could be similarly trapped on one catalytic site when the experiment was repeated with ADP + Mg2+. A titration curve of the fluorescence quenching of the αS411C mutant with trapped nucleotide is presented in Fig. 1B. It can be seen that there was binding of an additional 2 mol of ATP, with binding affinities in the range for the second and third sites, but with values somewhat higher than for enzyme in which the catalytic sites were all empty at the beginning (Table I).Fig. 3Binding of nucleotides to the ECF1 from the mutant αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C.

The reference cell contained 500 μl of buffer (MOPS, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) and the sample cell contained 100 nM ECF1 from the mutant αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C in the same buffer. Equal concentrations of TNP·ATP were added to both cells, and absorbance at 420 and 395 nm was measured alternately. The average of five spectra was taken. Curve 1, ECF1 from the mutant αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C before addition of TNP·ATP; curve 2, after addition of 0.1 mM TNP·ATP to the sample and to the reference, respectively; curve 3, after cross-linking in the presence of 0.1 mM TNP·ATP and then three consecutive Sephadex centrifuge column steps. C, effect of MgATP on the absorbance spectra of the αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C mutant, in which TNP·ATP had been trapped by cross-link reaction. Absorbance spectra were recorded as described for B.

In this way, any trapped nucleotide could be identified directly by its intrinsic fluorescence. Fig. 3B compares the difference absorbance spectra of (i) the αS411C mutant without additions (curve 1), (ii) enzyme after binding 3 mol of TNP·ATP (based on a titration curve and measurement of three binding affinities as indicated in Table II (curve 2), and (iii) enzyme cross-linked after TNP·ATP addition followed by three successive Sephadex centrifuge column steps to remove loosely bound nucleotide (curve 3). Clearly, TNP·ATP remained tightly bound in a catalytic site when enzyme was cross-linked with the substrate analogue present, under conditions where it is removed from non-cross-linked enzyme. Fig. 3C shows the effect of adding 10 mM ATP to enzyme in which TNP·ATP had been trapped by the cross-linking reaction. TNP·ATP remained bound in the catalytic site with no exchange with this very large excess of substrate (curve 1) until the cross-link was broken by DTT (curve 2).Table II.Binding parameters of TNP · ATP in the ECF1 from the mutant βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C and αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108CPreparationKd1Kd2Kd3μMαS411C mutant0.0060.081.5α-γ, α-ϵ X-linkedaX-linked, cross-linked.αS411C mutant0.052.2α-γ, α-ϵ X-linked αS411C mutant after addition of MgTNP · ATP0.312.9βE381C mutant0.0080.091.9β-γ, β-ϵ X-linked βE381C mutant0.030.343.1β-γ, β-ϵ X-linked βE381C mutant after addition of MgTNP · ATP0.0330.373.2a X-linked, cross-linked.

Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), have shown that the three catalytic sites behave identically in ATP + EDTA, and have the same low binding affinities for ATP of around 100 μM. As shown in Fig. 4, the βE381C mutant can switch between a cooperative state (with Mg2+) and a state in which the catalytic sites have identical low affinities (no Mg2+) even after cross-linking (Table I). This is not the case with the αS411C mutant. Before cross-linking, ATP binds to this mutant in the absence of Mg2+ (EDTA present) in three sites each with binding affinity around 80 μM (Table I). After cross-linking in the absence of nucleotide, only two catalytic sites could be occupied by either ADP or ATP, and the titration curves of this binding showed the same cooperative state of the protein independent of whether Mg2+ or EDTA were present (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of EDTA on the binding of ATP to the cross-linked Y331W:βE381C:ϵS108C and αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C mutants. ECF1 (100 nM) was titrated with ATP in the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA in a buffer containing 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol (v/v).

With a Cys in the α subunit at position 411 (the equivalent position to Glu-381 of β) and with a Cys at position 108 of the ϵ subunit, a second state or conformation of ECF1 has been obtained where γ and ϵ subunits are each covalently linked to a different α subunit. The population of these two states is nucleotide-dependent (14Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). With uncleaved ATP present, the γ and ϵ subunits are predominantly linked to α subunits while, with ADP in catalytic sites, these small subunits link to, and must reside close to, β subunits. These two states represent a rotation of the γ and ϵ subunits with respect to the α3β3 domain of around 60°. Inasmuch as the positioning of the small subunits closer to α subunits is favored by binding of ATP, this state can be considered a high energy state which occurs transiently during the cooperative switching of the γ and ϵ subunits from interactions with one β subunit (or α-β pair) to another.The results presented here show that when the small subunits are positioned next to α subunits, as after cross-linking of the αS411C mutant, the high affinity catalytic site is closed. Nucleotide (ATP or ADP) cannot get into this site, nor can nucleotide bound in the site before cross-linking get out. This is not the case for enzyme in which the γ and ϵ subunits are located at the β subunits by cross-linking of the βE381C mutant. Then, nucleotides bind with high affinity, but all three sites can be emptied by column centrifugation after cross-linking.There is evidence that the functioning of the F1 ATPase is affected by nucleotide occupancy of noncatalytic sites (28Milgrom Y.M. Ehler L.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18725-18728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Allison W.S. Jault J.M. Zhuo S. Paik S.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (but see Wise and Senior (30Wise J.G. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). Rotation of the γ and ϵ subunits away from β subunits to interact with α subunits might be expected to alter the binding affinities of the noncatalytic sites that are located predominantly on α subunits (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). This has not been examined in the present work but could be studied with a mutant incorporating Cys residues for cross-linking, as here, along with the αR365W mutation described by Weber et al. (31Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that monitors selective nucleotide binding into noncatalytic sites.During normal functioning via an alternating site mechanism, the high affinity catalytic site would be occupied by nucleotide at all times. Under conditions for ATP synthesis, this site would contain ADP + Pi (+Mg2+). We suggest that uptake of protons during proton translocation shifts the γ and ϵ subunits to switch their interactions from β to α subunits, generating the closed state of the high affinity catalytic site and thereby favoring the synthesis of ATP. Release of the translocated proton(s) would then relax the enzyme state by switching the small subunits back to the β subunits, with concomitant release of the newly synthesized ATP.It is interesting that covalent cross-linking of the γ and ϵ subunits to β subunits does not prevent the enzyme from switching between a cooperative binding of nucleotides, when Mg2+ is present, and the equivalency of binding observed in the absence of Mg2+. This contrasts with the results obtained after linkage of γ and ϵ to the α subunits, which locks the enzyme in its cooperative nucleotide binding mode.The high resolution structure of MF1 shows three different conformations of the catalytic sites (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), one closed, one partly open, and one fully open, as expected for the cooperative state. This structural data suggests that opening and closing of catalytic sites involves rotation of the C-terminal domain relative to the catalytic domain. In the absence of Mg2+, when the catalytic sites are equivalent and of low affinity for nucleotides (21Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11261-11268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presumably all are open. The results presented here indicate that rotational movements of the C-terminal domains of the β subunit as a part of the opening and closing of catalytic sites can occur without release of attached γ and ϵ subunits. The implication is that these domain movements of β subunits alter the interaction between and/or conformations of the γ and ϵ subunits, as expected if these small subunits of the stalk are the conduit for conformational coupling within the ATP synthase. INTRODUCTIONThe Escherichia coli F1 ATPase is composed of five different subunits, α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ, in the stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits are hexagonally arranged, alternating around a central cavity in which the γ subunit is located (2Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the α and β subunits is similar, each has three domains, an upper (with respect to the F0 part) β-sheet domain, a nucleotide binding domain of 9 β strands and 9 α helices, and a COOH-terminal domain which is made up of 7 α helices in the α subunits and 6 α helices in the β subunits (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). This C-terminal α-helical domain includes the so-called “DELSEED” region (residues 380-386 in the E. coli numbering system).The 2.8 Å structure of MF1 shows three segments of the γ subunit (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The part of the γ subunit within the ring of α and β subunits is arranged as two α helices, one contributed by the N-terminal part, the other by the C-terminal part of the polypeptide. Both stretch from within the α3β3 domain to contribute a part of the stalk that links the F1 part to the F0. A third shorter α helix of the γ subunit (residues 82-99 in the E. coli numbering system) lies below the α3β3 barrel. Attached at the bottom of the ECF1, and contributing to the stalk, is the ϵ subunit. This subunit interacts with the α3β3 domain at one end (5Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).There is an emerging consensus that the γ and ϵ subunits are able to rotate with respect to the α3β3 domain as first demonstrated in our cryoelectron microscopy studies (12Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and later by cross-linking (8Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X.

Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Such a rotation is a likely part of the catalytic cooperativity in which three sites alternate in hydrolyzing or synthesizing ATP (18Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1440: 215-250Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 19Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rotational movements of the γ and ϵ subunits can be blocked in a mutant βE381C:ϵS108C by CuCl2, which induces almost full yield cross-linking between one β subunit and the ϵ subunit (via Cys-381 of β and Cys-108 of ϵ) and a second β and the γ subunit (via Cys-381 of this β and the intrinsic Cys-89 of the γ subunit) (14Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20568-20574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effect of this cross-linking is to fully inhibit ATPase activity.Recently, a mutant αS411C:ϵS108C has been described, in which a Cys is introduced into the α subunit at the equivalent position to Cys-381 of the β subunit (14Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Under oxidizing conditions, there is cross-linking in this mutant between one α and the ϵ and a second α and the γ subunit, again with full inhibition of activity. The mutant αS411C:βE381C:ϵS108C has also been constructed. This mutant showed a nucleotide dependence of disulfide bond formation, with cross-linking of γ and ϵ to β subunits preferred when ADP is in catalytic sites, and cross-linking of the small subunits to α subunits, predominating with ATP bound. The combination of results from these different mutants suggests that the γ-ϵ domain rotates relative to the α3β3 domain in 60° steps, with the dwell time on α versus β subunits determined by nucleotide occupancy.In any rotational mechanism of catalysis, there should be a direct relationship between the interaction of the small subunits with the three α-β pairs and the nucleotide binding properties of their respective catalytic sites. We have recently used the mutant βE381C:ϵS108C to address this issue (21Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By laser-photoactivated reaction of [3H]-2-azido-ATP (+ Mg2+) to ECF1 1The abbreviations used are: ECF1soluble portion of the Escherichia coli F1F0 ATPaseDTTdithiothreitolMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidTNP·ATP2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine-5′-triphosphate. over a wide range of concentrations, we were able to relate nucleotide affinities to the interaction of γ and ϵ subunits with the different β subunits. The high affinity site for nucleotide was localized to that β subunit which fails to cross-link with γ or ϵ subunits in the mutant after Cu2+ treatment. The second site to be occupied by ATP was the β that cross-links to the ϵ subunit, and the lowest affinity site was on the β subunit that links to the γ subunit.To further explore the relationship between the positioning of the small subunits and the nucleotide-binding affinities, we have now conducted experiments in which ATP and ADP ± Mg2+ have been bound to mutants αS411C:βY331W:ϵS108C and βY331W:βE381C:ϵS108C both before and after cross-linking. In these experiments, advantage was taken of the introduced Trp-for-Tyr replacement in catalytic sites to monitor nucleotide binding (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J.

https://openalex.org/W1991713145,"In vitro transcription, DNase I footprinting, and abortive initiation assays were used to characterize transcription using mutant forms of sigma 54 shown previously to bypass certain enhancer requirements in vitro. The holoenzymes containing these sigma mutants produce low levels of open complexes at both the glnAp2 and glnHp2 promoters. The open complexes are unusual in that they are destroyed by heparin. Enhancer protein and ATP convert them into a stable heparin-resistant state. The enhancer response occurs over a similar range of NtrC concentration as occurs with the wild-type holoenzyme, indicating that the activation determinants have been largely preserved within these mutants. One-round transcription assays show that the mutant holoenzymes can be driven to transcribe both promoters without NtrC. The unstable opening induced by these mutations apparently serves as a conduit that can shuttle templates into transcriptionally competent complexes. The results lead to a model in which activation occurs in two steps. First, the enhancer complex overcomes an inhibitory effect of the sigma 54 leucine patch and unlocks the melting activity of the holoenzyme. Second, different sigma 54 determinants are used to drive stabilization of the open complexes, allowing the full transcription potential to be realized.

Sigma 54 is necessary for transcribing a class of bacterial genes that depend on activators (such as NtrC/NRI) that bind and function from remote DNA sites (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kustu S. North A.K. Weiss D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 397-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 2Magasanik B. J. Cell.

These activator-binding sites can be moved to various locations and retain function, allowing them to be termed bacterial enhancers (see Ref. 3Reitzer L.J. Movsas B. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5512-5522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This class of promoters is distinct from the promoters used by the sigma 70 family of proteins, which generally include at least one nearby regulatory DNA site (4Collado-Vides J. Magasanik B. Gralla J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 371-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gralla J.D. Cell. 1991; 66: 415-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the promoter classes are clearly distinct, sigma 54 and sigma 70 use the same RNA polymerase core for transcription. Thus, sigma 54 is thought to alter the holoenzyme so as to confer on the polymerase the property of enhancer responsiveness (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is facilitated by the unique amino acid sequence of sigma 54, which is unrelated to that of any other sigma factor (7Merrick M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). By contrast, all other sigma factors constitute a family of sequence-related proteins that form holoenzymes that do not respond to distant enhancers. The mechanism by which the sigma 54 holoenzyme responds to enhancer-binding proteins has been studied in detail. One major aspect of the response that differs strongly from transcription by the sigma 70 family of proteins is an energy requirement. Thus, the activator must hydrolyze ATP and transfer this energy to the remainder of the transcription complex in order for the polymerase to function (8Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Weiss D.S. Batut J. Klose K.E. Keener J. Kustu S. Cell. 1991; 67: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Prior to physiological activation, the inactive form of the holoenzyme can be bound to DNA, but cannot begin RNA synthesis (10Ninfa A.J. Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. 1987; 50: 1039-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) because the transcription start site is not melted (11Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S. Science. 1989; 243: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the activation event, activator-dependent ATP hydrolysis drives DNA melting and thus converts the inactive closed complex to an active open complex. As the enhancer sites are not directly adjacent to the promoter, the intervening DNA is looped out to enable the activator protein to contact the polymerase (13Su W. Porter S. Kustu S. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5504-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because the RNA core polymerase that participates in this mechanism is the same one used to transcribe sigma 70-dependent promoters, it appears that this unique mechanism is imposed by association with sigma 54, i.e. the sigma 70 form of polymerase neither responds to enhancers nor needs ATP hydrolysis to melt promoter DNA (reviewed in Refs. 5Gralla J.D. Cell. 1991; 66: 415-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 14Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Recently, mutant forms of sigma 54 were isolated that can still associate with polymerase and direct its binding to DNA but that cause the polymerase to behave more like the sigma 70 holoenzyme in transcription (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mutations allow the polymerase to transcribe the glnAp2 promoter in vitro without the need for enhancer protein. The mutant holoenzymes can also transcribe without the need for hydrolysis of the β-γ bond of ATP. Our prior study (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) indicated that changes within a short leucine-rich region of sigma 54 were important for allowing these energy and enhancer requirements to be bypassed in vitro. Two mutant forms of sigma 54 were studied, the double leucine mutant LS2633 and the triple leucine mutant HRS456 (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neither mutant requires ATP or the activator NtrC for transcription in vitro. Both mutant proteins allow the polymerase to catalyze detectable levels of glnAp2 promoter melting in the absence of enhancer protein and ATP. As assayed by permanganate probing, these levels are fairly low, 15% or less of what is attainable in a fully activated (presence of NtrC and ATP) wild-type complex. The combination of the enhancer-binding protein NtrC and ATP stimulates the low permanganate signal of the mutant holoenzymes, bringing it closer to the fully activated level. The properties of these mutants should provide a substantial basis for learning how sigma 54 confers on polymerase the need for and ability to use enhancers and ATP. One complication relates to prior studies showing that some leucines in the region play a positive role in allowing sigma 54 to direct formation of closed complexes that fully use the −12 element of the glnAp2 promoter (15Hsieh M. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another complication is that the mutations also lie within a region that has been proposed to allow the positive response to enhancers, and it is not known if the changes alter the ability to respond properly. It is also necessary to further understand the relationship between the observed low levels of melting and the higher levels of in vitro transcription. In this report, we investigate these and other issues by expanding the range of assays used to study these two mutant forms of sigma 54. These include direct assays for the formation of certain critical intermediate complexes along the transcription pathway: DNase footprinting assays for closed and open complexes and an abortive initiation assay for the extent to which the mutant holoenzymes can make the first mRNA bond. In addition, the ability of the mutant holoenzymes to transcribe the glnHp2 promoter was assayed to assess whether the mutants could function on the large class of sigma 54 promoters that depend on the DNA-bending protein integration host factor (IHF) 1The abbreviations used are: IHFintegration host factor.

The results suggest an expanded model for the action of activators and for the role of the sigma 54 leucine patch in this process. integration host factor. Plasmid pYS1 (pGEM-3 vector; Promega) contains the glnA regulatory region and downstream coding region derived from pLR1 (3Reitzer L.J. Movsas B. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5512-5522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was used for DNase I footprinting by primer extension procedures (20Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 146-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTH8 (21Hunt T.P. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used for transcription and differs from pYS1 only in the downstream sequence. Plasmid pFC50 (16Claverie-Martin F. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1631-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) contains the glnH regulatory and promoter regions. All were obtained from B. Magasanik (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). NtrC was purified as described (22Moore J.B. Shiau S.P. Reitzer L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2692-2701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as was wild-type sigma 54 (23Popham D. Keener J. Kustu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19510-19518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HRS456 and LS2633 forms of sigma 54 were found in inclusion bodies, and therefore, the purification was modified. One liter of cells grown in LB medium (for the induction method and expression vector, see Ref. 24Schauder B. Blocker H. Frank R. McCarthy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was collected and disrupted in a French press. The insoluble fraction was dissolved in 100 ml of 4 M guanidine HCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). The soluble material was then dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B with 1 M guanidine HCl and then against 2 liters of buffer B alone. It was then chromatographed on a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (1.5 × 15 cm; Sigma) and eluted with a 0.2-0.8 M KCl linear gradient in buffer B (200-ml total volume eluting at 1 ml/min). The mutant proteins eluted at ~0.5 M KCl. The peak fractions (identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and concentrated by precipitation with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, dissolved in 1-2 ml of buffer B + 10 mM MgCl2, and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer B + 10 mM MgCl2. The sample was then loaded onto a 1.5 × 10-cm heparin-agarose column (Sigma). The protein appeared in the flow-through fraction, and fractions were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At this point, the protein was estimated to be >90% pure. In some experiments, the pooled fractions were concentrated again with ammonium sulfate and chromatographed on a Mono-Q FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with a gradient of 0.2-0.8 M KCl. The peak fractions, as detected by UV at A280 and checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate and dialyzed in buffer B with 40% glycerol + 10 mM MgCl2 for storage. The concentration of the sigma 54 proteins was determined at A280 (1 A280 = 1.26 mg/ml as estimated from amino acid sequence). The mutant proteins have a tendency to be inactivated at 37°C possibly due to aggregation, and so all procedures avoided lengthy preincubations. The concentrations of all proteins are nominal in that they are calculated from the absorbance. The reactions were similar to those described by Tintut et al. (25Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24392-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 20-μl reactions contained a 5 nM concentration of either supercoiled DNA template pTH8 (glnAp2) or linear template pFC50 (glnHp2). When pFC50 was used, 100 nM IHF was included in the reaction and GpU was used in place of UpA as dinucleotide primer. Other components included in the reaction were 100 nM NtrC (except when stated otherwise), 10 mM carbamyl phosphate (Ref. 26Feng J. Atkinson M.R. McCleary W. Stock J.B. Wanner B.L. Ninfa A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6061-6070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Sigma), 100 nM sigma 54, 36 nM Escherichia coli RNA core polymerase (1 unit; Epicentre Technologies Corp., Madison, WI), 4 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dinucleotide (UpA; Sigma), 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (DuPont NEN), and 50 μM unlabeled CTP in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 ng of bovine serum albumin, and 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. All components were assembled on ice, and after the addition of labeled CTP, the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. For the heparin challenge reactions, the unlabeled CTP (25 μM) was present for the first 10 min of incubation, followed by heparin (25 μg/ml for 2 min). Labeled CTP (4 μCi + 25 μM unlabeled CTP) was added for the last 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of urea-saturated formamide mixture (95% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). The products were separated on a 20% urea-polyacrylamide gel (19:1 monoacylamide:bisacylamide) and then visualized and quantitated by direct phosphorimaging. 20-μl reactions contained 200 ng of supercoiled DNA template pYS1 bearing the glnAp2 promoter, 200 nM NtrC, 10 mM carbamyl phosphate, 200 nM sigma 54, 4 units of E. coli RNA core polymerase, and 4 mM ATP in the same buffer as used in the abortive initiation assay. All components were assembled on ice and then incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The remaining procedure was as described by Tintut et al. (25Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24392-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of 0.5 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) in 25 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MgCl2, and 1.2 × 10−4 N HCl was added for 30-40 s. The reaction was quenched with 40 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, + 2 μl of 0.5 M EDTA; extracted with 100 μl of phenol + 100 μl of chloroform; and heated to 90°C for 3 min. The aqueous phase was removed and passed through a Sephadex G-50 packed 1-cc syringe spin column equilibrated in water. 32P-End-labeled oligonucleotide primer GlnD4 (5′-TCAGTACGTGTTCAGCGG-3′) was added and extended with Taq polymerase enzyme (Promega) in a thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc.) for 35 cycles. The extension product was separated by urea-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Supercoiled pTH8 was used for glnAp2 transcription, and pFC50 linearized with EcoRI was used for glnHp2 transcription. The reaction conditions were as described for abortive initiation, except that 0.5 mM each ATP and GTP and 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP + 50 μM unlabeled CTP were added (note UTP was omitted). The sequence of the glnAp2 template will enable the polymerase to elongate to position +20, where the first U is encountered. For the glnHp2 promoter, the dinucleotide GpU was added (position +2 is U), allowing ATP, GTP, CTP, and GpU to direct elongation to position +13. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 10 min, and then 0.5 mM UTP and 25 μg/ml heparin were added to the reaction. The reaction was incubated 10 min further and was then quenched by the addition of urea-saturated formamide dye. The mixtures were electrophoresed on a 6% urea gel. The run-off transcript was then analyzed by phosphoimaging. RNA polymerase holoenzymes containing sigma 54 mutants HRS456 and LS2633 were studied previously under conditions where activator was absent (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Permanganate probing indicated that the mutations could trigger detectable but low levels of open DNA at the glnAp2 promoter start site. The amount of melting was thought to be <15% of the activated wild type, but the accuracy of this value was limited by the nature of the technique. The mutations allowed higher levels of heparin-resistant transcription to be achieved, but only using a preincubation with nucleotides to allow a short RNA chain to form. The results suggested that the mutations allowed the holoenzyme to form open complexes with DNA, but that these might be unstable and in equilibrium with closed complexes. In this experiment, we use a quantitative abortive initiation assay to test and expand these ideas. Abortive initiation has been used to quantify the extent of open complex formation at promoters (27Carpousis A. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Dayton C.J. Prosen D.E. Parker K.L. Cech C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1616-1621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6381-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and has been applied previously using holoenzyme containing wild-type sigma 54 and the activator NtrC (23Popham D. Keener J. Kustu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19510-19518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24392-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The glnAp2 promoter start site sequence is UACGG (positions −1 to +4). When the UpA dinucleotide and radioactive CTP are the only sources of ribonucleotide (dATP is present to support ATPase activity), the wild-type holoenzyme reiteratively synthesizes the trinucleotide UAC. As a control, Fig. 1 confirms that large amounts of this product form (see Ref. 25Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24392-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) when the activator NtrC is included in the reaction (lane 1). When NtrC is not included, only a very low signal is seen (lane 4). This low signal is primarily due to nonspecific activity of the core polymerase (data not shown). When the holoenzymes containing sigma mutants are assayed without NtrC, they show detectable levels of the same abortive initiation product (Fig. 1, lane 5 for HRS456 and lane 6 for LS2633). These levels are significantly higher than the low background signal seen for wild-type sigma without NtrC (lane 4). The data were analyzed using a PhosphorImager and normalized, taking the signal from the wild type with NtrC as 100% (lane 1). After subtracting the background signal of lane 4, the results show 11-12% signals for the two mutants (lanes 5 and 6). The 11-12% signal seen in these experiments is in good agreement with levels of promoter opening estimated from prior permanganate footprinting studies of these same mutant polymerases (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Those prior studies also showed that the mutant holoenzymes could still respond to NtrC to yield greater levels of start site opening. This is also reflected in the abortive initiation assay, where strongly enhanced signals are observed in the presence of NtrC: HRS456 shows a signal comparable to that of the wild type (lane 2), and the LS2633 signal is increased to 65% (lane 3). We suggested previously that the open complexes formed by these mutants might be unstable, i.e. in dynamic equilibrium with closed complexes (6Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M.L. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test this directly, the abortive initiation reactions were allowed to proceed as described above for half the reaction time (10 min). At this time, heparin (25 μg/ml) was added for 2 min, followed by [α-32P]CTP for another 10 min. Any heparin-resistant complexes can then produce radioactive abortive initiation product during the final 10 min of reaction. Fig. 2 shows that the open complexes formed by the HRS456 holoenzyme in the absence of the enhancer complex are largely heparin-sensitive (compare lanes 4 and 6 with heparin with lanes 3 and 5 without heparin). Heparin reduces the signal to close to background levels (lanes 7 and 8 without sigma), and quantitation indicates that at least 80% of the complexes are destroyed by heparin. Neither ATP alone nor NtrC alone can increase the signal significantly or induce resistance to heparin (lanes 4 and 6). By contrast, when NtrC and ATP are added together, the complexes that form are largely resistant to heparin (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2). Quantitation shows that now only 25% of the complexes are destroyed by heparin. Even this 25% is likely an overestimate of the actual heparin sensitivity because the initial 10-min incubation is probably not long enough to allow all the complexes to reach the open complex stage. Overall, the heparin experiments indicate that open complexes formed by the HRS456 holoenzyme alone are likely in rapid equilibrium with heparin-sensitive closed complexes; NtrC and ATP enhance the stability of the open complexes, leading to heparin resistance. Next, we use this protocol and an NtrC titration (10Ninfa A.J. Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. 1987; 50: 1039-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) to determine whether the mutant holoenzymes respond to the presence of activator in the same manner as does the wild type. The amount of abortive product observed for the wild type increases up to 100 nM NtrC (Fig. 3, filled circles). For the mutants, the curves originate at slightly elevated levels, reflecting their ability to catalyze some amount of abortive initiation in the absence of NtrC. Both curves rise roughly over the same range of NtrC concentrations as does the wild-type curve. This indicates that there are no strong defects in the ability of the mutant holoenzymes to respond to activator. However, the maximum level attainable by mutant LS2633 is only about two-thirds that of the wild type. This suggests that there is a defect in the ability of LS2633 to form open complexes that cannot be fully overcome by the addition of activator. The HRS456 and LS2633 sigma mutants have been studied previously in vivo (15Hsieh M. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental context was in a background containing activator and overexpressed levels of sigma. In vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting indicated that mutant LS2633 (and to a lesser extent, mutant HRS456) had certain defects compared with the wild type. Transcription levels were lower, and especially for LS2633, promoter recognition was impaired. We now use DNase I footprinting to assess promoter binding by the mutant holoenzymes in vitro. At the glnAp2 promoter, DNase I footprinting can distinguish closed and open complexes by the extent of downstream protection (12Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S. Science. 1989; 243: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 30Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Closed complexes can form without activator and ATP and protect an ~35-base pair segment upstream of the start site. This is confirmed for the wild type in Fig. 4A (lane 5, where the upstream protection is evident, compared with lane 8, which lacks polymerase). When NtrC and ATP are added, the protection extends farther downstream, as confirmed in Fig. 4A (lane 2). When HRS456 and LS2633 polymerases were footprinted without activator, both mutants showed partial protection patterns. In both cases, the partial protection was restricted to the upstream region of the promoter (Fig. 4A, lane 6 for HRS456 and lane 7 for LS2633; both compared with template alone in lane 8). Thus, the predominant type of complex formed by the two mutant holoenzymes is similar to the complex that forms when wild-type polymerase forms a closed complex. The experiment also shows that the mutants form weaker closed complexes than does the wild type as the degree of protection in either of lanes 6 and 7 is less than that shown by the wild type in lane 5. Although not fully evident in the exposure shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of protection by LS2633 (lane 7) is significantly less than that seen using HRS456 polymerase (lane 6). In the presence of NtrC and ATP, the HRS456 polymerase protection strengthens in the upstream region and extends into the downstream region (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The result confirms that open complexes have formed and that they have protection patterns similar to those formed by activated wild-type polymerase. The protection is somewhat weaker than that of wild-type polymerase (compare lanes 2 and 3). For LS2633, the footprinting pattern seen in the presence of NtrC and ATP (lane 4) is essentially that of an open complex, but with clearly reduced occupancy. The partial protection is fairly uniform over both the upstream and downstream regions (compare lane 4 with lanes 1 and 8 (controls)). By comparison with lane 7, the effect of NtrC and ATP is to extend the partial protection into the downstream region and to slightly increase the overall extent of protection. These footprinting results lead to several conclusions. First, the mutant holoenzymes form closed and open complexes that cover the same regions as the wild type. Second, the mutants form mostly closed complexes without activator and ATP and mostly open complexes with these components. Third, the mutants show modest defects in promoter occupancy, especially LS2633, consistent with results of in vivo footprinting (15Hsieh M. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another observation from the DNase I footprinting is that NtrC and ATP not only increase the downstream protection of HRS456 polymerase, but also increase the overall protection of the promoter. There have been prior suggestions that activators might have a secondary function independent of triggering the transition between closed and open complexes by the sigma 54 holoenzyme. In these “recruitment” models, activators can assist the holoenzyme to form closed complexes more readily (see Ref. 31Buck M. Cannon W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The model cannot be tested easily using typical footprinting conditions because they are such that closed complexes already form fairly efficiently in the absence of NtrC on the glnAP2 promoter. Thus, any recruitment effect of NtrC will be difficult to detect. To avoid this problem and to allow assessment of the recruitment model in this system, we established conditions that decrease the efficiency of HRS456 closed complex formation. This involves increased ionic strength (100 mM KCl instead of 10 mM KCl). Under these conditions, closed complex protection by the HRS456 holoenzyme (Fig. 4B, lane 3) is weak. By contrast, the wild-type holoenzyme still forms closed complexes fairly well (lane 4). Both of these results pertain in the absence of activation. When NtrC, but not ATP, is included during formation of HRS456 closed complexes, there is no increase in protection (compare lanes 1 and 3; inclusion of ATP yields a normal open complex protection pattern in both case (data not shown)). We infer that NtrC alone cannot significantly recruit RNA polymerase into closed complexes at the glnAp2 promoter. The above results indicate that when either mutant holoenzyme is reacted with the glnAP2 promoter, an equilibrium mixture of mostly closed and some open complexes forms, along with some unoccupied DNA. We adapted a one-round transcription protocol (10Ninfa"
https://openalex.org/W2052481314,"Reaction of H2O2 with ferric leghemoglobin (metLb, the monomeric, oxygen-carrying, heme protein from root nodules of nitrogen-fixing plants) has been previously shown to generate an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) species and at least one protein radical. The latter has been suggested to be a tyrosine-derived phenoxyl radical present at Tyr-133 in the soybean protein and Tyr-138 in the lupin protein. To obtain further information on these protein radicals and their potential interaction with the physiologically important peribacteroid membrane (which surrounds the microsymbiont in vivo), EPR spin trapping studies have been carried out with soybean metLb.Evidence has been obtained for at least two additional protein-derived radicals in addition to the phenoxyl radical; these radicals are transient and reactive in nature. These species are carbon-centered, and at least one is a tertiary species (·CR1R2R3); these radicals may be side chain- or α-carbon-derived, their exact sites have not been determined. Some of these radicals are on the protein surface and may be key intermediates in the formation of protein dimers.These radicals have been shown to be capable of reacting with peribacteroid membrane fractions, with the consequent generation of lipid-derived radicals. The formation of such radicals may result in the depletion of membrane antioxidants and the initiation of lipid peroxidation. This transfer of damage from the heme center via the protein surface to neighboring membranes may be of considerable biological significance; the destruction of this membrane is one of the earliest observable events in root nodule senescence and is associated with the loss of nitrogen-fixing activity. Reaction of H2O2 with ferric leghemoglobin (metLb, the monomeric, oxygen-carrying, heme protein from root nodules of nitrogen-fixing plants) has been previously shown to generate an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) species and at least one protein radical. The latter has been suggested to be a tyrosine-derived phenoxyl radical present at Tyr-133 in the soybean protein and Tyr-138 in the lupin protein. To obtain further information on these protein radicals and their potential interaction with the physiologically important peribacteroid membrane (which surrounds the microsymbiont in vivo), EPR spin trapping studies have been carried out with soybean metLb. Evidence has been obtained for at least two additional protein-derived radicals in addition to the phenoxyl radical; these radicals are transient and reactive in nature. These species are carbon-centered, and at least one is a tertiary species (·CR1R2R3); these radicals may be side chain- or α-carbon-derived, their exact sites have not been determined. Some of these radicals are on the protein surface and may be key intermediates in the formation of protein dimers. These radicals have been shown to be capable of reacting with peribacteroid membrane fractions, with the consequent generation of lipid-derived radicals. The formation of such radicals may result in the depletion of membrane antioxidants and the initiation of lipid peroxidation. This transfer of damage from the heme center via the protein surface to neighboring membranes may be of considerable biological significance; the destruction of this membrane is one of the earliest observable events in root nodule senescence and is associated with the loss of nitrogen-fixing activity."

INTRODUCTIONThe cytochrome P450 monooxygenases catalyze biotransformation reactions involving both endogenous and exogenous substrates (1Conney A.H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1967; 19: 317-366PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gillette J.R. Mitchell J.R. Brodie B.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1974; 14: 271-288Crossref Google Scholar). One of the members of the cytochrome P450 family, CYP1A1, 1The abbreviations used are: CYP1A1cytochrome P4501A1PAHpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonB[a]Pbenzo[a]pyreneGNMTglycine N-methyltransferaseMEMminimal essential medium. is responsible for the the bioactivation of PAHs such as B[a]P to metabolites that may play a role in environmental carcinogenesis (3Nebert D.W. Woodhead A.D. Bender M.A. Leonard R.C. Genes Encoding Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Possible Role in Human Disease. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 45-64Google Scholar). The expression of CYP1A1 is significantly elevated in the livers of rats that have been exposed to PAHs such as 3-methylcholanthrene and B[a]P. Evidence exists that such induction may be facilitated at least in part through a cytosolic receptor, the 4 S PAH-binding protein (4Tierney B. Weaver D. Heintz N. Schaeffer W. Bresnick E. Arch.

The 4 S protein specifically binds certain PAHs with high affinity and in a saturable manner (4Tierney B. Weaver D. Heintz N. Schaeffer W. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem.

Schaeffer W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the 4 S protein in cultured rat liver cells is positively correlated with the extent of induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (13Heintz N.H. Tierney B. Bresnick E. Schaeffer W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic 4 S protein has recently been identified as glycine N-methyl transferase (GNMT) (14Raha A. Wagner C. MacDonald R.G. Bresnick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5750-5756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of sarcosine from S-adenosylmethionine and glycine and serves as a folate carrier as well. It has also been demonstrated that the cytosolic 4 S PAH-binding protein serves as a transcriptional activator of CYP1A1 expression (15Raha A. Gusky S. Joyce T. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the 4 S protein belongs to a class of substances that exhibit multiple functions, as an enzyme and as an activator of transcription.The activity of many factors is modulated by posttranscriptional events, with phosphorylation representing a major mechanism for regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells (16Bohmann D. Cancer Cells (Cold Spring Harbor). 1990; 2: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jackson S.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Almost every eukaryotic transcription factor analyzed in detail has been shown to undergo phosphorylation. The state of phosphorylation of a number of transcription factors, including yeast GAL4 (18Mylin L.M. Johnston M. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4623-4629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HSF (19Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), STE 12 (20Song O. Dolan J.W. Yuan Y.O. Fields S. Genes Dev. 1990; 5: 741-750Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and mammalian Sp1 (21Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and Oct-2 (22Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) has been correlated with the extent of their activation. In many cases, however, the functional consequence of such phosphorylation, if any, remains largely unknown.Phosphorylation may affect gene regulation in a number of ways. Phosphorylation may increase the affinity of the trans-activation domain for a component of the basal transcriptional machinery or for a protein that mediates its interaction with the initiation complex (23Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may repress gene activity by causing the dissociation of the activation domain from an inhibitory protein. It has been suggested that cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation inactivates ADR-1 by preventing its ability to interact with the general transcriptional machinery while bound to DNA (24Taylor W.E. Young E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The involvement of phosphorylation in trans-repression of c-fos has been suggested (25Lucibello F.C. Lowag C. Neuberg M. Muller R. Cell. 1989; 59: 999-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Gius D. Cao X. Rauscher F.J. Cohen D.R. Curran T. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4243-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may affect the specificity of binding of the transcription factors to their targets (27Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar).A computer search performed on the primary amino acid sequence of the 4 S protein did indicate some sites for potential posttranslational modification, which could have biological significance. Putative phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II in the 4 S protein exist at threonines 68 and 83 and at serines 147 and 250. The serine at position 88 of the 4 S protein may serve as a substrate for protein kinase C. It has already been shown that GNMT is an excellent substrate for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in an in vitro phosphorylating system (28Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results in an increase of 2-fold in enzyme activity. However, it is not known whether phosphorylation has any measurable effect on the PAH binding activity of the 4 S protein. Here, we report that the depletion of ATP in intact cells dephosphorylated the protein by ~25%, caused a loss in ligand binding activity, and retarded its nuclear import; restoration of cellular ATP levels reversed these events.DISCUSSIONPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons specifically bind to the 4 S protein, and the ligand-bound “receptor” translocates into the nucleus, wherein it modulates CYP1A1 expression as a trans-activator (15Raha A. Gusky S. Joyce T. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 4 S protein, like a number of other proteins, fulfills multiple functions within tissues. It may: (a) catalyze sarcosine formation from glycine and S-adenosylmethionine, fulfilling its enzymatic role as a methyltransferase (33Ogawa H. Fujioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3447-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) serve as a folate carrier (34Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); and (c) bind PAHs such as B[a]P in a traditional ligand-receptor manner (14Raha A. Wagner C. MacDonald R.G. Bresnick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5750-5756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in carrying out a transcriptional activation mission. However, the enzymatic and activator functions are conducted by different subunit configurations. Methyltransferase activity requires the tetramerization of the protomeric 33-kDa subunit (34Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas the role of a transcriptional activator requires either the dimeric or monomeric form (14Raha A. Wagner C. MacDonald R.G. Bresnick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5750-5756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the tetramer is inactive in this regard. Consequently, the conversion of monomer (or dimer) to tetramer is important in determining the function of the resultant molecule.In this article, we have shown that ATP depletion partly dephosphorylates the 4 S protein, which affects its interaction with B[a]P. Addition of ATP to the reaction mixtures containing dephosphorylated 4 S protein and [3H]B[a]P did not restore the binding activity of the protein. This observation indicates that ATP possibly acts through the phosphorylation of the 4 S protein. One possible explanation for selective dephosphorylation is that the phosphates at those sites turn over more rapidly than at moieties at other sites and thus are more rapidly lost in ATP-depleted cells. Alternatively, this dephosphorylation may also be the result of activation of specific phosphatases in ATP-depleted cells. The use of sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol as ATP-depleting agents in eukaryotic cells is widely reported (31Mendel D.B. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Nature. 1986; 324: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Mendel D.B. Orti E. Smith L.I. Bodwell J. Munck A. Sato G.H. Stevens J.L. Molecular Endocrinology and Steroid Harmone Action.

Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fischbeck K.H. Exp. Neurol. 1984; 83: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor, azide treatment of the host cells selectively dephosphorylates serines 220 and 234 (37Hu L. Bodwell J. Hu J. Orti E. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased binding activity of the immunopurified 4 S protein from azide-treated cells eliminates the involvement of the nonspecific effects of azide treatment. Reverse effects of staurosporin, a protein phosphorylation inhibitor, and okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase on the B[a]P binding of the 4 S protein, reinforce the involvement of phosphorylation in the ligand-receptor interaction. Dephosphorylation of the purified 4 S protein from the rat liver by alkaline phosphatase treatment and its effect on the B[a]P binding also indicates the involvement of the phosphorylation in regulating the activity of this receptor. The process of rephosphorylation of the 4 S protein appears to occur quickly in the H4IIE cells, since introduction of glucose into the medium resulted in a rapid restoration of the ATP level to the formation of phosphorylated protein and to the recovery of B[a]P binding activity, all within 30 min.Furthermore, the reduction in intracellular ATP exerts a marked effect on the cytosol-to-nucleus trafficking. Entry into the nucleus is blocked under these conditions. As ATP depletion decreases the ligand binding by approximately 60%, whereas nuclear transport is completely inhibited, this block in the nuclear transport may be partly the result of decreased binding of the dephosphorylated protein and/or of the involvement of ATP in some energy-dependent translocation of the ligand and receptor from the cytosol to the nucleus. Alternatively, unknown phosphorylation events participating in other cellular processes may be involved in the regulation of ligand-receptor trafficking from the cytosol to the nucleus. Phosphorylation-dependent redistribution of receptors between the cytosolic and nuclear compartments has been reported previously. Modification of either the protein itself or a cytoplasmic anchor protein would allow energy-dependent translocation through the nuclear pore complex (39Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of the T antigen, phosphorylation of serines 111 and 112 by casein kinase II accelerated nuclear import (40Rhis H.P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been reported that stimulus-dependent phosphorylation may cause the nuclear translocation and therefore activation of transcriptional factors such as NF-AT (41Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), NFIL-6 (42Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and ISGF3 (43Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 44Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Fux X.Y. Levy D.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulus-dependent translocation (and activation) of the protein kinases themselves into the nucleus, wherein phosphorylation of certain factors would then occur, has been reported to regulate activity of those transcriptional proactivators that are normally resident in this compartment (45Nigg E.A. Hitz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 46Chen R.H. Sarnechi C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cytosolic receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor, also participate in an ATP-dependent cycle that involves phosphorylation (37Hu L. Bodwell J. Hu J. Orti E. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These hormone receptors exist in a phosphorylated state in the absence of ligand but can be hyperphosphorylated in the presence of the specific hormone or agonist (47Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9728-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation took place on predominantly serine moieties, although some threonines were also involved (48Bodwell J. Orti E. Coull J.M. Pappins D.J.C. Smith L.I. Swift F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7549-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites were found predominantly in the N-terminal domain.It is of interest that the enzymatic function of GNMT is also enhanced by phosphorylation in vitro with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (28Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that phosphorylation must occur at the tetramer level as well. Whether the phosphorylation of the tetramer is accompanied by a translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus is not yet known. Furthermore, it is not known whether the phosphorylation of the tetramer occurs at the same site(s) as the modification of the monomer or dimer. It is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of the monomer (or dimer), as affects PAH transport, or of the tetramer, which may influence enzymatic activity, is required for the flow of traffic from the cytosol to the nucleus. However, interaction of the protein with B[a]P may occur at the level of the tetramer, which then stimulates disaggregation to either the monomer or dimer state, i.e. the transcriptional activator state, or may take place at the monomer or dimer form, which then prevents oligomerization to the tetramer. In either case, the rate-limiting factor in transcriptional activation of CYP1A1 expression is not the amount of protein per se but the concentration of the monomer (or dimer), which appears to be dependent on the concentration of B[a]P.In addition to the ease of interaction with other regulatory proteins, the extent of dimerization, and subcellular localization, the posttranslational phosphorylation of the 4 S protein may also affect its stability or the extent of DNA binding, all of which could influence the overall transcriptional activation property of this and other trans-factors (49Bohmann D. Cell. 1990; 21: 337-343Google Scholar). In the case of c-jun, phosphorylation at one set of sites negatively regulated the interaction with DNA, whereas modification at another sequence increased the trans-activation (50Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 51Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation may also influence the biological property of the protein by inducing allosteric changes as well as electrostatic repulsion, both of which had been reported previously with other regulators (52Sprang S.R.

Which sites in the 4 S protein are phosphorylated, what effect phosphorylation and ligand interaction have on the state of oligomerization, and how phosphorylation stimulates translocation and the subsequent interaction with responsive genes remain to be established. INTRODUCTIONThe cytochrome P450 monooxygenases catalyze biotransformation reactions involving both endogenous and exogenous substrates (1Conney A.H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1967; 19: 317-366PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gillette J.R. Mitchell J.R. Brodie B.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1974; 14: 271-288Crossref Google Scholar). One of the members of the cytochrome P450 family, CYP1A1, 1The abbreviations used are: CYP1A1cytochrome P4501A1PAHpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonB[a]Pbenzo[a]pyreneGNMTglycine N-methyltransferaseMEMminimal essential medium. is responsible for the the bioactivation of PAHs such as B[a]P to metabolites that may play a role in environmental carcinogenesis (3Nebert D.W. Woodhead A.D. Bender M.A. Leonard R.C. Genes Encoding Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Possible Role in Human Disease. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 45-64Google Scholar). The expression of CYP1A1 is significantly elevated in the livers of rats that have been exposed to PAHs such as 3-methylcholanthrene and B[a]P. Evidence exists that such induction may be facilitated at least in part through a cytosolic receptor, the 4 S PAH-binding protein (4Tierney B. Weaver D. Heintz N. Schaeffer W. Bresnick E. Arch.

The 4 S protein specifically binds certain PAHs with high affinity and in a saturable manner (4Tierney B. Weaver D. Heintz N. Schaeffer W. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem.

Schaeffer W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the 4 S protein in cultured rat liver cells is positively correlated with the extent of induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (13Heintz N.H. Tierney B. Bresnick E. Schaeffer W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic 4 S protein has recently been identified as glycine N-methyl transferase (GNMT) (14Raha A. Wagner C. MacDonald R.G. Bresnick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5750-5756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of sarcosine from S-adenosylmethionine and glycine and serves as a folate carrier as well. It has also been demonstrated that the cytosolic 4 S PAH-binding protein serves as a transcriptional activator of CYP1A1 expression (15Raha A. Gusky S. Joyce T. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the 4 S protein belongs to a class of substances that exhibit multiple functions, as an enzyme and as an activator of transcription.The activity of many factors is modulated by posttranscriptional events, with phosphorylation representing a major mechanism for regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells (16Bohmann D. Cancer Cells (Cold Spring Harbor). 1990; 2: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jackson S.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Almost every eukaryotic transcription factor analyzed in detail has been shown to undergo phosphorylation. The state of phosphorylation of a number of transcription factors, including yeast GAL4 (18Mylin L.M. Johnston M. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4623-4629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HSF (19Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), STE 12 (20Song O. Dolan J.W. Yuan Y.O. Fields S. Genes Dev. 1990; 5: 741-750Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and mammalian Sp1 (21Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and Oct-2 (22Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) has been correlated with the extent of their activation. In many cases, however, the functional consequence of such phosphorylation, if any, remains largely unknown.Phosphorylation may affect gene regulation in a number of ways. Phosphorylation may increase the affinity of the trans-activation domain for a component of the basal transcriptional machinery or for a protein that mediates its interaction with the initiation complex (23Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may repress gene activity by causing the dissociation of the activation domain from an inhibitory protein. It has been suggested that cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation inactivates ADR-1 by preventing its ability to interact with the general transcriptional machinery while bound to DNA (24Taylor W.E. Young E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The involvement of phosphorylation in trans-repression of c-fos has been suggested (25Lucibello F.C. Lowag C. Neuberg M. Muller R. Cell. 1989; 59: 999-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Gius D. Cao X. Rauscher F.J. Cohen D.R. Curran T. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4243-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may affect the specificity of binding of the transcription factors to their targets (27Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar).A computer search performed on the primary amino acid sequence of the 4 S protein did indicate some sites for potential posttranslational modification, which could have biological significance. Putative phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II in the 4 S protein exist at threonines 68 and 83 and at serines 147 and 250. The serine at position 88 of the 4 S protein may serve as a substrate for protein kinase C. It has already been shown that GNMT is an excellent substrate for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in an in vitro phosphorylating system (28Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results in an increase of 2-fold in enzyme activity. However, it is not known whether phosphorylation has any measurable effect on the PAH binding activity of the 4 S protein. Here, we report that the depletion of ATP in intact cells dephosphorylated the protein by ~25%, caused a loss in ligand binding activity, and retarded its nuclear import; restoration of cellular ATP levels reversed these events.

HsORC1, a recently identified human protein related to yeast Orc1p and Cdc6p/Cdc18p, may be a component of the replication initiation complex in human cells. We have independently isolated the gene for HsORC1 and begun to address its function in eukaryotic DNA replication and its relationship to Cdc18p. Although HsORC1 failed to rescue the temperature-sensitive S. pombe cdc18-K46 strain, overexpression in a wild-type strain led to continuous DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis. Deletion mutagenesis identified a short N-terminal region of HsORC1 that contains potential phosphorylation sites for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) as being sufficient to induce re-replication. In addition, we found that HsORC1 is an efficient substrate for CDKs in vitro. We propose that perturbation of the re-replication control by overexpression of HsORC1 is due to a titration of components involved in inactivating Cdc18p upon initiation of replication.

DNA replication is thought to initiate at discrete sites within the genome, termed replication origins. Replication origins have been localized within autonomously replicating sequence elements in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Yeast replication origins exist in two chromatin states during the cell cycle that correspond with the binding of two different protein complexes (7Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Post-replicative complexes generate a genomic footprint pattern similar to purified ORC in vitro. Pre-replicative complexes are characterized by an additional region of protection which appears near the end of mitosis and persists through G1. It has recently been shown that the establishment of these pre-replicative complexes requires Cdc6p (8Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), a protein whose role in DNA replication was previously inferred from genetic and biochemical studies. In addition, Cdc6p has been shown to directly interact with the purified ORC (9Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It appears that the cell cycle-regulated interaction of Cdc6p with ORC sets replication origins into the pre-replicative state. Cdc6p and its homolog in S. pombe, Cdc18p, are not only required for initiation of DNA replication in their cognate organisms, but overexpression of these proteins in fission yeast has been found to be sufficient to induce continuous DNA replication in the absence of mitosis (10Muzi-Falconi M.

Although the biochemical details of this phenomenon are not fully understood at present, the current data suggest that these potent activators of replication are subject to tight control in the normal cell cycle.

For the initial characterization of HsORC1, we used S. pombe as a simple eukaryotic organism that has recently been successfully used to study the role of individual proteins in initiation and re-replication control (2Leatherwood J. Lopez-Girona A. Russell P. Nature. 1996; 379: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Muzi-Falconi M. Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we demonstrate that overexpression of HsORC1 in fission yeast causes a re-replication phenotype similar to Cdc18p overexpression, indicating a common regulatory mechanism of these proteins. A 2.5-kb HsORC1 cDNA was isolated from a HeLa UNI-ZAP XR phage cDNA library (Stratagene) screened with a 0.9-kb EcoRI/NotI restriction fragment containing the partially sequenced human cDNA clone 121313 which was obtained from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. The 670 nucleotides lacking at the 5′-end of the HeLa cDNA clone were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Marathon-Ready human spleen cDNA purchased from Clontech. The full-length sequence was submitted to the NCBI GenBank™ data base (accession number U43416). All yeast and mammalian expression plasmids containing the coding region of the HsORC1 cDNA were engineered by PCR. For expression in S. pombe, derivatives of the pREP3X and pREP41X plasmid were constructed which allowed transcription of cDNA inserts under the control of the thiamin-repressible nmt1 promoter. The pREP3X backbone vector was modified to encode the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to which the various cDNA inserts were fused at their 5′ ends. Two point mutations (S65T, V163A) were introduced into GFP by site-directed mutagenesis. An N-terminal c-Myc tag was introduced into the expression plasmid pcDNA3 which was used to express HsORC1 in mammalian cells. For the production of the bacterially expressed GST fusion protein, HsORC1 was cloned into pGEX4T3. S. pombe strains used for overexpression of HsORC1 and cdc18 were all derived from the wild-type strain 972 h−. The h− cdc18K46 was crossed with a h+ leu1-32 strain in order to generate the cdc18K46 leu1-32 strain. Cells were grown at 25°C or 30°C in EMM supplemented with adenine and uracil. Cells were transformed with the lithium acetate method according to Moreno et al. (18Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected for leucine prototrophy on EMM plates devoid of leucine. Thiamin was added to a final concentration of 20 μM to suppress expression from the nmt1 promoter. To induce expression, cells growing in liquid culture were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with deionized water, and resuspended in supplemented EMM lacking thiamin. For flow cytometry, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed, digested with RNase A, and stained with propidium iodide at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum on 18-mm coverslips and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (19Heald R. McLoughlin M. McKeon F. Cell. 1993; 74: 463-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). 15-18 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence staining with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 as described (19Heald R. McLoughlin M. McKeon F. Cell. 1993; 74: 463-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Slides were viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV confocal laser scanning microscope. Expression of cyclins and CDKs in BHK cells and kinase assays was performed as described (19Heald R. McLoughlin M. McKeon F. Cell. 1993; 74: 463-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The GST-HsORC1 fusion protein was expressed in BL21 pLysS and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described in detail (20Jackson P.K. Chevalier S. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A homology search in the NCBI dbEST data base revealed a human cDNA fragment with homology to Orc1p, Cdc6p, and Cdc18p, which was used to isolate a full-length cDNA. The gene identified turned out to be identical to a cDNA that was recently isolated by Stillman and colleagues and named HsORC1 (6Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consistent with the size of the full-length cDNA, a 3.2-kb HsORC1 message was detected in many human tissues, with highest levels found in the thymus, testes, and small intestine (Fig. 1A). HsORC1 displays an overall amino acid identity of approximately 20% with Orc1p, which increases to 40% in a C-terminal domain between residues 503 and 735 (Fig. 1B). This domain also exhibits 28% and 25% identity with Cdc18p and Cdc6p, respectively, and 19% identity with Sir3p, a protein involved in transcriptional silencing (21Ivy J.M. Klar A.J. Hicks J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 688-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further examination of the HsORC1 sequence shows two peptide motifs (G537VPGTGKT and D620E(I/L)D) common to nucleotide-binding proteins (22Walker J.E. Saraste M.J. Runswick J.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) that are conserved in Orc1p, Cdc18p, and Cdc6p (Fig. 1B). In addition, three motifs are present in the N terminus that fit the (S/T)PX(K/R) consensus sequence for CDK phosphorylation sites. To determine the subcellular localization of HsORC1, we expressed a c-Myc epitope-tagged construct in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Staining with a monoclonal c-Myc antibody revealed a distinct nuclear pattern characterized by a fine array of detergent-resistant foci which are excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 1C). This highly organized pattern suggests a tight and non-random association of HsORC1 with the nuclear chromatin similar to proteins present at sites of DNA replication (23Bravo R. Macdonald-Bravo H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24Nakamura H. Morita T. Masaki S. Yoshida S. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 151: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Given the structural similarities between HsORC1 and Cdc18p, we investigated whether HsORC1 could complement a temperature-sensitive allele of cdc18. Full-length HsORC1 and two fragments encoding either the conserved C-terminal domain or the N terminus were expressed in the temperature-sensitive cdc18-K46 strain. As shown in Fig. 2, HsORC1 was unable to suppress the lethality of the cdc18-K46 strain maintained at 36.5°C, irrespective of whether it was expressed at low levels from a pRep41 plasmid (Fig. 2A) or at higher levels from a pRep3 plasmid (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the cdc18 control plasmids showed complementing activity, although expression from the weaker pRep41 plasmid proved to be more effective than expression from pRep3. Even at the permissive temperature (25°C), strains transformed by the pRep3.cdc18 construct grew more slowly than strains carrying the vector alone or those expressing lower levels of Cdc18p from the pRep41 plasmid. Similarly, strains producing high amounts of HsORC1 formed smaller colonies at 25°C compared to those expressing low amounts. These results demonstrate that HsORC1 cannot functionally replace cdc18 in fission yeast, but rather appears to compromise cell growth when expressed at high levels. To explore the inhibitory effect of HsORC1 overexpression on S. pombe cell growth in greater detail, the pREP3 plasmids described above were modified to yield fusions with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). De-repression of the nmt1 promoter resulted in bright nuclear fluorescence in the GFP-HsORC1 transformant (Fig. 3A), while nonfused GFP localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (data not shown). Cells expressing GFP-HsORC1 at high levels became progressively elongated and, like cells expressing Cdc18p, showed a time-dependent decrease in septation indicating a block of entry into mitosis (Fig. 3B). The elongation phenotype of the HsORC1-transformed strains was accompanied by a dramatic increase in nuclear diameter (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometry revealed that these enlarged nuclei reflected an increase in DNA content (Fig. 3C) that was prevented by the addition of hydroxyurea and did not occur in cells arrested in G2 by overexpression of the catalytic domain of the human Wee1-like kinase (data not shown). This suggests that the increased DNA content is the consequence of a direct effect of HsORC1 overexpression on chromosomal DNA replication, rather than an indirect consequence of a cell cycle block. To delineate the region of HsORC1 responsible for re-replication, we overexpressed various deletion mutants in S. pombe. As summarized in Fig. 3D, the N-terminal region between residues 247 and 502 of HsORC1 was required and sufficient for re-replication. Notably, this region does not show any obvious relationship to Cdc18p in primary structure, nor is it capable of rescuing the cdc18 temperature-sensitive allele (Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, all of the three potential CDK phosphorylation sites of HsORC1 are contained within this region. Surprisingly, the C-terminal region (residues 503-861) conserved among HsORC1 and Cdc18p had no apparent effect on cell division or DNA replication. Despite the inability of HsORC1 to rescue a temperature-sensitive cdc18 allele, the overexpression phenotypes of HsORC1 and Cdc18p are remarkably similar (10, 11 and Fig. 3C). While these findings are consistent with the structural analyses indicating that HsORC1 is the human homolog of Orc1p, we have noticed that CDC6, which is generally regarded the cdc18 homolog of budding yeast, also failed to rescue cdc18-K46.2 It is therefore possible that this class of proteins provides unique interfaces for interaction with other proteins that are only functional in the context of their cognate organisms. Regardless, from these data it appears likely that perturbation of the re-replication control by overexpression of HsORC1 is not a reflection of its normal replication function in human cells but rather may indicate saturation of an inactivation mechanism common to HsORC1 and Cdc18p. A number of recent studies has pointed to a role for the Cdc2p kinase as a negative regulator of components of the replication initiation complex in S. pombe. For example, treatments that result in the inactivation of the Cdc2p/Cdc13p complex have been shown to break the normal dependence of DNA replication on mitosis resulting in re-replication (16Moreno S. Nurse P. Nature. 1994; 367: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 17Hayles J. Fisher D. Woolard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Significantly, a common feature shared by HsORC1 and Cdc6p/Cdc18p is the presence of multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for CDKs. It is therefore possible that excessive availability of these replication components efficiently competes for Cdc2 activity that normally serves to inactivate endogenous replication complexes and to induce mitosis. Consistently, overexpression of Cdc18p has been found to cause decreased Cdc2p activity along with re-replication. Inhibition of Cdc2p under these circumstances may simply reflect the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint by favoring the unscheduled generation or maintenance of replication structures. Alternatively, inhibition of Cdc2p activity resulting from titration may be the cause rather than the consequence of the re-replication phenomenon. We therefore tested whether bacterially purified GST-HsORC1 could serve as an in vitro substrate of mammalian CDKs. BHK cells were transfected with various combinations of HA-tagged cyclins A or B and with CDK2 or CDC2. Kinase assays performed on anti-HA precipitates from lysates of transfected cells using histone H1 as a substrate showed strong activity of cyclin A/CDK2 and cyclin B/CDC2, while lysates prepared from cells transfected with either cyclin alone showed no activity above background (Fig. 4). Using the same cyclin/CDK precipitates, we found that, compared to H1, GST-HsORC1 served as a more efficient substrate for cyclin A/CDK2 than cyclin B/CDC2 in vitro. As to what may be the function of CDKs in regulating replication complexes is unclear. One attractive model predicts that key components of the replication complex become efficiently phosphorylated at low CDK activity during the initiation step, thereby marking the origin as already used. An alternative model suggests that CDK-mediated modification may target replication components for degradation. Immediate support for such a model has been provided recently by the finding that Rum1p-mediated inhibition of Cdc2p coincides with re-replication and the accumulation of Cdc18p by interference with its proteolysis (25Jallepalli P.V. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, HsORC1 overexpression may cause re-replication by competing for Cdc2p activity which could target Cdc18p for degradation. Interestingly, budding yeast mutants defective in proteolytic pathways have recently been found to re-replicate their DNA (26Heichman K.A. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to other re-replication states, these strains maintain high CDK activity, which could indicate that the proteolytic mechanism acts downstream of CDK-dependent inactivation steps. It is therefore also possible that excessive amounts of HsORC1 compete directly for components of the Cdc18p inactivation mechanism independently of CDKs. Current mutagenesis experiments aim at distinguishing between these possibilities. We thank the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory I.M.A.G.E. Consortium for providing the EST plasmid and S. Reed for the CDK2 expression plasmid. We are indebted to T. Enoch and members of her laboratory for providing plasmids, strains, and help with the genetic manipulation of fission yeast. We are also grateful to P. Jackson for help with the bacterial expression of HsORC1 and discussion.

The proximal region was localized by deletion studies and stable transfections in the Fao cells to the sequence −553/−398. This region includes the glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) A sequence, which consists of two overlapping GREs and which can mediate the glucocorticoid regulation of a heterologous promoter. DNase I footprinting studies have shown that a site 80 base pairs upstream of the GRE A was protected by liver and brain nuclear extracts (site P8). The binding was displaced by an excess of an oligonucleotide containing a typical NF1 binding site and by NF1-specific antibodies. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the P8 oligonucleotide as a probe, several complexes were formed. Most complexes were common to liver and brain but were less abundant when testis extracts were used. At least one complex was specific to the liver. All complexes, with the exception of two, were competed for by the NF1 oligonucleotide. Furthermore, the sequence of the P8 site showed a 7/9-base pair homology with a typical NF1 site. A mutation of the P8 site, which prevents the binding of NF1-like proteins to it, considerably decreases the regulation of the cAspAT promoter fragment by glucocorticoids. Surprisingly, the basal activity of the mutant promoter was increased 2-fold. Thus, the regulation of the cAspAT gene promoter is mediated by a regulatory unit comprising the GRE A and a NF1 binding site."

In order to explore such a possibility, we looked for changes in the linking number of plasmid pBR322 caused by H1 binding, using assays that involve nicking and resealing of DNA strands. Two types of enzymes were used, eukaryotic topoisomerase I and prokaryotic DNA ligase. The results revealed that H1 binding causes unwinding of the DNA, with the unwinding angle being approximately 10°. The globular domain of histone H1 is also capable of unwinding DNA, but to a lesser degree."
