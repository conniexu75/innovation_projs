https://openalex.org/W1976926859,"The eruptions of El Chich√≥n volcano on 28 March and 3 and 4 April 1982 were observed by the Nimbus 7 total ozone mapping spectrometer due to strong absorption by volcanic gases at the shortest wavelengths of the spectrometer (312.5 and 317.5 nanometers). These ultraviolet pictures permit a measurement of the volume, dispersion, and drift of volcanic gas clouds. The tropospheric clouds were rapidly dispersed in westerly winds while persistent stratospheric clouds drifted in easterly winds at speeds up to 13 meters per second. The spectral reflectance is consistent with sulfur dioxide absorption and rules out carbon disulfide as a major constituent. A preliminary estimate of the mass of sulfur dioxide deposited in the stratosphere by the large eruptions on 3 and 4 April is 3.3 x 10(6) tons. Prior estimates of volcanic cloud volume were based on extrapolation of locally measured sulfur dioxide concentrations."

Reduced spatial overlap with predators appears to decrease mortality rate of adult female Pseudocalanus. A life table analysis suggests that the demographic disadvantage associated with daily migration across a thermal gradient can be overcome if mortality is reduced by as little as 16 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2084191157,"In addition to the primary pheromone component (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate, the sex pheromone gland of Trichoplusia ni contains the immediate fatty acyl precursor (Z)-7-dodecenoate and a large quantity of (Z)-11-hexadecenoate. Labeling experiments showed that (Z)-11-hexadecenoate is chain-shortened to (Z)-9-tetradecenoate, and that this in turn is chain-shortened to (Z)-7-dodecenoate. The same mechanism appears to explain the sex pheromone compositions of many other moth species."

This result supports the probable detection of carbon dioxide by Samuelson and his co-workers and strengthens possible analogies between the atmosphere of Titan and conditions on primitive Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2075716707,"The application of calcium chelating agents (EDTA or EGTA) to the tips of maize roots caused a loss of gravitropic sensitivity. When the chelator was replaced with calcium chloride, gravitropic sensitivity was restored. Asymmetric application of calcium chloride near the tip of a vertical root caused curvature toward the calcium source. When the calcium was applied to the upper surface of the tip of a root oriented horizontally, the root curved upward even though control roots exhibited strong downward curvature. Application of calcium chloride to the tips of decapped roots, which are known to be gravitropically insensitive, did not restore gravitropic sensitivity. However, asymmetric application of calcium chloride near the tips of decapped roots caused curvature toward the calcium source. Calcium may play a key role in linking gravity detection to gravitropic curvature in roots."
https://openalex.org/W2087109366,"There is accumulating evidence that as much as 90 percent of the mass of the universe is nonluminous and is clumped, halo-like, around individual galaxies. The gravitational force of this dark matter is presumed to be responsible for the high rotational velocities of stars and gas in the disks of spiral galaxies. At present, the form of the dark matter is unknown. Possible candidates span a range in mass of 1070, from non-zero-mass neutrinos to massive black holes."
https://openalex.org/W1979407253,"The hyphae of the water mold Achyla bisexualis generate electrical currents that enter the growing tips and leave farther back. An inward-moving current also precedes branching and predicts the site of branch emergence; during the branching process, the current at the original tip declines or even reverses transiently without any change in growth rate. The inward current probably acts as an early signal during branch differentiation. The flow of specific ions rather than the flow of electrical charge probably serves to localize growth."
https://openalex.org/W2091351888,"Scanning electron microscopy and single unit recordings of male Trichoplusia ni antennae reveal at least two classes of pheromone-sensitive sensilla trichodea. The longer sensillum contains two receptor neurons each with small amounts of spontaneous activity. One neuron responds to large (10-microgram) doses of (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate, a component of the female sex pheromone. The shorter sensillum contains two receptor neurons both with larger amounts of spontaneous activity and increased sensitivity to low (0.01-microgram) doses of pheromone."
https://openalex.org/W1987198596,"Observations of thermal radio emission from the surface of Venus, made by the Pioneer Venus radar mapper at a wavelength of 17 centimeters, show variations that are dominated by changes in surface emissivity. The regions of lowest emissivity (0.54 +/- 0.05 for the highland areas of Aphrodite Terra and Theia Mons) correspond closely to regions of high radar reflectivity reported earlier. These results support the inference of inclusions of material with high electrical conductivity in the surface rock of these areas."
https://openalex.org/W1965019103,"The identities, sexes, and reproductive status of groups of wild horses (Equus caballus) living in the Great Basin Desert of North America were known prior to their deaths on ridgelines. Another group of very young horses died on a quagmire. Snow accumulation or drought was apparently responsible for the mass deaths. These data have implications for reconstructing some aspects of the social structure of fossil mammals on the basis of skewed sex or age ratios in bone assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2019397392,"Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy is a useful technique for the study of vibrational modes of molecules adsorbed on the surface of oxide layers in a metal-insulator-metal tunnel junction. The technique involves studying the effects of adsorbed molecules on the tunneling spectrum of such junctions. The data give useful information about the structure, bonding, and orientation of adsorbed molecules. One of the major advantages of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy is its sensitivity. It is capable of detecting on the order of 10(10) molecules (a fraction of a monolayer) on a 1-square-millimeter junction. It has been successfully used in studies of catalysis, biology, trace impurity detection, and electronic excitations. Because of its high sensitivity, this technique shows great promise in the area of solid-state electronic chemical sensing."

A hanging-drop technique has been developed that permits the use of a minimum of substrate, i.e., one small drop for each tissue section. ATPase in wheat was demonstrated for the first time."

On mineral agar and on media containing sorbitol the tissue from Polytrichum (found diploid) reverts to the growth pattern of apparently normal moss plants."
https://openalex.org/W2012100404,"Extracts of seeds and leaves of the tropical legume Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. (the pigeon pea) elicited the accumulation of three phytoalexins when applied as droplets to superficially wounded leaves of the plant. The active component was purified and identified as sucrose. Phytoalexin accumulation was proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of sucrose applied, with maxima ranging from 338 to 455 micrograms per gram (fresh weight) of leaf tissue. The sucrose concentrations required to elicit half these amounts ranged from 20 to 35 micrograms per milliliter, but other sugars had little effect even at 1000 micrograms per milliliter. The elicitor activity of sucrose was abolished by actinomycin D, puromycin, and cycloheximide at a concentration of 10 micrograms per milliliter or greater, suggesting that gene derepression is required for expression of the phytoalexin response."

These are the first Eocene rocks to be identified in Massachusetts. Interpretation of seismic records taken in the Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod Bay will be influenced by this discovery."

https://openalex.org/W2010894850,"The atmospheric concentrations of several trace gases capable of changing the climate are increasing. Researchers are concerned about the trace gases despite their miniscule concentrations because they are such efficient absorbers of far-infrared radiation. The trace gases that concern climatologists are methane, nitrous oxide, and the chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of these gases are discussed and atmospheric models predicting their greenhouse effect are described."
