https://openalex.org/W1964287631,"The recent discoveries of Stim1 and Orai proteins have shed light on the molecular makeup of both the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor and the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, respectively. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CRAC channel function by extracellular Ca2+ for channels composed primarily of Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3, by co-expressing these proteins together with Stim1, as well as the endogenous channels in HEK293 cells. As reported previously, Orai1 or Orai2 resulted in a substantial increase in CRAC current (Icrac), but Orai3 failed to produce any detectable Ca2+-selective currents. However, sodium currents measured in the Orai3-expressing HEK293 cells were significantly larger in current density than Stim1-expressing cells. Moreover, upon switching to divalent free external solutions, Orai3 currents were considerably more stable than Orai1 or Orai2, indicating that Orai3 channels undergo a lesser degree of depotentiation. Additionally, the difference between depotentiation from Ca2+ and Ba2+ or Mg2+ solutions was significantly less for Orai3 than for Orai1 or -2. Nonetheless, the Na+ currents through Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3, as well as the endogenous store-operated Na+ currents in HEK293 cells, were all inhibited by extracellular Ca2+ with a half-maximal concentration of ∼20 μm. We conclude that Orai1, -2, and -3 channels are similarly inhibited by extracellular Ca2+, indicating similar affinities for Ca2+ within the selectivity filter. Orai3 channels appeared to differ from Orai1 and -2 in being somewhat resistant to the process of Ca2+ depotentiation.

Store-operated or capacitative calcium entry channels subtend or support important Ca2+ signaling pathways in a wide variety of cell types (1Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). The best characterized store-operated mechanism involves a current termed calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) 2The abbreviations used are: CRAC, calcium release-activated calcium; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HBSS, HEPES-buffered saline solution; DVF, divalent free solution; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; siRNA, short interfering RNA; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; TEA, tetraethylammonium; SOC, store-operated current; pF, picofarad. current or Icrac.

In addition to Orai1, two homologs, Orai2 and -3, have been shown to be capable of forming store-operated channels (7Mercer J.C. DeHaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24979-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the properties of these three Orai forms is necessary to understand the specific functions of the subunits and to implicate specific molecular components of native store-operated channels. In this study, we focused on the well characterized modulatory effects of extracellular Ca2+ on CRAC channels (8Lewis R.S. Dolmetsch R.E. Zweifach A. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 241-254Google Scholar, 9Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Extracellular Ca2+ has two effects on CRAC channels. It reduces conductance, or blocks the channels, by binding to a selectivity filter in the channel pore (10Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar), but it also augments channel function by binding to an undefined extracellular site, a process known as potentiation (11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The latter role of extracellular Ca2+ can be revealed by protocols in which extracellular divalent cations are removed. The removal of Ca2+ block results in rapid increases in inward current, and then, as Ca2+ dissociates from the potentiating sites, current declines, a process termed depotentiation (11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen.

J. 2004; 86: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the sensitivity of Orai channels to block by extracellular Ca2+, and the sensitivity of Orai channels to the process of depotentiation. In the course of this work, we developed a technique that permits reproducible assessment of very small Icrac, such as encountered in wild type HEK293 cells or in cells transfected with Stim1 and Orai3. Our results indicate remarkable similarity among the three Orai forms with respect to selectivity and sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ block. However, we find that Orai3 differs strikingly from Orai1 and -2 in being relatively resistant to the process of depotentiation. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. The HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator set at 5% CO2. All experiments were performed on HEK293 cells plated onto 30-mm round glass coverslips mounted in a Teflon chamber. Plasmids—Full-length Orai cDNA plasmids were purchased from Origene in the pCMV6-XL4 (Orai1 and Orai3) and pCMV6-XL5 (Orai2) vectors. An EYFP-Stim1 plasmid was obtained from Tobias Meyer, Stanford University. N-terminal enhanced CFP-tagged Orai plasmids were constructed using human Orai 1, -2, and -3 purchased from Invitrogen in the pENTR™221 vector, as part of the Ultimate ORF Clone collection. The Orai open reading frames were tagged at the N terminus using Gateway system LR reaction (Invitrogen) and the destination vector pDEST501. Successful recombination was confirmed by sequencing. siRNA Knockdown—Orai1 siRNA (Invitrogen) was performed as described previously (7Mercer J.C. DeHaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24979-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were plated in a 6-well plate on day 1. On day 2, cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Metafectine (Biontex Laboratories). After 6–8 h of incubation, the bathing medium was changed with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. On day 3, siRNA-treated cells were transfected with cDNA as described below. cDNA Transfection—HEK293 cells were transferred to 6-well plates and allowed to grow to 80–90% confluence, followed by transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen;) 2 μl per well with EYFP cDNA (0.5 μg/well), EYFP-Stim1 cDNA (0.5 μg/well), or EYFP-Stim1 cDNA together with Orai cDNA (Orai1, 0.5 μg/well; Orai2, 2 μg/well; Orai3, 2 μg/well), as described previously (7Mercer J.C. DeHaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24979-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). After a 6–8-h incubation period, the medium bathing the cells was replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and maintained in culture. The next day, cDNA-treated cells were transferred to 30-mm glass coverslips in preparation for electrophysiological studies as described below. All transfections of cells with Orai constructs involved co-transfection with EYFP-Stim1, the fluorescence of which was used to identify successfully transfected cells. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell currents were investigated at room temperature (20–25 °C) in HEK293 cells using the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. The standard HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS) contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH to 7.4 with NaOH). The standard divalent free solution (DVF) was prepared by removing the CaCl2 and MgCl2 from HBSS and adding 0.1 mm EGTA. The divalent cation substitution experiments used the standard DVF solution throughout, with Ca2+, Ba2+, or Mg2+ added to 2 mm final concentration. Monovalent permeation experiments were performed using 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 2 EDTA, 10 glucose; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Where stated, NaCl was substituted by equimolar LiCl, RbCl, CsCl, TEA-Cl, or NMDG; pH was adjusted to 7.4. The DVF solution used in experiments examining Ca2+ inhibition of Na+ currents through Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3 was described previously by Prakriya and Lewis (14Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and contained (pH 7.4) 10 mm HEDTA and 1 mm EDTA. CaCl2 was added to this DVF solution at the amount calculated using the Maxchelator program (WEBMAXC). Fire-polished pipettes fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with 3–5-megohm resistance were filled with the followign (in mm): 145 cesium methanesulfonate, 20 BAPTA, 10 HEPES, and 8 MgCl2 (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). In most experiments, the pipette also contained 25 μm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3, hexasodium salt; Sigma). Voltage ramps (–100 to +100 mV) of 250 ms were recorded every 2 s immediately after gaining access to the cell from a holding potential of 0 mV, and the currents were normalized based on cell capacitance. Leak currents were subtracted by taking an initial ramp current before Icrac developed and subtracting this from all subsequent ramp currents. Access resistance was typically between 5 and 10 megohms. The currents were acquired with pCLAMP-10 (Axon Instruments) and analyzed with Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and Origin 6 (Microcal) software. All solutions were applied by means of a gravity-based multibarrel local perfusion system with an extremely low dead volume common delivery port (Perfusion pencil, Automate Scientific, Inc.). Flow rates were set at ∼0.25 ml/min. In cells transfected with Orai1 and Stim1, we noticed one anomaly that limited the experimental protocols to some degree. When we broke into these cells with IP3 in the pipette, but with extracellular solutions ranging from nominally Ca2+-free to ∼100 μm [Ca2+], large currents developed with unusual doubly rectifying properties (supplemental Fig. 1). We carried out experiments in nontransfected HEK293 and RBL cells, and in neither case did such currents develop. They thus may reflect a degree of instability of the channels in this highly overexpressed state. As a result, in all experiments, we initially broke in with an extracellular Ca2+-containing medium, and we then switched to DVF media or to media containing other cations, as indicated in specific protocols. As long as the experiments were initiated in a Ca2+-containing medium (mm range) or DVF solution, the unusual currents were never observed, even if subsequently the solution was changed to one containing low Ca2+. Also, note that our usual extracellular medium contained 2 mm Ca2+ rather than the 10 mm Ca2+ generally used for Icrac measurements. We found that with overexpressed Orai1 and Stim1, with 10 mm Ca2+ the resulting store-operated currents were somewhat unstable and tended to run down rapidly. With 2 mm Ca2+, the currents were generally stable for prolonged periods (see for example, Fig. 1). Fig. 1 illustrates experiments in which HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, EYFP-Stim1 alone, or EYFP-Stim1 cotransfected with the plasma membrane proteins Orai1, Orai2, or Orai3. Successfully transfected cells were identified by the fluorescence from EYFP-Stim1 or by transfected EYFP for endogenous HEK293 CRAC currents. For Orai-transfected cells, EYFP-Stim1 was always present. Whole-cell electrophysiological experiments were performed with IP3 and BAPTA in the pipette to deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, and the extracellular solution in these studies contained 2 mm Ca2+. Fig. 1A depicts representative inward currents collected from –100 mV voltage steps every 2 s in HEK293 cells expressing the indicated Orai constructs. In our hands, neither EYFP controls, Stim1 alone, nor Orai3-expressing cells developed any detectable Icrac-like Ca2+ currents. Other laboratories have measured, or attempted to measure, endogenous Icrac in wild type HEK293 cells and have concluded the currents to be very small (∼0.5 pA/pF) and inconsistently detectable (5Vig M.

However, large inward currents were recorded from cells in which Orai1 or Orai2 and Stim1 were co-expressed, as described previously (6Zhang S.L. Yeromin A.V. Zhang X.H. Yu Y. Safrina O. Penna A.

Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Voltage ramps (250 ms) from –100 to +100 mV were used to compare the current-voltage relationships under extracellular Ca2+ conditions for Orai1 and Orai2. Fig. 1B shows the strong inward rectification and very positive reversal potential (>+50 mV), indicative of the Ca2+-selective currents. Fig. 1C shows a summary of the data, where the mean inward Ca2+ currents activated by store depletion were –0.15 ± 0.03 pA/pF (YFP), –0.37 ± 0.10 pA/pF (Stim1), –0.27 ± 0.11 pA/pF (Orai3 + Stim1), –3.65 ± 0.36 pA/pF (Orai2 + Stim1), and –11.55 ± 0.78 pA/pF (Orai1 + Stim1). Unlike Stim1 alone or Orai3 and Stim1, both Orai1 and Orai2 co-expressed with EYFP-Stim1 produced SOC currents that were significantly larger than EYFP. The inability to detect endogenous Icrac currents in HEK293 cells is a recurring problem in cell types with small store-operated currents. This prevents quantitative comparisons of these currents to those produced by expression of Orai1 and -2. It is also difficult to assess the effects of expressing Stim1 alone or to characterize the currents produced by Orai3. One biophysical hallmark of Icrac is development of a transient Na+ current upon removal of extracellular Ca2+ (10Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the results of whole-cell electrophysiological experiments utilizing a DVF-switching technique to readily reveal these small currents. A DVF Na+-containing solution was perfused onto the cells following store depletion with IP3 and BAPTA in the pipette. In Fig. 2, A–E, representative current traces are depicted showing that robust and reproducible Na+ currents are readily apparent for endogenous (A; EYFP control), EYFP-Stim1 (B), and Orai1- (C), Orai2- (D), and Orai3- (E) HEK293 cells. Note that the current scales for YFP and Stim1 are different from the scales for Orai-expressing cells. Thus, it is now readily apparent that Stim1 expression alone causes a significant increase in Icrac in this cell type, and that co-expression of Orai3 and Stim1 results in Na+ currents greater than those in wild type cells or with Stim1 alone. The rapid perfusion of divalent free solution onto the cells caused an initial augmentation of the Na+ currents, because of removal of Ca2+ block, followed by a depotentiation of these currents, similar to the Na+-CRAC currents seen with native channels in RBL and Jurkat cells (10Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This depotentiation is believed to result from the dissociation of Ca2+ from an external site that is necessary for full CRAC channel activation (11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Su Z. Shoemaker R.L. Marchase R.B. Blalock J.E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in HEK293 cells expressing Orai3 and EYFP-Stim1, the depotentiation appeared significantly less pronounced (Fig. 2E). Fig. 2F shows representative current-voltage relationships for each of the experiments performed in A–E. Similar to the I-V relationships under extracellular Ca2+ conditions seen in Fig. 1B, the I-V relationships under divalent free conditions remain strongly inwardly rectifying with a reversal potential of approximately +50 mV for YFP controls (endogenous), Stim1 alone, and Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3 cells co-expressed with Stim1. Fig. 2G summarizes peak divalent free Na+ currents; the mean inward Na+ currents (depicted by horizontal line in scatter plot) activated by store depletion were –3.09 ± 0.36 pA/pF (YFP), –10.91 ± 0.64 pA/pF (Stim1), –25.34 ± 1.26 pA/pF (Orai3 + Stim1), –34.33 ± 1.89 pA/pF (Orai2 + Stim1), and –66.48 ± 3.90 pA/pF (Orai1 + Stim1). The summary data confirm the statistically significant increase in current by Stim1 alone and greater increase when co-expressed with each of the Orai forms. To assess more quantitatively the extent of depotentiation of the Na+-CRAC currents seen with the Orai-expressing HEK293 cells, we calculated the inactivation indices for each condition. The inactivation index was determined by dividing the Na+-CRAC currents at steady state (30 s after application of DVF solution) by the peak Na+-CRAC currents, and subtracting this from one. This method is similar to that described by Zweifach and Lewis (19Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) for quantitating degree of fast inactivation. Fig. 2H shows a scatter plot of the inactivation indices for Stim1 (0.51 ± 0.03), Orai1 and Stim1 (0.61 ± 0.02), Orai2 and Stim1 (0.63 ± 0.02), and Orai3 + Stim1 (0.28 ± 0.01). Thus, although ∼60% of the Na+ currents depotentiated in YFP-, Stim1-, Orai1-Stim1-, and Orai2-Stim1-expressing HEK293 cells, only ∼30% depotentiation was seen in Orai3-Stim1-co-expressing cells. As in our previous study, the rank order of Icrac activation by the three Orai with this Stim1 co-transfection paradigm was Orai1 > Orai2 > Orai3. We considered the possibility that these differences reflected differences in expression of the three proteins. To address this issue, we constructed N-terminal CFP fusions of each of the Orai. The results were consistent with the observations of current, i.e. Orai1 was expressed to a greater level than Orai2 or -3. The relative expression of the three proteins was determined by flow cytometry and was as follows (in arbitrary units): CFP-Orai1, 3041 ± 573; CFP-Orai2, 1449 ± 122; CFP-Orai3, 1,086 ± 51 (n = 3 transfections, 10,000 cells per transfection per condition). For the most part, these constructs behaved in a manner similar to their wild type counterparts when co-transfected with Stim1. However, unlike the results with unmodified Orai3, CFP-Orai3 + Stim1-transfected cells revealed detectable store-operated Ca2+ currents and significantly larger Na+ currents. In addition, these larger CFP-Orai3 currents tended to depotentiate in a manner similar to Orai1 and -2. The reason for these differences in behavior for the N-terminal fusion version of Orai3 was not further investigated. However, because of this, we did not use the tagged constructs for any experiments other than for determination of expression level and localization. All three localized similarly at the cell periphery, presumably in the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these results suggest the smaller Orai2 and Orai3 currents might result at least in part from differences in expression levels in HEK293 cells. However, a caveat is that the tagged versions of the proteins did not behave identically to the wild type proteins, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Thus, comparison of both behavior and expression of unmodified Orai must await development of isoform-specific antibodies. In previous work examining Ca2+ signaling responses, overexpression of Orai1 and -2 appeared to inhibit entry, whereas Orai3 had no effect. Thus, we next examined the effects of overexpression of each of the three Orai on store-operated Na+ currents. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of Orai1 or -2 alone significantly inhibited store-operated Na+ currents in divalent free solutions. However, overexpression of Orai3 caused a modest but statistically significant increase in the current. In contrast to the results in the presence of excess Stim1, when expressed alone, the inactivation index for Orai3-expressing cells was not significantly different from control (EYFP-expressing cells). We considered that the apparent difference in depotentiation of Orai3 in the presence or absence of Stim1 might reflect the relative contribution of endogenous Orai1 under the two conditions, i.e. if Orai1 were better able to interact with Stim1 (or Stim1-dependent signals) than Orai3, then with Stim1 limiting, the functional channels might be largely Orai1 homomers and Orai1–Orai3 heteromers (20Vig M. Beck A. Billingsley J.M. Lis A. Parvez S. Peinelt C. Koomoa D.L. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. Fleig A. Curr.

Chem. 2007; 282: 16232-16243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). When Stim1 is not limiting, the effects of Orai3 homomers may contribute to a greater degree, as in Fig. 2E. Thus, we next examined the characteristics of store-operated Na+ currents following expression of Orai1 and -2 with Stim1, and Orai3 with and without Stim1 in cells with endogenous Orai1 reduced by RNAi, as described previously (7Mercer J.C. DeHaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24979-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4. Knockdown of Orai1 resulted in an almost complete loss of store-operated Na+ current (–0.63 ± 0.11 pA/pF; not shown), even with overexpression of Stim1 (–0.64 ± 0.22 pA/pF; Fig. 4B). Expression of Orai1 and -2 with Stim1 produced currents similar to those seen without Orai1 knockdown, although somewhat smaller (Fig. 4, C, D, and G). Expression of Orai3 alone in these cells restored Na+ currents to near control levels (–2.46 ± 0.61 pA/pF), consistent with our previous report showing that Orai3 can rescue Ca2+ entry following knockdown of Orai1 (7Mercer J.C.

Expression of Orai3 with Stim1 in these cells resulted in larger currents but still considerably smaller than those seen when Orai3 and Stim1 were expressed in cells containing endogenous Orai1 (–6.05 ± 0.49 pA/pF versus –25.34 ± 1.26 pA/pF), consistent with the idea that the current from cells expressing their endogenous complement of Orai1 results from a combination of Orai1 and Orai3. As predicted, the inactivation index for Orai3 in cells lacking Orai1 was 0.25 ± 0.04 in the absence of Stim1 and was not significantly different from that for the larger currents when Orai1 remained (0.28 ± 0.01). It is generally believed that depotentiation results from dissociation of Ca2+ from a regulatory extracellular site, i.e. it is the reciprocal of the process of Ca2+ potentiation (11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Su Z. Shoemaker R.L. Marchase R.B. Blalock J.E. Biophys.

Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Su Z. Shoemaker R.L. Marchase R.B. Blalock J.E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We thus compared the potentiating effects of Ba2+ and Mg2+ to those of Ca2+. Fig. 5, A–C, shows representative current traces of HEK293 cells expressing EYFP-Stim1 co-expressed with Orai1 (A), Orai2 (B), or Orai3 (C), in which extracellular DVF solution was focally applied to the cells after pre-exposing them to 2 mm Ca2+, Ba2+, or Mg2+ outside. All experiments were performed on cells in which stores were actively depleted by IP3 and BAPTA in the pipette. In Orai1-Stim1 and Orai2-Stim1 co-expressing HEK293 cells, the focal perfusion of 2 mm Ba2+ and Mg2+ significantly reduced the inward currents recorded at –100 mV but did not completely eliminate them. In both Orai1-Stim1- and Orai2-Stim1-expressing cells, which show significant Ca2+ currents, only ∼20 and ∼10% (normalized to the Ca2+ currents) of the inward currents remained after switching the extracellular solution from a Ca2+-containing buffer to one containing Ba2+ or Mg2+, respectively. Fig. 5D illustrates that the rank order for the potentiating effects of the different cations on store-operated Na+ currents for all three Orai was Ca2+ > Ba2+ > Mg2+. However, the differences in potentiation in the Orai3 cells were less than with the other two Orai. Pre-exposure of Orai1 and Orai2 cells to external Ba2+ or Mg2+ resulted in subsequent DVF currents that were ∼60 or ∼45% of those seen following pre-exposure to Ca2+, respectively. The DVF currents following Mg2+ pre-exposure did not appear to depotentiate and did not appear appreciably large"

TRBP and PACT are structurally related but exert opposite regulatory activities on PKR. It is not understood whether TRBP and PACT are simultaneously required for Dicer. Here we show that TRBP directly interacts with PACT in vitro and in mammalian cells. TRBP and PACT form a triple complex with Dicer and facilitate the production of small interfering RNA (siRNA) by Dicer. Knockdown of both TRBP and PACT in cultured cells leads to significant inhibition of gene silencing mediated by short hairpin RNA but not by siRNA, suggesting that TRBP and PACT function primarily at the step of siRNA production. Taken together, these findings indicate that human TRBP and PACT directly interact with each other and associate with Dicer to stimulate the cleavage of double-stranded or short hairpin RNA to siRNA.

Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar). At least two classes of small RNAs have been described in mammals, micro-RNAs (miRNA) produced from hairpin precursors and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derived from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) (2Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Both miRNAs and siRNAs are generated by RNase III-type nuclease Dicer, and they are assembled into effector complex termed RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (3Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M.

Although two Dicer enzymes Dcr1 and Dcr2 have been found in fruit flies and are responsible for the generation of miRNAs and siRNAs, respectively, there exists only one single Dicer in humans, which produces both miRNAs and siRNAs (3Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar). Dcr2 is known to associate with a dsRNA-binding protein (dsRBP) termed R2D2, which binds to siRNA and facilitates its passage from Dcr2 to RISC (5Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.-E.

In this study, we explored the direct interaction between TRBP and PACT as well as its impact on Dicer and RNA silencing. Plasmids and siRNA—Human cDNAs for TRBP and PACT were derived from clones IRAUp969F1229 and DKFZp564I0123 obtained from RZPD (Berlin, Germany). Expression plasmids for TRBP and PACT were based on pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen), pCMVTag3B (Stratagene), pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs), and pET-28a (Novagen). Coding sequences of CFP and YFP were PCR-amplified from plasmids pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). Plasmid pshRL1776 expressing shRL has been described elsewhere (23Kok K.H. Jin D.-Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for shTRBP, shPACT, and shGFP were constructed using pSHAG-1 (24Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) and pshRL1776 as template. siRL and siDicer were chemically synthesized as described previously (25Zhou Y. Ching Y.-P.

Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and Protein Analysis—GST-TRBP, MBP-TRBP, His-PACT, and GST-PACT, as well as the truncated forms of His-TRBP and His-PACT, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm reduced glutathione. MBP-TRBP was purified through amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and eluted with 10 mm maltose solution. Polyhistidine-tagged proteins were purified through nickel-chelating column (Qiagen) and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. All fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C. To remove contaminating RNA bound to TRBP/PACT, protein purification was performed in the presence of 200 μg of RNase A (Sigma). All proteins were purified to >90% homogeneity as verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. All preparations of purified proteins were free of contaminating RNA as measured by UV absorbance (A260). GST pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis were carried out as described (27Ching Y.-P. Chan S.-F. Jeang K.-T. Jin D.-Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Siu Y.-T. Chin K.-T. Siu K.-L. Choy E.Y.W. Jeang K.-T. Jin D.-Y. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc serum was from Sigma. Mouse anti-Dicer and goat anti-T7 antibodies were from Abcam. A rabbit anti-TRBP serum was raised against purified recombinant GST-TRBP-A. Specificity of anti-TRBP antibodies was verified with lysate of TRBP-overexpressing HEK293T cells. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Imaging—Multicolor fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (29Zhou Y. Ching Y.-P. Chun A.C.S. Jin D.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Chin K.-T. Chun A.C.S. Ching Y.-P. Jeang K.-T. Jin D.-Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA-CFP-TRBP, pcDNA-YFP-PACT, or both. Cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) at 24 h post-transfection. Fixed cells were excited either at 820 nm (for CFP excitation) or 488 nm (for YFP excitation), and signals were recorded at either 435–485 nm (signal for CFP) or 535–590 nm (signal for YFP) on a Zeiss LSM510 META laser scanning microscope. FRET signal was captured at 535–590 nm during excitation at 820 nm. FRET signal between CFP and YFP was corrected using Zeiss LSM software. Protein Fractionation Analysis—Two C57 mouse testes were dissected and homogenized in 1 ml of MTPBS buffer with protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) for 1 min on ice. Homogenized testes were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein lysates were treated with RNase A at 50 μg/ml for 15 min at 4 °C and then passed through a 0.22-μm filter. Filtered lysates were loaded into Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and were fractionated at 0.3 ml/min in MTPBS buffer. Fractions (1 ml each) were lyophilized overnight and redissolved in 100 μl of MTPBS buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-TRBP, rabbit anti-PACT (Abcam), and mouse anti-Dicer (Abcam) antibodies. In Vitro Dicer Cleavage Assay—dsRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion) and purified with RNeasy reagents (Qiagen). Excess amount of dsRNA was incubated with recombinant human Dicer (Stratagene or Ambion) for 16 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were purified by passing through G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) and then YM-100 (Millipore) columns to remove salts and undigested dsRNA. Purified products were analyzed through urea-PAGE and stained with ethidium bromide. The purity of recombinant human DICER was verified by SDS-PAGE, and a single discrete band of >200 kDa was seen. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was isolated from cultured cells with mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). RNA on denaturing polyacrylamide gel was transferred onto ZetaProbe membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semi-dry Transblot apparatus (Hoefer). RNA on the membrane was cross-linked and then hybridized in ULTRAhyb-Oligo solution (Ambion) with 32P-labeled RNA oligonucleotides that can hybridize to siRL. Luciferase Assay—Renilla luciferase activity was determined as described (23Kok K.H. Jin D.-Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Chan C.-P. Siu K.-L. Chin K.-T. Yuen K.-Y. Zheng B. Jin D.-Y. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9279-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) using the Dual-Luciferase® reagents (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized to a control plasmid expressing firefly luciferase. TRBP and PACT Interact Directly with Each Other—Because TRBP and PACT are related both structurally and functionally, we asked whether they bind to each other directly. We first performed GST pulldown experiments with recombinant proteins purified from E. coli. We found that a polyhistidine-tagged PACT (His-PACT) bound with high affinity to GST-TRBP but not to GST (Fig. 1A, lane 2 compared with lane 1 and lane 5 compared with lane 4). In agreement with the previous finding on homodimerization of PACT (22Hitti E.G. Sallacz N.B. Schoft V.K. Jantsch M.F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we also observed the retention of His-PACT in the GST-PACT resin (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 6). To confirm the direct binding between TRBP and PACT, we employed another TRBP fusion protein MBP-TRBP. We noted that MBP-TRBP specifically bound to GST-PACT resin but not to GST alone (Fig. 1B, lane 4 compared with lane 2). In keeping with the concept of TRBP homodimerization (21Daher A. Longuet M. Dorin D. Bois F. Segeral E. Bannwarth S. Battisti P.L. Purcell D.F. Benarous R. Vaquero C. Meurs E.F. Gatignol A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33899-33905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), homophilic interaction between GST-TRBP and MBP-TRBP was also seen in this experiment (Fig. 1B, lane 6 compared with lane 2). Thus, our results from in vitro affinity binding assay consistently support that TRBP and PACT cannot only form homodimers but also interact directly with each other. TRBP and PACT contain three dsRBDs (Fig. 1C) that have differential activities in regulating PKR (17Peters G.A. Hartmann R. Qin J. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Gupta V. Huang X. Patel R.C. Virology. 2003; 315: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in the formation of homodimers (21Daher A. Longuet M. Dorin D. Bois F. Segeral E. Bannwarth S. Battisti P.L. Purcell D.F. Benarous R. Vaquero C. Meurs E.F. Gatignol A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33899-33905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Hitti E.G. Sallacz N.B. Schoft V.K. Jantsch M.F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of the three dsRBDs in mediating TRBP-PACT interaction, we constructed two sets of truncated mutants and interrogated them for binding activities with TRBP or PACT using GST pulldown assay. We found that PACT-A containing the first dsRBD was capable of binding to GST-TRBP (Fig. 1C, lane 1), whereas the interaction with GST-PACT was mediated by TRBP-A and TRBP-B corresponding to the first and second dsRBDs, respectively (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). Next we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiment to further investigate the interaction of TRBP with PACT in human cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed reciprocally with antibodies recognizing Myc-tagged TRBP (Myc-TRBP) and V5-tagged PACT (V5-PACT). Because both Myc-TRBP and V5-PACT were found in the precipitates (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 and 8 compared with lanes 3 and 7, respectively), the two entities plausibly formed a protein complex inside human cells in culture. To rule out the possibility that TRBP and PACT associate as a result of lysate preparation, Myc-TRBP and V5-PACT were also expressed in separate cells. Precipitation was then performed immediately after mixing the lysates of different cells. Because similar results were also obtained in this setting (data not shown), the interaction of TRBP and PACT was unlikely an artifact generated during the preparation of cell lysates. In a third approach, we used FRET imaging to analyze the interaction between TRBP and PACT. FRET imaging can detect the interaction between two proteins differentially fused with fluorescent tags. The FRET signal is emitted only when the two proteins are within a distance of less than 10 nm (32Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In our experiment, both CFP-TRBP and YFP-PACT were found to localize in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, panels 1 and 5). No FRET signal was measurable when CFP-TRBP alone or YFP-PACT alone was expressed (Fig. 2, panels 3 and 6). In contrast, when cells co-expressing CFP-TRBP and YFP-PACT were recorded simultaneously in the CFP, YFP, and FRET channels, a significant FRET signal was observed (Fig. 2, panel 9). These results lent further support to the notion that TRBP and PACT interact directly with each other within human cells.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) prompted us to ask whether TRBP, PACT, and Dicer might function as a protein complex. In this regard, although the roles of TRBP and PACT in RNAi have been well described (10Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 11Haase A.D. Jaskiewicz L. Zhang H. Laine S. Sack R. Gatignol A. Filipowicz W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 12Lee Y. Hur I. Park S.-Y. Kim Y.-K. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), two important questions remain unanswered. First, because the association of PACT with Dicer has been demonstrated by co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation only (12Lee Y. Hur I. Park S.-Y. Kim Y.-K. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), it is not known whether PACT directly interacts with Dicer or through TRBP. Second, it is not understood whether TRBP and PACT bind to Dicer simultaneously or exclusively. To address these questions, we performed in vitro protein affinity binding assays using bacterially produced TRBP, PACT, and Dicer (Fig. 3A). Because recombinant Dicer was retained in the GST-PACT-bound resin as efficiently as in the resin containing GST-TRBP (Fig. 3A, lane 1 compared with lane 4), the physical interaction between PACT and Dicer is direct and unlikely mediated through another protein. We then queried for the formation of triple complex by loading MBP-TRBP and Dicer sequentially to the GST-PACT resin. In this experiment, GST-PACT was first saturated with an excess of MBP-TRBP, and the unbound MBP-TRBP was then removed by extensive washing (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Next, Dicer was added and found to be retained in the resin (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Likewise, when we saturated GST-TRBP resin with excess His-PACT, washed away all free His-PACT, and incubated the GST-TRBP-His-PACT-bound resin with Dicer, Dicer was also retained in the resin (Fig. 3A, lane 6 compared with lane 5). Reciprocally, MBP-TRBP or His-PACT was found in the resin if the GST-PACT or GST-TRBP resin was first saturated with Dicer (data not shown). Collectively, our results are consistent with the formation of a stable triple complex of TRBP, PACT, and Dicer. To verify that a protein complex containing TRBP, PACT, and Dicer is also formed in cultured human cells, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Although both Dicer and V5-PACT were found in the anti-Myc precipitate that contained Myc-TRBP (Fig. 3B, lane 4 compared with lanes 1–3), both Dicer and Myc-TRBP were also detected in the precipitate containing V5-PACT (Fig. 3B, lane 8 compared with lanes 5–7). Thus, TRBP and PACT likely bound with Dicer as a functional complex. We next compared the binding activities of truncated TRBP and PACT mutants (Fig. 3C). Although the first two dsRBDs of TRBP (TRBP-A and TRBP-B) were responsible for interaction with TRBP and PACT, the third dsRBD (TRBP-C) was accounted for binding with Dicer. This is generally consistent with previous findings (8Förstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Plos Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 11Haase A.D. Jaskiewicz L. Zhang H. Laine S. Sack R. Gatignol A. Filipowicz W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the first dsRBD of PACT (PACT-A) was necessary for binding to TRBP and PACT, whereas the second and third dsRBDs (PACT-B and PACT-C) were required for interaction with Dicer. Thus, TRBP and PACT used different domains to mediate their interaction with partner proteins. Interestingly, all truncated forms of TRBP and PACT were found to associate with Dicer in cultured cells, suggesting that some mutants incapable of binding with Dicer directly in vitro might interact with it indirectly through its TRBP or PACT partner. Moreover, when we pre-saturated recombinant Dicer with excess TRBP-C or PACT-C, other forms of TRBP or PACT was no longer able to bind with Dicer (data not shown), suggesting that TRBP and PACT likely compete for the same binding site(s) in Dicer. Formation of TRBP-PACT-Dicer Complex in Mouse Testicular Tissue—Consistent with a previous report (33Zhong J. Peters A.H.F.M. Lee K. Braun R.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we found that TRBP and PACT were abundantly expressed in male germ cells (data not shown). Thus, we investigated the in vivo formation of TRBP-PACT-Dicer complex in mouse testicular tissue. As a first step, the specificity of polyclonal antibodies against endogenous TRBP, PACT, and Dicer, which we prepared or purchased, was verified with human and mouse tissues as well as transfected cells. All three antibodies reacted with target proteins in human and mouse tissues and cells in a highly specific manner (data not shown). We then fractionated extracts of mouse testes through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column and analyzed the fractions by Western blotting with anti-TRBP, anti-PAC, and anti-Dicer antibodies (Fig. 4A). TRBP, PACT, and Dicer were detected in fractions 40–43, consistent with the presence of a TRBP-PACT-Dicer complex displaying a molecular mass of more than 440 kDa. The detection of multiple TRBP or PACT species in mammalian cells was consistent with previous reports (10Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 11Haase A.D. Jaskiewicz L. Zhang H. Laine S. Sack R. Gatignol A. Filipowicz W.

Blood. 2006; 108: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In keeping with the co-fractionation results, we also detected PACT and Dicer in the protein complex precipitated with anti-TRBP (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 7). Thus, our results suggested that endogenous TRBP, PACT, and Dicer proteins associate to form a triple complex in mouse testicular tissue. Roles of TRBP and PACT in Dicer-dependent Production of siRNA—The formation of a stable TRBP-PACT-Dicer complex led us to explore the influence of TRBP and PACT on Dicer function. In previous studies, comparison of the siRNA/miRNA-producing activities of TRBP-Dicer or PACT-Dicer with Dicer alone suggests that neither TRBP nor PACT is required for the RNA cleavage reaction catalyzed by Dicer (10Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 12Lee Y. Hur I. Park S.-Y. Kim Y.-K. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, a Drosophila homolog of TRBP and PACT named Loquacious can stimulate the specific pre-miRNA processing activity of Dicer-1 (8Förstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Plos Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 35Park J.K. Liu X. Strauss T.J. McKearin D.M. Liu Q. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 533-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, a dsRBP partner of Caenorhabditis elegans Dicer termed RDE-4 also functions in concert with Dicer at the step of siRNA production (36Parker G.S. Eckert D.M. Bass B.L. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 807-818Google Scholar). To clarify whether human TRBP, PACT, or TRBP-PACT complex could facilitate RNA processing by Dicer, we monitored the cleavage of dsRL566, a 566-bp-long dsRNA corresponding to a fragment of Renilla luciferase mRNA. In reactions containing the same amount of recombinant Dicer and escalating amounts of GST-TRBP, His-PACT, or GST-TRBP plus His-PACT, a significant increase in the production of siRNA could be appreciated (Fig. 5). Notably, the increase in siRNA yield attributed to GST-TRBP plus His-PACT is comparable with the elevation ascribed to the same amount of GST-TRBP or His-PACT (Fig. 5, lanes 10–12 compared with lanes 4–6 and 7–9). These results indicate the facilitation of Dicer-mediated production of siRNA by TRBP and PACT. In addition, a protein complex"
https://openalex.org/W1992981977,"The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is indispensable for development, and functions to activate a transcriptional program modulated by the GLI transcription factors. Here, we report that loss of a regulator of the SHH pathway, Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), resulted in early embryonic lethality in the mouse similar to inactivation of another SHH regulator, Patched1 (Ptch1). In contrast to Ptch1+/- mice, Sufu+/- mice were not tumor prone. However, in conjunction with p53 loss, Sufu+/- animals developed tumors including medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Tumors present in Sufu+/-p53-/- animals resulted from Sufu loss of heterozygosity. Sufu+/-p53-/- medulloblastomas also expressed a signature gene expression profile typical of aberrant SHH signaling, including upregulation of N-myc, Sfrp1, Ptch2 and cyclin D1. Finally, the Smoothened inhibitor, hedgehog antagonist, did not block growth of tumors arising from Sufu inactivation. These data demonstrate that Sufu is essential for development and functions as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2028294233,"Choline is an essential nutrient for humans, though some of the requirement can be met by endogenous synthesis catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). Premenopausal women are relatively resistant to choline deficiency compared with postmenopausal women and men. Studies in animals suggest that estrogen treatment can increase PEMT activity. In this study we investigated whether the PEMT gene is regulated by estrogen. PEMT transcription was increased in a dose-dependent manner when primary mouse and human hepatocytes were treated with 17-beta-estradiol for 24 h. This increased message was associated with an increase in protein expression and enzyme activity. In addition, we report a region that contains a perfect estrogen response element (ERE) approximately 7.5 kb from the transcription start site corresponding to transcript variants NM_007169 and NM-008819 of the human and murine PEMT genes, respectively, three imperfect EREs in evolutionarily conserved regions and multiple imperfect EREs in nonconserved regions in the putative promoter regions. We predict that both the mouse and human PEMT genes have three unique transcription start sites, which are indicative of either multiple promoters and/or alternative splicing. This study is the first to explore the underlying mechanism of why dietary requirements for choline vary with estrogen status in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2028991058,"We have studied the possible correlation between nuclear glutathione distribution and the progression of the cell cycle. The former was studied by confocal microscopy using 5-chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate and the latter by flow cytometry and protein expression of Id2 and p107. In proliferating cells, when 41% of them were in the S+G2/M phase of the cell cycle GSH was located mainly in the nucleus. When cells reached confluence (G0/G1) GSH was localized in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear distribution.

In the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, the nucleus/cytoplasm GSH ratio decreased to values close to 1. We report here that cells concentrate GSH in the nucleus in the early phases of cell growth, when most of the cells are in an active division phase, and that GSH redistributes uniformly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm when cells reach confluence.

We report here that cells concentrate GSH in the nucleus in the early phases of cell growth, when most of the cells are in an active division phase, and that GSH redistributes uniformly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm when cells reach confluence. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant non-protein thiol in mammalian cells and performs many physiological functions (1Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Function. CRC Press, Boston1990Google Scholar). We have reported that cellular glutathione decreases in apoptosis (2Esteve J.M. Mompó J. García de la Asunción J. Sastre J. Boix J. Viña J.R. Viña J. Pallardó F.V. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the role of nuclear GSH in the synthesis of DNA (3Reichard P. Thelander L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and in protection against oxidative damage or ionizing radiation (4Biaglow J.E. Varnes M.E. Clark E.P. Epp E.R. Radiat. Res. 1983; 95: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) is well established, little is known about the concentration of GSH in the nucleus and its regulation. This is due to two main factors. The first is methodological: it is impossible to determine the nuclear concentration of GSH using standard cell fractionation and analytical approaches (for a review see Söderdahl et al. (5Söderdahl T. Enoksson M. Lundberg M. Holmgren A. Ottersen O.P. Orrenius S. Bolcsfoldi G. Cotgreave I.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In view of this problem, we used confocal microscopy. The second factor is that most, if not all, of the reports share the common view of nuclear GSH distribution in a static situation. Cells are usually studied under steady state conditions i.e. when they are confluent (G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle). The nucleus changes dramatically during the different phases of the cell cycle. Thus, studies addressed to determining the nuclear GSH distribution must take cell cycle physiology into account. To our knowledge there is a lack of information about the cellular distribution of glutathione during the different phases of the cell cycle and the possible correlation between cellular growth and nuclear GSH levels. We report here that GSH concentrates in the nucleus in the early phases of cell growth, when most of the cells are in an active division phase, and it redistributes uniformly between nucleus and cytoplasm when cells reach confluence. Nuclear Bcl-2 may be responsible for this change, as its expression changes in parallel with glutathione levels in nuclei. 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.3 μg/ml amphotericin B) in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C in 25 or 75 cm2 flasks. Cultured fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and acid GSH extracts were obtained in 6% perchloric acid containing 1 mm EDTA. GSH was measured spectrophotometrically using the glutathione S-transferase assay (6Brigelius R. Muckel C. Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2529-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Determination of reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was carried out using the high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV-visible detection, which we developed to measure GSSG in the presence of a large excess of GSH (7Asensi M. Sastre J. Pallardo F.V. Garcia de la Asuncion J. Estrela J.M. Vina J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The essence of this method consists of minimizing GSH oxidation, which otherwise would result in a large increase in GSSG. Analyses were performed using an Epics Elite cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Miami). Fluorochromes were excited with an argon laser tuned at 488 nm. Forward angle and right angle light scattering were measured. Samples were acquired for 15,000 individual cells. Cell cycle phases were determined using the fluorescent DNA dye propidium iodide (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) at 630 nm fluorescence emission (8Borras C. Esteve J.M. Vina J.R. Sastre J. Vina J. Pallardo F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34332-34335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal laser scanning unit equipped with argon and helium-neon laser beams and attached to a Leica DM1RB inverted microscope. 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in culture as described previously (8Borras C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34332-34335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and plated in 2-cm2 Lab-Tek II chambered cover glass (Nunc) for 5 days, 72 h, 48 h, 24 h, 12 h, and 6 h before the experiment so that cells in all phases of the cell cycle were dyed and analyzed on the same day. Triple staining was performed as follows: 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) 4The abbreviations used are: PI, propidium iodide; CMFDA, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBST, TBS with Tween 20; FCCP, p-trifluoromethoxycarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone; GCS, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. (Sigma) to identify dead cells, 2 μg/ml Hoechst (Sigma) to localize nuclei, and 5 μm CellTracker green 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) (Molecular Probes) to detect GSH (specificity 95%) (9Hedley D.W. Chow S. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). When indicated, mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Red 580 (Fig. 6). Cells were first stained with 5 μm CMFDA in cell culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After washing with prewarmed cell culture medium, cells were left to rest for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in cell culture medium or, alternatively, were loaded with 250 nm MitoTracker Red 580 (Molecular Probes). In the last 5 min of incubation, 2 μg/ml Hoechst and 2 μg/ml PI were added. After incubation with the fluorochromes, staining solution was replaced with fresh prewarmed cell culture medium, and cells were analyzed. Cell washing procedures did not change glutathione distribution (results not shown). The excitation wavelengths for fluorochromes were 488 nm for CMFDA, 543 nm for IP, 364 nm for Hoechst, and 543 nm for MitoTracker Red 580. The emission apertures for fluorescence detection were 510–540 nm for CMFDA, 585–715 nm for PI, 380–485 for Hoechst, and 575–650 nm for MitoTracker Red. The Z-section series obtained beginning from the nuclear apex and progressing down in 1 ± 0.2-μm increments (at least 10 planes) were converted to maximum projection images to avoid subjectivity in the choice of plane to be analyzed. The distributions of green CMFDA fluorescence (GSH levels) and blue Hoechst fluorescence (nuclei localization) were analyzed by profile and by area as follows. Fluorescence Profile Analysis—A cross-section line of 200 ± 20 μm was drawn through a cell field to compare the intensity and distribution of Hoechst (DNA) and CMFDA (GSH) fluorescence. The graphs obtained from the quantification were overlaid using the following color code: blue for nuclei localization (Hoechst fluorescence) and green for GSH distribution (CMFDA fluorescence). Fluorescence Area Analysis—Perimeters were drawn around the nucleus (according to the area marked with Hoechst) and around the entire cell excluding nucleus area (according to transmission image obtained by light microscopy). The nucleus/cytoplasm ratio for GSH in every cell analyzed was established by dividing the mean of green CMFDA fluorescence of nuclear area by the mean of CMFDA fluorescence in cytoplasmic area. We calculated the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio (n/c) using CMFDA fluorescence in three separate experiments (100 cells/condition). Aliquots of cell lysates (40 μg) were immediately boiled for 10 min to inactivate proteases and phosphatases, electrophoresed in SDS-10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and electroblotted (Bio-Rad) onto Immobilon-P nylon membranes (Invitrogen). Protein content was determined by a modified Lowry method (10Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 0.05g/ml skimmed milk in TBS-0.2% Tween 20 (TBST), washed three times at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against Id2 (1:1000) and p107 (1:1000) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBST with 0.05 g/ml bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the blots were washed again with TBST and further incubated for 1 h with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000) (Cell Signaling Technologies). After washing with TBST as above, blots were developed by using the LumiGLOl® reagent as specified by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technologies). 3T3 cells were subjected to nuclear protein extraction for the determination of protein oxidation and protein glutathiolation following the instructions for the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif North America). The efficiency of nuclear extraction was determined by measuring the relative activity of a cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, in the nuclei and in whole cell. Nuclear lactate dehydrogenase activity was less than 1.2% of the total cellular activity. To measure the level of nuclear protein oxidation, samples were lysed and derivatized, and Western blotting was performed according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. The level of nuclear protein oxidation was determined by the Oxy Blot protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon International), which detects carbonylated proteins. Nuclear lysates were obtained in the absence of reductive agents. Western blotting procedure was performed as described previously, and the membrane was probed against anti-glutathione antibody (1:1000; Virogen) at 4 °C overnight. Nuclear lysates were obtained, and Western blotting procedure was performed as described previously. Membrane was probed against anti-bcl2-antibody (1:1000; rabbit polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or, alternatively, against anti-GCS antibody (1:750; NeoMarkers, rabbit polyclonal antibody). Autoradiographic signals were assessed using a Fujifilm scanning densitometer (Fujifilm LAS-1000 plus). Cells were incubated for 30 min to 2 h with freshly prepared 20 μm p-trifluoromethoxycarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP; Sigma), loaded with CMFDA, PI, and Hoechst, and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described above. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. The statistical analysis was performed using the least significant difference test with analysis of variance. The null hypothesis is accepted for all numbers of those set in which F is nonsignificant at the level of p ≤ 0.05. We assessed the changes in nuclear GSH compartmentalization in different phases of the cell cycle. Twenty-four hours after plating, 3T3 fibroblasts begun to grow exponentially (Fig. 1); at 24 and 48 h after plating the percentage of cells at the S+M/G2 phase increased significantly (41 and 35%, respectively). At 72 h or later, cell growth slowed, and 6 days after plating, when the cells reached confluence, most of the cells (81%) were in the G0/G1 phase. GSH concentration in whole cells was maximal (20 nmol/106 cells) at 24 h after plating (Fig. 2A) when a high percentage of cells (41%) was entering or preparing for division. However when the cell population reached confluence (day 6) and most cells were quiescent, GSH concentration was at a low level (11 nmol/106 cells). We determined the GSH/GSSG ratio in cells during the cell cycle and found that it does not change significantly (see Fig. 2B). In view of these results, we studied whether nuclear distribution of GSH might have a role in the progression of the cell cycle during the early phases of cell culture. Fig. 3 shows the cell cycle-dependent GSH distribution in 3T3 fibroblasts. Six hours after plating, few cells could be seen on the plate (see Fig. 3, a and b). The blue staining of the nuclei with Hoechst 33342 is shown in Fig. 3b, and green (glutathione) staining is shown in panel c. Magnified detail of glutathione staining (Fig. 3d) shows that the highest fluorescence is located in the nucleus. We drew a white line throughout the cell field. The number of cells that the line crosses shows a quantification of the fluorescence per each cell. Fig. 3e shows that the nuclei blue staining (blue peaks in the graph) co-localizes with the green glutathione staining (green peaks in the graph) at the beginning of the culture. At 12 and 24 h of culture, cells continued to populate the plate. Cellular glutathione (CMFDA green fluorescence intensity) was maximal at 24 h. Analysis of the blue/green fluorescence (Fig. 3, b and d, respectively) distribution and intensity showed a maximum correlation of blue/green fluorescence at 24 h. When cells were confluent after 72 h or 5 days in culture, no correlation among the peaks of green and blue fluorescence could be found. The increase over culture time in total cellular staining for CMFDA correlated with the peak of glutathione concentration (20 nmol/106 cells) determined spectrophotometrically (see Fig. 2). As expected, green (GSH) fluorescence clearly decreased at 72 h and 5 days in culture when cell culture reached confluence, cell-to-cell growth inhibition took place, and as a consequence the cell population entered quiescence (70–80% G0/G1). At these stages no significant difference could be seen between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and there was a homogenous green (CMFDA) pattern on the plates. Thus, when cells started to grow, GSH was located mainly in the cell nucleus. However, when cell growth slowed, GSH distribution was homogenous throughout the cell. The capacity of the cell to concentrate GSH in the nucleus was estimated measuring the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, which was calculated after measuring the ratio in 100 cells one by one in each experiment. The results in Fig. 4 show a distribution pattern where the maximal nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (4.2 ± 0.8) was found very early after plating (6 h). Although a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for GSH was maintained during cell growth, as the culture progressed, a steady decrease in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was present. Once the cells reached confluence and most of them were in the G0/G1 phase, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for GSH was homogeneous, and no difference could be seen between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To ensure that most cells at 24 and 48 h in culture were in the S/M+G2 phase of the cell cycle, we studied Id2 and p107 expression patterns during cell growth. These proteins are overexpressed when cell division is active. The results in Fig. 5 show high Id2 and p107 expression at 24 and 48 h in culture, demonstrating that the cells divided at 24 and 48 h in culture. Expression of Id2 and p107 at 72 h of culture or later was very low. Mitochondrial GSH was not responsible for the areas of high CMFDA fluorescence. To test this we incubated fibroblasts with Hoechst to stain genomic DNA (in blue), CMFDA for GSH (green), and MitoTracker for mitochondrial staining (red) (see Fig. 6). A selection of images obtained along the z axis starting from the cell apex is shown in Fig. 6 (a representative experiment of three). The nuclear shape is clearly visible as is the presence of GSH in the nucleus. Mitochondrial distribution was perinuclear. To determine whether glutathione concentrates in the nucleus via an ATP-dependent mechanism, we incubated the cells with FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupling agent. The results shown in Fig. 7 suggest that glutathione concentrates in the nucleus by an ATP-independent process, because the glutathione distribution was similar in both treated and untreated cells. An additional possible explanation for the reported nuclear increase in GSH during the early phases of cell cycle would be the nuclear GSH synthesis. We studied the presence of the enzymes for GSH synthesis GCS and GSH synthetase. Fig. 8A shows a lack of expression of the rate-limiting enzyme GCS (11Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) in nuclear extracts, whereas samples from whole cells showed a marked expression. Thus, under our experimental conditions, the nuclear synthesis of GSH seems improbable. Fig. 8B shows the nuclear presence of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein that has been reported to increase nuclear glutathione (12Voehringer D.W. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Birsbay S. Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2956-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our result points to a correlation between the expression of Bcl-2 during the cell cycle and the distribution of cellular GSH. When cells are dividing (6 and 24 h of culture), the presence of nuclear Bcl-2 is high, but it decreases later (48 h and 5 days of culture) when cell growth stops. If nuclear GSH is high during the early phases of cell cycle and low when cells are confluent, nuclear oxidized proteins are likely to be higher during cell cycle arrest than at 6 h after culture. This is indeed the case as is shown in Fig. 9. If GSH is consumed by the reactive oxygen species in the nucleus, it will be converted into GSSG or other mixed disulfides and will not diffuse back to the cytoplasm as free GSH. Indeed, Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed the differences in the glutathiolation of nuclear proteins (Fig. 10); it was higher at 6 h after culture, when nuclear compartmentalization reached its maximum. As expected, when cells reached confluence and nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution was homogeneous, glutathiolation of nuclear proteins decreases. We reported previously that GSH regulates telomerase activity in cells in culture (8Borras C. Esteve J.M. Vina J.R. Sastre J. Vina J. Pallardo F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34332-34335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GSH increases in 3T3 fibroblasts before exponential cell growth. Peak telomerase activity takes place 24 h after plating and coincides with the maximal levels of GSH in cells. Thus, telomerase activity is maximal under reduced conditions. In view of these results and because telomerase exerts its activity in the nucleus, we decided to study GSH distribution in the cell nucleus before, during, and after exponential cell growth. Mercury orange, monochlorobimane, and CMFDA are the most commonly used probes for GSH determination, but the results obtained by these methods are conflicting. Pioneer work by Bellomo et al. (13Bellomo G. Vairetti M. Stivala L. Mirabelli F. Richelmi P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4412-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) using monochlorobimane-GSH conjugation showed a 3:1 nucleus:cytoplasm ratio. However, more recent reports by Briviba et al. (14Briviba K. Fraser G. Sies H. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that the high nuclear fluorescence was because of an influx of the fluorescent bimane-GSH adduct into the nucleus. Thomas et al. (15Thomas M. Nicklee T. Hedley D.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) used fractionation techniques and flow cytometry with mercury orange, as this probe readily forms fluorescent adducts with GSH and other non-protein sulfhydryls, reacting much more slowly with protein sulfhydryls. Contrary to the previous reports, they found lower GSH levels in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm, with a mean nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of 0.57 ± 0.05 (15Thomas M. Nicklee T. Hedley D.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). They suggested that there is a distinct pool of GSH in the nucleus because in their experiments GSH was partially resistant to buthionine sulfoximine depletion compared with the cytoplasm (15Thomas M. Nicklee T. Hedley D.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, Söderdahl et al. (5Söderdahl T. Enoksson M. Lundberg M. Holmgren A. Ottersen O.P. Orrenius S. Bolcsfoldi G. Cotgreave I.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed the highest GSH staining in a perinuclear mitochondria-rich compartment and low nuclear GSH staining using mercury orange and a specific GSH antibody. Finally, Voehringer et al. (12Voehringer D.W. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Birsbay S. Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2956-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) using CMFDA (which binds in 95% to GSH, see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 9Hedley D.W. Chow S. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) showed that GSH is distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, although Bcl-2 overexpression is able to increase nuclear GSH levels. In recent years new methods have become available to measure the nuclear redox state. These have been reviewed recently by Hansen et al. (16Hansen J.M. Go Y.M. Jones D.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 215-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Two forms of the redox blot have been developed to separate on the basis of different charge- or mass-oxidized nuclear proteins. Other techniques include antibodies that bind only to the oxidized form of the protein (17Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and mass spectrometry (18Kim J.R. Lee S.M. Cho S.H. Kim J.H. Kim B.H. Kwon J. Choi C.Y. Kim Y.D. Lee S.R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another recent approach to determining the nuclear redox state is the use of redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins. Although it is a promising step, until now no physiological oxidative treatment has been able to cause detectable changes in the excitation ratios of redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins (17Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Although the nuclear redox state (mainly thioredoxins) can be determined, the measurement of nuclear GSH concentrations is limited, and no methods are available to measure nuclear GSSG (17Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). To study glutathione compartmentalization in 3T3 fibroblasts during cell growth, we used a triple staining (CMFDA-Hoechst-propidium iodide) or (CMFDA-Hoechst-MitoTracker) by confocal microscopy analysis. Figs. 3E and 6 show that GSH co-localized with the nuclei at 6, 12, and 24 h after plating. However, when cells were confluent, at 3 and 5 days after plating, no differences between the nucleus and cytoplasm could be seen. The images obtained at 3 or 5 days in culture are similar to those reported previously by Söderdahl et al. (5Söderdahl T. Enoksson M. Lundberg M. Holmgren A. Ottersen O.P. Orrenius S. Bolcsfoldi G. Cotgreave I.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using GSH antibody and mercury orange. Thus, our results may explain the apparent discrepancies in the GSH distribution. It is very important to take into account the moment of the cell cycle in which glutathione distribution is studied. We show here that cells that are preparing to divide have high nuclear GSH levels. Quiescent cells have similar (or even lower) GSH levels in the nucleus than the cytoplasm. Fig. 3 shows higher GSH levels in the nucleus of the cells early after plating. The availability of GSH in cellular compartments is determined by a complex equilibrium between utilization, transport, synthesis, glutathiolation of proteins, and reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and GS-SX GSSG plus mixed disulfides. The regulation of such interactions is unclear. According to Smith et al. (19Smith C.V. Jones D.P. Guenthner T.M. Lash L.H. Lauterburg B.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the possible biochemical mechanisms responsible for the turnover of nuclear GSH are: 1)GSH may be taken up from the cytoplasm into the nuclei either passively or through energy dependent processes; 2) GSH may be synthesized de novo in the nucleus by the enzymes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH synthetase; 3) GSH may function to transport γ-Glu-Cys-Cys. Ho and Guenthner (20Ho Y.F. Guenthner T.M. Toxicologist. 1994; 14: 178Google Scholar), using nuclear fractions from liver, concluded that GSH is taken up by the nucleus by passive diffusion, and no evidence for an ATP-dependent mechanism for GSH concentration was observed. According to Ho and Guenthner (20Ho Y.F. Guenthner T.M. Toxicologist. 1994; 14: 178Google Scholar) γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH synthetase activities were found in nuclei. About 4–8% of the GSH synthetic activity of the cell was found in the nucleus, maintaining nuclear GSH levels (20Ho Y.F. Guenthner T.M. Toxicologist. 1994; 14: 178Google Scholar). The role of ATP-dependent mechanisms in maintaining the nuclear/cytoplasmic GSH concentration was studied by Bellomo et al. (13Bellomo G. Vairetti M. Stivala L. Mirabelli F. Richelmi P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4412-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Bellomo G. Palladini G. Vairetti M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 36: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using culture hepatocytes pretreated with the uncoupler protonophore CCCP. After 20 min of incubation the nuclear/cytoplasmic GSH gradient disappeared, but the total GSH content remain unchanged. In fibroblasts, we did not find an ATP-dependent mechanism or γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase in the cell nucleus. Different authors reported that overexpression of Bcl-2 leads to higher cellular levels of GSH (12Voehringer D.W. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Birsbay S. Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Van Dierendonck J.H. Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported that high nuclear Bcl-2 expression correlates with higher nuclear GSH levels in rat CC531 colorectal cancer cells. Thus, we suggest that during the changes in the nuclear membrane that precede the cell division, nuclear Bcl-2 could allow the specific translocation of selected substances, among them glutathione, to the cell nucleus. It has been reported that Bcl-2 is associated with nuclear pore complexes (29Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). Thus Bcl-2 has been suggested as an ideal candidate for catching proteins as they cross the nuclear envelope (30Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). A number of physiopathological situations unravel the importance of nuclear GSH. Atzori et al. (31Atzori L. Dypbukt J.M. Hybbinette S.S. Moldeus P. Grafstrom R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated variations in the amount and redox state of cellular thiols, particularly reduced glutathione, supporting a role for thiols in the regulation of growth and squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells. In a similar fashion, depletion of nuclear GSH to 50–60% of its initial value prior to irradiation (400 centigray) resulted in nuclear DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, suggesting that GSH plays a critical protective role in maintaining nuclear functional integrity and in determining the intrinsic radiosensitivity of cells (32Morales A. Miranda M. Sanchez-Reyes A. Biete A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1998; 42: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thalidomide became sadly famous in the 1950s because of its ability to cause human birth defects, mainly limb reduction malformations (phocomelia) (33McBride W.G. Lancet. 1961; 21358Abstract Scopus (814) Google Scholar). A rat thalidomide-resistant and a rabbit thalidomide-sensitive species were used to compare potential differences among limb bud cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that glutathione distribution determined by CMFDA staining was different in these cell types. Thalidomide induced cytosolic GSH depletion in both cell lines; however, nuclear GSH levels remained high in the rat thalidomide-resistant cells but not in the rabbit thalidomide-sensitive cells. Hansen et al. suggest that a redox shift in the nucleus may result in the misregulation of interactions between transcription factors and DNA causing defective growth and development (34Hansen J.M. Harris K.K. Philbert M.A. Harris C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thalidomide is used today as an inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Chen et al. (35Chen J. Delannoy M. Odwin S. He P. Trush M.A. Yager J.D. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 75: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported the specific role of nuclear GSH in preventing apoptosis and its importance in estrogen action. An important number of nuclear proteins, including transcription factors, require a reduced environment to bind to DNA. More than 62 proteins are involved directly in transcription, nucleotide metabolism, (de)phosphorylation, or (de)ubiquitinylation, which are all essential processes for cell cycle progression (36Conour J.E. Graham W.V. Gaskins H.R. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 18: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). According to Jang and Surh (37Jang J.H. Surh Y.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) nuclear GSH may act as a transcriptional regulator of NF-κB, AP-1, and p53 by altering their nuclear redox state. Toledano et al. (21Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) found a redox-dependent shift of oxyR-DNA contacts along genomic DNA, suggesting a mechanism for differential promoter selection. For a review of the importance of a reduced nucleus and the role of nuclear GSH, see Conour et al. (36Conour J.E. Graham W.V. Gaskins H.R. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 18: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that cells need a reduced nuclear environment provided by glutathione to proliferate (see Fig. 11). Indeed, the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio is high several hours after plating. Thus, glutathione translocates to the nucleus before exponential cell growth. When cells reach confluence, at 3 and 5 days after plating, GSH distribution is similar in both of the cell compartments, nucleus and cytoplasm. The phase of the cell cycle must be taken into account when studying cellular and/or nuclear GSH levels. Thus our results demonstrate that the cell nucleus suffers dramatic changes in its oxidative status and underscore the role of nuclear glutathione in the physiology of the cell cycle."

MCs are the only cells that express mMCP-6, and this serine protease is particularly abundant in those MCs that reside in the peritoneal cavity, skin, and lung (4Reynolds D.S. Stevens R.L. Lane W.S.

A. 1994; 91: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Numerous biochemical studies have been carried out to understand the biosynthesis and substrate preference of mMCP-6. This tryptase is initially translated as a zymogen with a 245-mer mature domain. When the signal and propeptides are proteolytically removed, the mature protease spontaneously forms tetramers with the active site of each monomer facing the central core of the tetramer unit, as first described for its human ortholog (11Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A positively charged face forms on the surface of each monomer, thereby allowing mature mMCP-6 to interact with negatively charged serglycin proteoglycans in the Golgi complex. The resulting tryptase-serglycin macromolecular complexes are then targeted and packaged in the cell secretory granules. When exocytosed, these complexes are retained in connective tissues for hours because of their large sizes (12Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J. F.,Šali, A. Gurish M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors are abundant in blood. Nevertheless, no circulating protease inhibitor has been identified that rapidly inactivates mMCP-6 or hTryptase β1. Substrate specificity studies carried out using varied peptide combinatorial libraries revealed that recombinant mMCP-6 (7Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J.

However, due to the unique structural constraints of the tetramer unit, the abilities of mMCP-6 and hTryptase β1 to cleave large-sized proteins are very limited. Thus, the importance of these evolutionally conserved enzymes in MC-dependent reactions remains to be determined. MC development in vivo is highly dependent on the cytokine kit ligand/stem cell factor on the surface of mesenchymal cells and its tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit/CD117 on the surface of MC-committed progenitors. Signaling through c-Kit results in the translocation of microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) into the nucleus. WBB6F1 -KitW/KitW-v (W/Wv) mice are MC-deficient secondary to a point mutation in the intracellular domain of c-kit, which makes their MCs and progenitors less responsive to kit ligand. WBB6F1-tg/tg (tg/tg) mice, on the other hand, have reduced numbers of MCs, because they express a mutated isoform of MITF. Thus, transcription of the mMCP-6 gene and certain other MC-restricted genes are greatly diminished in MITF-deficient tg/tg mice (13Morii E. Oboki K. Ishihara K. Jippo T. Hirano T. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2004; 104: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In 1996, Echtenacher et al. (14Echtenacher B. Maaönnel D.N. Huöltner L. Nature. 1996; 381: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) noted that W/Wv mice quickly die from septic peritonitis after their caecum is ligated and punctured. Malaviya et al. (15Malaviya R. Ikeda T. Ross E. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1996; 381: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) reported at the same time that W/Wv mice cannot efficiently combat a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection of their peritoneal cavities or lungs. The same phenomenon was observed in tg/tg mice (16Jippo T. Morii E. Ito A. Kitamura Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), confirming the importance of MCs in innate immunity. The latter data suggest that a MC-restricted gene whose transcription is highly dependent on MITF plays an essential immunoprotective role in bacterial infections. Although it has been concluded that MC-derived tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is needed to control bacterial infections (14Echtenacher B. Maaönnel D.N. Huöltner L. Nature. 1996; 381: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 15Malaviya R. Ikeda T. Ross E. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1996; 381: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), the number of TNF-α-expressing lipopolysaccharide-responsive macrophages in the lungs and peritoneal cavities of bacteria-infected mice greatly exceeds the number of MCs. There is also no evidence that MITF regulates the transcription of the TNF-α gene in any cell. Thus, additional factors more restricted to MCs must be required for an optimal antibacterial response in vivo to explain why MC-deficient mice are so susceptible to bacterial challenge. In support of this conclusion, Maurer et al. (17Maurer M. Echtenacher B. Huöltner L. Kollias G. Maaönnel D.N. Langley K.E. Galli S.J. J. Exp.

We have here described the generation of an mMCP-6–/– mouse strain. Using these mice, we have shown that mMCP-6 is required to efficiently combat K. pneumoniae infections. Targeting of the mMCP-6 Locus in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells and Generation of the mMCP-6–/– Mouse Strain—The mMCP-6 gene (GenBankTM gene identification number 17229) resides in the tryptase locus on mouse chromosome 17A3.3 (18Wong G.W. Yasuda S. Morokawa N. Li L. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2438-2452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using the bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP24–263I14 (Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, CA) and oligonucleotides based on the genomic sequence of the chromosomal locus at GenBankTM accession number NT_039649, a PCR approach was carried out to obtain the mMCP-6-specific nucleotide sequences for the targeting vector shown in Fig. 1A. Employing the translation initiation site of the mMCP-6 transcript as a reference point (defined here as residue +1), a 2970-bp 5′ homology arm (nucleotides –2966 to +3) was cloned into the BglII-HindIII sites of the pKO Scrambler NTK-1907 plasmid (Stratagene) downstream of the phosphoglucokinase promoter-driven neomycin resistance gene (PGK-Neo). A 3196-bp 3′ homology arm (nucleotides +897 to +4092) was then cloned into the SalI-NotI sites upstream of PGK-Neo. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cDNA driven by a mutant polyomavirus enhancer (MC1-TK) is present in this plasmid for negative selection. A mouse expressing Cre recombinase (Cre) under the control of an MC-specific promoter has not yet been created to selectively diminish the expression of ubiquitously expressed genes using a Cre/loxP approach. Because mMCP-6 is highly restricted to MCs, a knock-in approach was carried out by placing Cre with a SV40 poly(A) signal at the 3′ end of the 5′ homology arm using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites. The linearized targeting vector was electroporated into 129svJ × C57BL/6J F1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cell clones that underwent homologous recombination were identified by blot analysis of BglI-digested ES cell DNA hybridized with a radiolabeled probe generated with Klenow polymerase using as template a 1-kb 3′ external fragment (nucleotides +4285 to +5283). Positive clones were confirmed by PCR with a primer located upstream of the 5′ homology arm (5′-GATCCGACCTTGAACATGGATAGC-3′) and another located in the Cre coding region (5′-GGACAGAAGCATTTTCCAGGTATGC-3′). Selected ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6J-Tyrc-2j/J (The Jackson Laboratory) blastocysts, which were then implanted into pseudopregnant CD-1 foster mothers. Resulting male chimeric mice were crossed with C57BL/6J-Tyrc-2j/J females, and non-albino pups from this cross were screened for germ line transmission of the mutant mMCP-6 allele. Genotyping was carried out on tail biopsies by multiplex PCR using oligonucleotides within the 5′ homology arm (P1, 5′-CCTGAAGCAGAGTAACCAAGC-3′), within the deleted portion of the mMCP-6 gene (P2, 5′-AGGGCTCAAGACAACTTACGAG-3′), and within the Cre coding region (P3, 5′-CTGGCAATTTCGGCTATACG-3′). mMCP-6 heterozygotes were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice to eliminate any mutated background gene in our mMCP-6–/– mice. Using a marker-assisted selection protocol/speed-congenic approach, a male mMCP-6+/– mouse expressing 100% of C57BL/6 polymorphisms at 50 chromosomal loci was identified in the third backcrossed generation. This mouse was selected as the founder of a line that was backcrossed three more times before generating the mMCP-6+/+, mMCP-6+/–, and mMCP-6–/– littermates used in this study. All mice were maintained in a BL2 animal facility of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center according to their animal care guidelines. Isolation and Purification of In Vivo Differentiated MCs— MCs were isolated from the peritoneal cavity. After euthanasia with CO2, 10 ml of modified Tyrode’s buffer was injected into the peritoneal cavity. Eight to nine ml of the injected solution was recovered in each instance, and the resulting exudates were centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of modified Tyrode’s buffer and layered over a 2-ml solution of 22.5% metrizamide (Nycomed/Accurate Chemical) in modified Tyrode’s buffer. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 15 min, peritoneal MCs were recovered at the bottom of the gradient. Purification was confirmed by toluidine blue staining or by flow cytometry with anti-c-kit/CD117 (Pharmingen) and anti-FcɛRIα (eBioscience) antibodies. Immunoblot Analysis—Peritoneal MCs were lysed by freeze thawing in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE with 4–15% linear gradient Ready Gels (Bio-Rad). The resulting blots were probed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide antibodies specific for mMCP-4, mMCP-5, and mMCP-6 (12Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J.

Peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and SuperSignal West Pico ECL substrate (Pierce) were used for protein detection. Membranes were stripped at 65 °C for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS; they were then reprobed with an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody (Abcam) to serve as a protein loading control. Electron Microscopy—Isolated peritoneal MCs from four mMCP-6+/+ mice and four mMCP-6–/– mice (∼5 × 104 cells/sample) were separately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h followed by 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Samples were dehydrated, embedded in AralditeTM (Huntsman Advanced Materials), sectioned at 100 nm with an ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined with a JEOL 200CX electron microscope. Cell profiles from each section were photographed using an unbiased random sampling technique. Twenty cell profiles from seven samples from each group were examined. The fraction of cell profiles identified morphologically as MCs (e.g. by the presence of their characteristic electron-dense granules, non-segmented nucleus, and surface microplicae) was assessed by unbiased stereology (22Royet J.P. Prog. Neurobiol. 1991; 37: 433-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The volume fraction (which represents the fraction of the total volume of the cell occupied by granules) and the surface density (which is directly proportional to the membrane surface of the granules per unit of volume) were calculated with the point-counting method using a cycloid grid. The area of the cell profiles was measured using a point grid. Cell Count and Differential—Peritoneal lavages from four mMCP-6+/+ mice and four mMCP-6–/– mice were obtained but not subjected to MC purification. The nucleated cells in each sample were counted with a Neubauer chamber, and the cell differential was determined on cytospins of 400 μl of each 8-ml sample stained with Wright-Giemsa. Fluorescence Microscopy—Ears from four mMCP-6+/+ mice and four mMCP-6–/– mice were excised, fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0), dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Avidin binds strongly to the heparin-containing serglycin proteoglycans in the MC secretory granules. Thus, 10 random 5-μm cross-sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-avidin and Hoechst (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, respectively) for 1 h at 25 °C, and then mounted with Fluoromount (Diagnostic BioSystems). Images were acquired in a fluorescent microscope with the appropriate fluorescent filters (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, green fluorescent protein, and Texas Red). Taking advantage of the autofluorescence of the cartilage, epidermis, and muscle observed in the red channel, we delineated the dermis of the ears as tissue between two epidermal layers excluding all muscle and cartilage in Image Pro Plus. All dermal FITC-avidin+ cells with a Hoechst+ nucleus were counted. Results were expressed as the number of MCs/mm2 of dermis. Histamine and Cytokine Release from Peritoneal MCs—Isolated peritoneal MCs from four mMCP-6+/+ mice and four mMCP-6–/– mice were counted and resuspended individually. In each experiment, 105 MCs were sensitized in medium containing 5 μg/ml anti-2,4-dinitrophenol (anti-DNP) IgE (clone SPE-7; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h at 37 °C. After washing to eliminate excess antibody, cells were activated immunologically with 100 ng/ml DNP-conjugated human serum albumin (DNP-HSA; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C. For histamine release, an equal amount of cells was lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100, and histamine was measured in each supernatant and lysate after 1 h. For TNF-α release, samples of the supernatants were taken at 0, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h. Histamine and TNF-α levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Oxford Biomedical Research). Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis (PCA)—10–12-week-old mMCP-6+/+, mMCP-6+/–, mMCP-6–/–, and B6.Cg-KitW-sh/KitW-sh (Wsh/Wsh) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. 100 ng of both anti-DNP IgE and anti-dansyl IgE (Pharmingen) in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were then injected intradermally into the right and left ear pinnae, respectively. Two days later, the treated mice were challenged intravenously with 100 μg of DNP-HSA in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Evans blue. The mice were euthanized 30 min later, and their ears were excised and incubated in 150 μlof formamide at 55 °C for 24 h. Absorbance of Evans blue in each supernatant was read at 610 nm using a μQuant universal microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Bacterial Infection—K. pneumoniae (line 43816; American Type Culture Collection) were grown to confluence on 100-mm2 Difco nutrient agar plates (Pharmingen) overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The bacteria were harvested, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to 2 × 103 colony-forming units (CFUs)/ml and 2 × 104 CFUs/ml. 10–12-week-old anesthetized mMCP-6+/+, mMCP-6+/–, and mMCP-6–/– littermate mice were inoculated by intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of the bacterial suspensions. For survival, animals were monitored every 3–6 h up to 72 h post-infection. For cell and bacterial counts and cytokine measurements, mice were euthanized 0, 0.5, 4, and 24 h after inoculation. The peritoneal cavity of each animal was lavaged, and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. Aliquots of both samples were resuspended in erythrocyte-lysis buffer (0.15 m ammonium chloride, 0.01 m potassium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). Nucleated cells were counted with a Neubauer chamber, and the cell differential was determined by examination of cytospins or blood smears stained with Wright-Giemsa. Other aliquots were serially diluted and plated onto 100-mm2 Difco nutrient agar plates. The bacterial colonies were counted 24 h later. The rest of the peritoneal lavages were centrifuged, and the concentrations of TNF-α and interleukin-6 in the samples were determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (Pierce SearchLight Mulitplex Array Analysis Service). Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. The normal distribution of the samples was confirmed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test before comparing the means by the two-tail paired Student’s t test. Generation and Characterization of a Novel mMCP-6–/– Mouse Strain—Some mouse strains, including C57BL/6, do not express mMCP-7 (23Hunt J.E. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Zhang J. Xia Z. Ghildyal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2851-2855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, all MC-sufficient mouse strains examined to date express mMCP-6. Thus, to address the role of mMCP-6 and its human ortholog in MC development and function, we used a homologous recombination approach to generate a novel mMCP-6-null strain on a C57BL/6 mouse genetic background (Fig. 1). The targeting construct used in these experiments is shown in Fig. 1A. We replaced the three coding exons downstream of the translation initiation site of the mMCP-6 gene with the cDNA that encodes Cre recombinase. The resulting mutated mMCP-6 gene will lack critical amino acids, including the codon that encodes the essential catalytic triad residue His75. Thus, no functional mMCP-6 protein can be expressed even if a truncated transcript is generated. Genotyping of the resulting cloned ES cells and mutant animals confirmed the targeted disruption of the mMCP-6 gene (Fig. 1, B and C). In agreement with the genotyping data, the levels of mMCP-6 protein were below detection in the MCs that resided in the peritoneal cavities of these transgenic mice (Fig. 1D). The antibody we used was raised against a unique 19-mer peptide (RKYHTGLYTGDDFPIVHDG) that corresponds to residues 160–178 in the mature domain of the protease (12Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J. F.,Šali, A. Gurish M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This amino acid sequence is encoded by the next to the last exon of the mMCP-6 gene, which was not deleted by our targeting strategy. Given that no smaller protein bands were detected with this anti-mMCP-6 antibody in MC lysates from mMCP-6+/– and mMCP-6–/– mice (data not shown), we concluded that a truncated protein was not expressed. Our mMCP-6–/– mice produced normal-sized litters, showed no obvious developmental abnormality, and had a normal lifespan when maintained in a pathogen-free animal facility. Histochemical analysis revealed normal numbers of MCs in the skin and peritoneal cavity (Fig. 2). The peritoneal MCs isolated from these mice also showed no substantial alteration in their size or shape or in the number, size, and density of their secretory granules (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Thus, even though mMCP-6 is expressed relatively early in MC development (5Reynolds D.S. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3847-3853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this neutral protease is not essential for the migration, retention, and overall maturation of MC-committed progenitors in connective tissues.TABLE 1Quantitation and morphometry of cutaneous and peritoneal MCsmMCP-6+/+mMCP-6-/-Skin MCsaFITC-avidin+ cells with a Hoechst+ nuclear profile/mm2 of dermis in random sections of ear (10 samples/animal).(number/mm2)189 ± 8183 ± 8Peritoneal MCsbNeubauer chamber counts and Wright-Giemsa staining of cytospins of peritoneal lavages (3 samples/animal).(%)9.1 ± 1.29.3 ± 1.4(103/ml)171 ± 14164 ± 12MorphometrycStereological analysis of randomly acquired electron microscopy images from peritoneal MCs.

Open table in a new tab Peritoneal MCs store substantial amounts of the chymotrypsin-like proteases mMCP-4 and mMCP-5 in their secretory granules in addition to the tryptase mMCP-6 (4Reynolds D.S.

As assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis, the amounts of mMCP-4 and mMCP-5 stored in the peritoneal MCs in our mMCP-6–/– mice were not decreased (Fig. 1D). If anything, the levels of mMCP-5 protein increased in the peritoneal cavity MCs of these mice, presumably due to the availability of more serglycin/proteoglycan-binding sites in the secretory granule. These MCs also contained normal levels of histamine (data not shown). Thus, the lack of mMCP-6 in a connective tissue-type MC does not adversely impact the storage of other mediators in the cell secretory granules. Activated MCs from mMCP-6–/– Mice Release Appreciable Amounts of TNF-α and Histamine and Induce a Normal PCA Reaction—Isolated peritoneal MCs from our mMCP-6+/+ and mMCP-6–/– mice were sensitized with IgE and challenged with antigen in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A, no significant difference in the secretion of TNF-α between the two groups was noted over the course of 24 h. Similarly, no difference in the exocytosis of histamine at 1 h was observed (Fig. 3B). MCs play a critical role in the in vivo PCA reaction, and it has been concluded that the most important vasopermeability mediators secreted from activated MCs in this IgE/antigen-dependent response are histamine, serotonin, platelet-activating factor, and cysteinyl leukotrienes (24Inagaki N. Goto S. Yamasaki M. Nagai H. Koda A. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1986; 80: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Weg V.B. Watson M.L. Cordeiro R.S. Williams T.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 204: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found, as have others, that the PCA reaction is markedly reduced in MC-deficient Wsh/Wsh mice relative to wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 3C). Because mMCP-6–/– mice had a PCA reaction comparable with that of their control littermates, we concluded that mMCP-6 does not play a critical role in the FcɛRI-dependent activation of MCs and their release of histamine and other vasopermeability factors. Innate Immunity Is Significantly Diminished in mMCP-6–/– Mice—Despite having normal MC numbers, morphology and secretory responses, and intact FcɛRI-dependent reactions, our mMCP-6-null mice exhibited the striking phenotype of a sub-stantially reduced ability to combat K. pneumoniae infections of their peritoneal cavities. Only ∼10% of our mMCP-6–/– mice survived 72 h after receiving just 1000 CFUs of K. pneumoniae (Fig. 4A), compared with ∼40% of mMCP-6+/– and ∼80% of mMCP-6+/+ mice. Confirming these results, no mMCP-6–/– mice survived a challenge with 10,000 CFUs of K. pneumoniae (Fig. 4B). This increased lethality was associated with a deficiency in the early extravasation of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavities of mMCP-6–/– mice (Fig. 5A). This deficit was independent of the number of circulating neutrophils, which were almost identical between mMCP-6+/+ and mMCP-6–/– mice throughout the course of the infection (data not shown) but correlated with higher bacterial counts in the peritoneum and blood of mice deficient in mMCP-6 (Fig. 5B and data not shown).FIGURE 5Neutrophil recruitment and bacterial load during peritoneal K. pneumoniae infection. mMCP-6+/+ and mMCP-6–/– mice received 103 CFUs of K. pneumoniae intraperitoneally and were studied at different time points. A, the number of neutrophils in each peritoneal fluid sample was calculated from total cell counts in a Neubauer chamber and differentials in cytospins stained with Wright-Giemsa. mMCP-6–/– animals show a deficit in the early recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection (***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0."
https://openalex.org/W2042583579,"Tumor cell invasion is a primary event in the metastatic progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our recent results indicate a concordant elevated expression of osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in primary metastatic HCC. This study hypothesizes an MMP-9-directed cleavage of OPN that biologically contributes to HCC metastasis. We found that MMP-9 cleaved OPN into specific fragments in vitro, of which three could be identified by Edman degradation amino-acid sequencing. One of these fragments (OPN-5 kDa, residues 167-210) induced low-metastatic HCC cellular invasion via CD44 receptors, which was effectively blocked by the addition of small peptides within the region of OPN-5 kDa. Increased expression of an OPN splice variant (OPN-c) was associated with clinical metastatic HCC. Overexpression of OPN-c with physiological levels of MMP-9 enhanced cellular invasion and coincided with elevated OPN-5 kDa levels. Our data suggest that an alternative splicing event (OPN-c) promotes extracellular cleavage of OPN by MMP-9, thus releasing a distinct region of OPN (OPN-5 kDa) that is essential for HCC cellular invasion and appears to correlate with metastatic potential. The findings of this study may help to improve advanced-stage HCC prognosis and suggest the utility of small peptides for novel therapies."

The immediate effect of energy depletion is a transient activation of the pathway due to inhibition of the mTORC1/S6K1 axis, which in turn prevents the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at inhibitory phosphorylation sites (12Tzatsos A.

Following its immediate activation, the pathway is repressed because of subsequent inhibitory events, which are not well understood to date. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway by prolonged energy depletion promotes apoptosis. IRS-1 plays a central role in the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway by insulin and insulin-like growth factor I signals. In addition to its role in PI 3-kinase/Akt activation, IRS-1 also plays an important role in a feedback loop that inhibits the pathway. The feedback loop is triggered by mTORC1/S6K1, which is activated by insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, or nutrients (12Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Mol. Cell.

In addition to mTORC1/S6K1, other kinases such as JNK and IκB kinase-β also phosphorylate IRS-1 at inhibitory sites in the course of various pathological conditions such as inflammation and diabetes (16Shoelson S.E. Lee J. Goldfine A.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The importance of IRS-1 in both the activation and the inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway by insulin and insulin-like growth factor I raised the question whether it may contribute to the inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway during energy stress. Previous studies have shown that activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside in C2C12 myoblasts (17Jakobsen S.N. Hardie D.G. Morrice N. Tornqvist H.E. J. Biol.

However, the natural stimuli that trigger phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 remained unknown. Moreover the biological significance of this phosphorylation event remained undetermined with one study suggesting that it promotes (17Jakobsen S.N. Hardie D.G. Morrice N. Tornqvist H.E. J. Biol.

The work in this study focused on the nature, regulation, and biological significance of the events leading to the inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway during energy stress. Our data show that energy depletion induced by glucose deprivation, hypoxia, inhibition of ATP synthesis in mitochondria, oxidative stress, and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) activated AMPK, which binds to and phosphorylates IRS-1 at Ser-794. Glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and inhibition of ATP synthesis stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 primarily via the α2 subunit of AMPK in an LKB1-dependent manner, whereas oxidative stress and 2-DG stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at the same site primarily via the α1 subunit perhaps in a CaMKKβ-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 induced by energy depletion inhibited the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and promoted apoptosis by suppressing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Cell Culture—To engineer HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type IRS-1 or the mutants S794A and S794D, cells were transfected with pCMVhis-IRS-1-WT, pCMVhis-IRS-1-S794D, or pCMVhis-IRS-1-S794A constructs. Transfected cells were selected for 10 days in 10 mm histidinol (Sigma). Pooled clones were analyzed from three independent transfections. Stably transfected HEK293 cells express ∼5 times more IRS-1 compared with non-transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). LKB1–/– 3T3 fibroblasts as well as the retroviral expressing vectors pBabe-LKB1-WT (wild type) and pBabe-LKB1-KD (kinase-deficient) were kindly provided by Dr. N. Bardeesy (Massachusetts General Hospital) (20Bardeesy N. Sinha M. Hezel A.F. Signoretti S. Hathaway N.A. Sharpless N.E. Loda M. Carrasco D.R. DePinho R.A. Nature. 2002; 419: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected for 5 days in 2–3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Pooled clones were analyzed. The myoblast cell line L6 was grown to subconfluency in DMEM containing 20% FBS and antibiotics. NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. In all experiments, cells were grown in high glucose (25 mm) DMEM (catalog number 11995-065, Invitrogen). For glucose and amino acid starvation experiments we used low glucose (5 mm) DMEM (catalog number 11885-084, Invitrogen), glucose-free DMEM (catalog number 11966-025, Invitrogen), or Hanks' balanced salt solution (amino-acid free, 5 mm glucose; catalog number 24020-17, Invitrogen). In some experiments we starved cells in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (12 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (catalog number 126575, Calbiochem), pH 7.4) supplemented with glucose, amino acids, or both as indicated under “Results” and in the figure legends. Expression Constructs—Site-directed mutagenesis of pCMVhis-IRS-1-WT was carried out using overlap extension PCR. Amino acid numbering refers to the human isoform. To mutate the Ser-794 into aspartic acid or alanine we used the primers 5′-CGTCTCTCTTCAGACTCTGGACGC-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCTCTTCAGCATCTGGACGC-3′, respectively. Mutated nucleotides are underlined. The outer IRS-1 primers IRS-1 1338–1359Forward (5′-CACACCCCACCAGCCAGGGGT-3′) and IRS-1 3189–3159Reverse (5′-TCCCAGCAAGGAAGAGTGAGC-3′) were designed to span two unique BlpI sites. To generate the pCMV-Myc-IRS-1-S794D and pCMV-Myc-IRS-1-S794A constructs we digested the plasmids described in the previous step with XhoI and SalI restriction enzymes, and we subcloned the fragments produced in the XhoI and HindIII sites of the previously described pCMV-Myc-IRS-1 (12Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The human AMPK αI catalytic subunit was cloned from HepG2 cells using the following primers: sense, 5′-ATATATATGAATTCGCGACAGCCGAGAAGCAGAAACACGAC-3′; and antisense, 5′-ATATATATTCTAGAAAATTATTGTGCAAGAATTTTAATTAGATTTGC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-vector (Promega). Following sequencing the PCR product was subcloned to a modified pCMV5-Myc vector with EcoRI and XbaI sites to generate pCMV-Myc-AMPK-α1. The pcDNA3-Myc-AMPK-α2-WT and pcDNA3-Myc-AMPK-α2-KD expression constructs were provided by Dr. M. Birnbaumn. Short Interference RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNA against the human LKB1, the human AMPK α1 and α2 catalytic subunits, and the human IRS-1 were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and they were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out using a final siRNA concentration of 80 nm. To knock down both the α1 and the α2 subunits of AMPK simultaneously, cells were transfected with a mixture of the two siRNAs (final concentration of 40 nm for each one, 80 nm combined). Transfection efficiency, measured with the use of a fluorescein-conjugated control nonspecific siRNA (Cell Signaling Technology catalog number 6201), was higher than 90%. Cells were grown for 48–60 h before each experiment. Antibodies—Anti-AMPK α1 and α2 antibodies were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-AMPK antibody (it recognizes both the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits of AMPK) was bought from Cell Signaling Technology. Hif-1α antibody was bought from BD Transduction Laboratories. p85α antibody was bought from Upstate. All other antibodies, including secondary antibodies, were bought from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 nm okadaic acid supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 0.5–1 mg of a given lysate was mixed overnight via gentle agitation with 1–2 μg of specific or nonspecific antibodies coupled to protein A- or G-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to Western blot analysis using standard Western blotting protocols. Measurement of IRS-1-associated PI 3-Kinase Activity—IRS-1 immune complexes, immunoprecipitated from cell lysates as described above, were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with buffer A (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm LiCl, 2 mm Na3VO4), once with buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4), and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The washed beads were then mixed with 45 μl of kinase buffer, 5 μl of sonicated lipid substrate (phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (1:1) (from Avanti Polar Lipids) in a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA)), and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCI. Lipids were extracted and spotted on potassium oxalate-treated silica gel TLC plates (250-μm layer; catalog number 4420221, Whatman) and separated in chloroform, methanol, acetone, acetic acid, H2O (60:20:23:18:12, v/v/v/v/v). The plates were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Annexin V Staining—To measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) we used the MitoProbe™ 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine iodide (DiIC1) (5Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) assay kit (catalog number M34151, Molecular Probes) as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly cells (including floating cells) grown in 12-well plates were collected following mild trypsinization. Trypsinized cells were washed once with PBS, and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. Resuspended cells were labeled with 50 nm DiIC1 (5Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) (excitation/emission, 638/658 nm) at 37 °C in the dark for 20–30 min. Labeled cells were washed once in PBS, and they were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a CyAn (Dako Cytomation) high performance flow cytometer. To measure apoptosis we used the Annexin V fluorescein staining kit (catalog number A13199, Molecular Probes) as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells treated as described in the previous paragraph were collected following mild trypsinization. Trypsinized cells were washed once with PBS, and they were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin binding buffer mixed with 5 μl of Annexin V fluorescein conjugate (excitation/emission, 494/518 nm). Resuspended cells were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Labeled cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. All flow cytometry data were analyzed using Summit Version 3.1 software. Cell Proliferation Assay—To measure changes in the number of live cells, we used the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; catalog number M5655, Sigma) assay. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the wild-type IRS-1 or the S794A IRS-1 mutant were seeded at 104 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates. Sixteen hours later, cells were cultured in glucose- or serum-free media for an additional 48 h period as indicated under “Results” and in the figure legends. Then cells were placed in complete medium containing MTT at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml for an additional 2-h period. Absorbance was measured with a Bio-Rad Benchmark microplate reader at 490 nm. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired two-tailed t tests. Western blot band densitometry was done with IGOR Pro software (Wavemetrics, Inc.). Energy Depletion Induces Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 and Down-regulates IRS-1 Expression—Energy depletion is defined as an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio, and it can be caused by a variety of factors such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia, inhibition of ATP synthesis in the mitochondria, oxidative stress, and 2-DG. Fig. 1A demonstrates that in L6 myoblasts glucose deprivation induced phosphorylation of the AMPK kinase on Thr-172 and inhibited the mTORC1 pathway. In addition, glucose deprivation stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 with kinetics similar to the kinetics of phosphorylation of AMPK. Phosphorylation in response to glucose deprivation was not affected by insulin stimulation (supplemental Fig. S1) and was amino acid-independent (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown). Long term glucose deprivation also down-regulated the expression of endogenous IRS-1 whose levels decreased with a half-life of ∼9 h (Fig. 1A), whereas amino acid depletion alone did not affect IRS-1 expression (data not shown). Therefore, in L6 myoblasts a glucose-dependent pathway regulates both the phosphorylation and expression of IRS-1. To explore the mechanism of IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-794 and to determine its functional significance we needed to establish a system in which glucose deprivation would not induce the down-regulation of IRS-1. To this end, we engineered HEK293 cells stably expressing IRS-1 under the constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter. HEK293 cells normally express IRS-1 at very low levels. Fig. 1B shows that glucose deprivation did not down-regulate the ectopically expressed IRS-1. This suggests that IRS-1 down-regulation following glucose deprivation (Fig. 1A) may be regulated transcriptionally possibly by a mechanism that involves suppression of mTORC1 signaling and mitochondria dysfunction as reported previously (15Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 9855-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing IRS-1 allowed us to measure the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of IRS-1 over time in cells cultured in media with decreasing concentrations of glucose. The results show that, upon glucose deprivation, IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-794 took place as early as 10 min from the start of the starvation period and persisted for 9 h similarly to phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 (Fig. 1B). Moreover phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 occurred within physiological glucose concentrations (4–6 mm glucose; supplemental Fig. S2) in a manner similar to phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172. Hypoxia increases the AMP:ATP ratio and activates AMPK (22Liu L. Cash T.P. Jones R.G. Keith B. Thompson C.B. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that hypoxia, in addition of stabilizing Hif-1α, stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 in HEK293 cells stably expressing IRS-1 with kinetics that were similar to the kinetics of AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172. Similarly the hypoxia-mimicking agent, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), also stimulated AMPK and IRS-1 phosphorylation at these sites (Fig. 1D). Lastly short term insulin stimulation did not affect hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 (supplemental Fig. S3). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation produces the majority of cellular ATP. To directly address the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the regulation of IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-794 we examined the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at this site in cells treated with oligomycin and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Oligomycin and CCCP inhibit ATP production via inhibition of the F0F1 ATP synthase and via irreversible dissipation of the electrochemical gradient, respectively. Fig. 1E demonstrates that inhibition of ATP synthesis in the mitochondria by both oligomycin and CCCP activated AMPK and stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-794. Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress acutely activates AMPK by increasing the cellular AMP:ATP ratio (8Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M.

In HEK293 cells and L6 myoblasts hydrogen peroxide stimulated AMPK and IRS-1 phosphorylation at Thr-172 and Ser-794, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner within 2 min from the start of the treatment (Fig. 1, F and G, respectively). Lastly increase of the AMP:ATP ratio in cells treated with 2-DG (3Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar) potently induced phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 and IRS-1 at Ser-794 (supplemental Fig. S4). Overall the data presented in Fig. 1 establish that energy depletion caused by a variety of treatments induces phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 and that long term exposure to the same treatments reduces the expression of endogenous IRS-1 possibly transcriptionally (Figs. 1, A and B, and 4C and Refs. 15Harrington L.S.

Of note, energy depletion caused by all tested treatments completely eliminated previously described nutrient-sensitive mTORC1/S6K1-mediated phosphorylations of IRS-1 at inhibitory sites (data not shown and Refs. 12Tzatsos A.

IRS-1 Phosphorylation at Ser-794 in Response to Glucose Deprivation, Hypoxia, and Oxidative Stress Depends on the AMPK Catalytic Subunit α—To determine whether IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-794 in response to energy depletion is AMPK-dependent we either overexpressed or knocked down the catalytic subunit of AMPK, and we examined the effects of these treatments on IRS-1 phosphorylation at this site. Fig. 2A demonstrates that overexpression of the wild-type form of the α2 (or the α1, not shown) catalytic subunit of AMPK significantly enhanced IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-794 following glucose deprivation, whereas overexpression of the kinase-deficient mutant of AMPK did not. Next we used siRNA that specifically knocked down the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits of the AMPK in HEK293 cells stably transfected with IRS-1. HEK293 cells express both the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits of AMPK with the α1 subunit being more abundant (5Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin.

Fig. 2B shows that knocking down either subunit efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794 in response to glucose deprivation. Simultaneous knockdown of both subunits, using half the amount of siRNA for each subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”), completely eliminated basal as well glucose deprivation-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794. Next we addressed the role of AMPK in the hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-794.

https://openalex.org/W2003361945,"Human defensins are a family of small antimicrobial proteins found predominantly in leukocytes and epithelial cells that play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune defense against microbial infection. The most distinct molecular feature of defensins is cationicity, manifested by abundant Arg and/or Lys residues in their sequences. Sequence analysis indicates that Arg is strongly selected over Lys in α-defensins but not in β-defensins. To understand this Arg/Lys disparity in defensins, we chemically synthesized human α-defensin 1 (HNP1) and several HNP1 analogs where three Arg residues were replaced by each of the following six α-amino acids: Lys, ornithine (Orn), diaminobutyric acid (Dab), diaminopropionic acid (Dap), N,N-dimethyl-Lys (diMeLys), and homo-Arg (homoArg). In addition, we prepared human β-defensin 1 (hBD1) and Lys→ArghBD1 in which all four Lys residues were substituted for Arg. Bactericidal activity assays revealed the following. 1) Arg-containing HNP1 and Lys→ArghBD1 are functionally better than Lys-HNP1 and hBD1, respectively; the difference between Arg and Lys is more evident in the α-defensin than in the β-defensin and is more evident at low salt concentrations than at high salt concentrations. 2) For HNP1, the Arg/Lys disparity is much more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus than with Escherichia coli, and the Arg-rich HNP1 kills bacteria faster than its Lys-rich analog. 3) Arg and Lys appear to have optimal chain lengths for bacterial killing as shortening Lys or lengthening Arg in HNP1 invariably becomes functionally deleterious. Our findings provide insights into the Arg/Lys disparity in defensins, and shed light on the cationicity of defensins with respect to their antimicrobial activity and specificity.

Bactericidal activity assays revealed the following. 1) Arg-containing HNP1 and Lys→ArghBD1 are functionally better than Lys-HNP1 and hBD1, respectively; the difference between Arg and Lys is more evident in the α-defensin than in the β-defensin and is more evident at low salt concentrations than at high salt concentrations. 2) For HNP1, the Arg/Lys disparity is much more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus than with Escherichia coli, and the Arg-rich HNP1 kills bacteria faster than its Lys-rich analog. 3) Arg and Lys appear to have optimal chain lengths for bacterial killing as shortening Lys or lengthening Arg in HNP1 invariably becomes functionally deleterious. Our findings provide insights into the Arg/Lys disparity in defensins, and shed light on the cationicity of defensins with respect to their antimicrobial activity and specificity.

Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). Most AMPs are cationic and kill microorganisms through permeabilization of the microbial membrane composed of negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin (2Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell.Third Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1994Google Scholar, 3Brock T.D. Madigan M.T. Biology of Microorganisms.Sixth Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1991Google Scholar). The selectivity of cationic AMPs toward microorganisms is further conferred by negatively charged molecules extruding out of the surface of the bacterial cell wall, i.e. teichoic acids in Gram-positive and lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative strains of bacteria. It is believed that electrostatic interactions dictate not only the uptake of cationic AMPs across the bacterial cell wall but also their ability to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane and to induce leakage of cellular contents (4Hancock R.E. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). A large subfamily of cationic AMPs in humans is termed defensins (5Ganz T. Nat.

To date, six human α-defensins, four primarily from neutrophils (HNP1–4) and two from intestinal Paneth cells (HD5–6) (11Gabay J.E. Scott R.W. Campanelli D. Griffith J. Wilde C. Marra M.N. Seeger M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in size, cellular origin, disulfide topology, and amino acid composition, defensins from both families share a similar core structure of a three-stranded β-sheet stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bridges (18Szyk A. Wu Z. Tucker K. Yang D. Lu W. Lubkowski J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2749-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Xie C. Prahl A. Ericksen B. Wu Z. Zeng P. Li X. Lu W.Y. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J.

The pleiotropic roles of human defensins, manifested by their multifaceted antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions in innate and adaptive immunity (22Yang D. Oppenheim J.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3401-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Yang D. Biragyn A. Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Oppenheim J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 181-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and their mechanisms of action at the molecular level have recently been the focus of intense scrutiny. Sequence analysis of most known mammalian α-defensins indicates that Arg is strongly selected over Lys by a ratio of ∼9:1, with few exceptions such as corticostatin/defensin-like peptides (RK-1 and RK-2) expressed in the rabbit kidney (24Bateman A. MacLeod R.J. Lembessis P. Hu J. Esch F. Solomon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10654-10659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Wu E.R. Daniel R. Bateman A. Peptides. 1998; 19: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In humans, none of the six α-defensins contain Lys in their mature domain sequences. By contrast, Lys appears to be the more frequent cationic residue found in more than 30 putative human β-defensin genes (with an Arg-to-Lys ratio of ∼4:6). The Arg/Lys disparity seen in mammalian α-defensins sharply contrasts the fact that Arg is one of the least frequent amino acids in proteins. In fact, the frequency of Arg (5.2%) in the genomes of living organisms (Archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes) is on average lower than that of Lys (6.3%) despite six codons in the genetic code for Arg as opposed to only two for Lys (26Gilis D. Massar S. Cerf N.J. Rooman M. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1Crossref Google Scholar). To better understand why Arg is strongly selected over Lys in human α-defensins, but not in β-defensins, and how the cationicity of defensins impacts their antimicrobial function at the atomic level, we replaced three out of four Arg residues in HNP1 by each of the following six α-amino acids: Lys, ornithine (Orn), diaminobutyric acid (Dab), diaminopropionic acid (Dap), N,N-dimethyl-Lys (diMeLys), and homo-Arg (homoArg) (Fig.1). The N-terminal Arg5 in HNP1 was left unchanged because it forms a conserved, loop-supporting salt bridge with Glu13, contributing to α-defensin folding and stability (27Wu Z. Li X. de Leeuw E. Ericksen B. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43039-43047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, we mutated all four Lys residues to Arg in human β-defensin 1 (K→RhBD1). Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of the six HNP1 analogs and K→RhBD1, their bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative strains, and their ability to induce leakage of an encapsulated fluorophore from large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of negatively charged phospholipids, palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG). To confirm the correct fold and describe the structural implications of the substitutions, we also determined medium-to-high resolution crystal structures of K→RhBD1 and three HNP1 analogs (Lys, Orn, and Dab). Total Chemical Synthesis of HNP1 Analogs and K→RhBD1—The amino acid sequence of HNP1 is as follows: 1ACYCRIPACIAGERRYGTCIYQGRLWAFCC30. The Arg residues in boldface type were replaced by each of the following six Boc-Nα-protected α-amino acids purchased from Bachem Biosciences, Lys, Orn, Dab, Dap, diMeLys, and homoArg. Preparation of HNP1 and its synthetic analogs by Boc solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) was essentially as described previously (28Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, all seven peptides, i.e. wild type HNP1, Lys-HNP1, Orn-HNP1, Dab-HNP1, Dap-HNP1, diMeLys-HNP1, and homoArg-HNP1, were synthesized on Boc-Cys(4MeBzl)-OCH2-PAM resin using an in-house chemistry tailored from the N,N-diisopropylethylamine in situ neutralization/2-(1H-benzotriazolyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate activation protocol originally developed by Kent and co-workers for Boc SPPS (29Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 30Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The following side chain protections were used: Arg(tosyl), Cys(4MeBzl), Glu(OcHxl), Thr(Bzl), Tyr(BrZ), Trp-(CHO), Lys(Fmoc), Orn(Fmoc), Dab(Fmoc), Dap(Fmoc), and diMeLys(Fmoc). After chain assembly and Boc/Fmoc removal, the peptides were deprotected and cleaved by anhydrous HF in the presence of 5% p-cresol at 0 °C for 1 h, followed by precipitation with cold ether. Synthesis of K→RhBD1 (1DHYNCVSSGGQCLYSACPIFTRIQGTCYRGRARCCR36) on Boc-Arg(tosyl)-OCH2-PAM resin was carried out in an identical fashion using the following side chain protections: Arg(tosyl), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHxl), Cys(4MeBzl), His(Bom), Ser(Bzl), Thr-(Bzl), Tyr(BrZ). All crude peptides were purified to homogeneity by preparative C18 reversed phase (RP) HPLC on a Waters Delta Prep 600 system, and their molecular masses were ascertained by a Micromass ZQ-4000 single quadruple electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (ESI-MS). Oxidative folding/disulfide formation of synthetic α-defensins was carried out, as described previously, in the presence of reduced (3 mm) and oxidized (0.3 mm) glutathione, 2 m urea, and 25% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 8.3 (28Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Folding of K→RhBD1 was performed using a published protocol designed for wild type hBD1 and hBD2 (31Wu Z. Hoover D.M. Yang D. Boulegue C. Santamaria F. Oppenheim J.J. Lubkowski J. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8880-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The folding reactions, monitored by analytical RP-HPLC, proceeded overnight at room temperature, and the desired products, characterized by shortened retention times and a loss of six mass units due to formation of three disulfide bonds, were purified to homogeneity by preparative RP-HPLC. To verify the correct disulfide connectivity in HNP1 analogs and in K→RhBD1, mass mapping of peptide fragments generated by complete proteolysis with a combination of chymotrypsin and trypsin was performed. All defensins were quantified by UV absorbance measurements at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated according to the algorithm published by Pace et al. (32Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Structural Studies—Crystals of K→RhBD1, Lys-HNP1, Orn-HNP1, and Dab-HNP1 were grown using the conditions from the commercial crystallization screens. The crystallization conditions as well as compositions of solutions used for cryo-preservation of crystals are described in supplemental Table S1. All x-ray experiments were conducted at 100 K. The x-ray data for Lys-HNP1 and Orn-HNP1 were collected using the radiation (λCu = 1.5478 Å) originated from the rotating anode mounted on the Rigaku-Ru200 generator that operated at 100 V and 50 mA and focused by the Osmic mirrors (Rigaku). The diffraction patterns were recorded using the image plate detector, MAR345dtb (Mar Research). The final x-ray data for the crystals of K→RhBD1 and Dab-HNP1 were collected using the synchrotron radiation (beamline 22BM on the SER-CAT station at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory), with the wavelength set to 0.96 Å. The experimental intensities were recorded using the MAR CCD300 detector (MAR-Research). All data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (HKL Research) (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Wu Z. Lu W. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A 2-fold dilution series of defensin, ranging from 0.5 to 125 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with E. coli or S. aureus (1 × 106 colony-forming units/ml), followed by addition of twice-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth (2× MHB) and 12-h kinetic measurements of bacterial growth at 650 nm. vLD50 and vLD90 values were reported as the concentration of defensin resulting in the killing of 50 and 90% of bacteria, respectively. For salt dependence experiments, bacteria were exposed to a fixed concentration of defensin at 25, 50, or 125 μg/ml for 2 h in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mm) before addition of 2× MHB and subsequent measurements of growth kinetics. LUV Leakage Assay—LUVs encapsulating the low molecular weight fluorophore/quencher pair (8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid sodium salt and p-xylenebis(pyridinium)-bromide, or ANTS/DPX) were prepared using the standard extrusion method. POPG LUVs freshly prepared for this study contained 5 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, and 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and were stored in 5 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (high salt condition), or 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (low salt condition). Leakage of ANTS from LUVs, monitored on an LS-55 PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer, was characterized by an increase in fluorescence, which was quenched by DPX when encapsulated together inside liposomes (37Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). 270 μl of ANTS/DPX-encapsulated LUVs were added to each well of a 96-well plate to a final lipid concentration of 600 μm.30 μl of H2O was added to the first well of each row as a blank, and 30 μl of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to the last (12th) well as the control for 100% leakage. Upon addition of 30 μl of a 2-fold dilution series of defensin (from 0.2 to 100 μg/ml) and incubation for 1 h, the fluorescence signal was recorded at 515 nm with an excitation wavelength of 353 nm, 10 nm bandwidths, and a 390-nm cut-off filter in the emission path. Percent leakage was calculated as reported previously (19Xie C. Prahl A. Ericksen B. Wu Z. Zeng P. Li X. Lu W.Y. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Biol.

We established robust synthetic access to and efficient folding protocols for all six human α-defensins and several hBDs (28Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem.

Synthesis and oxidative folding of the HNP1 analogs and K→RhBD1 used in this study were essentially as described previously (28Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem.

Shown in Fig. 2 are the six α-defensins, i.e. Lys-HNP1, Orn-HNP1, Dab-HNP1, Dap-HNP1, diMeLys-HNP1, and homoArg-HNP1, on analytical C18 RP-HPLC and ESI-MS; synthetic K→RhBD1 is shown in the supplemental Fig. S1. The determined molecular mass of each analog was within experimental error of the theoretical value calculated on the basis of the average isotopic compositions of folded defensins. We previously used mass mapping of peptide fragments generated by a combination of proteolytic digestion and Edman degradation to establish native disulfide connectivities in synthetic HNP1 and hBD1 (28Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Wu Z. Hoover D.M. Yang D. Boulegue C. Santamaria F. Oppenheim J.J. Lubkowski J. Lu W. Proc. Natl.

Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the six HNP1 analogs by trypsin and chymotrypsin all yielded, in addition to a two-disulfide-bridged fragment containing Cys1-Cys3-Cys5-Cys6, a common fragment of 830.8 ± 0.4 Da, which was unambiguously identified by ESI-MS to be (C2R)(YAGTC4IY), consistent with native disulfide connections in α-defensins. Similarly, digestion of K→RhBD1 resulted in three major fragments, (NC1VSSGGQ)(SAC3PIF)(C5C6R) (1762.7 Da calculated, 1763.0 ± 0.3 Da found), (C2LY)(IQGTC4Y) (1078.4 Da calculated, 1078.6 ± 0.0 Da found), and (C2L)(IQGTC4Y) (915.4 Da calculated, 915.5 ± 0.0 Da found). The one-disulfide-bridged fragments involving Cys2 and Cys4 were expected from a correctly folded hBD1. It is worth noting that as the side chain of Lys became shorter or less hydrophobic (Lys → Orn → Dab → Dap), retention of the defensins on C18 RP-HPLC progressively increased. Evidently, the more solvent-exposed the cationic charge, the less retention the defensin manifested on C18 RP-HPLC despite its increased hydrophobicity. Consistent with this observation, homoArg-HNP1, which is more hydrophobic than Arg, eluted slightly earlier than did HNP1 (data not shown). Interestingly, defensin folding became increasingly less efficient as the cationic side chain was shortened, with the folding yield for Dap-HNP1 being the lowest in the panel (data not shown). This result may be attributed to charge burial, in general, destabilizing folded peptides and proteins. Finally, as peak broadening is commonly associated with the cationicity of peptides on RP-HPLC, perhaps not surprisingly, Dap-HNP1 with least exposed cationic charges showed a much narrower chromatographic peak compared with other α-defensin analogs. For four derivatives included in this study (K→RhBD1, Lys-HNP1, Orn-HNP1, and Dab-HNP1), the crystal structures have been solved and refined. The selected four samples form a representative subset of all derivatives described in this study in terms of chemistry and size of the residues used for the substitutions. The primary purpose of the structural studies was to verify correct folds and to investigate potential topological changes, if any, caused by the substitutions. Each of the four derivatives forms a different type of crystal, eliminating the possibility of any bias because of specific crystal packing. When the tertiary structures of these derivatives were compared with the corresponding wild type proteins (hBD1 and HNP2), no significant structural changes were detected (Fig. 3). Other results of these comparisons are included in the Supplemental Materials. In all four cases the connectivity and stereochemistry of disulfide bridges are identical to the wild type defensins, and so are the networks of other intra-molecular interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridges). It is thus apparent that the substitutions described for the hBD1 and HNP1 derivatives in this study did not cause obvious changes in their tertiary structures. The approximated distributions of electrostatic charges on the surfaces of the monomers of the derivatives are nearly indistinguishable from the distributions derived from the in silica-generated models based on the structures of the wild type proteins. Somewhat different are the results obtained from the comparison of the tertiary structures of the HNP1 derivatives (for hBD1, a monomer is believed to be its native form (40Pazgier M. Prahl A.

Virtually identical dimers are also present in the crystal structures of Lys-HNP1 and Orn-HNP1. Their topological comparison with the dimers of HNP2 is shown in the supplemental Fig. S2. In the crystal structure of Dab-HNP1, however, the central β-strand (residues 18–20) of one monomer interacts with the first β-strand (residues 2–4) of another primarily through four backbone hydrogen bonds. This asymmetric mode of dimerization results in a string of interacting monomers spanning through the crystal lattice. Analysis of the intermolecular contacts in the Dab-HNP1 crystal did not yield an obvious answer as to why the atypical dimerization pattern formed. However, the asymmetric mode of dimerization seen in Dab-HNP1 should be disfavored for wild type human α-defensins and their derivatives with long cationic side chains at positions 14 and 24, as they would be projected toward each other. The bactericidal activity of HNP1, HNP1 analogs, hBD1, and K→RhBD1 was tested in a low salt medium (10 mm phosphate buffer) against the E. coli 25922 and S. aureus 29213 strains. The survival curves for α-defensins are shown in Fig. 4, and the vLD50 and vLD90 values summarized in Table 3. As expected, α-defensins, in general, showed a greater killing efficiency against S. aureus than against E. coli.

To better understand the molecular mechanism of this enzyme, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of the AfcA catalytic (Fuc) domain in unliganded and complexed forms with deoxyfuconojirimycin (inhibitor), 2′-fucosyllactose (substrate), and l-fucose and lactose (products) at 1.12-2.10Å resolution. The AfcA Fuc domain is composed of four regions, an N-terminal β region, a helical linker, an (α/α)6 helical barrel domain, and a C-terminal β region, and this arrangement is similar to bacterial phosphorylases. In the complex structures, the ligands were buried in the central cavity of the helical barrel domain. Structural analyses in combination with mutational experiments revealed that the highly conserved Glu566 probably acts as a general acid catalyst. However, no carboxylic acid residue is found at the appropriate position for a general base catalyst. Instead, a water molecule stabilized by Asn423 in the substrate-bound complex is suitably located to perform a nucleophilic attack on the C1 atom of l-fucose moiety in 2′-fucosyllactose, and its location is nearly identical near the O1 atom of β-l-fucose in the products-bound complex. Based on these data, we propose and discuss a novel catalytic reaction mechanism of AfcA. 1,2-α-l-Fucosidase (AfcA), which hydrolyzes the glycosidic linkage of Fucα1-2Gal via an inverting mechanism, was recently isolated from Bifidobacterium bifidum and classified as the first member of the novel glycoside hydrolase family 95.

Bifidobacteria are obligate anaerobic lactic acid-producing bacteria that constitute a substantial fraction of the mammalian intestinal microflora. Interest in bifidobacteria has grown recently following the identification of many beneficial probiotic homeostatic effects, including reducing the presence of harmful bacteria and toxic compounds, immunomodulation, and anticarcinogenic activity (1Bernet M.F.

Bifidobacteria naturally colonize the lower gastrointestinal tract, but host and microbial factors present in the upper gastrointestinal tract render this environment poor in mono- and disaccharides. Therefore, to survive here, bifidobacteria have evolved the ability to produce a variety of different surface-bound or secreted glycosidases facilitating the metabolism of the diverse sugars found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (6Hoskins L.C.

There are two broad classes of glycosidases, exo- and endoenzymes, that differ based on the site and mechanism of polysaccharide degradation. Endoglycosidases cleave specific internal glycosidic bonds, but exoglycosidases remove oligosaccharide units at the reducing or nonreducing ends of the polysaccharide chain. Glycosidases can be further divided into two broad families, retaining and inverting glycosidases, according to the stereochemical outcome of their action (9Sincott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 10McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Most retaining glycosidases have two catalytic carboxylic acids separated by 5.5 Å in their active site and function through a double displacement mechanism (9Sincott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 10McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 11Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). In contrast, inverting glycosidases act through a single displacement mechanism in which the two carboxyl groups, acting as general acid and base catalysts, are ∼10.5 Å apart, allowing simultaneous interactions with a water molecule and substrate (9Sincott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 10McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 11Davies G.

Glycosidic cleavage involves the protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by the general acid catalyst in concert with general base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of a water molecule at the anomeric center. The result is a hemiacetal product with an anomeric configuration that is inverted relative to that of the substrate. 1,2-α-l-Fucosidase (AfcA) 2The abbreviations used are: AfcA, 1,2-α-l-fucosidase; GH, glycoside hydrolase; 2′FL, 2′-fucosyllactose; DFJ, deoxyfuconojirimycin; MES, 2-N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s., root mean square. is an exoglycosidase recently identified from Bifidobacterium bifidum (12Katayama T. Sakuma A. Kimura T. Makimura Y. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Yamanoi T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It was classified as a member of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 95 using the CAZy server (available on the World Wide Web at www.cazy.org/) (13Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). AfcA has 1,959 amino acids divided among three domains: an N-terminal domain with unknown function, a catalytic domain (Fuc domain), and a C-terminal bacterial Ig-like domain. The recombinantly expressed Fuc domain exhibits 1,2-α-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.63) activity leading to the removal of α1-2 fucosyl residues from the nonreducing ends of oligosaccharides, such as 2′-fucosyllactose (2′FL; Fucα1-2Galβ1-4Glc) and lacto-N-fucopentaose I (Fucα1-2Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc) (12Katayama T.

The stereochemical outcome of the released l-fucose was determined to be inversion by 1H NMR (12Katayama T. Sakuma A. Kimura T. Makimura Y. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Yamanoi T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). l-Fucose is a common monosaccharide present at the non-reducing ends of oligosaccharides of many glycoconjugates, including N- and O-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, glycolipids on the cell surface, blood group substances, and oligosaccharides in human milk (14Podolsky D.K.

A number of different species from bacteria to mammals express α-l-fucosidases, and the abundance of these enzymes emphasizes the ubiquity and biological significance of l-fucose in living organisms. Fucose-containing carbohydrates play important roles in diverse cellular and physiologic processes, including inflammatory responses (16Springer T.A.

Sci. 1991; 16: 84-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, altered expression of α-l-fucosidases and corresponding changes in fucosylation levels are seen in many carcinomas (20Hosono J. Narita T. Kimura N. Sato M. Nakashio T. Kasai Y. Nonami T.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the presence of human α-l-fucosidase in the serum can be used as an early detection marker for several carcinomas (22Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Ayude D. de la Cadena M.P.

Additionally, α-l-fucosidases have been used to determine the function of particular l-fucose residues. To date, most identified α-l-fucosidases belong to GH family 29, based on amino acid sequence similarities, and the only solved structure from this family is the Thermotoga maritima α-l-fucosidase (25Sulzenbacher G.

However, this is a retaining glycosidase, and the structural characteristics of inverting α-l-fucosidases remain unclear. To better understand the architecture and mechanism of inverting α-l-fucosidases, we performed structural and biochemical studies of the B. bifidum 1,2-α-l-fucosidase catalytic domain. A series of the structural and the biochemical analyses provides insight into a novel catalytic mechanism for this enzyme. Materials—Q Sepharose Fast Flow, CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite, cellulofine GC-700-m, and MonoQ columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Bio-Rad, Seikagaku Kogyo, and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. All crystallization reagents were purchased from Hampton Research and deCODE Genetics. Deoxyfuconojirimycin (DFJ) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Japan), and 2′FL, l-fucose, and lactose were from Sigma. Other chemicals were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical (Japan), Sigma, and Nacalai Tesque (Japan). Protein Expression and Purification—The gene corresponding to the catalytic domain (Fuc domain; 577-1,474 amino acid residues of full-length AfcA fucosidase) was amplified by PCR using pSA3 as a template (12Katayama T. Sakuma A. Kimura T. Makimura Y. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Yamanoi T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and a pair of primers (forward, 5′-CCATATGGTCATCGCCAGTGTCGAGGACG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCCGGGTCAGCTCGCCTTCTTCGTGATCG-3′). After digestion with NdeI and SmaI, the amplified fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI (blunt-ended) site of pET-3a (Novagen). Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells carrying the resultant plasmid were grown in LB medium and induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 291 K for 35 h. Cells were disrupted by sonication at 277 K. The supernatant was fractionated by the addition of 50-80% saturated ammonium sulfate, and precipitated material was dissolved and dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mg/liter phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After dialysis, the sample was loaded onto a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-200 mm NaCl. Appropriate fractions were precipitated again with 80% saturated ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against 2 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 20 mg/liter phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The resulting sample was applied onto a CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite column. After the elution with a linear gradient of 2-200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, enzymatically active fractions were collected and loaded onto a gel filtration column (cellulofine GC-700-m) equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mg/liter phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The Fuc domain was finally purified on a MonoQ column and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced using E. coli strain B834(DE3) in LeMaster medium containing 25 mg/liter seleno-l-methionine (26LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. Lemaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Purification of the selenium-labeled protein was carried out as described above for the native Fuc domain without the gel filtration step. Mass spectrometric analysis (Autoflex; Bruker-Daltonics) verified that all 12 methionine residues in the 898-amino acid Fuc domain were substituted with selenomethionine. The native and selenium-labeled proteins were purified as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Amino acid substitutions of the AfcA Fuc domain were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis involving PCR. Mutant proteins for crystallographic study were expressed and purified as described above. Those for biochemical analyses were expressed as C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins using modified pET-3a vectors and were purified by the MagneHis purification system (Promega) and a MonoQ column. Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectroscopy—The purified Fuc domain was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) prior to analysis. The content and concentration of metal ions in the protein were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy using ICPS-8000 (Shimadzu). ICP multielement standard solution IV (Merck) was used as a standard. Enzymatic Assay and Chemical Rescue—Examination of the enzymatic 1,2-α-l-fucosidase activity of the wild-type and mutated proteins was performed at 303 K in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) using 2′FL as a substrate. After the reaction, reaction mixtures were boiled for 3 min. The amount of released l-fucose was determined by a previously described method using fucose dehydrogenase from a Pseudomonas strain (28Cohenford M.A. Abraham A. Abraham J. Dain J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Initial velocity of hydrolysis was determined in the range where the linearity of reaction rate was observed. Kinetic parameters were determined by double-reciprocal plot of Michaelis-Menten equation, in which substrate concentration was varied in the range of 0.4-3 times their Km values. Chemical rescue experiments were performed by adding 1.25 m sodium azide (dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) to a reaction mixture consisting of 8.5 microunits of wild-type and mutated proteins, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 2 mm 2′FL at 303 K. The reaction mixture was then spotted onto a silica gel plate (Merck). The plate was developed with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (3:3:1, v/v/v), and released l-fucose was detected by orcinol-H2SO4. Crystallization of Wild-type and Mutated Fuc Domains—The apo form of Fuc domain crystals was grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing an equal volume of protein (10 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and precipitant composed of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, and 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 at 289 K over 10 days. The selenomethionine-substituted crystals were obtained under almost identical conditions (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 10% (w/v) PEG 4000). Crystals of the complex of the Fuc domain with the inhibitor DFJ were obtained by soaking the apo form crystals in 10 mm DFJ solution for 10 min at 293 K. Apo form E566A crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, and 15% (w/v) PEG 4000. The E566A-2′FL complex crystals were prepared by soaking the crystals of apo E566A with 10 mm 2′FL for 10 min at 293 K. The crystals of D766A in complexes with l-fucose and lactose were obtained by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m MES-Na (pH 6.0), 15% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 2000, and 10 mm 2′FL. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Synchrotron data were collected at beamlines BL-6A and AR-NW12A at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and BL9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. All data sets were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 program package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Phase determination of the selenium-substituted apo form was done by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the SOLVE program (30Terwilliger T.C. Brendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) at 3.0 Å resolution. The initial automatic model was constructed by the RESOLVE program. This model, which contained 1,411 amino acid residues in the asymmetric unit, was used for molecular replacement of the native data set using the Molrep program from the CCP4 program suite (31Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and the phases were extended up to 1.12 Å resolution. The structure of the wild type-DFJ complex was determined by the molecular replacement method using Molrep using a refined model of the wild-type apo form as a search model. The structures of the E566A-2′FL and D766A-l-fucose-lactose complexes were determined by the molecular replacement method using the DFJ complex structure as a search model. The automatic model construction for all models was performed using the ARP/wARP program (32Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Further model reconstructions were performed manually using Xfit from XtalView (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinement was carried out using REFMAC from the CCP4 suite. Coordinates for the DFJ molecule was obtained by modifying the structure of α-l-fucose (Protein Data Bank code 7ABP), and the geometry was optimized using Monomer Library Sketcher from CCP4 prior to incorporation into models. Coordinates for 2′FL, α- and β-l-fucose, and lactose were obtained from Protein Data Bank codes 1GZ9, 1OFZ, and 1IS3, respectively. The qualities of the protein models were assessed with the structure validation program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All models have good stereochemistry, and no residues were in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.

Open table in a new tab Structural Comparison among Related Proteins—The LSQKAB in CCP4 was used to analyze conformational differences among Fuc domain structures. Structural homologs of the Fuc domain were retrieved from the DALI server (39Holm L. Sander C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 653-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the SSM (Secondary Structure Matching) program was used for the structural alignment among these proteins (40Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—We solved the crystal structures of the AfcA Fuc domain in the absence of ligand and in the presence of an inhibitor, substrate, and reaction products. The structure of the unliganded (apo) form was determined at 1.12 Å resolution. The Fuc domain consists of four regions: an N-terminal β region (residues 9-79 and 134-293), a helical linker region (residues 294-386), a helical barrel domain (residues 80-133 and 387-778), and a C-terminal β region (residues 779-896) (Fig. 1a). We then used the DALI server to identify proteins structurally similar to the AfcA Fuc domain, and maltose phosphorylase from Lactobacillus brevis (GH family 65) (41Egloff M.P. Uppenberg J. Haalck L. Tilbeurgh H. Structure. 2001; 9: 689-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and chitobiose phosphorylase from Vibrio proteolyticus (GH family 94) (42Hidaka M.

Structure. 2004; 12: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were highly structurally related, with root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation values of 3.1 and 3.6 Å for the 574 and 504 corresponding Cα atoms, respectively. The high degree of structural similarity was present despite low sequence identities between proteins (maltose phosphorylase, 12%; chitobiose phosphorylase, 11%). The catalytic active sites of both of these phosphorylases reside within the helical barrel domains. The N-terminal β region of the Fuc domain is composed of 16 antiparallel strands arranged in a super β-sandwich, and it is connected to the four α helices of the linker region. This N-terminal β region has a low degree of structural similarity to Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 α-amylase II (Protein Data Bank code 1BVZ) (43Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T.

The central helical barrel domain is composed of an (α/α)6 barrel fold domain, and a DALI search identified structural similarities with the catalytic domains of inverting glucoamylases of GH family 15, such as glucoamylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (Protein Data Bank code 1LF6) (46Aleshin A.E. Feng P.H. Honzatko R.B. Reilly P.J. J. Mol.

The r.m.s. deviation values for the 120-, 118-, and 233-equivalent Cα positions of these proteins are 2.8, 2.9, and 3.2 Å, respectively, but they only share 13-20% amino acid sequence identity with the helical barrel domain of the AfcA Fuc domain. The (α/α)6 helical fold is also present in GH65 and GH94 family enzymes. The molecular surface of the central helical barrel domain is characterized by a deep, negatively charged pocket (Fig. 1b), and this region probably represents the substrate-binding pocket. This conclusion is further supported by the solved structures of the AfcA Fuc domain with an inhibitor, substrate, and products (see below). The C-terminal β region forms a two-layered jelly roll fold with a high degree of similarity to the C-terminal domains of maltose phosphorylase and chitobiose phosphorylase, but the function of this region remains unclear. The dispersive difference Fourier map calculated from the data set at a wavelength of 1.7000 Å (native 2 in Table 1) revealed one strong peak density (above 10 σ) buried within the protein, representing a coordinated metal ion. This metal ion bridges the N-terminal β region, helical linker, and helical barrel domains (supplemental Fig. 1), and three main chain carbonyl groups (from Gly56, Ser385, and Leu392), the oxygen atom of one carboxylate from Glu76, and one water molecule are the coordinating ligands for this metal ion. We performed inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy on the AfcA Fuc domain in solution, and calcium was identified. The ratio of calcium ion to protein molecule was calculated as 0.93 ± 0.1 (data not shown), strongly suggesting that all AfcA Fuc domains bind a single calcium ion.

https://openalex.org/W2035665637,"In the mammalian mitochondrial electron transfer system, the majority of electrons enter at complex I, go through complexes III and IV, and are finally delivered to oxygen. Previously we generated several mouse cell lines with suppressed expression of the nuclearly encoded subunit 4 of complex IV. This led to a loss of assembly of complex IV and its defective function. Interestingly, we found that the level of assembled complex I and its activity were also significantly reduced, whereas levels and activity of complex III were normal or up-regulated. The structural and functional dependence of complex I on complex IV was verified using a human cell line carrying a nonsense mutation in the mitochondrially encoded complex IV subunit 1 gene. Our work documents that, although there is no direct electron transfer between them, an assembled complex IV helps to maintain complex I in mammalian cells."

Previous work has shown links between inflammatory stimuli and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, although the molecular mechanisms of this process are poorly understood. Here we report that tribbles-1, a recently described modulator of MAPK activation, controls vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and chemotaxis via the Jun kinase pathway. Our findings demonstrate that this regulation takes place via direct interactions between tribbles-1 and MKK4/SEK1, a Jun activator kinase. The activity of this kinase is dependent on tribbles-1 levels, whereas the activation and the expression of MKK4/SEK1 are not. In addition, tribbles-1 expression is elevated in human atherosclerotic arteries when compared with non-atherosclerotic controls, suggesting that this protein may play a role in disease in vivo. In summary, the data presented here suggest an important regulatory role for trb-1 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology.

Injury to the arterial wall initiates a series of changes in specialized molecular and cellular events that not only contribute to wound healing but also to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the presentation of acute coronary syndromes, and the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention. An important initiating event appears to be endothelial cell dysfunction or cell death caused by local abnormalities. These events result in the production and release of a number of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In pathogenic conditions, elevated levels of inflammatory mediators can lead to migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 3The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; pMAPK, phosphorylated MAPK; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siTrb-1, small interfering Trb-1; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced YFP; PCA, protein fragment complementation assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IHD, ischemic heart disease; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; IL, interleukin; IL-RA, IL receptor antagonist; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; GAPDH, glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; hASMC, human aortic smooth muscle cells. 3The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; pMAPK, phosphorylated MAPK; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siTrb-1, small interfering Trb-1; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced YFP; PCA, protein fragment complementation assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IHD, ischemic heart disease; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; IL, interleukin; IL-RA, IL receptor antagonist; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; GAPDH, glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; hASMC, human aortic smooth muscle cells. to form a neointima.

It has been demonstrated that activation of MAPK cascades occurs in response to a wide range of stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, mechanical stimuli (stress) (8Li C. Xu Q. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and integrin-dependent cell/matrix interactions (9Goldschmidt M.E. McLeod K.J. Taylor W.R. Circ.

MAPKs are classified into at least three distinct groups (JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) kinases) and can be activated via a variety of upstream kinases, MAPKKs. In VSMC, Jun kinases (JNK) and p38 MAPKs have been implicated in responses primarily to stress (heat, hypoxia, chemical, oxidative, etc.) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas ERK kinases primarily respond to mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors (PDGF) (11Che W.

However, in most cases, a given stimulus will activate more than one group of MAPKs. The specific contribution of each MAPK pathway to a physiological response varies from cell type to cell type. In some cases, MAPK pathways can cooperate, but they can antagonize in others (14Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 15Xia Z.

Further, no interaction was detected between control plasmids and either MKK4-V1 or trb-1-V2. I, as a further control, an increasing dose of trb-1 expression plasmid (unlabeled) was co-transfected in HeLa cells with the above two constructs (left), and the average total fluorescence per cell was measured (right) by fluorescent microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Artery Biopsies—Coronary arteries from patients with a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (IHD, n = 8) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n = 6) were harvested from transplantation recipients at the time of surgery. Patients diagnosed as having DCM were free of chronic arterial disease before transplantation, as assessed by coronary angiography and histological analysis by a cardiac pathologist (S. Kim Suvarna) using the American Heart Association (AHA) classification system (27Stary H.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Mean ages were 55.75 ± 5.11 for IHD and 48.5 ± 10.23 for the DCM group. Mean AHA histological grades of disease were 6.42 for the IHD and 3.16 for the DCM group, respectively.RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from human artery biopsies and VSMC using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA and used immediately for qRT-PCR. Gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR using ABI prism 7900 (Applied Biosystems). Probes for human trbs, IL-1β, IL-RA, TNFα, and GAPDH were synthesized by Sigma Genosys with FAM at the 5′-end and TAMRA at the 3′-end.

Standard curves for the nine genes and GAPDH mRNAs were generated using serially diluted solution of plasmids incorporating each gene as a PCR template. All assays were performed in duplicate, and the average values were used for analysis.Transfections—Transfections were performed using Nucleofector (Amaxa) using program U-25 and Nucleofector solution for VSMC (Amaxa). For most experiments, 1.0 × 106 cells were used per nucleofection. The rate of transfection was >40 as judged by enhanced green fluorescent protein expression, measured by fluorescent microscopy (data not shown). Polyfect (Qiagen) was used for transfection of HeLa cells according to the manufacturer's instructions.Proliferation Assay—Transfected VSMC were placed on 96-well culture plates and further cultured for 24 h. Cells were then treated with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) and/or MAPK inhibitors for 6, 24, and 30 h. ERK MAPK inhibitor (PD98059), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), and JNK MAPK inhibitor (SP600125) were purchased from Calbiochem and used at 20 μm for ERK and JNK MAPK inhibitors and 0.2 μm for p38 MAPK inhibitor. After treatment, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting.In Vitro Wound-healing Assay and Time-lapse Video-Microscopy—Cells were transfected as described above, seeded into 35-mm culture dishes, and incubated overnight. Confluent cell monolayers were wounded by removing a strip of cells from the plate surface with a standard 1-ml pipette tip. Wounded monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove non-adherent cells and replaced with fresh complete growth medium. Time-lapse video-microscopy (30King A.R. Francis S.E.

(see Fig. 2D). 15 randomly picked cells from the wound edges were tracked over a 1-h period. The on-screen distance traveled was measured to calculate migration speed (mm/h) irrespective of direction. (see Fig. 2E)FIGURE 2trb-1 function in hASMC proliferation, migration and chemotaxis. hASMC cells were transfected with a trb-1 overexpression construct (A) or si-trb1-1 siRNA (B).Proliferation rate was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. si contr., control. As an independent measure of proliferation, time-lapse video microscopy was performed, and the percentages of mitotic cells on each field were calculated (C). The number of cells migrated through the edge of the wound (D) and their speed of migration (E) were assessed in a wound-healing assay. (F) The effect of MAPK inhibitors (inh.) on proliferation rate was measured as on panel B. G, the number of cells migrated through the Boyden chamber in response to PDGF were compared between control and si-trb-1-transfected cells. In addition, the impact of JNK inhibitor on the migrating cells was also investigated. The impact of tribbles-1 knockdown on the expression of TNFα mRNA (H) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) protein levels (I) was evaluated by qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Western Blotting—Anti-phospho-MAPK and anti-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Anti-β-actin antibody was from Dako. Between probing for the various proteins, membranes were stripped by Re-Blot Plus mild solution (Chemicon). Membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, and signals were quantified by Chemigenius gel documentation system (Syngene). pMAPK and MAPK signals were expressed as a ratio to β-actin levels within the same sample.Immunostaining—Serial 4-μm thick paraffin-embedded human artery sections were stained for Trb-1 using standard techniques. Trb-1 primary antibody (Millipore-Upstate) was applied overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then exposed to goat biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were then immersed in 0.25 mg/ml 3,3′diaminobenzidine, activated with hydrogen peroxide, and counterstained with Carazzi's hematoxylin. Primary antibody was omitted from the negative controls.RESULTSTribbles Expression Is Regulated in Response to an Inflammatory Stimulus in hASMC—Smooth Muscle Cell proliferation is a key event in the healing response to injury, a process that is initiated by inflammatory stimuli (32Morton A.C. Arnold N.D. Gunn J. Varcoe R. Francis S.E. Dower S.K. Crossman D.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify whether tribbles expression is regulated in vascular cells under inflammatory conditions, we stimulated human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMC, Fig. 1A) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (not shown) with LPS and measured tribbles mRNA expression levels by using qRT-PCR. IL-1β expression was measured as positive controls in the same samples (Fig. 1B). We found that trb-1 was selectively and transiently up-regulated by LPS treatment in hASMC (Fig. 1A) but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (not shown). Previous reports (33Wilkin F.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggest that tribbles proteins may be unstable and expressed at low levels; 4H. Y. Sung, H. Guan, A. Czibula, A. R. King, K.

Kiss-Toth, unpublished observations. therefore, mRNA levels are likely to correlate well with protein expression. We have, therefore, investigated the biological relevance of altered trb-1 levels on hASMC under inflammatory conditions.FIGURE 1trb-1 expression in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells. A, hASMC were stimulated by LPS for the various time points as indicated, total RNA was prepared, and qRT-PCR was performed to detect changes in tribbles 1-3 mRNA expression levels. B, IL-1β levels were also measured as positive controls in the same samples. C, the impact of culture conditions on Trb-1 expression was assessed in control and si-trb-1-transfected hASMC cells by qRT-PCR. FCS, fetal calf serum. D, the specificity of si-trb-1 knockdown was evaluated by qRT-PCR, comparing the expression levels of trb-1, -2, and -3 in si-trb-1-transfected cells. The values were normalized to the expression of tribbles in cells transfected with control siRNA. E, the efficiency of si-trb-1 treatment was assessed by Western blot. Cells were transfected with control (si contr.) or trb-1-specific siRNA, and Western blot was performed on whole cell lysates using an anti-trb-1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the role of trb-1 in LPS-stimulated hASMC, we transiently transfected these cells with a trb-1 expression plasmid or a pool of anti-trb-1 siRNA oligonucleotides and measured proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. However, first we evaluated the potential impact of culture conditions on trb-1 expression (Fig. 1C) and the specificity of the siRNA pool (Fig. 1D) used for targeting trb-1 mRNA. We have found that although trb-1 siRNA had the desired activity both under standard culture conditions (10% fetal calf serum) and when cells were serum-starved after transfection (0.5%), the expression levels of this gene and, indeed, the other tribbles as well (not shown) were significantly affected by the serum concentration. This is in line with previous work, demonstrating that expression of members of mammalian trb family is modulated through metabolic signals (34Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 35Schwarzer R. Dames S. Tondera D. Klippel A. Kaufmann J. Cell. Signal. 2005; 18: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used 10% fetal calf serum in all our experiments to minimize inter-experimental variations. In addition, the siRNA pools showed high specificity toward trb-1 and did not alter significantly trb-2 and -3 expression (Fig. 1D). In line with these results, siTrb-1 treatment resulted in a substantial decrease in trb-1 protein levels (Fig. 1E).Tribbles-1 Regulate Specific hASMC Cellular Functions—To investigate the role of trb-1 in hASMC function, we raised or suppressed trb-1 levels by transient transfection of hASMC cells with trb-1 expression plasmid or siRNA and measured proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2, A and B). We observed a modest anti-proliferative effect at 48 h after transfection (24-h time point in the proliferation assay) when trb-1 was overexpressed. In contrast, depletion of trb-1 results in a significant increase in proliferation rate at the same time point (Fig. 2B). However, this assay measures the net effect of cell death and proliferation. To confirm that the observed increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation is due to an increased mitosis rate, we performed time-lapse video imaging on control and si-trb-1-treated cells and calculated the rate of mitosis (Fig. 2C). The data obtained by both methods were in agreement. In addition, there was no difference in the observed rate of apoptosis between treatment, further supporting a specific tribbles effect on proliferation. Using the same time-lapse assay, we also measured VSMC migration in a wound-healing assay (Fig. 2, D and E). These data show that neither the number (Fig. 2D) nor the migration speed (Fig. 2E) of cells migrating into the wound was affected upon depletion of trb-1.As trb-1 acts via modulating MAPK activation, and this signaling system is known to govern VSMC proliferation, we used selective MAPK inhibitors to block individual pathways and investigated their involvement in the trb-1-regulated proliferation (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate that blocking of JNK but not p38 pathways suppresses VSMC proliferation. In line with previous reports, inhibiting ERK activation also caused a significant inhibition of proliferation (36Lai K. Wang H. Lee W.S. Jain M.K. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1560-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).To further investigate the impact of trb-1 levels in hASMC function, chemotaxic migration of these cells was measured in a transwell migration assay, in response to PDGF (Fig. 2G). Depletion of trb-1 led to an increase in transmigrated cells. Further, inhibition of the JNK pathway abrogated the effect of si-trb-1 treatment, suggesting that trb-1 may be a negative regulator of hASMC chemotaxis via inhibitory activity of"

The therapeutic actions of nicotinic acid are mediated by GPR109A, a Gi protein-coupled receptor, expressed primarily on adipocytes, Langerhans cells, and macrophage. Unfortunately, a severe, cutaneous flushing side effect limits its use and patient compliance. The mechanism of high density lipoprotein elevation is not clearly established but assumed to be influenced by an inhibition of lipolysis in the adipose. The flushing side effect appears to be mediated by the release of prostaglandin D2 from Langerhans cells in the skin. We hypothesized that the signal transduction pathways mediating the anti-lipolytic and prostaglandin D2/flushing pathways are distinct and that agonists may be identified that are capable of selectively eliciting the therapeutic, anti-lipolytic pathway while avoiding the activation of the parallel flush-inducing pathway. We have identified a number of GPR109A pyrazole agonists that are capable of fully inhibiting lipolysis in vitro and in vivo and not only fail to elicit a flushing response but can antagonize the ability of nicotinic acid to elicit a flush response in vivo. In contrast to flushing agonists, exposure of cells expressing GPR109A to the non-flushing agonists fails to induce internalization of the receptor or to activate ERK 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation.

It also offers protection against other cardiovascular risk factors by lowering very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipoprotein(a) plasma concentrations (1Carlson L.A.

Although the mechanism by which nicotinic acid raises HDL is not clear, one hypothesis is that it is the ability of nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes that results in a decrease in the concentration of free fatty acids available for the liver to use for triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production. The attenuated synthesis of the triglyceride-rich VLDL particles in the liver leads to a decreased rate of HDL metabolism via limiting the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated exchange of cholesterol from HDL to VLDL, and triglyceride from VLDL to HDL (3Carlson L.A.

Another hypothesis is that nicotinic acid inhibits the uptake and subsequent catabolism of Apo-AI-containing HDL particles in hepatocytes (7Jin F.Y. Kamanna V.S. Kashyap M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Identification of a high affinity nicotinic acid binding site that was localized to adipose, macrophage, and spleen tissues and appeared to function in a Gi protein-coupled manner (9Lorenzen A.

Kero J. Schaub A. Wufka C. Blaukat A. Pfeffer K. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). A low affinity nicotinic acid receptor has also been identified, referred to as GPR109B or HM74 (11Tunaru S. Kero J. Schaub A. Wufka C. Blaukat A. Pfeffer K. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). GPR109B appears to be the product of the gene duplication of GPR109A and is >95% identical to GPR109A. A search of available genomes indicates that this receptor is found only in the human and chimpanzee genomes and is absent in rodents. It is therefore difficult to know whether GPR109B has an endogenous ligand or plays a physiological role. The therapeutic value of nicotinic acid is limited by its major side effect, cutaneous flushing. This burning sensation, felt on the face and upper body, is responsible for a large portion of patient non-compliance (13Coronary Drug Project J. Am. Med.

A series of pyrazole derivatives have been reported in the literature that act as partial agonists for the nicotinic acid receptor (20van Herk T. Brussee J. van den Nieuwendijk A.M. van der Klein P.A. IJzerman A.P. Stannek C. Burmeister A. Lorenzen A. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The authors postulate that tissue selectivity, commonly observed with partial agonists, could be useful in preventing unwanted effects on skin cells and thus reduce or eliminate flushing. In the work presented herein, we set out to test the hypothesis that there are GPR109A agonists that are effective anti-lipolytic agents that do not cause flushing. We find that we can divide GPR109A agonists into two groups, those that elicit an anti-lipolytic and a flushing response, exemplified by nicotinic acid, and those that only elicit an anti-lipolytic response, i.e. non-flushing agonists. This second group of non-flushing compounds significantly decreases plasma free fatty acids and not only fails to elicit a flushing response but can also block the flushing response of nicotinic acid. The non-flushing agonists are comprised of both full and partial agonists, depending on the functional output examined. We further characterized the signaling pathways elicited by these compounds and have shown that compounds that led to a flushing response also induce both ERK 1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation as well as receptor internalization. The non-flushing compounds fail to significantly activate ERK 1/2 MAP kinase and do not result in receptor internalization. These non-flushing agonists may have a therapeutic, anti-lipolytic benefit without the unwanted cutaneous flushing side effect. The GPR109A receptor was cloned and stable CHO-K1 cells were generated as described in Ref. 21Taggart A.K. Kero J. Gan X. Cai T.Q. Cheng K. Ippolito M. Ren N. Kaplan R. Wu K. Wu T.J. Jin L. Liaw C.

Animal studies were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Academy of Sciences (1996). All study protocols were reviewed and approved by Arena Pharmaceutical's Internal Animal Care and Use Committee. C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, and jugular vein-catheterized Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. A 96-well Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Flashplate Assay™ kit (PerkinElmer) was optimized to measure changes in intracellular cAMP levels due to receptor activation in CHO-K1 stable cell lines expressing GPR109A. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in F-12 Kaighn's modified cell culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 400 μg/ml Geneticin in T-185 cell culture flasks. Cells were harvested from culture flasks and isolated via low speed centrifugation, counted, and diluted to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Compounds were prepared in Me2SO and serially diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were added to the test plates containing the compounds at a final cell density of 50,000 cells/well. 5 μm forskolin was added to all wells. The assay plates were placed on a shaker for 1 h at room temperature (∼25 °C). Diluted 125I-cAMP (supplied with the FlashPlate kit) was added to each well and the plates continued to shake for another 2 h. The plates were counted on a Wallac Microbeta Counter 1450. Preparation of Adipocytes—Cultured human subcutaneous adipocytes were received from Zen Bio., Inc. plated in 96-well plates 2 weeks prior to performing the lipolysis assay. Upon arrival, all medium was removed and pooled together (ZenBio Adipocyte Maintenance medium). 150 μl of this medium was then re-aliquoted to each well. Cells were kept in a sterile, humidified incubator at 37 °C and allowed to recover for 1 week. Induction of Lipolysis—On the day of the lipolysis assay, cells were washed twice with 150 μl of Zen Bio wash buffer. After the second wash and removal of wash buffer, 75 μl of test compounds were added to each well, in triplicate. Compounds were prepared in Zen Bio assay buffer plus 1 μm isoproterenol. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Glycerol Assay—Glycerol was determined using a free glycerol reagent from Sigma (Reagent A). Adipocyte medium (50 μl) was removed and transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well plate. Reagent A (50 μl) was then added to each well. After 15 min, absorbance was read at A540 on a Spectramax 340PC microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The amount of glycerol released was calculated based on regression analysis of known glycerol concentrations using a glycerol standard (Sigma). Male C57/Bl6 mice, 8–10 weeks old (∼25 g), were food-deprived 16 h prior to the experiment. They were then injected intraperitoneal with vehicle (PBS) or the compound of interest at the desired concentration (5 ml/kg) diluted in PBS. After 10 min, the animals were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation and blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. The blood was centrifuged on a tabletop centrifuge (4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min). Serum was collected in a new microfuge tube, recentrifuged (4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min), and dispensed to a 96-well plate at 5 μl/well for NEFA assay. The NEFA assay was done according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol (NEFA-C kit; Wako) adding 100 μl of reagent A, incubating for 10 min at 37 °C, adding 200 μl of reagent B, incubating for another 10 min at 37 °C, and equilibrating for 5 min at room temperature (∼25 °C). Absorbance was measured on a plate reader at 550 nm. Jugular vein cannulae of male Sprague-Dawley rats (7–10 weeks old; ∼350 g) were flushed with ∼200 μl of saline, and animals were food-deprived for 16 h. All blood draws were immediately followed by a 200-μl saline flush to maintain patency of the cannulae. Base-line blood samples were collected via cannula, and rats were given vehicle (PBS, 5% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, or 0.5% methylcellulose) or drug via per oral administration (2 ml/kg). Blood was collected at desired time points, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and placed on ice. The blood was centrifuged on a tabletop centrifuge (4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min). Serum was collected in a new microfuge tube and processed as described for the mouse NEFA assay above. Male C57/Bl6 mice (8–10 weeks old; ∼25 g) were anesthetized with Nembutal via intraperitoneal injection (80 mg/10 ml/kg). After 10 min the mouse was placed under an LDPI Laser Doppler (PeriScan PIM II; Perimed, Stockholm) and a needle and syringe containing vehicle (PBS, 40% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, or 0.5% methylcellulose) or drug was placed in the intraperitoneal space and a slight back pressure was applied to prevent premature delivery of compound. The right ear of the mouse was turned inside-out to expose the ventral side using forceps. The Laser Doppler was focused in the center of the ventral right ear and adjusted as follows: repeated data collection; 15 × 15 image format; auto interval start; 20-s delay; medium resolution; very fast scan speed; and 8–9-V intensity (∼4.5 cm from ear). After a 3-min base-line reading, vehicle or compound was administered into the intraperitoneal space (5 ml/kg through the preinserted syringe), and readings continued for ∼15 min. For competition assays, a similar protocol was utilized with the exception that immediately following the Nembutal injection the mouse was intraperitoneal-injected with vehicle or competing compound. This was followed by establishing baseline and intraperitoneal drug administration (typically 30 mg/kg nicotinic acid) as described above. In some cases, this round of flushing was followed by re-establishing base-line and intraperitoneal PGD2 (2 mg/5 ml/kg) injection as a positive control. MAP kinase assays were performed using the phospho-MAP kinase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (KHO 0091) from BIOSOURCE according to the manufacturer's specifications. Specifically, CHO-K1 stable cell lines expressing GPR109A were serum-starved overnight. Cells were stimulated with compounds for 5 min at 37 °C, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed with PBS. The cells were scraped in 1 ml of PBS and transferred to a microfuge tube. The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of cell extraction buffer (0.1% SDS). The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min, 4 °C at 13,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford analysis, and 10 μg of protein was added to each well of a 96-well plate coated with anti-phospho-MAP kinase capture antibody. The samples were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C and then extensively washed before incubation with the anti-phospho-MAP kinase detection antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. The samples were washed and then incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at 25 °C. The samples were washed and then incubated with chromogen in the dark for 20 min at 25 °C before stopping the reaction with stop buffer. Absorbance at 450 nm was read on a Spectramax 340PC microplate reader (Molecular Devices). For the mouse ear MAP kinase assays, mice were injected intraperitoneal with either vehicle or niacin at 100 mg/kg. After 5 min, mice were sacrificed via CO2 asphyxiation and the ears removed. Ears were minced into small pieces and homogenized in lysis buffer using a Brinkman Polytron. Membrane protein was isolated via centrifugation at 20,000 rpm (JA-25.50 rotor, 15 min, 4 °C). Membrane pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of cell extraction buffer and treated as described above. COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with NH2-terminal HA epitope-tagged human or mouse GPR109A and human β-arrestin2 and plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well). Receptor internalization was assayed at 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated on ice for 1 h with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-HA-antibody 16B12 (Molecular Probes) at 5 μg/ml in Opti-MEM. Indicated concentrations of compounds were then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for various lengths of time. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with formaldehyde. Coverslips were then mounted on slides for visualization. Mouse epidermal cells were isolated and cultured as described in Ref. 19Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Richman J.G. Hakak Y. Gaidarov I. Behan D.P.

Compounds used in the assays described herein are shown in Fig. 1. CHO-K1 cells were stably transfected with GPR109A and cellular cAMP was measured in the intact cells. Compounds were added at the indicated concentrations to measure their ability to inhibit 5 μm forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels, and nicotinic acid was used as the full agonist positive control. 5-Methyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (3a), 3-methyl-5-carboxyl-isoxazole (4a), 5-isopropyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (2a), and 5-meta-fluorobenzyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (1c) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production to the same extent as nicotinic acid (i.e. were full agonists; Fig. 2). By contrast, 5-meta-chlorobenzyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (1a) and 5-meta-bromobenzyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (1b) were able to inhibit only 65–67% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP production (i.e. were partial agonists; Fig. 2). These compounds had the same potency and efficacy when applied to cAMP assays using cells stably transfected with human, rat, or mouse GPR109A. The partial agonists 1a and 1b were applied to [3H]nicotinic acid competition binding assays and were able to fully displace [3H]nicotinic acid binding (data not shown).FIGURE 2Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP in stably transfected CHO-K1 cells. GPR109A agonists were added at the indicated concentrations to measure their ability to inhibit forskolin (5 μm)-stimulated cAMP production. Nicotinic acid was used as the full agonist, positive control. Values represent mean % inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production normalized to nicotinic acid ± S.E. IC50 values are shown in the table above. Height represents the % maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP relative to nicotinic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the ability of these compounds to inhibit human adipocyte lipolysis in an in vitro model. Human subcutaneous adipocytes were cultured and differentiated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lipolysis was stimulated with 1 μm isoproterenol, and compounds were added to determine their ability to inhibit lipolysis. Fig. 3 shows the results of the adipocyte lipolysis assays. All of the compounds tested inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis with varying potencies. All but one compound, 4a, appeared to inhibit lipolysis to the same extent as nicotinic acid (i.e. full inhibition; Fig. 3). Compound 4a was only able to decrease glycerol production to 50% of the control value (Fig. 3), indicating that it is a partial agonist in this assay. We next examined the effect of these GPR109A agonists on plasma free fatty acid concentrations in vivo in male C57Bl/6 mice. Again, all of the compounds examined were able to acutely depress plasma free fatty acid concentrations to an equivalent or greater extent than nicotinic acid 10 min after per oral agonist administration (Fig. 4). This effect appeared to be dose-dependent for each of the agonists examined. The potency of the compounds varied but did not necessarily reflect the predicted, in vitro, potency of the agonists. This more likely reflects the bioavailability and/or compound half-life. When we applied the GPR109A agonists to an acute, in vivo rat model of plasma free fatty acid measurement, we found similar results. All of the compounds examined dose and time dependently depressed plasma free fatty acids levels (Fig. 5). The maximal extent of plasma free fatty acid inhibition was similar for all of the agonists (up to ∼75% inhibition of base-line values). The cutaneous flushing induced by these agonists was assessed via Laser Doppler (which measures blood flow, and thus vasodilation) on the ears of male C57Bl/6 mice. Fig. 6 illustrates that some of the GPR109A agonists described above led to a flushing response (nicotinic acid, 3a, and 4a) whereas others did not (Fig. 6, 1a, 1b, 1c, and 2a). When compound 1a, a non-flushing GPR109A agonist, was preinjected into the mice 10 min prior to base line (13 min prior to nicotinic acid injection), nicotinic acid was unable to elicit a flushing response (Fig. 7). When similar experiments were performed with a follow-up PGD2 injection, the animals responded with a concomitant full flushing response (data not shown). These data indicate that the non-flushing compound 1a is able to interact with receptors on the cells responsible for mediating the flushing response and antagonizes the nicotinic acid-mediated flushing effect (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Competition of nicotinic acid-induced flush in mice. C57Bl/6 mice were given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or compound 1a 10 min prior to determining base line (co-administered with the Nembutal anesthetization). Base line was established followed by intraperitoneal injection of nicotinic acid. Values are the mean % change from base-line, prenicotinic acid injection values ± S.E. of eleven or five animals as indicated in the key at right. Preinjection of compound 1a antagonized the ability of nicotinic acid to induce a flushing response.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anti-phospho ERK 1/2 MAP kinase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed on the GPR109A stably transfected CHO cells. Interestingly, of the compounds tested only the flush-inducing compounds nicotinic acid, 5-methyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (compound 3a), and 3-methyl-5-carboxyl-isoxazole (compound 4a) stimulated MAP kinase activation (Fig. 8). On the other hand, the non-flush-inducing compounds 5-meta-chlorobenzyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (1a) and 5-isopropyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (2a) failed to significantly increase ERK 1/2 MAP kinase activity (Fig. 8). It was postulated that β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization are required for MAP kinase activation (as proposed by Daaka et al.) (22Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della R.G. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To test this, we examined the ability of these compounds to differentially internalize epitope-tagged GPR109A in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Fig. 9 shows the dose-dependent effects of nicotinic acid and 5-meta-chlorobenzyl-3-carboxyl-pyrazole (compound 1a) on the cellular localization of HA-tagged GPR109A. Following 30 min of exposure of the cells to 1, 10, and 100 μm nicotinic acid or the isoxazole agonist 4a, anti-HA immunoreactivity appears to cluster in a characteristic pattern within the subcellular space (Fig. 9, left and right rows), indicative of agonist-directed receptor internalization. On the other hand, compound 1a, a non-flushing agonist, failed to effect any change in anti-HA immunoreactivity, confirming the hypothesis that this agonist fails to drive receptor internalization (middle row). When applied to other GPR109A agonists described herein, the qualitative assessment of HA-tagged GPR109A immunoreactivity revealed that, again, nicotinic acid stimulation results in receptor internalization, whereas non-flushing compounds 2a and 1a–c fail to internalize receptor immunoreactivity (Fig. 10).FIGURE 10Qualitative assessment of GPR109A internalization following 10 μm agonist exposure for 30 min. Internalization of GPR109A was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy on transiently transfected COS-7 cells following 30 min of exposure to 10 μm of indicated compounds. Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent work examining the mechanism of niacin-induced flushing has revealed that it is mediated by GPR109A (16Benyó Z. Gille A. Kero J. Csiky M. Suchánková M.C. Nüsing R. Moers A. Pfeffer K. Offermanns S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3634-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and requires the release of PGD2 and activation of DP1 receptors in the skin (18Cheng K. Wu T.J. Wu K.K. Sturino C. Metters K. Gottesdiener K. Wright S.D. Wang Z. O'Neill G. Lai E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and, finally, that the PGD2 release is mediated by epidermal Langerhans cells (17Benyó Z. Gille A. Bennett C.L. Clausen B.E. Offermanns S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Richman J.G. Hakak Y. Gaidarov I. Behan D.P. Connolly D.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 2637-2646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Based on the results shown herein we would speculate that GPR109A agonists activate a MAP kinase-mediated release of PGD2 from Langerhans cells, leading to the cutaneous vasodilation responsible for the flushing response. As shown in Fig. 11A, mice given an intraperitoneal niacin injection had a profound, 3-fold elevation of phospho-MAP kinase in the ear (where flushing is measured in the mouse model). When mouse epidermal cells were isolated and cultured, niacin treatment led to a significant PDG2 release that was attenuated by pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 11B). This effect was also seen in cultured human Langerhans cells where both the MEK inhibitor and indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) were able to attenuate PGD2 release (Fig. 11C). Although in vivo use of the MEK inhibitor to prevent flushing was confounded by its inability to inhibit MAP kinase production in this model, the above results are consistent with a MAP kinase requirement for flushing. The results presented herein indicate that there are GPR109A agonists that, like nicotinic acid, are capable of stimulating the Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes, and decrease plasma free fatty acids in both mice and rats but that lack the ability to induce receptor internalization and ERK 1/2 MAP kinase activation. We find that the compounds that fall into this group fail to elicit a flushing response and, in fact, can antagonize the flushing response elicited by nicotinic acid. These results suggest that it may be possible to tailor anti-lipolytic compounds that fail to induce the unwanted flushing side effect present in nicotinic acid preparations. The concept that a receptor agonist may selectively activate only a subset of signal effectors distinct from other agonists via a common receptor has been proposed for a number of G protein-coupled receptors. This phenomenon may result if the effectors being examined are sequential and the agonists used have differing intrinsic efficacies resulting in differential signal strength. One agonist may induce a first effector sufficient to overcome a threshold necessary to activate a second, downstream effector signal, whereas another agonist is capable of eliciting a measurable, first effector signal that is not sufficient to activate the second effector pathway. Alternatively, it has been proposed that receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors may, upon activation, have more than one active conformation. In this model one agonist would induce a conformation capable of activating multiple, parallel effector pathways, whereas another agonist induces a receptor conformation only capable of eliciting a subset of signaling effectors. This model of pleiotropic agonist signaling has been termed “agonist-directed trafficking of receptor signals” (23Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 232-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The idea that different agonists may induce different receptor conformations or may have different signal strengths, and therefore divergent signaling pathways, has been suggested by a number of groups for a variety of G protein-coupled receptors including the α2A-adrenergic receptor, 5HT2 receptors, adenosine-A1, and the nicotinic acid receptor (Refs. 20van Herk T. Brussee J. van den Nieuwendijk A.M. van der Klein P.A. IJzerman A.P. Stannek C. Burmeister A. Lorenzen A. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24Tan C.M.

In these studies it is suggested that use of one agonist or agonist class may elicit cellular and pharmacological activities distinct from activities elicited by another agonist or agonist class. These concepts have been adopted by a number of groups for the use of partial agonists, compounds that bind receptors but in which activation does not translate to a fully efficacious response, to elicit a desired response without an undesirable side effect. For example, it was shown by Tan et al. (24Tan C.M. Wilson M.H. MacMillan L.B. Kobilka B.K. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12471-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that use of an α2A-adrenergic receptor partial agonist, moxonidine, has an anti-hypertensive effect in wild-type C57Bl/6 mice while avoiding the sedative side effect elicited by the α2AAR full agonist clonidine. In this study it is important to note that different agonists elicit in vitro responses with varying degrees of efficacy as a function of the different effectors examined (e.g. GTPγS binding, MAP kinase activation, etc.). In addition, the receptor density and downstream effectors are going to vary in different tissues and therefore the relative efficacies of agonists will also vary accordingly. The authors conclude that partial agonists can evoke response-selective pathways and may be used to provide response-selective therapies (24Tan C.M. Wilson M.H. MacMillan L.B. Kobilka B.K. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12471-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As described in the Introduction, a series of pyrazole derivatives have been reported in the literature that act as partial agonists for [35S]GTPγS binding via the nicotinic acid receptor in rat adipocyte and spleen membranes (20van Herk T. Brussee J. van den Nieuwendijk A.M. van der Klein P.A. IJzerman A.P. Stannek C. Burmeister A. Lorenzen A. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The authors postulate that tissue selectivity, commonly observed with partial agonists, could be useful in preventing unwanted, flush-inducing side effects on skin cells while maintaining the ability to inhibit lipolysis. In examination of the compounds presented herein, when we looked at agonist effects at inhibiting cAMP we identified four full agonists (compounds 1c and 2–4a) and two partial agonists (compounds 1a and 1b); of these, three are non-flushing compounds (one full agonist and both of the partial agonists). These effects are independent of the species of the receptor as the potency and efficacy of these compounds were essentially identical in human, rat, or mouse stably transfected cells. In the in vitro lipolysis assay one of the compounds, 4a, is a partial agonist, yet this compound is a potent flush inducer. It should be noted that these compounds have little or no affinity to GPR109B, the low affinity niacin receptor. In addition, as mentioned in the Introduction, GPR109B does not appear to have a rodent ortholog. Therefore, differential effects mediated by the panel of molecules presented herein cannot be explained on the basis of non-selectivity. Therefore, the separation of downstream effector signals in order to achieve a therapeutic effect without the unwanted side effect does not necessarily require the development of partial agonists. Rather, the drug design and identification process should be focused on identification of agonists that potently stimulate responses downstream of effectors known to mediate therapeutic responses and that lack the ability to stimulate effectors that mediate untoward side effects. Obviously, because the mechanism of therapeutic action of nicotinic acid has yet to be identified, one concern would be that eliminating the side effect may also eliminate the desired therapeutic effect. Preclinical and clinical studies need to be done comparing the therapeutic efficacy of compounds that fall into the two categories, those that elicit flushing, MAP kinase activation, and internalization in addition to eliciting an anti-lipolytic response versus those that solely elicit an anti-lipolytic response.

Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 5Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A.

The photopigments purified from these expression systems contain trace amounts of MTHF and stoichiometric flavin cofactor in the two-electron oxidized, FADox, form. A number of interesting observations have been made with Arabidopsis cryptochromes, in particular with AtCry1, which may be relevant to their functions. First, AtCry1 binds ATP in the cavity containing the flavin cofactor (8Özgür S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Bouly J.P. Giovani B.

Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Second, AtCry1 exhibits an autophosphorylating kinase activity (9Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Euro. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Third, the FADox of AtCry1 is photoreduced to the FADH· neutral radical by intraprotein electron transfer both in vitro and in vivo (4Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Bouly J.P. Schleicher E Dionisio-Sese M Vandenbusscbe F. Van Der Stradeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittle R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Fourth, this intraprotein electron transfer causes a conformational change in the C-terminal tail of AtCry1 (13Partch C.L. Clarkson M.W. Özgür S. Lee A.L. Sancar Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Kottke T. Batschauer A. Ahmad A. Heberle J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is known to play a key role in signal transduction. Fifth, the intraprotein electron transfer and, presumably, the accompanying conformational change activates or greatly stimulates the intrinsic kinase activity of AtCry1 (9Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Euro. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Shalitin D. Yu X. Maymon M. Mockler T. Lin C. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Sixth, in support of the previous findings, it was reported that mutation of the Trp residue that functions as the electron donor in photoreduction abolished the stimulatory effect of light on the kinase activity (15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, a photocycle for plant cryptochromes has been proposed (12Bouly J.P. Schleicher E Dionisio-Sese M Vandenbusscbe F. Van Der Stradeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittle R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Blue light reduces the FADox to FADH·, which is the signaling form of plant cryptochrome. Absorption of a green light photon by FADH· further reduces it to FADH– and turns off the signal. Facile oxidation of FADH– to FADox under aerobic conditions regenerates the active form of cryptochrome and completes the photocycle. In contrast to the plant cryptochromes, there is rather limited information on the photochemical properties of animal cryptochromes. This is, to a large extent, due to the unavailability of animal cryptochromes with full cofactor complement and in large quantities (3Partch C.L. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Özgür S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Human cryptochromes purified using bacterial and insect cell expression systems contain grossly substoichiometric flavin and only trace amounts of MTHF (3Partch C.L. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Özgür S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, recently the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) Cry1 (16Zhu H. Yuan Q. Briscoe A.D. Froy O. Casselman A. Reppert S.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R953-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) expressed in E. coli (17Denaro T.R. Purification and Characterization of Danaus plexippus Cryptochromes. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill2006Google Scholar) and the Drosophila melanogaster Cry (DmCry) expressed in Sf21 insect cells (18Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R. Henning S. Alexander M. Wolf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were found to contain near stoichiometric flavin in the form of FADox. Interestingly, exposure of these cryptochromes to blue light led to the photoreduction of flavin to the FAD.¯ flavin anion radical (17Denaro T.R. Purification and Characterization of Danaus plexippus Cryptochromes. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill2006Google Scholar, 18Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R. Henning S. Alexander M. Wolf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) instead of the FADH· flavin neutral radical observed in plant cryptochromes (4Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Bouly J.P. Schleicher E Dionisio-Sese M Vandenbusscbe F. Van Der Stradeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittle R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The photochemically generated flavin anion radical was reoxidized to FADox in the dark, and thus, it was proposed that, in at least these animal cryptochromes, the FADOX⇄darkhvFAD−˙ constitutes the photocycle, and the FAD.¯ form of cryptochrome represents the signaling state of the photoreceptor (18Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R. Henning S. Alexander M. Wolf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, we blocked the FADox→hvFAD.¯ transition by site-specific mutagenesis to test the biological relevance of this photochemical reaction in Drosophila Cry-like animal cryptochromes. Our results show that blocking the photoreduction of FADox in DpCry1 by intramolecular electron transfer does not affect its circadian photoreception function as measured by light-induced proteolytic degradation of the cryptochrome. Cloning of DpCry1 into a Bacterial Expression Vector—The DpCry1 was amplified by PCR using primers designed from the sequence that is in public databases and the pAC5.1 DpCry1 plasmid carrying the cDNA of DpCry1 as a template (16Zhu H. Yuan Q. Briscoe A.D. Froy O. Casselman A. Reppert S.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R953-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The gene was inserted into the pMal-c2 bacterial expression vector (New England Biolabs). The plasmid, which was named pDpCry1, encodes DpCry1 fused to the C-terminal end of E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP). The entire cloned gene was sequenced to ensure that no mutation was introduced into DpCry1 during PCR and the subsequent cloning manipulations. To investigate the role of photoreduction in DpCry1 activity, the W328F substitution was made in pDpCry1 and in pACS.1 DpCry for in vitro and in vivo assays, respectively. In both cases, the mutated gene was sequenced in its entirety to ensure the absence of incidental sequence alterations. Purification of DpCry1—The pDpCry1 or pDpCry1-W328F plasmids were inserted into E. coli BL21 (Strategene). Fresh colonies were picked and grown in Luria broth, in 1-liter batches, at 37 °C to A600 = 0.5. Then, the cultures were transferred to 15 °C and incubated for an additional 12–16 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A per liter of culture. Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cell suspension was frozen in dry ice/ethanol and kept at –80 °C. To prepare cell-free extract, the cells were thawed and were then incubated on ice with lysozyme at 1 mg/ml for 30 min. After an additional freeze-thaw cycle, the cells were sonicated 10 × 10 s with a Branson sonicator. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 90 min in a Ti 45 rotor at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman L-80 centrifuge. Cell-free extract from a 12-liter culture was loaded onto a 20-ml amylose column (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer A, and MBP-DpCry1 was eluted with 32 ml of Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl and 15 mm maltose. Two-ml fractions were collected, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing MBP-DpCry1 were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin 20 (Qiagen) and centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a Sorvall RC5B plus centrifuge. Unless otherwise indicated, the cryptochrome was dialyzed against Storage Buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. Typical yield was ∼2 mg of cryptochrome from a 12-liter culture. To prevent photochemical modification of DpCry1 during purification, we undertook one of the following precautions. Either the entire purification procedure was carried out under dim yellow light, or Buffer A, and subsequent buffers used in the purification contained 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, instead of Tris-HCl buffer, and lacked reducing agents (β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol) and EDTA, which also acts as a weak reductant. Spectroscopy—Absorption and fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-601 spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu RF5000U spectrofluorometer, respectively. Photoreduction—The wild-type DpCry1 and the W328F mutant DpCry1 in storage buffer were placed in a quartz cuvette and exposed to 366 nm light at a fluence rate of 2 milliwatts cm–2 using two F15T8-BLB black lights (General Electric) as an energy source. Light was filtered through a glass plate to eliminate short wavelength contaminants and through a heat-reflecting glass (Precision Glass & Optics) to prevent excessive heating. Photoinduced Degradation of DpCry1—To test the photosensitivity of wild-type DpCry1 and DpCry1(W328F) to light-induced degradation (19Emery P. So W.V. Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 95: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 20Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1988; 95: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 21Froy O. Chang D.C. Reppert S.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 147-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the cDNAs of these genes as well as that of DmCry (positive control) and DpCry2 (negative control) and β-galactosidase (loading control) were cloned into pAc5.1v5/HisA, a Schneider 2(S2) cell expression vector (16Zhu H. Yuan Q. Briscoe A.D. Froy O. Casselman A. Reppert S.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R953-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The S2 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids and incubated at 27 °C for 36 h. Then, the culture plates were exposed to 366 nm light at a rate of 1 milliwatt cm–2. The dark control samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and treated similarly. The S2 cells were lysed, cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the levels of Crys and β-galactosidase were determined by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-V5 IgG (Invitrogen). The levels of the Crys were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant 5.0 software (GE Healthcare) and expressed relative to the β-galactosidase internal control. Data from three experiments, with the S.E., are plotted. Purification and Properties of DpCry1—Previously, it has not been possible to investigate the photochemical reactions catalyzed by animal cryptochromes such as Drosophila Cry, which are known to function as circadian photoreceptors (20Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1988; 95: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (773) Google Scholar), because these proteins were available only as recombinant proteins with 1–5% content of FAD, which is thought to be the catalytic cofactor. Recently, we discovered that of the two monarch butterfly cryptochromes, the one known to function as a photoreceptor, DpCry1 (16Zhu H. Yuan Q. Briscoe A.D. Froy O. Casselman A. Reppert S.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R953-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), can be expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein to a high level (17Denaro T.R. Purification and Characterization of Danaus plexippus Cryptochromes. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill2006Google Scholar). More importantly, when recombinant DpCry1 was purified from E. coli (Fig. 1A), it contained near stoichiometric amounts of flavin in the two electron-oxidized form (FADox) (Fig. 1B). The photolyase/cryptochrome family members, in addition to flavin, are known or suspected to contain MTHF (or rarely, 8-deazaflavin) as second chromophores that are non-essential for activity but improve the efficiency of the photochemical reaction by functioning as a photoantenna that absorbs light and transfers the excitation energy to FAD (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In the majority of photolyases and all known cryptochromes, MTHF dissociates from the apoprotein readily during purification (4Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 5Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, formal proof that Crys contain MTHF (or any other second chromophore) is lacking. Indeed, as is apparent in Fig. 1B, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of DpCry1 is typical of protein-bound flavin with no indication of an additional chromophore. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to test for the presence of MTHF at a level that is not detectable by absorption spectroscopy. As seen in Fig. 1C, excitation of DpCry1 at 360 nm results in fluorescence emission with a maximum at 480 nm and a shoulder at 505 nm. It is known that photolyase-bound MTHF has an absorption peak in the 370–415 nm range and fluorescence maximum at 460–480 nm (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that DpCry1 does contain MTHF, albeit at grossly substoichiometric amounts in the purified pigment. Finally, excitation of DpCry1 at 450 nm where MTHF does not absorb, but FADox does yield the characteristic flavin fluorescence emission at 520 nm. It should be noted that we measured the FAD:DpCry1 apoprotein ratio by estimating the apoprotein level by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels containing known amounts of bovine serum albumin standards and the FAD level by absorption of the native protein at 450 nm. No accurate estimates can be made for the level of MTHF. Based on the absorption spectrum of DpCry1 and the known extinction coefficients of FADox and MTHF in the 370–390 nm region (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), we estimate the MTHF content of DpCry1 to be <5%. Photochemical Properties of DpCry1—Exposure of Arabidopsis Cry1 to blue light reduces FADox to FADH· neutral radical, and this reaction has been considered to be the key step in the photocycle of AtCry1 (15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R. Henning S. Alexander M. Wolf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of blue light on DpCry1. Unexpectedly, we found that FADox in DpCry1 was photoreduced to the flavin anion radical, FAD.¯, and not to FADH·, as is seen in Arabidopsis (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the quantum yield of the photoreduction was extremely high, in the range of 0.4–0.5 (Fig. 2C). This contrasts with the quantum yield of 0.01 for photoreduction of FADox to FADH· in Arabidopsis Cry1 (15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R. Henning S. Alexander M. Wolf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In fact, although AtCry1 can be purified with FADox under normal laboratory lighting conditions, when DpCry1 is purified under the same condition, all of the flavin is in the FAD2.˜¯ form (17Denaro T.R. Purification and Characterization of Danaus plexippus Cryptochromes. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill2006Google Scholar). To prevent photoreduction during purification, DpCry1 must be purified either under yellow light (λ > 550 nm), or reducing agents such as dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, and even EDTA must be excluded from the purification buffers. DpCry1( FAD.¯) is relatively stable and reoxidizes back to DpCry1(FADox) under aerobic conditions with a life time of 54 s under our reaction conditions (Fig. 2C). It must also be noted that under our experimental conditions, even very long irradiation of DpCry1 failed to convert the flavin to the two-electron reduced FADH– form (data not shown). Physiologic Role of Photoreduction—In E. coli photolyase, the Trp triad, FADH· ← Trp-382 ← Trp-359 ← Trp-306, is the photoreduction pathway with Trp-306 being the ultimate electron donor (23Li Y.F. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 25Kavakli I.H. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15103-15110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this Trp triad is conserved in most DNA photolyases and cryptochromes (1Lin C. Shalitin D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 54: 469-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Partch C.L. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this pathway plays no role in the photocycle of photolyase (23Li Y.F. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), which contains the flavin in the FADH– form in vivo (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 24Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been reported that Arabidopsis Cry1 contains the flavin in the FADox form in vivo, that the photoreduction is part of the catalytic photocycle, and that the photosignaling activity of AtCry1 is eliminated by the Trp → Phe mutation of the Trp residue corresponding to the E. coli Trp-306 (15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We wished to find out whether photoreduction of FADox in DpCry1 was a key reaction in the photocycle of this cryptochrome as well. To this end, we mutated Trp-328 in DpCry1, which is the structural counterpart of Trp-306 of E. coli photolyase. Mutating the Trp residue corresponding to Trp-306 of E. coli photolyase to investigate intraprotein electron transfer and its role in cryptochrome function is preferable to mutating the Trp residues that correspond to Trp-359 and Trp-382 in photolyase because Trp-306 and its counterparts in cryptochromes are located on the surface of the proteins (10Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 24Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and mutating these residues does not destabilize the proteins, whereas mutating Trp-359 and Trp-382, which are located in the core of the apoenzymes, causes significant destabilization (23Li Y.F. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), making the photochemical properties of these mutants open to alternative interpretations. Thus, we confined our analysis to the DpCry1 (W328F) mutant. We tested the DpCry1 (W328F) mutant protein in vitro for photoreduction and in vivo for photosignaling as measured by light-induced DpCry1 degradation. Fig. 2, B and C, show that the W328F mutation blocked photoreduction of FADox in DpCry1 as expected. Interestingly, however, this mutation had no effect on photodegradation of DpCry1 in S2 insect cells (Fig. 3), leading us to conclude that in DpCry1 and other insect Cry1 type (Drosophila-like) cryptochromes, the photogeneration of FAD.¯ anion radical is not required for the photoreceptor function of cryptochrome. Excitation of flavin by blue light in the majority of flavoproteins leads to quenching of the excited state at a much faster rate than that of free flavin (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). This is, almost invariably, due to electron transfer from neighboring redox active amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and histidine to the excited singlet state flavin, which is a potent oxidant. This property of flavoproteins has been extensively used to study the physical-chemical aspects of intraprotein electron transfer (26Zhong D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 16: 722-728Google Scholar). Naturally, in enzymes that utilize ground state flavin to catalyze redox reactions, such as glucose oxidase or cholesterol oxidase that carry out catalysis independently of light, the photoinduced reduction of flavin has no bearing on enzyme activity under physiological conditions. The significance, or the lack of, photoinduced electron transfer from aromatic amino acids to the flavin in photoreceptor flavoproteins such as photolyase and cryptochromes is more difficult to ascertain. Stringent criteria need to be applied to determine whether photoreduction of the flavin is a side reaction with no biological relevance or a key step in the photocycle of these flavin-based blue-light photoreceptors. In the case of DNA photolyases, overwhelming evidence indicates that the native form of the enzyme contains flavin in the FADH– form, which, when excited by light directly or by energy transfer, is incapable of abstracting electrons from neighboring amino acids because of its high reduction potential. Instead, it initiates DNA repair by donating an electron to DNA photoproducts and catalyzes repair by a cyclic electron transfer reaction (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the cryptochrome photocycle, in contrast, is rather limited. There is no known redox reaction catalyzed by cryptochromes. As a consequence, alternative roles for flavin must be considered, and any light-induced reaction in these photopigments must be seriously considered as a potential candidate for the photocycle. Light has been shown to induce a conformational change in the C-terminal extension of AtCry1 (13Partch C.L. Clarkson M.W. Özgür S. Lee A.L. Sancar Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Kottke T. Batschauer A. Ahmad A. Heberle J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and to stimulate the kinase activity of AtCry1 (9Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, this stimulation was reported to be caused by electron transfer through the Trp triad of AtCry1, and it was claimed that the blockage of intraprotein electron transfer through the triad abolished the photoreceptor function of AtCry1 in vivo (15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The model that has emerged from these studies is that blue light induces electron transfer from a specific Trp residue in the apoprotein to flavin to generate FADH·, and in the process, to cause a conformational change in the protein that activates its kinase function (9Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Euro. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Bouly J.P.

The activated kinase, in turn, modulates the interaction of AtCry1 with the COP1 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) ligase and inhibits the ubiquitination of HY5 and related light-responsive transcription factors by the ligase, prevents their proteolytic degradation, and thus, turns on blue-light response genes (1Lin C. Shalitin D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 54: 469-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Partch C.L. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The findings reported here and elsewhere (17Denaro T.R. Purification and Characterization of Danaus plexippus Cryptochromes. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill2006Google Scholar, 18Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R. Henning S. Alexander M. Wolf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), showing that photoreduction does occur in Drosophila Cry-type insect cryptochromes, have raised the possibility that these animal cryptochromes as well may have a somewhat similar photocycle. However, the model for the AtCry1 photocycle has encountered some serious difficulties. First, the light-induced autokinase activity has not been consistently reproducible (8Özgür S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Second, AtCry2, which also functions as a blue-light photoreceptor exhibits no autokinase activity with or without blue light (8Özgür S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally, the site-specific mutations that block intraprotein electron transfer in AtCry1 reduce not only the light-stimulated kinase but also the basal light-independent kinase activity (15Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may exert their effects by causing a nonspecific overall protein misfolding rather than disruption of a specific pathway. When considered in light of these findings in plant cryptochromes and other biochemical and photochemical findings in animal cryptochromes, it appears that the photoreduction of DpCry1, and by extension of other insect cryptochromes of the same class (27Yuan Q. Metterville D. Briscoe A.D. Reppert S.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), is not part of the cryptochrome photocycle. Of particular significance, the action spectrum of Drosophila Cry, which exhibits a major peak in the 350–400 nm range and a plateau in the 430–450 nm range, does not match the absorption spectrum of FADox (28Van Vickle-Chavez S.J. Van Gelder R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as would be expected from the Trp-mediated intraprotein photoreduction model. Finally, as we show here, blocking photoreduction of DpCry1 by site-specific mutagenesis does not affect its photoreceptor activity, at least not the photochemical reaction that promotes DpCry1 degradation. These latter two findings raise the possibility that Cry1-type insect blue-light photoreceptors may contain not FADox but rather, FAD.¯ as the catalytic cofactor and may mediate photoinduced redox reactions as part of their photocycle.

https://openalex.org/W2160751263,"In this study we characterize two novel chloroplast SufE-like proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. Other SufE-like proteins, including the previously described A. thaliana CpSufE, participate in sulfur mobilization for Fe-S biosynthesis through activation of cysteine desulfurization by NifS-like proteins. In addition to CpSufE, the Arabidopsis genome encodes two other proteins with SufE domains, SufE2 and SufE3. SufE2 has plastid targeting information. Purified recombinant SufE2 could activate the cysteine desulfurase activity of CpNifS 40-fold. SufE2 expression was flower-specific and high in pollen; we therefore hypothesize that SufE2 has a specific function in pollen Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. SufE3, also a plastid targeted protein, was expressed at low levels in all major plant organs. The mature SufE3 contains two domains, one SufE-like and one with similarity to the bacterial quinolinate synthase, NadA. Indeed SufE3 displayed both SufE activity (stimulating CpNifS cysteine desulfurase activity 70-fold) and quinolinate synthase activity. The full-length protein was shown to carry a highly oxygen-sensitive (4Fe-4S) cluster at its NadA domain, which could be reconstituted by its own SufE domain in the presence of CpNifS, cysteine and ferrous iron. Knock-out of SufE3 in Arabidopsis is embryolethal. We conclude that SufE3 is the NadA enzyme of A. thaliana, involved in a critical step during NAD biosynthesis.

Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Fe-S proteins are involved in processes such as electron transport, redox and non-redox catalysis, sensing of environmental stimuli, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression (2Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 3Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem.

Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although Fe-S clusters are derived from two of the most abundant elements on earth, they are not formed spontaneously in cells but arise by controlled biosynthesis requiring an intricate interplay of numerous proteins (5Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In plants, Fe-S proteins are particularly important for photosynthesis. In the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, Fe-S cluster proteins function in photosynthetic electron transport leading to the production of ATP and NADPH (7Raven J. Evans M.C.W. Korb R.E. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 111-149Crossref Google Scholar). These molecules provide the energy and reducing power for photosynthetic carbon reduction and assimilation, as well as for sulfur and nitrogen reduction and assimilation, which require Fe-S prosthetic groups as cofactors for sulfite reductase and nitrite reductase (for a review, see Ref. 8Ye H. Pilon M. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. New Phytol. 2006; 171: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fe-S cluster biogenesis can be divided into elemental sulfur formation, iron acquisition, assembly of iron and sulfur into a cluster, and cluster insertion into apoproteins (2Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 3Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, sulfur is mobilized from cysteine by the action of a a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase enzyme (9Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 10Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfur is combined with iron atoms, of which the source is still unknown, on a scaffold protein. There, a transient Fe-S cluster is assembled before insertion into apoproteins to form functional Fe-S proteins (11Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K.

In bacteria three main Fe-S assembly systems have been described which are termed NIF (nitrogen fixation), ISC 2The abbreviations used are: ISC, Fe-S cluster; QA, quinolinic acid; QS, quinolinate synthase; DHAP, dihydroxy acetone phosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcription. (Fe-S cluster) and SUF (mobilization of sulfur) (9Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2005; 50: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); each system contains a cysteine desulfurase. While the NIF operon has a specialized function in nitrogen fixation in certain bacteria, the ISC operon is thought to be involved in the general Fe-S cluster biosynthesis pathway (9Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The SUF system appears to represent an alternative pathway for the assembly of Fe-S clusters under oxidative stress and iron limitation (16Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 19Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In plants, chloroplasts have their own Fe-S cluster biogenesis machinery (20Suzuki S. Izumihara K. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Hase T. Matsubara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2434-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the redox conditions in the chloroplast are particularly challenging for the synthesis and maintenance of Fe-S cluster proteins, because Fe-S clusters are very sensitive to oxygen and photosynthesis produces oxygen (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Therefore, chloroplasts must have unique mechanisms better suited for Fe-S cluster formation under oxidizing conditions and/or mechanisms to replace or repair oxidatively damaged clusters. It is therefore not surprising that, based on sequence similarities, the plastid Fe-S biosynthesis components identified to date are most related to the bacterial Suf cluster genes, known to function under oxidative stress (4Balk J. Lobreaux S. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Characterization of the chloroplastic Fe-S machinery started with the discovery and characterization of the cysteine desulfurase CpNifS, also known as NFS2 (22Leon S. Touraine B. Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cysteine desulfurase activity of CpNifS is required for Fe-S cluster formation in the chloroplast protein ferredoxin in vitro (24Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Planta. 2005; 220: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other components of the plastidic Fe-S cluster biosynthetic machinery are the putative scaffold proteins CpNfu1–3 (25Leon S. Touraine B. Ribot C. Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Touraine B. Boutin J.P. Marion-Poll A. Briat J.F. Peltier G. Lobreaux S.

In addition, several other Suf-type components may assist in Fe-S formation in plastids (30Möller S.G. Kunkel T. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Xu X.M. Adams S. Chua N.H. Möller S.G. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The CpSufBCD complex is an ATPase that may be involved in providing iron or transferring the Fe-S cluster from the scaffold protein to the target protein (31Xu X.M. Adams S. Chua N.H. Möller S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6648-6654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Xu X.M. Möller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9143-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis CpNifS is a class II cysteine desulfurase and has only a low level of Cys desulfurase activity in vitro (23Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), similar to its bacterial homologue SufS. The cysteine desulfurase activity of Escherichia coli SufS was enhanced severalfold in the presence of bacterial SufE; SufE alone had no cysteine desulfurase activity (33Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteine of bacterial SufE is critical for the stimulation of cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS (33Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition, SufE, a homodimeric protein without cofactor, was shown to tightly bind to SufS to form a heterotetrameric complex (33Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Homologues of SufE are found in a wide variety of organisms, including prokaryotes and eukaryotes. All of these proteins have a conserved cysteine residue that is proposed to function as a mediator during sulfur transfer. After cysteine desulfurization by NifS/SufS-like proteins, the conserved cysteine of SufE abstracts the sulfur atom from the SufS persulfide and thus becomes an intermediate persulfide (33Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 55: 263-267Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Then, from the latter, sulfur is transferred to an acceptor protein where it serves for synthesis of a sulfur-containing compound such as a Fe-S cluster. Recently a SufE-like protein (At4g26500) was discovered in A. thaliana chloroplasts that can stimulate the cysteine desulfurase activity of CpNifS (36Xu X.M. Möller S.G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Ye H. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Anderson T.D. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. J. Biol.

Arabidopsis SufE1 represents an evolutionary conserved SufE protein that can complement the growth defects in SufE-deficient E. coli (36Xu X.M. Möller S.G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SufE1 was localized to both chloroplasts (36Xu X.M. Möller S.G.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It binds to and forms a heterotetrameric complex with CpNifS, stimulating its cysteine desulfurase activity 40-fold and increasing the substrate affinity of CpNifS toward cysteine (37Ye H.

In vitro reconstitution assays showed that the capacity of CpNifS to assemble 2Fe-2S clusters in ferredoxin was improved 20-fold in the presence of SufE1 (37Ye H. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Anderson T.D. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8958-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteine residue (Cys65) of Arabidopsis SufE1 is essential for this stimulation and is probably the acceptor site for sulfur, in analogy with E. coli SufE (37Ye H. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Anderson T.D. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8958-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The embryo-lethal phenotype of T-DNA disruption lines of Arabidopsis SufE1 demonstrated that it is an essential protein (36Xu X.M. Möller S.G.

Genomic data base searches revealed that next to SufE1, Arabidopsis contains two more genes that encode proteins with SufE-like domains. In this study, we characterize these two proteins, which we named SufE2 and SufE3. SufE2 consists of only a SufE-domain and seems to function in pollen. SufE3 is a two-domain protein consisting of an N-terminal SufE domain linked to a C-terminal domain with homology to bacterial NadA. E. coli NadA is involved in the biosynthesis of NAD, a cofactor in numerous essential redox biological reactions. In all living organisms, NAD derives from quinolinic acid (QA) (38Foster J.W.

In most eukaryotes studied to date, QA is produced via the degradation of tryptophan whereas in E. coli it is synthesized from l-aspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) as the result of the concerted action of two enzymes, l-aspartate oxidase encoded by the nadB gene, and quinolinate synthase (QS), encoded by the NadA gene (40Nasu S. Wicks F.D. Gholson R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 626-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that E. coli NadA is an Fe-S enzyme with a 4Fe-4S cluster absolutely required for activity (42Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Loiseau L. Sanakis Y. Barras F. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3737-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Cicchillo R.M. Tu L. Stromberg J.A. Hoffart L.M. Krebs C. Booker S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 7310-7311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As in E. coli, in Arabidopsis quinolinic acid is synthesized in the l-aspartate pathway (44Katoh A. Uenohara K. Akita M. Hashimoto T. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). During the course of this work, the Arabidopsis quinolinate synthase was shown to be localized to chloroplasts and to complement an E. coli mutant defective in the corresponding NadA gene (44Katoh A. Uenohara K. Akita M. Hashimoto T. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but the activity was not demonstrated in vitro. Here, we show that this protein, which we call SufE3, has both SufE and QS activity, the latter of which depends on a highly oxygen-sensitive 4Fe-4S cluster in the NadA domain. The SufE domain on the same protein can reconstitute this cluster through interaction with CpNifS. Plant Material—-Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.) ecotype Colombia was used for all studies. Plants were grown in soil at 22 °C with a 16 h/8 h light-dark cycle. Plasmid Construction and Expression Analysis—Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. cDNA clones for SufE2 and SufE3 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Ohio State University (clone numbers 33B2 and U09473, respectively). The A. thaliana SufE2 (At1g67810) and SufE3 (At5g50210) coding sequences were amplified by PCR using cDNA clones as a template. For SufE2 expression in E. coli, the mature sequence of SufE2 was amplified using primers SufE2-Bam and SufE2-Nde. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NdeI and then ligated into pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI), for expression as His6-tagged protein. The mature sequence of SufE3 was amplified using primers SufE3-mature-Nco and SufE3-mature-Xba. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and then ligated into pBAD/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen) to produce pSufE3 for expression as Myc-His6-tagged protein. The same construct was used for complementation analysis of the E. coli ΔNadA deletion mutant. To change the single cysteine to serine in the SufE domain of SufE3, recombinant PCR was performed. In the first round, two fragments were amplified with primer set SufE3-R-C132S and T7 and primer set SufE3-F-C132S and T7 terminator, respectively (Table 1). pSufE3 was used as a template. Two products from the first round of PCR were fused together and amplified with primers SufE3mature-Nco and SufE3mature-Xba (Table 1). The resulting PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and then subcloned into the pBAD/Myc-HisB expression vector to produce plasmid pSufE3C132S, also used for complementation analysis of the E. coli ΔNadA deletion mutant. For the expression in E. coli, the SufE domain of SufE3 was amplified using the primers SufE-dom-Bam and SufE-dom-Nde. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NdeI and then ligated into expression vector pET28a. For green fluorescent protein (GFP) localization studies, the full-length protein sequence of SufE2 was amplified with flanking primers SufE2-GFP-Sal and SufE2-GFP-Nco, and SufE3 was amplified using the primers SufE3-GFP-Sal and SufE3-GFP-Nco. The PCR products of SufE2 and SufE3 were digested with SalI and NcoI and then inserted into the GFP reporter plasmid 35Ω-SGFP (S65T) (45Miras S. Salvi D. Ferro M. Grunwald D. Garin J. Joyard J.

Ten microgram of total RNA was separated on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled SufE2 or SufE3 cDNAs as described (23Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The hybridized probe was removed according to (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1998Google Scholar), and the membrane was reprobed with a 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA fragment as a loading control. For RT-PCR, one μg of DNase-treated total RNA from different tissues (roots, leaves, stems, and flowers) was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with an oligo(dT) primer and avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl volume. One μl of this template was used for PCR amplification as follows: sense, SufE2RT, and antisense, SufE2RT-rev, primers were used to amplify a 575-bp sequence from different cDNAs. Actin2-F and Actin2-R primers were used in PCR reactions as an internal control. The PCRs were performed in a final volume of 50 μl, and 10-μl samples were collected at different cycles. The amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. Sequence Analysis and Alignments—Sequence analysis was performed using expert sequence analysis software (DNAS-TAR, Madison, WI). Searches for sequence similarity were performed using the BLAST network service provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Sequence alignment was performed using the MegAlign tool of DNASTAR. Subcellular Localization of GFP Fusion Proteins—For transient expression, the precursor sequences of SufE2 and SufE3 were cloned into the 35Ω-SGFP (S65T) vector (45Miras S. Salvi D. Ferro M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47770-47778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter to generate fusions with a C-terminal GFP. These constructs were expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts as described (47Abdel-Ghany S.E. Muller-Moule P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Expressed proteins were observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope. GFP was excited at 460–500 nm, whereas chlorophyll fluorescence was excited at 510–560 nm. Complementation of E. coli Mutants—Plasmids that contained the mature regions of SufE3 or SufE3C132S in pBAD/Myc-HisB were introduced into E. coli ΔNadA which has a disruption in the NadA gene encoding quinolinate synthase (48Loiseau L.

Plasmid containing strains were maintained on LB medium with kanamycin. Colonies were then grown on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% glycerol, 0.02% arabinose, with or without 12.5 μg/ml nicotinic acid. c-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Immunoblotting was performed using a standard protocol as described by (23Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M.

Characterization of T-DNA Knock-out Lines—T-DNA insertion line (SALK_075260) for SufE3 was provided by the SALK institute (49Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P.

Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) and obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC), Ohio State University. To determine the position of the T-DNA insert, a DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using primers specific for the T-DNA left border and for the flanking SufE3 sequence; the nucleotide sequence of the resulting product was determined. To determine the genotype of plants with respect to the T-DNA insertion (homozygous or heterozygous) SufE3-specific primers that flanked the insertion point were used to identify by PCR the presence of a wild type allele, whereas a SufE3-primer in combination with a T-DNA left border primer was used to identify the mutant allele. Using PCR analysis, only wild type individuals or plants heterozygous for T-DNA insertions in SufE3 were observed in a 1:2 ratio in the offspring of heterozygous plants. Growth analysis on kanamycin plates indicated that kanamycin resistance also segregated in a 1:2 ratio. Furthermore, PCR analysis showed that all kanamycin resistant plants had a T-DNA insertion in SufE3. These data indicate the presence of a single T-DNA insertion in this knock-out line. Protein Purification—For purification of the SufE domains of SufE2 and SufE3, respectively, plasmid pET28a containing either the sequence for the SufE domain of SufE2 or of SufE3 fused to an N-terminal His-tag were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Two liters of LB medium containing 50 μgml–1 kanamycin was inoculated with 1/100 volume of overnight culture. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5 and"

Studies of these GAPs and guanine nucleotide exchange factors have provided important insights into our understanding of GTPase signaling and biology. Within the Ras superfamily, the Arf family is composed of 30 members in mammals, including 22 Arf-like (Arl) proteins. Much less is known about the mechanisms of cell regulation by Arls than by Arfs. We report the purification from bovine testis of an Arl2 GAP and its identity as ELMOD2, a protein with no previously described function. ELMOD2 is one of six human proteins that contain an ELMO domain, and a second member, ELMOD1, was also found to have Arl2 GAP activity. Surprisingly, ELMOD2 also exhibited GAP activity against Arf proteins even though it does not contain the canonical Arf GAP sequence signature. The broader specificity of ELMOD2, as well as the previously described role for ELMO1 and ELMO2 in linking Arf6 and Rac1 signaling, suggests that ELMO family members may play a more general role in integrating signaling pathways controlled by Arls and other GTPases.

The Ras superfamily of regulatory GTPases is composed of over 150 members divided into at least five families (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ran, and Arf (1Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar)). Although the biological function of each family is distinct, all members exhibit many structural and biochemical similarities. They share conserved sequences involved in guanine nucleotide binding, have low intrinsic levels of GTP hydrolysis, and cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states as critical components of their biological functions. It is the ability of these two states to interact with different sets of proteins that enable these small GTPases to act as “molecular switches.” Because of the low intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis, the transition from the GTP-bound to GDP-bound form of the GTPase requires an accessory GTPase-activating protein (GAP). 2The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Arl, Arf-like; MBP, maltose-binding protein; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; CMC, critical micelle concentration; PH, pleckstrin homology. GAPs were initially thought to simply inactivate their cognate GTPase, but more recent research suggests that GAPs can also serve as effectors of the signaling pathways regulated by the GTPase (e.g. ArfGAP1 and ARAP2 (2Yang J.S. Zhang L. Lee S.Y. Gad H. Luini A. Hsu V.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Yoon H.Y. Miura K. Cuthbert E.J. Davis K.K. Ahvazi B. Casanova J.E. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4650-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). The first GAPs were purified based on their biochemical activities, but sequence and mutational analyses led to the identification of GAP domains, which have proven highly predictive for identifying novel GAPs within a GTPase family. More than 170 putative GAPs have been identified and are grouped according to which GTPase they act upon and which GAP domain they possess (4Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 3014-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Typically a protein with a given GAP domain will be active against members of one family of GTPases, or a subset within that family, but not against other families. For example, a protein with an Arf GAP domain will be active against one or more (but not necessarily all) Arfs but not against Rabs, Rhos, or Ras. Exceptions to these general rules exist (6Liu K. Li G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10087-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Tomoda T. Kim J.H. Zhan C. Hatten M.E.

Determining the specificity of a GAP for different GTPases is further complicated by factors that can influence the results of in vitro GAP assays, including the assay used to measure GTP hydrolysis, the need for hydrophobic surfaces on which protein interactions occur, the degree of membrane curvature (e.g. in the case of ArfGAP1 (9Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Bigay J. Gounon P. Robineau S. Antonny B.

Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2193-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). The importance of specificity is illustrated by the Arf family, which in mammals consists of 6 Arfs, 22 Arf-like (Arl), and 2 Sar proteins (14Kahn R.A. Cherfils J. Elias M. Lovering R.C. Munro S. Schurmann A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The Arf family is best known for the role of Arfs and Arl1 as regulators of adaptor recruitment and phospholipid metabolism, predominantly at the Golgi, although members of the Arf family are probably active at every membrane in eukaryotes (15D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The remaining Arls exhibit a far greater diversity of functions than do the Arfs as they have been implicated as regulators of microtubule-dependent processes (Arl2 and Arl3 (16Bhamidipati A.

With increasing interest in these proteins, it becomes more important to identify regulators and effectors that can provide insights into the biological function of each of the Arls and to determine the extent of overlap in their actions and protein partners. The prediction of >20 Arf GAPs in the human proteome (4Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar) is based upon the presence of the Arf GAP domain, a cysteine-rich zinc finger with specific spacing (CX2CX16–18CX2C, where X is any amino acid (12Brown M.T.

The specificities of these proteins have not yet been completely determined, but to date none have demonstrated activity against Arls. One of the four Arf GAPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (34Liu Y.W. Huang C.F. Huang K.B. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4024-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a partially purified preparation of rat spleen cytosol (35Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown activity against both Arfs and Arl1, but this is not surprising given their close sequence and functional relatedness. GAPs are often expressed only to low levels, and their assay in cell or tissue lysates can be compromised by a number of factors. We took advantage of the observation that Arl2 is partially localized to mitochondria to develop an Arl2 GAP assay using an enriched mitochondria preparation as the source of the activity (36Bowzard J.B. Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 453-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Later modifications to the assay allowed us to purify the activity from bovine testis. The purified Arl2 GAP contained a domain found in other human proteins, the ELMO domain, that we propose functions as an Arl GAP domain. The purification of this Arl2 GAP and issues surrounding the assay of GAP proteins in general are discussed. The observation that this GAP also acted on Arfs provides an opportunity for cross-talk between Arfs and Arls. All chemicals used were purchased from commercial sources. Sol-Grade CHAPS was purchased from Anatrace, Inc. (Maumee, OH). Mouse anti-Myc (9E10; Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in immunoblots. Bovine testicles (trimmed) were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR), and the tunica albuginea was removed before use. The coding sequences of human ELMOD1 and ELMOD2 were amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) using custom synthetic oligonucleotide primers and cloned into a pET28-based vector also containing the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) open reading frame (provided by Xing Zhang and Xiaodong Cheng, Emory University) and pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen). The coding sequence of ELMOD3 was amplified from a plasmid purchased from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD) and subcloned as above. Purified recombinant human Arl2, Arl3, Arf1, and Arf6 were each prepared as described previously (36Bowzard J.B. Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A.

Cultures were grown at 37 °C until the A600 = 0.2 at which point they were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After an additional 15 h of growth at room temperature, the cells were harvested and lysed by multiple passes through a French press. Purification was carried out with a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified recombinant preparations of RhoA and Rac1 (G. Bokoch, Scripps Research Institute) and Ran (I. Macara, University of Virginia) were generously provided by colleagues. Charcoal GAP Assay—Our standard GAP assay was performed by pre-loading recombinant human Arl2 with [γ-32P]GTP in a reaction that contained ∼2 μm Arl2 in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and ∼0.3 μCi/μl [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min at 30 °C. Under these conditions, typically ∼50% of the radionucleotide will be bound to Arl2 by the end of the preincubation. The amount of bound [γ-32P]GTP was determined by filtration of an aliquot of the pre-loaded Arl2 onto a nitrocellulose filter and scintillation counting, as described below. During this incubation, 25 μl of the GAP sample to be assayed was mixed with 20 μl of reaction buffer (62.5 mm HEPES, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm GTP, and 12.5 mm ATP) on ice. The reaction was started by adding 5 μl of the pre-loaded Arl2 to the 45-μl GAP/buffer combination, mixing, and placing at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped 4 min later by the addition of 750 μl of a suspension of ice-cold activated charcoal (5% in 50 mm NaH2PO4). The charcoal was pelleted, and the amount of released 32Pi in 400 μl of the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. A mock load reaction, which was identical to the pre-loading step but did not contain Arl2, was also performed and run in parallel for each sample to be assayed. This control measures the amount of GTP hydrolysis that occurs during the assay that is independent of Arl2-GTP. The control results were then subtracted from those obtained with Arl2-GTP in the reaction to obtain the Arl2-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Because Arl2 cannot hydrolyze GTP to a measurable extent by itself, this value is equal to the Arl2 GAP activity. Filter Trapping GAP Assay—Each GTPase was pre-loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in a reaction that is 1 μm GTPase in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP, and ∼0.3 μCi/μl[γ-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 6000 Ci/mmol) for 15 min at 30 °C. The pre-load reaction was then brought to a final concentration of ∼20 mm MgCl2 and placed on ice. The GAP sample (15 μl) to be assayed was mixed with reaction buffer (25 μl; 62.5 mm HEPES, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm GTP, and 12.5 mm ATP) on ice. A control reaction (–GAP) was run in parallel to determine the amount of [γ-32P]GTP or 32Pi released from the GTPase independent of the GAP. The reactions were started by adding 10 μl of the pre-loaded GTPase to the 40-μl GAP/buffer combination, mixing, and placing at 30 °C. At each time point, 10 μl was removed from the reaction to 2 ml of ice-cold HNMD (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and immediately filtered over a 0.45-μm Protran BA85 filter (Whatman), which was then washed four times with 2-ml aliquots of HNMD. The amount of GTPase-[γ-32P]GTP still bound to the filters was determined by scintillation counting. The amount of GAP activity is the difference between the counts lost from the GTPase in the presence of the GAP sample minus the control (-GAP) sample. Arl2 GAP activities were determined using the charcoal GAP assay, performed in parallel with controls, as described above. To best quantify this assay we made an assumption, based upon prior ligand-binding data, that when Arl2 is exposed to high concentrations of GTP it binds very rapidly to a stoichiometry of ∼20% (determined for each preparation of Arl2 but quite consistent). Thus, during the preincubation phase the Arl2 bound about 50% of the [γ-32P]GTP available to it. When the vast excess of unlabeled GTP is added at the start of the GAP assay, the free GTP-binding sites on the remaining Arl2 molecules quickly became occupied with cold GTP. Thus, we used in our calculations the 20% value to estimate the concentration of Arl2-GTP at the start of the assay, typically 1.8 pmol per assay point (2.5 nm). The GAP-dependent 32Pi counts, released during the 4-min incubation, were divided by the total counts available in each assay, determined by filter trapping at the end of the preincubation phase. This ratio represents the percentage of total Arl2-GTP present in the GAP reaction that was converted into Arl2-GDP during the assay. This was then multiplied by the [Arl2-GTP] to get the amount converted in the 4-min assay. Specific activity was reported in units/mg protein in the assay where 1 unit is the amount of activity required to convert 1 nmol of Arl2-GTP to Arl2-GDP/min. To calculate the specific activity of a GAP using the filter trapping assay, we again determined the GAP-dependent loss of 32Pi trapped on the filter during the assay, as described above. This number was divided by the total bound radionucleotide available at t = 0 to get the percentage hydrolyzed. Because the GTPases other than Arl2 do not bind significant amounts of unlabeled GTP during the GAP assay, because of the presence of high [Mg2+], the amount of GTPase-GTP present in the reaction was determined directly from the specific activity of the radioligand. Note that because of the differences in the ways these two assays are performed, we estimate that the concentration of Arl2-GTP was about 10-fold higher than the GTP-bound form of the other GTPases. Numerous preparations of Arl2 GAP activity were performed, with a number of variations, and a typical example (the one that was used for mass spectroscopy analysis) is described here. 137 g (wet weight) of bovine testis was homogenized on ice in 500 ml of SH Buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 320 mm sucrose) with a PT2000 Polytron with a 20-mm TSM probe (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) three times on setting 1 for 1 min each with a 1-min pause in between. The homogenate was transferred to a 1-liter centrifuge bottle and spun 1,000 × g for 45 min. The S1 supernatant was transferred by pipetting into 250-ml centrifuge bottles and spun 10,000 × g for 30 min. The S10 was then removed and layered in 26-ml aliquots onto 13 ml of sucrose (in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl) gradients. These gradients consisted of 8 ml of 20% sucrose layered on top of 5 ml of 60% sucrose. The gradients were spun 100,000 × g in an SW28 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) rotor for 120 min. The interface between the 20 and 60% sucrose layers (“20/60”) was recovered by pipetting and gently vortexed to mix. CHAPS (1.25 ml of 10% in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and Buffer A (148.75 ml; 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPS) were added to 50 ml of 20/60 to bring the final protein concentration to ∼2 mg/ml and the final detergent concentration to 0.25%. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the diluted 20/60 was spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was recovered by pipette and loaded onto a 140-ml (2.6 × 30 cm) Macro-Prep High Q column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 140 ml of Buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–40% Buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPS) over 400 ml. Arl2 GAP activity was assayed using the charcoal assay and found to elute between 75 and 250 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated using an Amicon Ultra (Millipore, Billerica, MA) 15-ml 30,000-Da nominal molecular weight limit centrifugal concentrator, and applied to a 120-ml (1.6 × 60 cm) HiLoad Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column, which was developed with Buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.25% CHAPS). The peak fractions from the gel filtration column, corresponding to a predicted molecular mass range of 150–300 kDa, were loaded onto a 15-ml (1.6 × 20 cm) Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite type I column (20 μm; Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer D (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm KH2PO4, 0.25% CHAPS) and then 10 ml of 10% Buffer E (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 200 mm K2HPO4, 200 mm KH2PO4, 0.25% CHAPS) before being developed with a 60 ml of 10–70% gradient of Buffer E. Fractions containing activity were pooled, concentrated, and further resolved on the 120-ml Superdex 200 column as above. Peak fractions from the gel filtration column were pooled and brought to a final concentration of ∼1% CHAPS by adding an amount of 10% CHAPS equal to one-ninth of the initial volume of the pooled fractions. After 30 min on ice, this sample was applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). The flow-through was collected and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 4-ml 10,000-Da nominal molecular weight limit centrifugal concentrator to a final volume of ∼0.5 ml. This was then applied to a 24-ml (1.0 × 30 cm) Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Fractions (0.35 ml) from this final column were collected and assayed. Proteins in fraction 27 from the final gel filtration column (Superdex 200) were resolved on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band of interest was excised and trypsinized in the gel slice. The resulting peptides were analyzed by nanoscale reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described previously (39Liao L. Cheng D. Wang J. Duong D.M. Losik T.G. Gearing M. Rees H.D. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. Peng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37061-37068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, the digested sample was dissolved in 0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, 5% acetonitrile, ∼95% water and loaded onto a 75-μm × 12-cm self-packed fused-silica C18 capillary column. The peptides were eluted during a 30-min gradient from 10 to 30% elution buffer (0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, 95% acetonitrile, and ∼5% water) at a flow rate of ∼0.3 μl/min. Eluted peptides were ionized under high voltage (1.8 kV), detected in a survey scan from 400 to 1600 atomic mass units (2 microscans) followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans (4 microscans each, isolation width 3 atomic mass units, 35% normalized collision energy, dynamic range 1 min) in a completely automated fashion on an LCQ-DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against combined reference data bases (mouse, rat, and human) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, leading to the identification of four peptides that are each present in human and bovine ELMOD2. The peptide matches were further validated by manually examining the spectra. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously (19Sharer J.D. Shern J.F. Van Valkenburgh H. Wallace D.C. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A Northern blot containing human poly(A)+ RNA from brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, placenta, small intestine, spleen, stomach, and testis (HB2010, OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) was probed with a random hexamer primed 32P-labeled fragment containing the entire ELMOD2 coding sequence. Hybridization was performed with ULTRAhyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) and followed standard procedures, with the highest stringency washing performed at 50 °C in 0.1% SDS 0.1× SSC. Development of a Specific Arl2 GAP Assay—For most GTPases, the dissociation of bound GTP or GDP can be slowed substantially by raising the free Mg2+ concentration (40Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, after preloading the GTPase with radiolabeled GTP under optimal conditions, the addition of increased free Mg2+“locks in” the bound GTP to maximize stability of the substrate in the GAP assay. The GAP reaction is stopped by dilution into cold buffer before trapping the remaining protein-bound [γ-32P]GTP on nitrocellulose filters. Controls run in parallel allow discrimination between intrinsic GTPase activity, GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, and simple GTP dissociation in the assay. This protocol was used to assess the specificity of our purified Arl2 GAP against other GTPases (see below) but cannot be used with Arl2 because the rate of dissociation of guanine nucleotides from Arl2 is insensitive to [Mg2+] (43Clark J. Moore L. Krasinskas A. Way J. Battey J. Tamkun J. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Instead, we developed an Arl2 GAP assay that was based upon those used earlier to assay GTPase activity of the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (44Brandt D.R. Asano T. Pedersen S.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4357-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and that uses the ability of activated charcoal to bind nucleotides but not free phosphate. Arl2 was pre-bound to [γ-32P]GTP and exposed to the GAP for a very limited time (typically 4 min), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of a suspension of activated charcoal. GAP-dependent GTP hydrolysis is the amount of liberated 32Pi over and above that released in the absence of the GAP or in the absence of the Arl2. Because, like Arfs, Arl2 has no intrinsic GTPase activity (43Clark J. Moore L. Krasinskas A. Way J. Battey J. Tamkun J. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the Arl2-dependent GTP hydrolysis is also a measure of the Arl2 GAP activity. It is important to clearly differentiate between GTP hydrolysis occurring as a result of GAP activity from hydrolysis resulting from contaminating nucleotidases present in every protein preparation. Thus, each assay contained two sets of parallel, control incubations as follows: one in which no GAP was added (to determine nonspecific GTPase activity of the Arl2 preparation), and one for each GAP sample in which the Arl2 was absent (to determine the nonspecific GTPase activity of e"

https://openalex.org/W1990453734,"The nel-like1 (NELL1) gene maps to chromosome 11p15, which frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). NELL1 promoter hypermethylation was examined by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 259 human esophageal tissues. Hypermethylation of this promoter showed highly discriminative receiver–operator characteristic curve profiles, clearly distinguishing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and EAC from normal esophagus (NE) (P<0.001). NELL1 normalized methylation values were significantly higher in Barrett's metaplasia (BE), dysplastic Barrett's (D) and EAC than in NE (P<0.0000001). NELL1 hypermethylation frequency was zero in NE but increased early during neoplastic progression, to 41.7% in BE from patients with Barrett's alone, 52.5% in D and 47.8% in EAC. There was a significant correlation between NELL1 hypermethylation and BE segment length. Three (11.5%) of 26 ESCCs exhibited NELL1 hypermethylation. Survival correlated inversely with NELL1 hypermethylation in patients with stages I–II (P=0.0264) but not in stages III–IV (P=0.68) EAC. Treatment of KYSE220 ESCC and BIC EAC cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine reduced NELL1 methylation and increased NELL1 mRNA expression. NELL1 mRNA levels in EACs with an unmethylated NELL1 promoter were significantly higher than those in EACs with a methylated promoter (P=0.02). Promoter hypermethylation of NELL1 is a common, tissue-specific event in human EAC, occurs early during Barrett's-associated esophageal neoplastic progression, and is a potential biomarker of poor prognosis in early-stage EAC."
https://openalex.org/W2107790283,"In recent years it has become apparent that removal of apoptotic cells (AC) by professional phagocytes alters the macrophage phenotype. This change is characterized by attenuated proinflammatory cytokine expression and NO production, which mechanistically remained unexplained. With the intention to explore molecular mechanisms underlying reduced NO formation, we showed that NO production in IFNgamma-stimulated murine RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to AC but not to either necrotic or viable human Jurkat cells was significantly reduced although iNOS expression remained high compared with controls. Analyzing iNOS activity in the cell extracts by using the radioactive L-arginine/citrulline conversion assay revealed increased ornithine production over citrulline in cells exposed to AC. RT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase reporter analysis supported the idea of an arginase II increase in response to AC. The involvement of arginase in modulating NO formation in response to AC was substantiated by the arginase inhibitor N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine. Moreover, knockdown of arginase II by siRNA allowed recovery of NO production. Experiments with AC-conditioned medium demonstrated that a soluble lipid factor, rather than phagocytosis of AC, modulated NO production in macrophages. We conclude that AC release a lipid factor to modulate NO formation in macrophages via arginase II up-regulation, thereby contributing to innate immune regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2061946629,"The primary intracellular mediators of TGF-beta signaling are the Smad proteins. Phosphorylation of R-Smad at the C-terminal SSXS motif by the activated TGF-beta type I receptor kinase triggers a conformation change in R-Smad and facilitates complex formation between R-Smad and Smad4, which shuttle into the nucleus where they interact with DNA and other transcription factors to regulate gene expression. In an attempt to identify proteins interacting with activated Smad signaling complex, we discovered that Mps1, a protein kinase that plays important roles in normal mitotic progression and mitotic checkpoint signaling, co-purifies with this complex. We demonstrated that Smad2 and Smad3 but not Smad4 are substrates of Mps1 in vitro and in vivo. Mps1 phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 at the SSXS motif in their C-terminal regions in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of microtubule networks by nocodazole activates Mps1 and promotes TGF-beta-independent activation of Smad signaling. We found that Mps1 is involved in turning on Smad signaling by phosphorylating R-Smads. Our results reveal a novel functional link between Mps1 and Smads in a non-canonical Smad signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2095158626,"The nuclear LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4) is upregulated in breast cancer, especially estrogen receptor-negative tumors, and its overexpression in mice leads to hyperplasia and tumor formation. Here, we show that deletion of LMO4 in the mammary glands of mice leads to impaired lobuloalveolar development due to decreased epithelial cell proliferation. With the goal of discovering potential LMO4-target genes, we also developed a conditional expression system in MCF-7 cells for both LMO4 and a dominant negative (DN) form of its co-regulator, cofactor of LIM domains (Clim/Ldb/Nli). We then used DNA microarrays to identify genes responsive to LMO4 and DN-Clim upregulation. One of the genes common to both data sets was bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7), whose expression is also significantly correlated with LMO4 transcript levels in a large dataset of human breast cancers, suggesting that BMP7 is a bona fide target gene of LMO4 in breast cancer. Inhibition of BMP7 partially blocks the effects of LMO4 on apoptosis, indicating that BMP7 mediates at least some functions of LMO4. Gene transfer studies show that LMO4 regulates the BMP7 promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that LMO4 and its cofactor Clim2 are recruited to the BMP7 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HDAC2 recruitment to the BMP7 promoter is inhibited by upregulation of LMO4 and that HDAC2 knockdown upregulates the promoter. These studies suggest a novel mechanism of action for LMO4: LMO4, Clim2 and HDAC2 are part of a transcriptional complex, and increased LMO4 levels can disrupt the complex, leading to decreased HDAC2 recruitment and increased promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997878337,"The bacterial nutritional and stress alarmone ppGpp and its co-factor DksA directly bind RNA polymerase to regulate its activity at certain σ70-dependent promoters. A number of promoters that are dependent on alternative σ-factors function poorly in the absence of ppGpp. These include the Pseudomonas-derived σ54-dependent Po promoter and several other σ54-promoters, the transcription from which is essentially abolished in Escherichia coli devoid of ppGpp and DksA. However, ppGpp and DksA have no apparent effect on reconstituted in vitro σ54-transcription, which suggests an indirect mechanism of control. Here we report analysis of five hyper-suppressor mutants within the β- and β′-subunits of core RNA polymerase that allow high levels of transcription from the σ54-Po promoter in the absence of ppGpp. Using in vitro transcription and competition assays, we present evidence that these core RNA polymerase mutants are defective in one or both of two properties that could combine to explain their hyper-suppressor phenotypes: (i) modulation of competitive association with σ-factors to favor σ54-holoenzyme formation over that with σ70, and (ii) reduced innate stability of RNA polymerase-promoter complexes, which mimics the essential effects of ppGpp and DksA for negative regulation of stringent σ70-promoters. Both these properties of the mutant holoenzymes support a recently proposed mechanism for regulation of σ54-transcription that depends on the potent negative effects of ppGpp and DksA on transcription from powerful stringent σ70-promoters, and suggests that stringent regulation is a key mechanism by which the activity of alternative σ-factors is controlled to meet cellular requirements.

The σ-subunit of bacterial holoenzyme RNA polymerases programs the multisubunit catalytic core enzyme (α2, β, β′, ω) to recognize and specifically initiate transcription from promoter sequences. Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase has to accommodate seven different σ-factors. Six of these have sequence and functional similarity and belong to the σ70-family of proteins, while a seventh, σ54, is unrelated and targets RNA polymerase to the highly conserved and unusual –24, –12 class of promoters (consensus TGGCAC-N5-TTGCa/t (1Barrios H. Valderrama B. Morett E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). Initiation of transcription involves multiple steps from initial closed complex formation at the promoter, through DNA melting to form the open complex, before reaching the final stage of promoter escape (reviewed in Ref. 2Records Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. I. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). The σ54-factor imposes kinetic constraints on transcriptional initiation by σ54-holoenzyme. Unlike σ70-holoenzyme, σ54-holoenzyme cannot undergo transition from the closed complex without the aid of a mechano-transcriptional activator that makes use of nucleotide hydrolysis to remodel the closed complex, thus allowing DNA melting (reviewed in Ref. 3Zhang X.

Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For σ54, this was demonstrated by the dramatic enhancement of transcription from the σ54-Po promoter upon manipulation of the relative levels of household σ70, σ54, and the stationary and stress σS-factor (5Laurie A.D.

Recent determination of the absolute levels of core RNA polymerase and σ-factors suggests that competition between σ-factors is likely to be even more extensive than previously anticipated (6Grigorova I.L. Phleger N.J. Mutalik V.K. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5332-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Changes in the composition of the different holoenzymes in the cell underlie many important bacterial adaptive processes undertaken to use available resources economically and to counteract stress conditions. In addition to alternative σ-factors having different affinities for core RNA polymerase, the levels of many are modulated in response to specific signals, growth conditions, and/or growth phases to allow conditional selective expression of different subsets of promoters. Growth phase and growth conditions also have a major effect on the efficiency of σ54-dependent transcription (7Sze C.C. Moore T. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Carmona M. Rodriguez M.J. Martinez-Costa O. De Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4711-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, as is the case for the household σ70, σ54 levels are more or less constant over the growth curve and under different growth conditions, and are maintained at 16–20% of the level of σ70 (10Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Hence, preferential expression of σ54-promoters in early stationary phase and under starvation/stress conditions cannot be explained by elevated σ54 levels.In its native Pseudomonas host, the σ54-Po promoter controls transcription of an operon required for mineralization of (methyl)phenols. Transcription from Po is strictly dependent on its cognate activator DmpR, which requires an aromatic effector as well as ATP for its activity (reviewed in Ref. 11Shingler V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1226-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In both E. coli and Pseudomonas putida, transcription from the Po promoter in rich media is growth-phase-regulated. The swift increase in transcription at the transition from exponential to stationary phase is dependent on the bacterial alarmone ppGpp 3The abbreviations used are: ppGpp, guanosine bispyrophosphate; Cb, carbenicillin; Cm, chloramphenicol; Km, kanamycin; Tc, tetracycline; AA, amino acid; T.

Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The unusual nucleotide ppGpp is produced in response to a variety of nutritional and physicochemical stresses (through the RelA and SpoT synthetases I and II), and is the mediator of the stringent response that encompasses down-regulation of transcription from stringent σ70-promoters, such as those for rRNA operons and tRNA genes, to balance translational capacity to reduced demand (reviewed in Ref. 14Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. I. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Sensitivity of RNA polymerase to ppGpp requires the non-DNA-binding protein DksA, which together with ppGpp directly mediates negative and positive effects on the performance of RNA polymerase at certain σ70-promoters (15Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Paul B.J. Berkmen M.B. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). During rapid growth, transcription from the powerful stringent σ70-rRNA promoters occupies ∼60–70% of the transcriptional machinery (17Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar). Thus, ppGpp/DksA mediated down-regulation of these powerful stringent σ70-promoters is likely to have global regulatory consequences through an increased pool of core RNA polymerase available for holoenzyme formation.Down-regulation of transcription from stringent σ70-promoters by ppGpp and DksA involves destabilization of their intrinsically very short-lived competitor-resistant open promoter complexes, which are rate-limiting for transcription (15Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Support for this mechanism comes from RNA polymerase suppressor mutants that likewise destabilize competitor-resistant complexes, and from promoter mutants with increased stability that become unresponsive to ppGpp (18Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 125: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). At positively regulated σ70-promoters, such as those involved in the biosynthesis and transport of some amino acids, dissociation of the open promoter complex is not rate-limiting. In these cases, ppGpp and DksA have been proposed to directly enhance transcription by decreasing the energy of a transition state intermediate(s) to accelerate the rate-limiting formation of open complexes, and to indirectly enhance this process by the reduced use of σ70-holoenzyme at the stringent σ70-promoters (16Paul B.J. Berkmen M.B. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).Simultaneous lack of both ppGpp and DksA essentially abolishes detectable σ54-dependent transcription in E. coli without having any discernable direct effect on reconstituted in vitro σ54-transcription, either in the presence or the absence of competing σ70 (13Bernardo L.M. Johansson L.U. Solera D. Skarfstad E. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous analysis has identified mutations within the rpoBC genes encoding the β- and β′-subunits of core RNA polymerase and within rpoD encoding σ70, that all allow transcription from the σ54-Po promoter in E. coli in the absence of ppGpp (5Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M. Sze C.C. Skarfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nystrom T. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1494-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study we identified and analyzed the performance of five hyper-suppressor mutants within core RNA polymerase on σ54- and σ70-dependent transcription in vitro to gain further insight into the global regulatory role of ppGpp and DksA for σ54-dependent transcription. The in vitro properties of these mutant polymerases expand the known mechanism(s) of bypass mutants to include effects on both σ-factor competition for core RNA polymerase and on the ppGpp/DksA-sensitive step of transcription from stringent promoters. These results strongly support a model in which stringent regulation of σ70-promoters is a key mechanism by which the activity of σ54 and other alternative σ-factors is amplified to combat conditions of nutritional deficit and other stresses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—Parental strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. Cultures were routinely grown at 30 °C in Luria broth (LB) (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (carbenicillin, 100 μg/ml, tetracycline 15 μg/ml). Resistance to rifampicin was assessed on LB plates containing either 20 or 100 μg/ml rifampicin. Prototrophy was assessed over 3 days of growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 100 μg/ml thiamine, and graded from no growth (–) to full prototrophy (+++) exhibited by ppGpp-proficient MG1655Δlac. The rpoBC alleles were transferred to defined genetic background using bacteriophage P1-mediated transduction employing the closely linked thiC39::Tn10 (TcR) marker. DNA sequencing was used to confirm co-transduction, and the entire DNA sequence of the rpoBC region of five strains was determined as previously described (5Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M. Sze C.C.

The σ70-λPL in vitro transcription plasmid pVI901 was constructed by PCR amplification of the –68 to +2 region as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment, and cloning between these sites of pTE103. The fidelity of the DNA sequence of the resulting plasmid was confirmed by sequencing.TABLE 1Parental bacterial strains and plasmidsRelevant propertiesRefs./SourceStrain MG1655K12, prototroph(42Xiao H.

N-terminally His-tagged E. coli DksA was a kind gift from A. Åberg (Umeå University, Sweden). Wild-type and mutant core RNA polymerases were purified according to a general protocol described in Burgess and Jendrisak (28Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), with modifications as in Ref. 29Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R.

Briefly, core RNA polymerase was preincubated with the appropriate σ factor for 5 min to allow holoenzyme formation. Open complex formation (20 min) was initiated by the addition of supercoiled plasmid template. For σ54-Po transcription, IHF (10 nm), DmpR-His (50 nm), ATP (4 mm), and the aromatic effector 2-methylphenol (0.5 mm) were also included. Transcription was initiated by addition of NTPs (ATP, CTP, GTP to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, UTP at 0.06 mm, and 5μCi [α-32P]UTP). In assays that involved comparison with the σ70-rrnB P1 promoter, the CTP and GTP concentrations were reduced to 0.16 mm to ensure correct initiation from this promoter (15Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Multiple round transcriptions were incubated for 5 min prior to addition of heparin (final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml) to prevent reinitiation. After incubation for a further 5 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop/load buffer (150 mm EDTA, 1.05 m NaCl, 7 m urea, 10% glycerol, 0.0375% xylene cyanol, and 0.0375% bromphenol blue). For single round transcription assays, heparin was added simultaneously with NTPs, and reactions were incubated for 10 min. Transcripts were analyzed on 4.5 or 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and quantified by phosphorimaging.σ-Factor Competition Assays—In vitro competition assays between different σ-subunits for wild-type or mutant core RNA polymerases were performed by preincubating σ70 with the core enzyme for 5 min prior to addition of different concentrations of σ54. After a further incubation for 10 min, multiple round transcriptions were performed as described above.RNA Polymerase-Promoter Complex Stability Assays—The stabilities of competitor-resistant complexes on specific promoters were assessed by preforming open complexes as described for the transcription assays above, after which complexes were challenged either with heparin (final concentration 0.1 mg/ml) or a 200-fold molar excess of double-stranded DNA. Single round transcription assays were used to measure the functional open complexes at the indicated times. For all promoters analyzed, challenges with double-stranded DNA gave longer half-lives than heparin challenges. To bring the half-lives into experimentally tractable time frames, a 60-bp double-stranded DNA fragment containing the full con promoter (30Gaal T. Ross W. Estrem S.T. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R.

Heparin was used as the competitor for the very stable σ70-λPL promoter-RNA polymerase complex.RESULTSRpoBC Mutants Suppress the Need for ppGpp for Efficient Transcription from the σ54-Po Promoter—Mutations in rpoB and rpoC capable of restoring transcription from Po in a ppGpp0 strain were previously isolated on rich media using a genetic system in which Po was placed in control of a promoterless tetracycline resistance gene (5Laurie A.D.

Among 41 of these strains, 31 different rpoB and rpoC alleles were identified (Table 2).

https://openalex.org/W1977795617,"A region between residues 414 and 466 in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) harbors more than half of the known NH2-terminal mutations associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. To gain insight into the structural basis of this NH2-terminal mutation hot spot, we have determined its location in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2. Green fluorescent protein (GFP), used as a structural marker, was inserted into the middle of this mutation hot spot after Ser-437 in the RyR2 sequence. The resultant GFP-RyR2 fusion protein, RyR2S437-GFP, was expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized using Ca2+ release, [3H]ryanodine binding, and single cell Ca2+ imaging studies. These functional analyses revealed that RyR2S437-GFP forms a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel that possesses Ca2+ and caffeine dependence of activation indistinguishable from that of wild type (wt) RyR2. HEK293 cells expressing RyR2S437-GFP displayed a propensity for store overload-induced Ca2+ release similar to that in cells expressing RyR2-wt. The three-dimensional structure of the purified RyR2S437-GFP was reconstructed using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle image processing. Subtraction of the three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR2-wt and RyR2S437-GFP revealed the location of the inserted GFP, and hence the NH2-terminal mutation hot spot, in a region between domains 5 and 9 in the clamp-shaped structure. This location is close to a previously mapped central disease-causing mutation site located in a region between domains 5 and 6. These results, together with findings from previous studies, suggest that the proposed interactions between the NH2-terminal and central regions of RyR2 are likely to take place between domains 5 and 6 and that the clamp-shaped structure, which shows substantial conformational differences between the closed and open states, is highly susceptible to disease-causing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2040437764,"Acute rheumatic fever is a serious autoimmune sequela of pharyngitis caused by certain group A streptococci. One mechanism applied by streptococcal strains capable of causing acute rheumatic fever is formation of an autoantigenic complex with human collagen IV. In some geographic regions with a high incidence of acute rheumatic fever pharyngeal carriage of group C and group G streptococci prevails. Examination of such strains revealed the presence of M-like surface proteins that bind human collagen. Using a peptide array and recombinant proteins with targeted amino acid substitutions, we could demonstrate that formation of collagen complexes during streptococcal infections depends on an octapeptide motif, which is present in collagen binding M and M-like proteins of different β-hemolytic streptococcal species. Mice immunized with streptococcal proteins that contain the collagen binding octapeptide motif developed high serum titers of anti-collagen antibodies. In sera of rheumatic fever patients such a collagen autoimmune response was accompanied by specific reactivity against the collagen-binding proteins, linking the observed effect to clinical cases. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the identified octapeptide motif through its action on collagen plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever. Eradication of streptococci that express proteins with the collagen binding motif appears advisable for controlling rheumatic fever.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). ARF and the subsequent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remain significant causes of cardiovascular disease today (2World Health Organization Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease: Report of a WHO Expert Consultation, WHO Technical Report Series 923.

According to a recent estimate more than 15 million people have RHD, more than 0.5 million acquire ARF each year, and about 0.25 million deaths annually are directly attributable to ARF or RHD (2World Health Organization Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease: Report of a WHO Expert Consultation, WHO Technical Report Series 923. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). The fact that penicillin has clearly failed to eradicate ARF and that streptococcal vaccines are still years away from being available underlines the need for novel control strategies (5Kaplan E.L.

Identification of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ARF is a prerequisite for the development of the necessary diagnostic and preventive approaches. Major virulence factors of streptococci that infect humans are the M and M-like proteins. They exert anti-phagocytic effects (7Bisno A.L. Brito M.O. Collins C.M. Lancet Infect.

Rheumatogenicity of Streptococcus pyogenes strains, which are also referred to as group A streptococci (GAS), was found to correlate with certain M serotypes in different parts of the world (12Potter E.V.

Different autoimmune mechanisms have been proposed for pathogenesis of ARF (3Carapetis J.R. McDonald M. Wilson N.J.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 5448-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One recent hypothesis is that human collagen IV, a major component of subendothelial basement membranes (18Afek A. Shoenfeld Y. Manor R. Goldberg I. Ziporen L. George J. Polak-Charcon S. Amigo M.C. Garcia-Torres R. Segal R. Kopolovic J. Lupus. 1999; 8: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Yurchenco P.D. Schittny J.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1577-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), acts as such an autoantigen after forming a complex with S. pyogenes strains, which have a potential of causing ARF (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Investigations on S. pyogenes strains of the rheumatogenic M serotypes M3 and M18 identified both M3 protein of the M3 strain and the hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule of the M18 strain as streptococcal surface components that interact with collagen. Immunization of mice with M3 protein led to the generation of collagen IV autoantibodies, which were also found in sera of patients with ARF or RHD. Direct binding of collagen to streptococcal surface components is, therefore, considered as one of the key mechanisms for induction of ARF (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In geographical areas with a high incidence of ARF there is a widespread carriage of group C streptococci (GCS) and group G streptococci (GGS) (20Haidan A. Talay S.R. Rohde M. Sriprakash K.S. Currie B.J. Chhatwal G.S. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1167-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21McDonald M.I. Towers R.J. Andrews R.M. Benger N. Currie B.J. Carapetis J.R.

Traditionally, these serogroups are considered as important veterinary pathogens but are also involved in human infections. Their spectrum of diseases is very similar to the one of GAS, comprising pharyngitis, skin, and soft tissue infections as well as bacteremia and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (23Baracco G.J. Bisno A.L. Fischetti V.A. Gram-positive Pathogens. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006: 223-229Google Scholar). Some GCS and GGS strains have the potential to induce autoimmunity against cardiac myosin, suggesting contribution to the pathogenesis of ARF/RHD (20Haidan A. Talay S.R. Rohde M. Sriprakash K.S. Currie B.J. Chhatwal G.S. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1167-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This might at least partially explain the high incidence of ARF in certain indigenous populations of the Northern Territory of Australia, where pharyngeal isolation of GAS is rare but the prevalence of GCS and GGS is high (24McDonald M. Currie B.J. Carapetis J.R. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2004; 4: 240-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The mechanisms known today are not sufficient to fully explain the pathogenesis of ARF. In this study we investigated the potential of GCS and GGS to interact with collagen IV and identified the binding factors, one being the M-like protein FOG, which was described as an adhesin (25Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Analysis of patient sera revealed contribution of FOG in clinical cases of ARF/RHD, indicating the role of GGS as a causative organism. By pinpointing the responsible binding motif we could gain deeper insight into the pathogenesis of ARF and discovered a promising diagnostic marker for the recognition of rheumatogenic strains. Bacterial Strains and Human Sera—Group C and G streptococcal strains were collected in different geographic regions, with an emphasis on human isolates from the Northern Territory in Australia. The S. pyogenes control strain (A60) was obtained from the Institute for Medical Microbiology of the TU Aachen. Unless stated otherwise, streptococci were grown statically to late exponential phase in tryptic soy broth (Roth) at 37 °C. Human sera from patients with acute rheumatic fever and of healthy volunteers were collected in Chandigarh, India. Collagen Binding Assays—Streptococci were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to give 108 bacteria/ml. Bacteria (2.5 × 107) were incubated with 30 ng (100,000 cpm) of 125I-labeled collagen IV isolated from placenta (Sigma) for 45 min at room temperature. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and the pellet was measured in a gamma counter. The HA capsule was detected by preincubating bacteria with either 20 μl (60 units) of hyaluronidase (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) or 20 μl of PBS for 45 min at 37 °C. The bacteria were washed 3 times in 1 ml of PBS before the incubation with the radiolabeled collagen. Assays were performed in triplicate within each set of experiments, and experiments were repeated on different days. Screening and Sequencing of emm and emm-like Genes—The chromosomal DNA of all collagen binding isolates was tested by PCR for the presence of emm and emm-like genes using the primers 1 and 2 recommended by the Center of Disease Control. The obtained PCR products were subsequently sequenced using primer 1. Electron Microscopy—G45 (a FOG-positive, HA-negative, and collagen binding strain) and G50 (a non-collagen binding strain) were grown statically to late exponential phase in Todd Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY). The bacteria (5 × 107) were suspended in 500 μl of PBS and incubated with 40 μg of collagen IV at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were washed, fixed, and processed for field emission scanning electron microscopy as described before (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins and Site-directed Mutagenesis—For cloning of FOG constructs and of MLC1903, suitable PCR products were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) between the BamHI and the SalI or the BamHI and the EcoRI cleavage site. FOGfl (amino acid residues 1-557) represents the mature full-length protein. FOG1-B represents the first 278 amino acids, and FOG1-A represents the first 134 amino acids of the mature FOG protein (Fig. 2A). The plasmids coded for fusion proteins that carried an N-terminal GST tag. They were expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the plasmid pGEX-6P-1-FOGfl that coded for the GST-FOGfl fusion protein. E. coli clones containing the plasmids with the desired substitutions were generated using the GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The tagged proteins from E. coli lysates were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 10 mm reduced l-glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) after washing the matrix with PBS. When desired the GST tag was removed by digesting the proteins with PreScission™ protease (GE Healthcare) while bound to the affinity matrix, which eluted the untagged FOG proteins. Immunization of Mice—For immunization with FOGfl and FOGB2-C2, groups of pathogen-free 8-week-old female C3H mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of an emulsion of the appropriate recombinant protein (10 μg) in PBS (2/3) and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1/3) at days 1, 14, and 21. Emulsion devoid of FOG was injected into mice of the control group. Serum samples were taken at day 28. In experiments with M3.5 and FOG1-B, respectively, groups of five pathogen-free 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with an emulsion of 25 μg of the regarding recombinant protein in 50 μl of PBS and 50 μl of Freund's incomplete adjuvant per dose at days 1, 7, and 14. Control mice were injected with 50 μl of PBS and 50 μl of Freund's incomplete adjuvant per dose. At day 21, the serum samples were collected and tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described below. To absorb FOG-reactive antibodies, 10 μl of serum pool was diluted 1:50 in PBS and incubated for 1 h with 1 mg of GST-FOGfl protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Antibodies that bound to this affinity matrix were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to ELISA analysis. ELISA—To determine anti-collagen IV antibody titers, 96-well plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human collagen IV rabbit polyclonal antibody (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany) diluted 1:100 in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.6), blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBST, and incubated with collagen IV (2 μg/ml in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBST, mouse sera or human sera diluted 1:50, 1:158, 1:500, and 1:1580 in PBS were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, bound antibodies were detected using suitable horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antiserum (goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM, Jackson Laboratories; rabbit anti-human IgG, IgA, and IgM, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2,2-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] diammonium salt (ABTS tablets, Roche Applied Science) as substrate. The absorbance was determined at 405 nm. To determine anti-M3 or anti-FOG antibody titers, M3.5 or FOG1-A (4 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6) were immobilized overnight at 4 °C followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST. Wells were washed before human sera diluted 1:100, 1:316, 1:1000, and 1:3162 in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS were added to the wells and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Antibody binding was measured as described above. Sera from symptom-free donors with low titers against group A carbohydrate, group G carbohydrate, and streptolysin O were identified. The highest titer against FOG1-A or M3.5, respectively, found in those sera was defined as the cut-off for considering a patient serum positive. Dot Blots—Ligand overlay assays were performed by spotting the purified recombinant proteins (5, 1, or 0.5 μg) on nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk followed by a 1-h incubation with radiolabeled collagen IV (200,000 cpm) in PBST. After five washing steps in PBST, filters were dried and placed on radiographic films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for autoradiography. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Protein interactions were studied in a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB) using 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) as running buffer. A CM5 sensor chip was activated by a 4-min injection of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in water. Collagen IV from human placenta (Sigma, 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium acetate) was diluted 1:25 in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Injection of 3 μl at a flow rate of 5 μl/min led to immobilization of 400–550 response units of collagen IV. Residual reactive groups were inactivated by a 6-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Collagen I was immobilized as described previously (25Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interaction measurements with FOG1-A and FOG1-B were carried out at a flow rate of 60 μl/min measurements with GST-FOGfl, mutated GST-FOGfl, and GST at a flow rate of 35 μl/min. Surface regeneration was achieved by injection of two 30-s pulses of 0.2% SDS in water. The BIAevaluation 3.0 software was used for further analysis of the data. The curves shown represent the difference between the signal of the collagen-coupled surface and of a deactivated control surface devoid of protein. They were further corrected by subtraction of the curve that was obtained after injection of buffer alone. Buffer injection led to responses less than five response units. Spot-synthesized Peptides—The 15-mer peptides were synthesized on an aminopegylated cellulose membrane (AIMS Scientific Products) as described previously (26Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). After washing in ethanol (96%) and thereafter in PBS, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (2% blocking solution from Genosys and 0.5% sucrose in PBST) at room temperature. Binding was tested by incubating the membrane with 3 μg of radiolabeled collagen IV (1,000,000 cpm) in PBST for 4 h at room temperature. Non-bound ligand was removed by washing with PBST for 1 h. Bound collagen IV was detected using an x-ray film. Collagen Binding Factors on GCS and GGS Isolated from Human Infections—A total of 70 GCS and GGS strains isolated from human infections, all belonging to the species Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, were examined in this study. A S. pyogenes strain (A60) of the rheumatogenic M3 serotype was included as a positive control (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All strains were tested for binding to radiolabeled collagen IV, revealing that 27 strains (38%) of the isolates had an ability to bind collagen IV, similar to the control strain. All strains that interacted with collagen were subjected to further analyses. Because HA capsule and M3 protein have been reported as collagen binding factors of GAS (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the presence of such factors in the GCS and GGS strains was investigated (Table 1). Collagen binding via the HA capsule was tested by hyaluronidase treatment that abolished HA-mediated interaction. HA was found in seven of the isolates and was distributed equally among GGS and GCS. The presence of emm-related genes, coding for M-like proteins, was investigated by PCR using primers of highly conserved sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subsequent DNA sequencing of the PCR products. All isolates possessed emm-related genes, which is in accordance with the observation that the presence of such genes is frequent in human isolates (27Simpson W.J. Robbins J.C. Cleary P.P. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 3: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Four of the strains were found to possess the emm-related gene fog that codes for the M-like fibrinogen binding protein of GGS (FOG) (25Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Johansson H.M. Mörgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because FOG was previously described as an adhesin that binds collagen I (25Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), these strains became the subject of further investigations. The gene fog was present in GGS isolates only. Of the four strains that were found to possess fog, two had an HA capsule that contributed to collagen binding. The interaction of streptococci with collagen IV was also analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1), revealing that a FOG-positive human isolate negative for HA bound collagen IV and aggregated it on its surface (Fig. 1A). Taken together, the experiments allowed the conclusion that encapsulated GCS and GGS bind collagen IV via HA, but direct interaction between M-like protein FOG and collagen IV remained to be investigated.TABLE 1Collagen binding factors in human GCS and GGS isolatesGroupStrain no.Collagen binding factorsemmfogHAC62+--C63+--C72+--C77+--C78+--C82+-+C89+-+G22+--G23+--G24+--G25+--G27+--G33+--G35+--G40+--G41+--G42+--G43+++G45++-G48+--G51++-G52+--G57+-+G58+-+G59+--G60+-+G89+++ Open table in a new tab The N Terminus of FOG Binds Collagen IV—For investigation of the interaction between FOG and collagen IV, three different recombinant proteins, FOGfl (amino acids 1–557), FOG1-B (amino acids 1–278), and FOG1-A (amino acids 1–134) (Fig. 2A), were subjected to SPR measurements using collagen IV as the immobilized ligand. FOGfl (Fig. 2B) as well as the shorter fragments FOG1-B (Fig. 2C) and FOG1-A (Fig. 2D) showed concentration-dependent binding with dissociation constants of 6 nm, 53 nm, and 1.3 μm, respectively. Coherent with data on collagen I (25Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. Mörgelin M. J. Biol.

Binding of FOG to collagen IV, which was shown here for the first time, is an interaction that suggests a role of FOG in ARF pathogenesis (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S.

This is corroborated by the observation that FOG also binds to collagen type II and type III. 4D. P. Nitsche-Schmitz, unpublished data. The specificity for collagens, however, is proven by the inability of FOG to bind C1q (37Nitsche-Schmitz D.P. Johansson H.M. Sastalla I. Reissmann S. Frick I-M. Chhatwal G.S. J. Biol.

J. 1976; 155: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Moreover, FOG was found negative for binding to fibronectin (data not shown), which is, like collagens, another abundant protein of the extracellular matrix (31Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1984; 35: 561-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The N Termini of FOG and M3 Induce Collagen Autoimmunity—In the case of GAS the surface protein M3 binds and aggregates collagen, leading to collagen IV autoantigenicity (15Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Kaplan E.L. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We, therefore, immunized mice with FOGfl and a FOG fragment that lacks the collagen binding region (FOGB2-C2; amino acids 187–415). Analysis of anti-collagen IV serum titers by ELISA revealed significantly higher autoimmunity in the group immunized with FOGfl as compared with the control group immunized with PBS. Immunization with FOGB2-C2 led to serum titers at the level of the control group (Fig. 3A). The results suggested that the collagen binding N-terminal region of FOG is crucial for the induction of collagen autoimmunity. To test whether the N-terminal fragments of M3 protein or FOG were sufficient for induction of collagen IV autoimmune response, sera from mice immunized with M3.5 (amino acids 1–186) protein or FOG1-B (Fig. 3B), were analyzed. As compared with the buffer control, both groups produced substantially higher titers of anti-collagen IV antibodies. To examine the specificity of the antibodies, the collagen-IV-reactive mouse sera were pooled, and the antibody titers against collagen IV and FOG1-A, determined before and after pre-absorption with FOGfl protein, were compared. Although reactivity against FOG1-A was completely eliminated (Fig. 3C), the serum titer against collagen IV remained almost unchanged after pre-absorption (Fig. 3D), indicating that antibodies against FOG and collagen were distinct populations that did not cross-react. This demonstrated that the observed collagen autoimmunity was not caused by structural similarities of FOG (molecular mimicry) but that interaction with FOG had rendered host collagen IV an antigen. In summary, the experiments indicate that collagen binding motifs in the N-terminal serotype-specific region of FOG and M3 induce collagen IV autoimmunity. To examine whether FOG-collagen complexes induce autoantigenicity in proven clinical cases of ARF/RHD, patient sera with elevated levels of collagen autoantibodies and sera of healthy controls were tested for reactivity against the serotype-specific N terminus of FOG (FOG1-A) as well as M3 protein (M3.5). Substantially higher serum titers against FOG1-A were observed with patient sera as compared with control sera from healthy donors from the same geographic region in Chandigarh, India (Fig. 4). Of the 17 patients' sera examined, 12 sera had positive titers against FOG1-A (for the definition of positive titers, see “Experimental Procedures”). Of these 12, only 5 sera also had a positive titer against M3.5. Notably, sera reacting with M3.5 but not with FOG1-A were not found. The results indicate an epidemiologically important contribution of FOG-positive strains in ARF"
https://openalex.org/W1997458315,"Recent genetic evidence has implicated the adhesive chemokine CX3CL1 and its leukocyte receptor CX3CR1 in atherosclerosis. We previously proposed a mechanism involving foam cell anchorage to vascular smooth muscle cells because: 1) CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are expressed by both cell types in mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions; 2) foam cells are reduced in lesions in cx3cr1-/-apoE-/- mice; and 3) proatherogenic lipids (oxidized low density lipoprotein [oxLDL] and oxidized linoleic acid derivatives) induce adhesion of primary human macrophages to primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) in vitro in a macrophage CX3CR1-dependent manner. Here we analyze this concept further by testing whether atherogenic lipids regulate expression and function of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 on CASMCs. We found that both oxLDL and oxidized linoleic acid derivatives indirectly up-regulated CASMC CX3CL1 at both the protein and mRNA levels through an autocrine feedback loop involving tumor necrosis factor α production and NF-κB signaling. Oxidized lipids also up-regulated CASMC CX3CR1 but through a different mechanism. Oxidized lipid stimulation also increased adhesion of macrophages to CASMCs when CASMCs were stimulated prior to assay, and a synergistic pro-adhesive effect was observed when both cell types were prestimulated. Selective inhibition with a CX3CL1-specific blocking antibody indicated that adhesion was strongly CASMC CX3CL1-dependent. These findings support the hypothesis that CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 mediate heterotypic anchorage of foam cells to CASMCs in the context of atherosclerosis and suggest that this chemokine/chemokine receptor pair may be considered as a pro-inflammatory target for therapeutic intervention in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

CX3CL1 is an atypical multimodular chemokine that exists both in membrane-tethered and shed forms. The immobilized form consists of a chemokine domain anchored to the plasma membrane through an extended mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular domain (11Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B.

Neither CX3CL1 nor CX3CR1 has been found in normal human arteries; however, their expression is up-regulated in the context of coronary artery disease on both foam cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in plaque (17Lucas A.D.

In our present study we tested whether the same atherogenic lipids regulate CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 expression and function on CASMCs. Materials—LDL and oxLDL were purchased from Intracel (Frederick, MD). 9-HODE and 13-HODE, and arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids, PGPC (1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and POV-PC (1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Monoclonal antibodies included: rat anti-human CX3CR1 (MBL International Corp., Woburn, MA), mouse anti-human CD14 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and neutralizing mouse anti-human IFNγ and mouse anti-human IL-1β (R&D, Minneapolis, MN). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human CX3CL1 antiserum was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies and rabbit IgG used for flow cytometry and neutralization studies were from BD Biosciences. Soluble TNFα receptor (sTNFαR) was from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-1β enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were from R&D. Real-time PCR reagents, including validated 6-carboxyfluorescein-tagged human CX3CL1, CX3CR1, and GAPDH probes were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). BAY 11-7082 and NF-κB activation inhibitor (AI) were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Primary human CASMCs and SmGM-2 medium were from Cambrex (Rockville, MD). CASMC donors died from suicide or accidents and lacked history or pathologic evidence of cardiovascular disease. RPMI 1640 and Vybrant cell adhesion assay kit were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and Stimulations—CASMCs were cultured in SmGM-2 medium containing epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin, gentamicin sulfate and fetal bovine serum as recommended by the manufacturer. CASMCs were grown to 90% confluence prior to stimulations. Stimulations of CASMCs (106) were performed in a 6-well dish for 24 h at 37 °C with LDL (25 μg/ml), oxLDL (25 μg/ml), or oxidized arachidonic acid- and oxidized linoleic acid-containing lipids (5 μg/ml). Concentrations were optimized to minimize cell death (<8%). Monocytes elutriated from peripheral blood of healthy donors were purified as described previously and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 volume % of autologous serum. Cells were plated at 2.5 × 106/well in a 6-well dish, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then stimulated with LDL (50 μg/ml), oxLDL (50 μg/ml), or oxidized arachidonic acid- and oxidized linoleic acid-containing lipids (10 μg/ml) for 24 h. In experiments using elutriated human monocytes these optimized lipid concentrations induced maximal CX3CR1 up-regulation and monocyte differentiation to macrophages (24Barlic J. Zhang Y. Foley J.F. Murphy P.M. Circulation. 2006; 114: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and were therefore used for all experiments. Flow Cytometry—CASMCs (106) were fixed (Cytofix buffer, BD Biosciences) and stained with antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min in labeling buffer (Hanks'balanced salt solution with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide) containing anti-Fc reagent (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) and then analyzed as described previously (24Barlic J. Zhang Y. Foley J.F. Murphy P.M. Circulation. 2006; 114: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). mRNA Quantitation—RNA was extracted and analyzed by qPCR exactly as previously described (24Barlic J. Zhang Y. Foley J.F. Murphy P.M. Circulation. 2006; 114: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CASMC Transfections and NF-κB Knockdown—“NF-κB Validated Stealth RNAi Duo Pack” was from Invitrogen. NF-κB-specific stealth RNAi (sRNAi) targeting the p50 subunit of the NF-κB transcription complex were: 5′-GCAGAUGGCCCAUACCUUCAAAUAU-3′ (NF-κB #1) and 5′-GCACGAAUGACAGAGGCGUGUGUAUAA-3′ (NF-κB #2). The two negative control sRNAi, which had minimal sequence homology to any vertebrate transcript, had low and medium GC content (-Clow and -Cmed) that matched the silencing sRNAi GC composition. Fluorescein-labeled dsRNA oligomer, used to estimate transfection efficiency, had the same length as the sRNAi. CASMCs (106) were detached using 0.05 m EDTA and nucleofected using basic nucleofector kit for primary SMC (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) with 200 nm fluorescein-labeled dsRNA or with 200 or 400 nm concentration of negative control or NF-κB-specific sRNAi. These concentrations of sRNAi have not interfered with viability (cell death ≤8%) or morphology of transfected cells. Following transfection, cells were resuspended in 2 ml of CASMC proprietary medium containing all recommended supplements (Cambrex) and then cultured with or without LDL, oxLDL, or lipids at 37 °C for 24 h. Static Adhesion Assay—Monocytes (2.5 × 106) were cultured with or without LDL, oxLDL, 9-HODE, or 13-HODE for 24 h, washed with prewarmed RPMI 1640, and loaded for 30 min with 5 μm Calcein AM at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended at 0.5 × 106/100 μl then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with sRNAi-transfected or control CASMCs (106) that were either unstimulated or stimulated with LDL, oxLDL, 9-HODE, or 13-HODE for 24 h. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing 4× and end point fluorescence (unit/ml) was measured using a fluorescein filter set (absorbance 494 nm/emission 517 nm) on a Flex-Station (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were corrected by subtracting the autofluorescence from the peak fluorescence in each well. For blocking experiments, CASMCs were pretreated with CX3CL1-directed Ab (2.5 μg/ml) or an equal amount of isotype-matched control IgG prior to co-cultivation with macrophages, and the adhesion assay was then carried out as outlined above. Statistical Analysis—All conditions were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was performed in three different monocyte and CASMC donors. Values for each condition were averaged, and data are presented as means ± S.E. of mean (S.E.). The statistical significance of differences among matched groups was tested by the nonparametric Friedman two-way analysis of variance by ranks, followed by Dunn's post-test, using the GraphPad Prism 3.0 Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Atherogenic Lipids Specifically Increase CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 Expression in CASMCs—Although neither CX3CL1 nor CX3CR1 have been observed in healthy coronary arteries (18Wong B.W.C. Wong D. McManus B.M. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 2002; 11: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we found that both molecules were constitutively expressed on the surface of CASMCs cultured in vitro (Fig. 1). Expression of CX3CL1 was increased by 7-15% by unmodified LDL or two bioactive arachidonic acid-containing phospholipid components of LDL, POV-PC and PGPC, which are found in atherosclerotic plaque (25Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbana-gounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), but this did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, oxLDL and either 9-HODE or 13-HODE, two oxidized linoleic acid-derived components of oxLDL found free at high concentrations in plaque (21Glavind J. Hartmann S. Experimentia (Basel). 1951; 7: 464Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Harland W.A. Gilbert J.D. Brooks C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Jira W. Spiteller G. Carson W. Schramm A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 91: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), all increased the frequency of CX3CL1+ and CX3CR1+ cells (Figs. 1, A and B). Furthermore, mean fluorescence on CX3CL1+ and CX3CR1+ cells increased significantly when CASMCs were stimulated with oxLDL or oxidized linoleic acid-containing lipids (supplemental Fig. 1). Up-regulation of both molecules was also observed at the mRNA level (Fig. 1C). Atherogenic Lipids Enhance Macrophage Adhesion to CASMCs in a CX3CL1-dependent Manner—In vitro, monocyte adhesion to CASMCs was low if both cell types were either unstimulated or stimulated with LDL. However, monocyte-CASMC adhesion increased 4.5-, 2.9-, or 3.6-fold over control values when CASMCs, but not monocytes, were stimulated with oxLDL (Fig. 2A), 9-HODE, or 13-HODE (Fig. 2B), respectively. Reciprocally, cell adhesion increased to a similar extent, 5.7-, 3.9-, and 3.7-fold, when monocytes but not CASMCs were stimulated with oxLDL (Fig. 2A), 9-HODE, or 13-HODE (Fig. 2B), respectively. When both monocytes and CASMCs were stimulated before assay, adhesion of the two cell types increased dramatically, by 10.2-, 8.6-, or 11.4-fold, respectively. Since CASMCs constitutively express CX3CL1 in our system, pretreatment of unstimulated CASMCs with anti-CX3CL1 Ab prior to the adhesion assay partially decreased adhesion of oxLDL-(Fig. 2A), 9-HODE-, or 13-HODE-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, pretreatment of stimulated CASMCs with this antibody strongly and specifically reduced adhesion induced by oxLDL (Fig. 2A), 9-HODE, and 13-HODE (Fig. 2B) by 64, 52, or 60%, respectively. Preincubation of CASMCs with the isotype-matched control IgG had no effect on adhesion (Fig. 2). Thus, the results show that adhesion of macrophages to CASMCs is specific and predominantly mediated by CX3CL1. TNFα Mediates Oxidized Lipid-induced CX3CL1 Up-regulation on CASMCs—The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-1β are all present in human atherosclerotic lesions (26Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 515-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Since in vitro stimulation with recombinant forms of each of these three cytokines has previously been shown to induce CX3CL1 expression in cultured vascular endothelial cells and aortic SMC (27Imaizumi T. Yoshida H. Satoh K. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2004; 11: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Ludwig A. Berkhout T. Moores K. Groot P. Chapman G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we investigated whether oxidized lipid stimulation could induce production of the corresponding endogenous cytokines in CASMCs. As shown in Fig. 3, stimulation of cells with LDL did not induce TNFα production, whereas 9-HODE, 13-HODE, or increasing concentrations of oxLDL strongly up-regulated CASMC production of TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-1β. Neutralization of endogenous cytokines did not affect constitutive expression of either CX3CL1 or CX3CR1 (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 2). In contrast, neutralization of endogenous TNFα with sTNFαR (Fig. 4, A and B) interfered with oxLDL-, 9-HODE-, and 13-HODE-induced production of CASMC CX3CL1. Furthermore, antibody neutralization of IFNγ (Fig. 4, C and D), but not IL-1β (supplemental Fig. 2), inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the oxidized lipid-induced increase in frequency of CX3CL1+ cells within the total CASMC population. The inhibitory effect was modest and did not quite reach statistical significance for the total CASMC population (Fig. 4, C and D) but did for the CX3CR1 negative subpopulation (p value = 0.0278 for 9-HODE and p value = 0.0432 for 13-HODE; Fig. 4E). No effect of IFNγ neutralization on CX3CL1+ cell frequency was observed for the CX3CR1 positive subpopulation (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, none of the three neutralizing agents interfered with oxidized lipid-induced expression of CX3CR1 on these cell types (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, our data suggest that TNFα and IFNγ, which are the major pro-atherogenic cytokines produced in response to stimulation with atherogenic lipids in our system, promote CX3CL1, but not CX3CR1, up-regulation on CASMCs. CX3CL1, but Not CX3CR1, Up-regulation on CASMCs Is NF-κB-dependent: Pharmacologic Analysis—TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-1β activate NF-κB (29Caamano J. Hunter C.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 414-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 30Sizemore N. Agarwal A. Das K. Lerner N. Sulak M. Rani S. Ransohoff R. Shultz D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7994-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NF-κB promotes atherogenic lipid-induced CX3CL1 up-regulation on CASMCs. We also tested CX3CR1, despite the lack of a modulatory effect of these cytokines on its expression, since it remained possible that oxidized lipids could activate NF-κB directly as shown previously for monocytes and endothelial cells (31Heermeier K. Leicht W. Palmetshofer A. Ullrich M. Wanner C. Galle J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar) or indirectly by inducing production of another factor able to activate NF-κB. Pretreatment of CASMCs with either BAY11-7082, which selectively and irreversibly inhibits TNF-α-inducible phosphorylation of IκBα resulting in decreased expression of NF-κB (32Pierce J.W.

Obara F. Hayashi H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), had no effect on either basal CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression or oxidized linoleic acid-containing lipid-induced CX3CR1 up-regulation but blocked oxidized lipid-driven induction of CX3CL1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Atherogenic Lipid Induction of CX3CL1 and TNFα in CASMCs Is NF-κB-dependent: Genetic Analysis—To test directly whether NF-κB up-regulates CX3CL1 expression and TNFα production in CASMC cultures exposed to atherogenic lipids, we blocked endogenous expression of NF-κB p50 with target-specific sRNAi. Transfection of CASMCs with either oligomer alone suppressed accumulation of the target mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 3A). At 200 nm, inhibition was >95% and appeared specific since constitutive expression of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 was unaffected (supplemental Fig. 3A). Thus, this concentration was judged as optimal and used for all subsequent experiments. The same concentration of a fluorescein-labeled dsRNA oligomer resulted in transfection of only 60% of CASMCs (supplemental Fig. 3, B and C). Thus this probe and the sRNAis appear to have distinct transfection efficiencies by the nucleofection method we used, which is consistent with information provided by the manufacturer. sRNAi transfection did not alter steady-state CASMC CX3CL1 or CX3CR1 surface expression (Figs. 6, A and B) or TNFα production (Fig. 6C). In CASMCs transfected with the negative control oligomers, stimulation with oxLDL, 9-HODE, or 13-HODE up-regulated the frequency of CX3CL1+ cells by ∼57, ∼55, or ∼59%, respectively (Fig. 6, A and B) and strongly induced TNFα production (Fig. 6C). In addition, the same stimuli increased the frequency of negative control sRNAi-transfected CX3CR1+ cells (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, NF-κB knockdown reversed the effects of oxLDL and oxidized linoleic acid metabolites on CX3CL1 surface expression and TNFα production but had no effect on increased CX3CR1 expression. Thus, these results indicate that NF-κB activity is crucial for atherogenic lipid-promoted CX3CL1 up-regulation and TNFα production in our system. Atherogenic Lipid-induced Macrophage-CASMC Adhesion Is NF-κB-dependent—CASMC transfection with either negative control or NF-κB-specific sRNAi had no effect on adhesion of unstimulated or stimulated monocytes to unstimulated CASMCs (Fig. 7A). In contrast, CASMC NF-κB knockdown strongly decreased adhesion of unstimulated and stimulated monocytes to oxLDL-, 9-HODE-, or 13-HODE-stimulated CASMCs (Fig. 7, B-D), indicating that NF-κB signaling in CASMCs is important for adhesion to monocytes. Oxidative stress and inflammation are accepted as major factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (2Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18955) Google Scholar, 3Witztum J.L. Lancet. 1994; 344: 793-795Abstract PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar), but how they interact to produce a plaque has not been clearly delineated. Recent data suggest that oxidized lipids may act in part by regulating production and function of chemokines and chemokine receptors expressed by cells in plaque (24Barlic J. Zhang Y. Foley J.F.

To examine the mechanism of CPT1 liver isoform (CPT1A) inhibition by malonyl-CoA, we constructed an in silico model of both its NH2- and COOH-terminal domains. Two malonyl-CoA binding sites were found. One of these, the “CoA site” or “A site,” is involved in the interactions between NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and shares the acyl-CoA hemitunnel. The other, the “opposite-to-CoA site” or “O site,” is on the opposite side of the enzyme, in the catalytic channel. The two sites share the carnitine-binding locus. To prevent the interaction between NH2- and COOH-terminal regions, we produced CPT1A E26K and K561E mutants. A double mutant E26K/K561E (swap), which was expected to conserve the interaction, was also produced. Inhibition assays showed a 12-fold decrease in the sensitivity (IC50) toward malonyl-CoA for CPT1A E26K and K561E single mutants, whereas swap mutant reverts to wild-type IC50 value. We conclude that structural interaction between both domains is critical for enzyme sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition at the “A site.” The location of the “O site” for malonyl-CoA binding was supported by inhibition assays of expressed R243T mutant. The model is also sustained by kinetic experiments that indicated linear mixed type malonyl-CoA inhibition for carnitine. Malonyl-CoA alters the affinity of carnitine, and there appears to be an exponential inverse relation between carnitine Km and malonyl-CoA IC50.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) 4The abbreviations used are: CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; CPT1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 liver isoform; CPT1B, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 muscle isoform; CPT2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. 4The abbreviations used are: CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; CPT1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 liver isoform; CPT1B, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 muscle isoform; CPT2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines in the presence of l-carnitine. This is the first step in the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix, where they undergo β-oxidation. CPT1 is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA. This regulation allows CPT1 to signal the availability of lipid and carbohydrate fuels to the cell (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Mammalian tissues express three isoforms: CPT1A (liver), CPT1B (muscle and heart), and CPT1C (brain), which are the products of different genes (2Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H.

Genomics. 2002; 80: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). CPT1A and -B have 62% amino acid identity, but they are differentially regulated by malonyl-CoA. CPT1A is inhibited to a much lesser extent than CPT1B, which may explain why fatty acid oxidation is more finely regulated in the heart than in the liver. CPT1 is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders involving diabetes and coronary heart disease (5Anderson R.C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between malonyl-CoA and CPT1C may be involved in the “malonyl-CoA signal” in hypothalamic neurons regulating food intake and peripheral energy expenditure (6Cha S.H. Rodgers J.T. Puigserver P. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15410-15415Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that there are two malonyl-CoA binding sites in the molecule of CPT1A (7Cook G.A. Mynatt R.L. Kashfi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8803-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zammit V.A. Corstorphine C.G. Gray S.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies indicate that there is a high affinity binding site and a low affinity binding site (9Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Shi J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The probable binding sites of malonyl-CoA in CPT1A were deduced to be at the COOH terminus, after the preparation of several CPT1A and CPT1B chimeras (14Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our group has reported that the conserved Met593, which is located in the COOH-terminal domain, plays a critical permissive role in the interaction between the enzyme and malonyl-CoA. The mutation of this amino acid to serine abolished the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT1A (15Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Bentebibel A. Selles E. Casals N. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9058-9063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the NH2 terminus of CPT1A (residues 1–47) was also shown to influence the enzyme/inhibitor interaction. Mutation of either Glu3 or His5 reduced malonyl-CoA sensitivity (12Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the removal of the segment comprised between amino acids 3 and 18 in both CPT1A and CPT1B decreased sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, which emphasizes the importance of the NH2 terminus before the first transmembrane region as a modulator of malonyl-CoA inhibition (17Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Further, it has been demonstrated by a physico-chemical method that CPT1A adopts different conformational states that are more or less sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition. These conformational states also involve different degrees of proximity between specific residues within the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains in conditions characterized by changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (18Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been observed that changes (whether insertions or deletions) in the length of the loop proximal to the transmembrane 2 region of CPT1A can increase its sensitivity to malonyl-CoA (19Borthwick K. Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32946-32952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several authors report data relating the inverse association between the effects of malonyl-CoA and carnitine on CPT1 activity. These can be summarized as follows: 1) in liver, the inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA on CPT1 activity is weaker after starvation and ketosis, when the carnitine content of the cell increases (20McGarry J.D. Robles-Valdes C. Foster D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4385-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); 2) tissues in which CPT1 is most sensitive to malonyl-CoA (muscle and heart) require the highest concentration of carnitine to drive the reaction (22McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar); 3) there is a reciprocal relationship between the affinity of carnitine and malonyl-CoA concentration, since malonyl-CoA increases the Km of the enzyme for carnitine, and hence the inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA varies with carnitine concentration (11Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); 4) mutations designed to decrease malonyl-CoA sensitivity increase catalytic efficiency of CPT1 for carnitine, which appears to be roughly proportional to the extent of the alteration in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (15Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Bentebibel A. Selles E. Casals N. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9058-9063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This indicates that such mutants can position carnitine better at the catalytic site, thus displacing malonyl-CoA and reducing the inhibition of CPT1. Since CPT1 has not been crystallized, many attempts have been made to identify the domains in CPT1 that may bind malonyl-CoA. However, the location of such binding sites has not yet been reported. In the present paper, we describe two putative binding sites for malonyl-CoA in rat CPT1A. They were inferred from the analysis of computational docking models developed for this interaction. The presence of malonyl-CoA on the protein-ligand interaction sites interferes with the positioning of carnitine. One of the sites, the “CoA site” or “A site,” is involved in the interactions between its NH2- and COOH-terminal domains, and the other, “opposite-to-CoA site” or “O site,” only intervenes in the COOH-terminal domain. Mutations of specific amino acids from both NH2 and COOH termini support their involvement in CPT1 malonyl-CoA sensitivity. This model is also supported by kinetic experiments that indicated linear mixed type malonyl-CoA inhibition for carnitine, suggesting that the positioning of malonyl-CoA near to the carnitine binding locus produces competitive-non-competitive inhibition. Furthermore, a linear inverse correlation between the logarithm of the IC50 for malonyl-CoA and the logarithm of Km for carnitine was observed. Overall, these data indicate a close relationship between the effects of malonyl-CoA on CPT1 and its affinity for carnitine. This conclusion is supported not only by experimental data but also by the two putative binding sites for malonyl-CoA in the three-dimensional structural model of CPT1A deduced from docking calculations. Construction of Site-directed Mutants—Plasmids, pYESLCPTIE26K, pYESLCPTIK561E, pYESLCPTIR45D, pYESLCPTID698R, and pYESLCPTIR243T were constructed using the QuikChange PCR-based mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) with the plasmid pYESLCPTIwt, obtained as previously described (15Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Bentebibel A. Selles E. Casals N. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9058-9063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as template. Plasmids containing double mutations pYESLCPTIE26K/K561E, pYESLCPTIR45D/D698R, and pYESLCPTIR243T/A478G were constructed using the same procedure with the plasmids pYESLCPTIE26K, pYESLCPTIR45D, and pYESLCPTIR243T as templates, respectively. The primers used for PCR are described in supplemental Table 1. The appropriate substitutions and the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by sequencing the inserts in both directions with an Applied Biosystems 373 automated DNA sequencer. Expression of CPT1A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—The expression of the constructs containing wild type and mutants CPT1A in yeast cells and the preparation of the cell extracts were performed as described elsewhere (15Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Bentebibel A. Selles E. Casals N. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9058-9063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae was chosen as an expression system for wild type and mutant CPT1A, because it does not have endogenous CPT1A activity. Determination of Carnitine Acyltransferase Activity—Carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was determined by the radiometric method as described elsewhere (15Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9058-9063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The substrates were l-[methyl-3H]carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA. Enzyme activity was assayed for 4 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. Substrate saturation data were fitted to rectangular hyperbolae by nonlinear regression using the program EnzFitter (Biosoft). Km was estimated by analyzing the data from three experiments. For determination of the apparent Km for carnitine, palmitoyl-CoA concentration was fixed at 135 μm, and for determination of the Km for palmitoyl-CoA, carnitine concentration was fixed at 400 μm. When malonyl-CoA inhibition was assayed, increasing concentrations of malonyl-CoA comprised between 0.05 and 100 μm were included. The IC50, defined as the malonyl-CoA concentration that produces 50% inhibition of enzyme activity, was determined at 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 400 μm carnitine. IC50 was calculated by Excel software using linear regression analysis. Values reported here are the means and S.D. of 3–5 determinations. Curve fitting was carried out using Sigma plot software version 8.0. All protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine albumin as a standard. Immunological Techniques—Western blot analysis of wild type CPT1A and the assayed mutants using polyclonal antibodies was performed as described (24Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D.

Prip-Buus (Institut Cochin, Université René Descartes, Paris, France) and was directed against peptide 317–430, in the cytosolic catalytic C-terminal domain. For the CPT1A wild type and mutants, proteins of predicted sizes were synthesized with similar levels of expression. Search of Homologous Proteins of Rat CPT1A Amino-terminal Domain—In order to find structural homologues for the amino-terminal domain sequence of rat CPT1A, the FFAS03 server (25Jaroszewski L.

From the output set of possible structural homologues among the SCOP data base representatives, the best candidate structure in terms of the FFAS03 server's empirical evaluation of matching significance was selected for further three-dimensional model building. Three-dimensional Protein Modeling of the CPT1A Amino- and Carboxyl-terminal Domains—The structural model for the rat CPT1A amino-terminal domain was assembled using homology modeling procedures, supported on the profile-based sequence alignment from the FFAS03 server output, and using the Protein Data Bank (30Berman H.M.

The structural model for rat CPT1A carboxyl-terminal domain was constructed using homology modeling procedures based on multiple structure-based amino acid sequence alignments of the carnitine acyltransferase family and the crystallographic coordinates of carnitine octanoyltransferase bound to acylcarnitine (Protein Data Bank entry 1XL8, chain A) (32Jogl G.

Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar) from the WHAT IF program (38Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar) from the same server. Finally, in order to optimize geometries, release local constraints, and correct possible inappropriate contacts, the modeled structures were energy-minimized with the implementation of the GROMOS 43B1 force field in the program DeepView (39Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar), using 500 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 500 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization. CPT1A Amino- and Carboxyl-terminal Domain Structural Interaction—The structural model for the molecular interaction between rat CPT1A amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains was built using the computational methods for protein-protein rigid docking implemented in the program Hex (40Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In order to reduce the complexity of the 6D positional search between both protein structures, the initial relative positioning of the amino-terminal domain was restrained to the CoA binding pocket side of the carboxyl terminal as proposed by Faye et al. (18Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For all of the docking models generated, molecular mechanics energy minimization over the force field implemented in Hex was finally performed. From the overall models, the best complex in terms of highest steric and electrostatic correlation between the pair of protein structures was selected. Malonyl-CoA Molecular Docking—In order to obtain a structural model of the interaction between CPT1A and its principal physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA, molecular docking procedures between both structures were performed using the methods implemented in the program suite Autodock 3.0 (41Goodsell D.S.

Structural Model for the CPT1A NH2-terminal Domain and Its Interaction with the COOH-terminal Domain—Both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of CPT1A are implicated in modulating the enzyme sensitivity to malonyl-CoA. To study the nature of the suggested interactions between the two regions and to determine how such interactions can influence the role of malonyl-CoA, we constructed in silico structural models of both domains and their structural contacts. We constructed a three-dimensional model of the residues in the NH2-terminal domain, comprising amino acids 1–61 of human CPT1A. Classic homology-based modeling techniques failed to provide a feasible template for the NH2-terminal domain, due to the lack of a close relative of known structure that could be detected using a simple BLAST search in the Protein Data Bank. To overcome this difficulty, an iterative procedure was implemented through the use of the FFAS03 server based on PSI-BLAST profile-profile searching against the classified protein structure data base SCOP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Iterative techniques like PSI-BLAST allow a more extensive search through sequence databases for remote homologues, usually maintaining structural constraints in terms of secondary and three-dimensional organization in the absence of high sequence identity. The first hit obtained on the FFAS03 server was the SCOP region d1tf3a3, corresponding to the three-dimensional structure of the a3 domain of the three-dimensional structure of X. laevis transcription factor IIIA (Protein Data Bank code 1TF3 (31Foster M.P. Wuttke D.S. Radhakrishnan I. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), with a score of –6.860 and a sequence identity of 50% over an alignment length of 44 residues; this result was within the limits of the technique. A structure-based multiple sequence alignment of several CPT1A and CPT1B NH2-terminal sequences and the sequence of the Protein Data Bank structure 1TF3 is shown in Fig. 1A. Using the crystallographic coordinates of 1TF3 as template and the information obtained from the structural alignment between 1TF3 and the NH2-terminal sequences of CPT1, a three-dimensional model was constructed for human CPT1A residues 10–50 (Fig. 1B). The model shows four β strands (E1, residues 12–14; E2, residues 20–22; E3, residues 27–30; E4, residues 34–37) and an α helix (H1, residues 38–47). The first two strands and the helix were completely aligned with the template, but beta strands E3 and E4 were modeled with less structural confidence. A model for the COOH-terminal domain of human CPT1A was constructed over the crystallographic structure of mouse carnitine octanoyltransferase (32Jogl G. Hsiao Y.S. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 738-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and CPT2 (33Hsiao Y.S. Jogl G. Esser V. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using standard homology modeling-based techniques, as described elsewhere (45Bentebibel A. Sebastian D. Herrero L. Lopez-Vinas E. Serra D. Asins G. Gomez-Puertas P. Hegardt F.G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4339-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Having obtained three-dimensional models both for NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of CPT1A, we then used the resulting structures to build a model for the putative interaction between them, using the in silico method Hex for protein-protein rigid docking, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initial positioning of both protein domains was selected on the basis of the relative location on the NH2-terminal domain in the nucleotide fragment of the acyl-CoA binding face (18Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We selected the model with the highest score in terms of steric and electrostatic correlation, and we applied energy minimization steps to correct unrealistic contacts. The final model for the NH2-terminal domain on the surface of COOH-terminal CPT1A structure is shown in Fig. 1, C and D.

Open table in a new tab In Silico Docking of the Malonyl-CoA Molecule in CPT1A Structure—The final docking model for interacting NH2- and COOH-terminal domains in human CPT1A was used as a structural frame to perform a search for a putative location of both substrates carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA and the physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA in the active center of the enzyme. A three-dimensional model of the free malonyl-CoA molecule was prepared using molecular-orbital calculation methods implemented in Mopac (46Stewart J.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1990; 4: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar), and then low energy conformational in silico models for putative inhibitor positions were generated and evaluated applying the algorithms Auto-grid and Autodock (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two runs of Autodock3 using the LGA algorithm rendered 200 conformations that were clustered with a root mean square deviation cut-off of 1 Å for all atoms of each docked solution, discarding unrealistic solutions. Docking methodology rendered a binding site for malonyl-CoA close to the interaction of NH2- and COOH-terminal domains, and residues from both domains were implicated (Figs. 1 and 2). A putative second site for the inhibitor molecule, located on the opposite side of the molecule, was also predicted (Fig. 2). In both models, the best docked conformation belonging to the lowest energy docked model of the most populated cluster was selected as a reference structure for further analysis. The two"

A key issue yet to be resolved is how GPCRs developed selectivity and diversity of ligand binding and intracellular signaling during evolution. We have explored the structural basis of selectivity of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) from different species in the single functional human GnRH receptor. We found that the highly variable amino acids in position 8 of the naturally occurring isoforms of GnRH play a discriminating role in selecting receptor conformational states. The human GnRH receptor has a higher affinity for the cognate GnRH I but a lower affinity for GnRH II and GnRHs from other species possessing substitutions for Arg(8). The latter were partial agonists in the human GnRH receptor. Mutation of Asn(7.45) in transmembrane domain (TM) 7 had no effect on GnRH I affinity but specifically increased affinity for other GnRHs and converted them to full agonists. Using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the highly conserved Asn(7.45) makes intramolecular interactions with a highly conserved Cys(6.47) in TM 6, suggesting that disruption of this intramolecular interaction induces a receptor conformational change which allosterically alters ligand specific binding sites and changes ligand selectivity and signaling efficacy. These results reveal GnRH ligand and receptor structural elements for conformational selection, and support co-evolution of GnRH ligand and receptor conformations."

The PHD finger is a motif defined by seven cysteines and a histidine arranged in a C4HC3 consensus. The PHD domain was first identified in a homeodomain protein involved in plant root development (9Schindler U. Beckmann H. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1993; 4: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Since then more than 400 eukaryotic proteins have been identified containing PHD fingers. Most of these proteins are nuclear and are thought to play roles in gene expression (10Jacobson S. Pillus L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the PHD finger of the KAP-1 core-pressor shows that the zinc ligation scheme and cross-brace topology of the anti-parallel β-sheets are very similar to the structure of the RING (really interesting new gene) finger (11Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher III, F.J. Borden K.L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Many proteins with RING fingers can act as E3 ubiquitin ligases in the ubiquitin conjugation cascade, a cascade initiated by an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, which transfers activated ubiquitin to one of a number of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is then transferred to target proteins through a large family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which bind both the activated E2 and a recognition element in the substrate (13Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). The similarity between the structure of PHD fingers and RING fingers prompted investigators to test whether PHD fingers in other proteins could act as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Several PHD-containing viral proteins have been identified that promote immune evasion by down-regulating proteins that govern immune recognition (14Boname J.M. Stevenson P.G. Immunity. 2001; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Studies show that these viral regulators lead to ubiquitylation of their targets by functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases, an activity that requires the PHD finger. The discovery of PHD-dependent E3 ligase activity in the cellular kinase MEKK1 (16Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) suggested that other PHD domain-containing proteins might share this activity, and indeed, E3 ligase activity of other such proteins has been reported (17Uchida D.

Thus, it is possible that subclasses of PHD domains exist, some with the ability to bind to modified histones, some with E3 ligase activity. These observations led us to test whether the PHD fingers in Msc1 can act as E3 ligases and whether they can bind to histones. In this paper we show that the PHD fingers of Msc1 possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, for the first time demonstrating that a PHD domain from a nuclear protein can facilitate ubiquitin transfer. Yeast Plasmids, Strains, and Manipulation—Standard Schizosaccharomyces pombe media and genetic manipulations were used as described by Moreno et al. (24Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). Yeast strains are listed in Table 1. For GST protein fusions each PHD finger was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with GST. Point mutations for the full-length protein were generated using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in a plasmid (pSP1) expressing msc1 under its endogenous promoter and tagged with a triple HA tag. The same methodology was used to generate point mutations in the GST-PHD protein fusions. GST and GST-PHD proteins were purified from Escherichia coli on GSH-Sepharose using standard procedures (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). For yeast lysate preparation, all strains were grown to mid-log phase (0.5 × 107 cells/ml) at 30 °C. For experiments assaying drug sensitivity, strains were grown to 107 cells/ml and serially diluted 10-fold, and 5 μl of each dilution was spotted. To assay UV sensitivity, cells were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C. 1000 cells were spread onto plates in triplicate and exposed to different doses of UV light using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Survival was determined by counting the number of colonies forming at each dose and dividing by the number of colonies that grew on the unirradiated control plates.TABLE 1List of strainsStrainGenotypeSP6h− leu1-32SP198h+ leu1-32 ade6-210NW591h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 pSPI/chk1-HANW1562h− leu1-32 msc1-HA-kanRNW1797h+ leu1-32 ade6-210 msc1-HA-kanRNW1798h+ leu1-32 ade6-210 ura4D18 rhp6::ura4NW1799h+ leu1-32 ade6-210 ura4D18 rhp6::ura4 msc1-HA-kanRNW1800h+ leu1-32 ade6-210 msc1::kanRNW1801h+ leu1-32 ade6-210 ura4D18 rhp6::ura4 msc1::kanRNW1802h+ leu1-32 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HANW1803h+ leu1-32 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-6C → ANW1804h+ leu1-32 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-1-7NW1805h+ leu1-32 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-2-7NW1806h+ leu1-32 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-3-7NW1807h+ leu1-32 msc1:: kanR pSPINW1808h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 cdc17-K42 pSPI/msc1-HANW1809h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 cdc17-K42 pSPI/msc1-HA-6C → ANW1810h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 cdc17-K42 pSPI/msc1-HA-1-7NW1811h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 cdc17-K42 pSPI/msc1-HA-2-7NW1812h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 cdc17-K42 pSPI/msc1-HA-3-7NW1813h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 cdc17-K42 pSPINW1814h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 pSPI/msc1-HANW1815h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 pSPI/msc1-HA-6C → ANW1816h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 pSPI/msc1-HA-1-7NW1817h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 pSPI/msc1-HA-2-7NW1818h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 pSPI/msc1-HA-3-7NW1819h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 chk1::ura4 pSPINW1820h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HANW1821h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-6C → ANW1822h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-1-7NW1823h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-2-7NW1824h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPI/msc1-HA-3-7NW1825h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPINW1826h+ leu1-32 ade6-216 ura4D18 chk1::ura4 msc1:: kanR pSPI/chk1-HA Open table in a new tab Ubiquitylation Assays—GST-PHD fusion proteins were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in a final volume of 180 μl with 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 86 mm ubiquitin (Sigma), 10 μm yeast E1 (Boston Biochem), 80 μm human E2 (Boston Biochem), and 200 μm histones extracted from S. pombe or purchased from Sigma. SDS/β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer was added and boiled, and the reaction was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a rabbit antibody against ubiquitin (Sigma) or GST. To test the requirement for Zn2+, the chelator tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN, Sigma) was added at 100 μm. For ubiquitylation reactions performed with full-length Msc1 immunoprecipitated from S. pombe (see below), reactions were performed essentially the same way except that the reaction components were incubated in the presence of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been used to capture the immunoprecipitated protein. After boiling, the reaction sample was spun down briefly at 15,000 × g, but only the supernatant was loaded onto the gel. Immunoprecipitations—To immunoprecipitate Msc1, 200 ml of cultures were grown to mid-log phase (0.5 × 107 cells/ml), spun down by centrifugation, and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline at 109 cells/ml containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed with acid-washed glass beads in a Fastprep vortexing machine (Bio101). The lysate was centrifuged at 2300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard. One mg of protein was incubated with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C before incubation with antibody. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube. 100 μl of HA antibody, F7 (Santa Cruz), was added, and the sample was rocked at 4 °C for 4 h. To capture immunocomplexes, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, then collected by centrifugation and washed 5 times with Tris-buffered saline. Samples were resuspended in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline and 6× SDS/β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, HA-tagged protein was detected by Western blot with either 12CA5 or Y11 (Santa Cruz) antibody. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Rhp6 was detected with a polyclonal antibody generated against the N terminus of human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 (Rad6 Antibody (BL840) Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.). To immunoprecipitate Rhp6 for the reciprocal assay, the Rad6 antibody was used, and HA-tagged Msc1 was detected with F7 antibody to the HA epitope. Histone Preparations—Histones were prepared according to Edmondson and Roth (26Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Methods. 1998; 15: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 500 ng of the preparation was used in each ubiquitylation reaction. For detection of methylation on histone H3, 50 μg of the histone prep was run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred, and blotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abcam) to histone H3 (ab1791) and to histone H3 dimethyl K4 (ab7766). Histone in Vitro Binding Assays—GST-PHD finger fusions for in vitro histone binding were expressed at low temperatures. Histone in vitro binding assays were performed as described by Shi et al. (22Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J.

The histones used in the assay contain methylated histone H3 as confirmed by detection with antibody to monomethyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethylhistone H3 (supplemental Fig. 1). The PHD Fingers of Msc1 Promote Polyubiquitylation in Vitro—Several PHD finger domains have the ability to bind to the methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (20Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L.

To test whether the PHD fingers of Msc1 share the ability to bind histones, we performed the assay described by Shi et al. (22Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J. Chua K.F. Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) to test whether GST fusion proteins of the Msc1 PHD fingers were capable of binding to histones in vitro. No binding of histones to any of the Msc1 PHD fingers was detectable, although the control protein consisting of the PHD finger of ING2 fused to GST pulled down histones as described (22Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J. Chua K.F. Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We compared the sequence of the PHD fingers of Msc1 with those PHD fingers that have been shown to bind methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (20Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although the tryptophan residue identified to be critical for methylated lysine 4 binding in both structural analyses is conserved in two of the three Msc1 PHD fingers, the constellation of other residues on ING2 or BPTF that interact with methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 are not conserved in any of the PHD domains of Msc1 (Fig. 1B). Because PHD fingers have also been reported to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (15Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14657-14668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we tested the Msc1 PHD fingers in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay. Purified fusion proteins were incubated with commercially obtained E1 and E2 proteins, ubiquitin, and ATP. Histones, lysozyme, or bovine serum albumin were included as sources of substrate. After incubation, reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with antibody against ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 2A, high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates were observed when PHD3 was used in the complete reaction (lanes 1-3). The presence of high molecular weight bands was dependent on ATP (lane 4, E1 (lane 5), E2 (lane 6), and substrate (lane 7). Furthermore, when GST was used in place of GST-PHD3 (lane 9), no high molecular weight products were detected. Similar results were obtained with PHD1 and PHD2 (data not shown). PHD fingers, like RING fingers, have an ordered arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues to coordinate zinc atoms in forming the cross-brace structure apparent in structural studies (11Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher III, F.J. Borden K.L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the ubiquitylation activity associated with the PHD fingers of Msc1 was dependent on the cysteine residues, the first or the seventh cysteine of each domain was mutated to alanine, and GST fusion proteins were produced. When assayed for ubiquitylation activity, the high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates were either diminished or totally abolished when the mutant PHD fingers are used (Fig. 2, A, lane 8, and B). Thus, the activity of the PHD fingers is dependent on intact cysteine residues, suggesting that activity is likely to be zinc-dependent. To test this hypothesis, assays were done in the presence of a zinc chelator TPEN. As shown in Fig. 2C, TPEN abolishes high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates, whereas the addition of ZnCl2 restores activity. The high molecular weight material seen in the presence of the Msc1 PHD fingers could be due to polyubiquitylation (28Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) or to the attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules on distinct lysine residues (multiubiquitylation). To distinguish these possibilities, assays were performed in the presence of methylated ubiquitin (29Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Methyl-ubiquitin forms the initial bond with a lysine residue through its C-terminal glycine residue. However, subsequent addition of methyl-ubiquitin to the initial one is blocked. As shown in Fig. 3A, high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates are not formed when methyl-ubiquitin is used in place of unmodified ubiquitin. Ubiquitin can form a number of chains, with the most well characterized occurring through lysine residues Lys-48 or Lys-63 (28Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Chains formed through Lys-48 linkages usually target a protein for degradation. Chains formed through Lys-63 form an extended chain and are associated with events that, for example, transduce a signal or trigger a change in protein localization (30Haglund K. Dikic I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin mutants with arginine substitutions at Lys-48 or Lys-63 were assayed for high molecular weight conjugate formation in the presence of Msc1 PHD fingers. As shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type ubiquitin or the K48R mutant each allow formation of high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates. However, when the K63R mutant was used, the high molecular ubiquitin conjugates were abolished (Fig. 3B), consistent with polyubiquitin chains forming through Lys-63 linkages. Msc1 Associates with the S. pombe Homologue of Ubc2, Rhp6—In the ubiquitin conjugation enzymatic cascade, the E1 and E2 enzymes activate ubiquitin, whereas the E3 ligase generates the specificity of the reaction by bringing the substrate near the E2 carrying the ubiquitin (13Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). In initial assays of the PHD fingers of Msc1 for E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, nine different human E2 enzymes were tested, with the most robust activity seen with Ubc2. The fission yeast homologue of human Ubc2 is encoded by the rhp6 gene, whereas the budding yeast homologue is Rad6 (31Leggett D.S. Jones D. Candido E.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). E3 and E2 components of the ubiquitin conjugation cascade can form physical interactions (33Xie Y. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6832-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether fission yeast Rhp6 and Msc1 associate in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Msc1 co-precipitates Rhp6. Likewise, immunoprecipitation of Rhp6 co-precipitates Msc1 (Fig. 4B). Because we could immunoprecipitate Msc1 with an E2, we hypothesized that full-length Msc1 from S. pombe cells might act as an E3 ligase in vitro. As controls, full-length mutant alleles of Msc1 were constructed with substitutions of alanine for the seventh cysteine residue in each of the PHD domains as well as a mutant in which all three PHD domains contained mutations in the first and seventh cysteines (6-Cys → Ala). As shown in Fig. 4C, immunoprecipitation of the full-length wild-type Msc1 protein supports ubiquitylation in the in vitro assay. Assays performed with proteins possessing single Cys to Ala mutations showed a reduced level of high molecular weight ubiquitylated material (Fig. 4C). No activity was detected in the assay using the mutant with simultaneous mutation of all three PHD domains (Fig. 4C). We note that the lack of activity is despite the fact that the amount of Msc1-6-Cys → Ala protein is reproducibly elevated relative to the single mutants or the wild-type protein (Fig. 4C, lower panel). The elevation in the amount of Msc1-6-Cys → Ala protein prompted us to consider the possibility that Msc1 self-ubiquitylates, leading to autoregulation of its own protein level. If this is the case and if Rhp6 is the appropriate E2, we anticipated that levels of Msc1 might be elevated in an rhp6Δ mutant. In the background of a strain lacking rhp6, however, the level of Msc1 is similar to that seen in a wild-type rhp6+ background (Fig. 4D). Thus, although Msc1 may utilize Rhp6 to ubiquitylate other substrates in vivo, it is unlikely that Rhp6 targets Msc1 itself for degradation. We also examined whether co-precipitating Rhp6 might be sufficient to support Msc1-mediated E3 ligase activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4E, immunoprecipitated Msc1 from cells with an intact rhp6 gene supports ubiquitylation with or without the addition of added Ubc2 as an E2 (lanes 1 and 3, respectively). However, when Msc1 was immunoprecipitated from cells with a deletion of rhp6, no activity was detected (lane 4) unless Ubc2 was added (lane 2). Thus, co-precipitated Rhp6 supports Msc1 activity and may be the predominant E2 for Msc1 in cells. The Function of the PHD Fingers Is Needed in Vivo—The gene encoding Msc1 was isolated in a screen for multicopy suppressors of a checkpoint-defective strain lacking chk1 in which DNA damage was generated by limiting the activity of DNA ligase (2Ahmed S. Palermo C. Wan S. Walworth N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3660-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test whether function of the PHD fingers is necessary for the ability of Msc1 to suppress this strain, a chk1Δ cdc17-K42 strain was transformed with plasmids expressing the single PHD domain mutants or the 6-Cys → Ala mutant. As shown in Fig. 5A, whereas a plasmid expressing wild-type Msc1 sustains growth at 32 °C, none of the mutants was capable of supporting colony formation. Thus, the E3 ligase activity associated with the PHD domains is important for the ability of Msc1 to allow"

The data document a fundamental difference in the mechanisms by which yeasts and multicellular fungi respond to the presence of d-galactose, showing that the Gal1/Gal3-Gal4-Gal80-dependent regulatory circuit does not operate in multicellular fungi. The enzymes of the Leloir pathway are responsible for the conversion of d-galactose to d-glucose 1-phosphate and have been identified in all biological kingdoms. In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the genes encoding the three main Leloir pathway enzymes, GAL1 (galactose kinase), GAL7 (UDP-galactose uridylyltransferase), and GAL10 (UDP-galactose epimerase and aldose 1-epimerase), are clustered and coordinately regulated at the level of transcription. The S. cerevisiae GAL genes are repressed by d-glucose, expressed only at a very low basal level on other respiratory carbon sources, and highly induced (up to 1000-fold) when the cells are switched to a medium containing d-galactose. This transcriptional activation is mediated by the interplay of three proteins; in the presence of d-galactose and ATP, the transcriptional inducer ScGal3 associates with the ScGal80 repressor thereby alleviating its repressing effects. This allows the transcriptional activator ScGal4 to recruit the RNA polymerase II to each of the GAL genes (reviewed in Refs.1Rubio-Texeira M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Schaffrath R. Breunig K.D. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2000; 30: 173-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Bhat P.J. Murthy T.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae galactokinase ScGal1 displays a 73% amino acid identity to the ScGal3, but galactokinase activity is absent in ScGal3. However ScGal3 can be converted into a catalytically active galactokinase through the insertion of the two amino acids, Ser and Ala, into its sequence (4Platt A. Ross H.C. Hankin S. Reece R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3154-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ScGal1, or a phenomenon termed long-term adaptation, can recover a gal3 phenotype in S. cerevisiae (5Bhat P.J. Oh D. Hopper J.E. Genetics. 1990; 125: 281-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of ScGal3 seems to be a unique trait of S. cerevisiae, and its role as a transcriptional inducer is fulfilled in other yeasts such as in Kluyveromyces lactis by a single galactokinase KlGal1. The regulatory function of KlGal1 does not require the galactokinase activity (6Meyer J. Walker-Jonah A. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5454-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the recent demonstration that the enzymatic and the weak transcriptional inducer properties of ScGal1 are located in separate parts of the protein (7Thoden J.B.

In contrast to S. cerevisiae and K. lactis, the gal genes of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans, Hypocrea jecorina, and Neurospora crassa, are not clustered (www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fgi/; genome.jgi-psf.org/), and an already high basal level of expression is found during growth on all carbon sources including d-glucose, indicating some major differences in the regulation of d-galactose metabolism between yeasts and filamentous fungi (8Seiboth B.

The H. jecorina gal1 has been shown to be essential for the induction of the cellulase genes by the d-galactose-containing disaccharide lactose (1,4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucose), an important carbon source for many fungal fermentations including the production of cellulases and recombinant proteins in H. jecorina (12Penttilä M. Limon C. Nevalainen H. Arora D.K. Handbook of Fungal Biotechnology. Marcel Dekker, New York2004: 413-427Google Scholar). A search of the H. jecorina genome data base shows that this fungus does not possess a GAL3 orthologue. Therefore, it would be possible that regulation of the gal genes in H. jecorina follows the model of the K. lactis GAL/LAC regulon. The objective of this paper was to test whether the induction of the Leloir pathway genes by d-galactose and of the cellulase genes by lactose depends on a putative transcriptional inducer function of H. jecorina GAL1. We will show that induction by lactose requires solely the galactokinase activity and that GAL1 is completely dispensable for the basal as well as the induced transcriptional level of the Leloir pathway genes. These data highlight a significant difference in d-galactose regulation between single and multicellular ascomycetes. H. jecorina strains QM9414 (ATCC 26921), Δgal1 (8Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and Δxyl1 (13Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Szentirmai A. Seiboth B. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were maintained on malt extract agar (Merck, VWR International, Vienna, Austria). Strains were grown in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 30 °C in the medium described elsewhere (14Mandels M.M. Andreotti R.E. Proc. Biochem. 1978; 13: 6-13Google Scholar) with the respective carbon source at a final concentration of 10 g l-1. For transcript analysis and galactokinase activity determination, strains were pregrown in with glycerol (1% w/v) as carbon source for about 24 h; mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with medium without carbon source, equal amounts of mycelia were transferred to 500-ml flasks containing the respective carbon source (1% w/v), and cultivation continued as indicated. For transcript analysis on lactose, direct cultivations were used. Escherichia coli strains JM109 (Promega, Madison, WI) and K12 (ATCC 19215) were used for plasmid propagation and cloning of galK. pGAL1 contains a 4.8-kb EcoRV-HindIII clone of the H. jecorina gal1 (8Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in pUC19 (15Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and pGALSH a 2.1-kb SacII-HindIII gal1 subclone in pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pGAL1-SA—Contains the 4.8-kb H. jecorina gal1 clone in which 6 nucleotides encoding the amino acid doublet Ser170-Ala171 were deleted by the fusion PCR approach. First, two gal1 fragments were amplified using pGALSH as template and the universal primer M13 reverse and GAL1mut1, respectively, GAL1mut2 and GAL1mut3. Both amplicons were joined in a second round using the primers M13 reverse and GAL1mut3. The resulting PCR product was cut with SacII/SfiI to give a 140-bp fragment, which was ligated in the SacII/SfiI-restricted pGAL1 and designated pGAL1-SA. pGALK—The E. coli galK coding region (1.1 kb) was placed under the promoter and terminator region of the H. jecorina gal1. E. coli galK was amplified from genomic E. coli K12 DNA with oligonucleotides EcGAL1fw inserting a HindIII site and EcGAL1rv inserting Acc65I/HindIII sites by PCR. The HindIII-restricted galK fragment was ligated into the HindIII site of pGAL1. The introduced Acc65I site was used to insert a 0.6-kb fragment of the terminator region, which was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides GAL1termfw and GAL1termrv. pLH1hph—A plasmid expressing the E. coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) under the promoter and terminator region of H. jecorina gpd1 (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; genome.jgi-psf.org/Trire2/Trire2.home.html, scaffold 1:1562760-1564086) was constructed. 800 bp of the gpd1 promoter region was amplified using the primer pair Pgpdf and Pgpdr and 500 bp of the terminator region using the primer pair Tgpdf and Tgpdr. The XbaI/NsiI fragment of E. coli hph of pRLMex30 (16Mach R.L. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and the NsiI/SalI gpd1 terminator region were ligated into XbaI/SalI-restricted pUC19. The BamHI/XbaI sites of the resulting vector were used for the insertion of the promoter region. All constructs were verified by sequencing (Table 1).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in the present studyNameSequenceaRespective restriction sites are underlined.GAL1mut15′-GACAAAGGCGGAGCTCAGGCC-3′GAL1mut25′-GAGCTCCGCCTTTGTCACCGC-3′GAL1mut35′-GAGGTGTGGGCTTGCTG-3′EcGAL1fw (HindIII)5′-GACTAAGCTTCGCCAACATGAGTCTGAAGGAAAAGACACAA-3′EcGAL1rv (HindIII, Acc65I)5′-GATCAAGCTTGGTACCTCAGCACTGTCCTGCTC-3′GAL1termfw (Acc65I)5′-GATCGGTACCAGGAATTAAGGGTGGGAAAG-3′GAL1termrv (Acc65I)5′-GCATGGTACCTTCCTTTGCCCGTGGGT-3′Pgpdf (BamHI)5′-GATCGGATCCGAGAGCTACCTTACATCAA-3′Pgpdr (XbaI)5′-GATCTCTAGATTTGTATCTGCGAATTGAGCTT-3′Tgpdf (NsiI)5′-GATCATGCATGTGCTGTGTTCCTCAGAAT-3′Tgpdr (SalI)5′-GATCGTCGACTTTCTTGGATTTGCAGCACAG-3′CBH1SF5′-TCGGCCTGCACTCTCCAATC-3′CBH1SR5′-TGGAGTCCAGCCACAGCATG-3′CBH2SF5′-ATTCTCACCACGCTGGCTAC-3′CBH2SR5′-CGGCGTAGTTGATGCACTC-3′18sRF5′-GGTGGAGTGATTTGTCTG-3′18sRR5′-CTTACTAGGGATTCCTCG-3′gal7for5′-CCGATATCATGCCTGACAAGATCCTCGATG-3′gal7rev5′-GTCTAGCTCAACTTGTTCCGG-3′a Respective restriction sites are underlined. Open table in a new tab Protoplast preparation, DNA-mediated transformation, and purification of the conidia were described previously (17Gruber F. Visser J. Kubicek C.P. de Graaff L.H. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hygromycin B (50 μgml-1) was used for selection of the transformants. Transformations of the Δgal1 strain were done as co-transformations either with the circular pLH1hph and a 4.2-kb PvuII fragment of pGALK or with the excised Pgpd1-hph-Tgpd1 cassette of pLH1hph together with the circular pGAL1 or pGAL1-SA. The Pgpd1-hph-Tgpd1 cassette was excised with BamHI, SalI, and PdmI. Southern analysis was performed to verify the integration of the constructs. Only strains showing a single ectopic integration of the construct were used for further analysis. Genomic DNA of the Δgal1 retransformed strains with pGAL1 or pGAL1-SA was digested with HindIII. Hybridization of these strains with a 2.6-kb HindIII gal1 fragment resulted in H. jecorina QM9414 in a 2.6-kb band, in the Δgal1 strain in a 4.7-kb band, and in retransformed strains in a 4.7-kb band, as well as an additional band that represents either the gal1 or gal1-SA fragment. Integration of E. coli galK was verified by digestion with MluI, which cuts once within the galK coding region. For hybridization a 1.1-kb PCR fragment of galK amplified with EcGAL1fw and EcGAL1rv was used. Strains that showed two hybridizing bands, indicating the integration of one copy of E. coli galK, were used for further analysis. Digoxigenin-labeled probes for the Northern analyses of cbh1, cbh2, and 18 S rRNA with the respective sizes of 1.2 kb, 1 kb, and 300 bp were amplified from chromosomal DNA using the primers CBH1SF, CBH1SR, CBH2SF, CBH2SR, 18sRF, and 18sRR. In the case of gal7 the probe was amplified from a 1.1-kb cDNA fragment (9Seiboth B. Hofmann G. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using the primers gal7for and gal7rev. DNA and RNA preparation was described previously (8Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Standard methods were used for nucleic acid electrophoresis and blotting (18Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Target DNAs were detected with probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Northern analysis was performed with the digoxigenin nonradioactive system from Roche Applied Science. Strains were pregrown as described above, and after transfer, cultivation was continued for 12 h (d-galactose) or 20 h (lactose), respectively. Mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed extensively with cold sterile tap water, blotted dry with paper towels, and ground to a fine powder under liquid N2 with mortar and pestle. About 1 gram (wet weight) of mycelium was suspended in 3 ml of extraction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and homogenized by sonication 10 times for 30 s at 2 °C with intermittent 1-min cooling periods. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (average protein concentration 10-15 mg ml-1) was used as a cell extract for measuring intracellular galactokinase activity as described previously (19Fekete E. Karaffa L. Sandor E. Seiboth B. Biro S. Szentirmai A. Kubicek C.P. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 179: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Specific activities are reported as nanokatal/mg protein, which was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A Catalytically Inactive Galactokinase Is Unable to Induce Cellulase Formation by Lactose—The necessity of the gal1 gene for cellulase induction by lactose has been demonstrated (8Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test whether cellulase induction by GAL1 depends on a putative transcriptional inducer function, we constructed a strain that expressed a catalytically inactive version of GAL1 (GAL1-SA) in a Δgal1 background. This recombinant GAL1-SA lacks the two amino acids, Ser170 and Ala171, that are found in the conserved GLSSSAA motif of fungal galactokinases and are essential for their activity (4Platt A. Ross H.C. Hankin S. Reece R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3154-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Northern analysis confirmed that these strains had gained the ability to form a gal1 (-SA) transcript on d-galactose (Fig. 1A). In contrast to H. jecorina QM9414 or control strains that had been retransformed with the wild-type gal1, strains expressing the GAL1-SA fully lacked galactokinase activity and showed the same growth behavior as a Δgal1 strain on d-galactose (Fig. 1B), thus confirming that the deletion of the two amino acids leads to an inactive galactokinase. Consequently, these strains were tested for their ability to induce transcription of the two major cellulase genes, cbh1 and cbh2, by lactose. Fig. 1C shows that only strains expressing the wild-type gal1 fully restored cbh1 and cbh2 transcript formation, whereas strains expressing the GAL1-SA did not. From this we conclude that the presence of the SA amino acid doublet in the H. jecorina GAL1 is essential for galactokinase activity and induction of cellulases by lactose. The E. coli Galactokinase galK Can Rescue Cellulase Induction by Lactose—The loss of galactokinase activity in GAL1-SA mimics the H. jecorina Δgal1 phenotype with respect to the induction of cellulases by lactose. To test for whether it is solely the galactokinase activity that is essential for cellulase induction, we examined whether the expression of a bacterial galactokinase, which possesses no transcriptional inducer function, would be able to rescue the Δgal1 phenotype. Therefore we used the E. coli galK gene, which is able to complement the loss of the ScGAL1 gene but not the loss of ScGAL3 gene in S. cerevisiae (5Bhat P.J. Oh D. Hopper J.E. Genetics. 1990; 125: 281-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An H. jecorina Δgal1 strain was transformed with the E. coli galK gene under control of H. jecorina gal1 expression signals. The galK-transformed Δgal1 strains grew better than the Δgal1 strains on d-galactose but were not able to reach the level of the parental strain QM9414 or gal1 retransformed strains (Fig. 2A). Measurements of galactokinase activity in these galK-transformed strains showed that they produced somewhat lower enzyme activities (about 80-90%) compared with QM9414 and H. jecorina retransformed strains (Fig. 2B). However, when grown on lactose, galK-expressing strains regained their ability to fully induce cbh1 and cbh2 transcription (Fig. 2C), thus proving that the galactokinase activity was sufficient for the induction of cellulases by lactose. Gal1 Is Dispensable for Induction of gal7 by d-Galactose—The results discussed above have shown that galactokinase activity per se (but not a putative transcriptional inducer function of the GAL1 protein as found in the ScGal3 or KlGal1) is necessary for cellulase induction by lactose. Consequently, we investigated whether the induction of the Leloir genes would follow the same trend. Unlike in S. cerevisiae or K. lactis, only the H. jecorina gal1 and gal7 (but not gal10) genes are induced to still higher levels by the addition of d-galactose. Therefore we compared the transcriptional level of gal7 in our set of recombinant strains during growth on d-glucose and d-galactose. As seen from Fig. 3 induction by d-galactose led to an ∼3-fold increase in gal7 transcript levels compared with d-glucose, and this result was also obtained with the parental strain, a Δgal1 strain, and Δgal1 strains that expressed the E. coli GalK or the H. jecorina Gal1-SA. These results imply that the GAL1 protein as well as the galactokinase activity is dispensable for the basal as well as the inducible level of gal7 transcription. Galactitol Formation Is Dispensable for gal7 Induction by d-Galactose—d-Galactose can be catabolized by filamentous fungi such as H. jecorina or A. nidulans via a second pathway absent in the yeasts S. cerevisiae and K. lactis (Fig. 4A) (8Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Fekete E. Karaffa L. Sandor E. Banyai I. Seiboth B. Gyemant G. Sepsi A. Szentirmai A. Kubicek C.P. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The first step in this pathway is the reduction to galactitol by an aldose reductase, which in the case of H. jecorina was identified as the d-xylose reductase XYL1. Galactitol formation by the d-xylose reductase in this pathway has been shown to be responsible for the induction of extracellular β-galactosidase formation by d-galactose (13Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Szentirmai A. Seiboth B. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because neither GAL1 protein nor galactokinase activity is required for the induction of gal7 by d-galactose, we tested whether catabolism of d-galactose via this second pathway would also create the inducer of the Leloir pathway. To this end, we tested the induction of gal7 by d-galactose in a Δxyl1 strain. The results shown in Fig. 4B document that gal7 induction is not affected in this strain, implying that the alternative pathway and galactitol formation are not involved in induction. We concluded from these results that d-galactose induction of gal7 in H. jecorina occurs independently of a blockage in the first step of either of the two pathways for d-galactose catabolism and is independent of galactitol formation. The S. cerevisiae GAL regulon has become a paradigm for transcriptional control in lower eukaryotes and a model system for gene regulation (1Rubio-Texeira M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Schaffrath R. Breunig K.D. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2000; 30: 173-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Bhat P.J. Murthy T.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although its importance is uncontested, the present results illustrate that this regulatory network may be restricted to yeasts and not representative for other ascomycetous fungi in general. The present data, that the Leloir pathway is regulated in a GAL1-independent way in H. jecorina, are consistent with previous findings such as nonclustered genomic organization, lack of carbon catabolite repression by d-glucose, induction of gal7 and gal1 by l-arabinose, the existence of a second d-galactose catabolic pathway, and lack of a mutarotase (aldose 1-epimerase) domain in GAL10 (reviewed in Ref. 21Seiboth B. Pakdaman B.S. Hartl L. Kubicek C.P. Fungal Biol. Rev. 2007; 21: 42-48Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This and the fact that we were not able to detect orthologues of GAL4 in the genome sequences of H. jecorina and other filamentous fungi (N. crassa, Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium graminearum, A. nidulans) support the present data that the Leloir pathway is controlled in a different way. Although the present study has been performed with only one ascomycetous species from the Pyrenomycetes, we also have preliminary data from A. nidulans and Aspergillus niger that are fully consistent with those obtained for H. jecorina. Consequently, we conclude that the GAL regulon is a yeast-specific trait but cannot be used to explain d-galactose regulation in filamentous fungi. In a previous study we failed to detect the induced level of the gal7 transcript in a Δgal1 strain of H. jecorina; however, we used only a single time point and different conditions (8Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, here we showed that d-galactose clearly induces gal7 in the Δgal1 strain. Although this implies that d-galactose induces gal7 without being metabolized through one of the two pathways, the underlying mechanism is unclear. It could be d-galactose itself, either bound to its permease (a Gal2 orthologue is present in the H. jecorina genome; scaffold 10:1127812-1130067) or its intracellular steady state concentration. It should be noted that the constitutive expression of the Leloir pathway genes could create a reverse pathway of galactose 1-phosphate formation by the action of GAL10 (forming UDP-galactose from UDP-glucose) and its subsequent conversion to d-galactose 1-phosphate by GAL7. Therefore, we cannot exclude at the moment that the inducer could still be d-galactose 1-phosphate. In contrast to gal7 induction, galactokinase activity was required for the induction of the cellulase genes by lactose. This implies that the regulation of the Leloir pathway and that of cellulases are not linked, which is corroborated also by the findings that d-galactose does induce cellulase gene expression only at a low level at low growth rates (22Karaffa L. Fekete E. Gamauf C. Szentirmai A. Kubicek C.P. Seiboth B. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In theory, this would be consistent with a role for d-galactose 1-phosphate as an inducer of cellulase formation. However, such an assumption raises the question of why galactokinase activity promotes high cellulase gene expression during growth on lactose. As emphasized previously, a major difference between growth on d-galactose and on lactose is that the latter is accompanied by a stronger participation of the alternative, reductive d-galactose-degrading pathway (21Seiboth B. Pakdaman B.S. Hartl L. Kubicek C.P. Fungal Biol. Rev. 2007; 21: 42-48Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Karaffa L. Fekete E. Gamauf C. Szentirmai A. Kubicek C.P. Seiboth B. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Blockage of the latter in a Δxyl1 also strongly impairs cellulase induction on lactose, and the effect is not additive with that in a Δgal1, as seen in a Δgal1Δxyl1 strain. 2B. Seiboth, C. Gamauf, L. Hartl, M. Pail, and C. P. Kubicek, unpublished results. In other words, d-galactose 1-phosphate, as well as galactitol or catabolites thereof, is needed for high induction of cellulase formation. Whether they both cooperate in the induction themselves, or first need to be converted to another metabolite, which then acts as an inducer, is currently investigated. In S. cerevisiae the GAL genes are repressed by d-glucose, derepressed (noninduced) on other respiratory carbon sources, and highly induced (1000-fold) in the presence of d-galactose. In comparison with S. cerevisiae, the basal level of GAL gene expression is higher in other yeasts, e.g. K. lactis (23Zachariae W. Breunig K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3058-3066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In H. jecorina no repression by d-glucose was found, transcription on d-glucose occurred to a similar extent as on other noninducing carbon sources, and only a relatively weak induction (three to 4-fold) was found during growth on d-galactose. These differences in the transcriptional regulation raise the question of why the Leloir pathway is regulated in a different way by filamentous fungi. An explanation for this difference may be derived from the difference in the importance of d-galactose for fungal cell biology; d-galactose is an important component of the cell wall of many filamentous fungi and also of their glycosylated proteins, whereas it does not occur in the cell walls of S. cerevisiae and is only a minor component of its glycoproteins (24Kainuma M. Chiba Y. Takeuchi M. Jigami Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of d-galactose for the cell wall and glycoproteins is higher in other yeasts, including K. lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, than in S. cerevisiae (25Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 26Grün C.H. Hochstenbach F. Humbel B.M. Verkleij A.J. Sietsma J.H. Klis F.M. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Klis F.M. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems, therefore, especially important for filamentous fungi to metabolize d-galactose, which results from the normal turnover of the cell wall and glycoproteins, before it accumulates intracellularly and would interfere with the regulation of other pathways. This may also explain the constitutive expression of gal10, the gene product of which is needed for the production of the activated precursor UDP-galactose for the synthesis of the carbohydrates in cell wall components and glycoproteins. Although there may still be other reasons, we speculate that these differences gave rise to the evolution of the different patterns of d-galactose regulation in fungi.

https://openalex.org/W2081535578,"Mutations in fukutin-related protein (FKRP) give rise to mild and more severe forms of muscular dystrophy. FKRP patients have reduced glycosylation of the extracellular protein dystroglycan, and FKRP itself shows sequence similarity to glycosyltransferases, implicating FKRP in the processing of dystroglycan. However, FKRP localization is controversial, and no FKRP complexes are known, so any FKRP-dystroglycan link remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a novel FKRP localization in vivo; in mouse, both endogenous and recombinant FKRP are present at the sarcolemma. Biochemical analyses revealed that mouse muscle FKRP and dystroglycan co-enrich and co-fractionate, indicating that FKRP coexists with dystroglycan in the native dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Furthermore, FKRP sedimentation shifts with dystroglycan in disease models involving the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, and sarcolemmal FKRP immunofluorescence mirrors that of dystroglycan in muscular dystrophy mice, suggesting that FKRP localization may be mediated by dystroglycan. These data offer the first evidence of an FKRP complex in muscle and suggest that FKRP may influence the glycosylation status of dystroglycan from within the sarcolemmal dystrophin-glycoprotein complex."

In those bacteria that use lactose as a carbohydrate source, the disaccharide is usually either converted to glucose through the Leloir pathway (1Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and then metabolized by glycolysis (2Bissett D.L. Anderson R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 318-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or catabolized directly through the d-tagatose-6-phosphate pathway (3van Rooijen R.J. van Schalkwijk S. de Vos W.M. J. Biol.

In S. aureus, d-galactose and lactose are imported and metabolized by proteins encoded by the lactose operon, lacABCDFEG, the gene products of which have been shown to be inducible by the addition of either d-galactose or lactose (5Rosey E.L. Oskouian B. Stewart G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5992-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or by d-galactose-6-phosphate (6Morse M.L. Hill K.L. Egan J.B. Hengstenberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 2270-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the Lac operon was the first discovered example of a group of genes under the control of an operator region to which a repressor (LacR) binds (7Oskouian B. Stewart G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lactose is converted by transglycosylation into allolactose. This binds to the repressor, inhibits binding to the operator, and allows the transcription of mRNA for enzymes involved in d-galactose metabolism and transport across the membrane (8Jacob F. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 318-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). In the d-tagatose-6-phosphate pathway (encoded by lacABCD), the first step carried out by a d-galactose-6-phosphate isomerase encoded by lacAB (9Bissett D.L. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8745-8749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) converts d-galactose-6-phosphate into d-tagatose-6-phosphate. The second step is an ATP-dependent phosphorylation of d-tagatose-6-phosphate by d-tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (LacC) 3The abbreviations used are: LacC, d-tagatose-6-phosphate kinase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate or adenyl 5′-(yl iminodiphosphate); SeMet, selenomethionine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol. 3The abbreviations used are: LacC, d-tagatose-6-phosphate kinase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate or adenyl 5′-(yl iminodiphosphate); SeMet, selenomethionine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol. that yields d-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fig. 1). A divalent cation is required for this reaction with Mg2+ giving the optimum reaction rate (10Kotlarz D. Buc H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Finally d-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (LacD) cleaves d-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate to produce glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (5Rosey E.L. Oskouian B. Stewart G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5992-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Hall D.R. Bond C.S. Leonard G.A. Watt I Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22018-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pathway is essential for the survival of S. aureus in lactose-rich media such as milk, because if it does not function properly, d-galactose accumulates and bacterial growth is inhibited (12Bettenbrock K. Siebers U. Ehrenreich P. Alpert C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 225-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interfering with this pathway may therefore be a useful strategy for eradicating infection by S. aureus. Such infections can be important in breast-feeding mothers (13Stagno S. Reynolds D.W. Pass R.F. Alford C.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 1073-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and are common in livestock where, if not treated, they cause damage to milk-secreting tissues affecting both the quality and quantity of dairy products (14Grove T.M. Jones G.M. J. Dairy Sci. 1992; 75: 423-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Structural information concerning the enzymes in the d-tagatose-6-phosphate pathway will play a key role in elucidating a mechanism for its inhibition. Currently, such information is only available for LacD (11Hall D.R. Bond C.S. Leonard G.A. Watt I Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22018-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid sequence comparisons, LacC belongs to the pfkB family of carbohydrate kinases, which form a subset of the ribokinase superfamily. Members of this superfamily include ribokinase (RbsK), the minor isoform d-fructose-6-phosphate kinase (PfkB), 1-phosphofructokinase (FruK) and inosine-guanosine kinase (15Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of five members of the ribokinase superfamily including LacC from S. aureus (Fig. 2) shows regions of sequence conservation. Two of these (Motifs I and II) are conserved even in the sequence of human adenosine kinase (16Spychala J. Datta N.S. Takabayashi K. Datta M. Fox I.H. Gribbin T. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and represent the ribokinase superfamily signature. The crystal structure of Escherichia coli ribokinase indicates that these motifs are involved in substrate recognition, catalytic mechanism, and transition state stabilization (17Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We present the structure of LacC in two crystal forms. To solve the structure, it was necessary to incorporate two additional selenomethionine (SeMet) residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Fortuitously, the crystals present a number of different states of the enzyme, and the structures provide details of apoLacC, binary complexes with ADP, or the co-factor analogue adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP, selected because it is a relatively stable triphosphate), and a ternary complex with AMP-PNP and d-tagatose-6-phosphate. The structures illustrate aspects of co-factor and substrate recognition and suggest a mechanism for phosphoryl transfer dependent on conformational changes. We also identify a new region of amino acid sequence conservation specific to the pfkB subfamily of carbohydrate kinases. Cloning of LacC from S. aureus—The gene encoding tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacC) from S. aureus (GenBank™ accession number X14827) was amplified by PCR using the specific primers 5′-CAT ATG ATT TTG ACT TTG ACA TTA AAC C-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGA TCC TTA CAC CTC TAA AAC TTC-3′ (reverse). The forward primer carries an NdeI restriction site and the reverse primer a BamHI restriction site. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a pET15b expression vector (Novagen) and the resulting plasmid heat shock-transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene). For the L124M,L125M double mutant of S. aureus LacC, PCR primers containing the mutations (forward primer, 5′-TTT ATT AAA CAT TTT GAA CAA ATG ATG GAA AAA GTT GAA GCA GTT GCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGC AAC TGC TTC AAC TTT TTC CAT CAT TTG TTC AAA ATG TTT AAT AAA-3′ (mutations shown in bold)) were prepared using a QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), the PCR product cloned into a pET15b expression vector, and the resulting plasmid purified and sequenced to check the presence of the desired mutation. The plasmid was then heat shock-transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Recombinant LacC was produced following similar protocols to those employed for 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase (18Miallau L. Alphey M.S. Kemp L.E. Leonard G.A. McSweeney S.M. Hecht S. Bacher S. Eisenreich W. Rohdich F. Hunter W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9173-9178Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After cultivation, cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, containing 50 mm NaCl (buffer A). Cell lysis was performed with a cell disruptor at 4 °C, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The filtered supernatant was applied to a Hitrap metal-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The pure protein, eluted in buffer A and 150 mm imidazole, was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer A and then concentrated to 34 mg/ml. An aliquot of the pure apoform of the protein was injected onto a high resolution Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). The elution profile (data not shown) was compared with that of various protein size markers (obtained from Sigma Aldrich) and indicated that LacC forms a dimer in solution. To prepare the selenomethionyl derivatives of LacC and the L124M,L125M double mutant, BL21 (DE3) cells, heat shock-transformed with the pET15b/lacC S. aureus, were grown in 3 ml of LB supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C for 3 h. The culture was harvested and cells resuspended in 25 ml of M9 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and allowed to grow for another 15 h at 37 °C. These cells were used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 medium. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.56 at 37 °C, solid amino acid supplements were added to the culture as follows: 100 mg/liter l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, l-threonine, 50 mg/liter l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-valine and 60 mg/liter SeMet. Following a delay of 15 min to allow inhibition of methionine synthesis, gene expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the culture left overnight. The same purification protocol described for the native enzyme was then followed. The final concentration of the stock solution in buffer A was 17.0 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection—The wild-type protein gave crystals that diffracted only to low resolution (∼3.3 Å). We proceeded to make selenomethionyl-LacC for structural analyses and discovered that, for reasons not understood, the SeMet protein produced much more ordered crystals, therefore, we worked only with them. Block-shaped monoclinic crystals (crystal form I) of SeMet-LacC preincubated with 5 mm ATP were obtained from hanging drops consisting of 1.0 μl of the protein stock solution (8.5 mg/ml) and 1.0 μl of a reservoir solution comprising 13% PEG 20000 and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.8, diffused against 0.5 ml of the reservoir solution to which 0.2 μl of 20% w/v benzamidine hydrochloride was added. Cryoprotection was achieved by soaking crystals in the crystallization mother liquid supplemented with 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and data collected on ID14-EH2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Table 1). Diffraction images were integrated with MOSFLM software and intensities scaled and merged using SCALA software. These were then converted to structure factors and anomalous differences derived using the program TRUNCATE.TABLE 1Crystallographic statisticsCrystal form ICrystal form IIData collectionBeamlineID14-EH2 (ESRF)Wavelength (Å)0.933Space groupP21P212121Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 77.6, b = 96.4, c = 94.8a = 95.2, b = 97.1, c = 154.5β = 94.3°Resolution range (Å)32.8-2.050.0-2.0Rsym (%)7.4 (48.1)8.6 (62.4)Completeness (%)98.5 (98.5)99.8 (99.8)Multiplicity4.2 (4.3)10.9 (9.6)〈I 〉/ 〈σ(I) 〉12.9 (3.0)7.6 (1.2)Anomalous completeness (%)97.3 (96.3)99.6 (97.7)Refined model compositionMonomers/asymmetric unit44Protein residues1,2511,264Water molecules705875AMP-PNP03.5ADP20.5Tagatose-6-phosphate01Mg2+ ions05Average isotropic thermal parameters (Å2)Wilson B-value27.031.0Overall32.031.1Main chain/side chain26.8/29.9 (A)30.0/31.4 (A)27.4/30.8 (B)31.4/32.6 (B)30.4/33.1 (C)31.4/33.1 (C)36.6/39.3 (D)26.8/28.0 (D)Model quality indicatorsRwork/Rfree (%)19.8/24.719.0/23.4Root mean square deviation for bond lengths (Å)/bond angles (°)0.009/1.1290.009/1.23Estimated coordinate errors (Å)0.170.17Ramachandran analysis (%)Favoured regions93.093.5Additionally allowed regions6.66.2Generously allowed regions0.00.0Disallowed regions0.40.4 Open table in a new tab Data collected from crystal form I did not allow de novo structure solution. To achieve this, we produced crystals of the SeMet derivative of the L124M,L125M double mutant to enhance the anomalous dispersion effects due to selenium incorporation. Prior to crystallization, this protein was incubated with 5 mm substrate (d-tagatose-6-phosphate) and 5 mm AMP-PNP. Diffraction quality orthorhombic crystals (crystal form II) grew in the optimized crystallization condition 0.2 m magnesium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 10% PEG 8000, 15% PEG 550, 10 mm ATP. Cryoprotection was achieved by soaking crystals in 0.2 m magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 10% PEG 8000 supplemented with 10% glycerol, and 10% PEG 550. Diffraction data, measured on European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beam-line ID14-EH2, were integrated and scaled using XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) and intensities merged using SCALA software packages. Intensities were then converted to structure factors and anomalous differences derived using the program TRUNCATE. See Table 1 for a summary of statistics. Crystal Form II—The structure of crystal form II was solved using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion technique. The programs XPREP (20Bruker SMART, SAINT, SADABS, and XPREP Software Reference Manual. Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wisconsin2000Google Scholar) and SHELXD (21Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) were used to determine a substructure comprising 16 selenium sites from a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The solvent content and Matthews co-efficient are 50% and 2.5 Å3/Da, respectively. SHELXE (22Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar) was used to determine the correct enantiomorph of the substructure, and the program SHARP (23Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C.M.S. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) was used to calculate phase probability distributions. This resulted in experimental phases with an average figure of merit of 0.245 to dmin = 2.1 Å resolution. The experimental phases were improved using the program DM by density modification using a combination of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, histogram matching and solvent flattening. Initial non-crystallographic symmetry operators were obtained using the program PROFESS. The resulting phases coupled with the observed structure factors were then input into ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar), which placed 1144 glycine, valine, and serine residues in the asymmetric unit. The GuiSIDE module of CCP4i (25Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) then docked the correct side chains to these residues. Visual inspection of the electron density using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) identified model fragments belonging to each of the four monomers. Rounds of refinement using REFMAC5 interspersed with map inspections in O allowed a model of all four monomers in the asymmetric unit to be constructed. The careful placement of solvent molecules and active site ligands concluded the analysis with the refinement process being monitored using Rwork and Rfree (27Kleywegt G.J. Brünger A.T. Structure. 1996; 4: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It was clear early in the map interpretation that there was significant deviation from the expected non-crystallographic symmetry, and therefore all subunits were treated independently. The subunits are labeled A-D. Crystal Form I—Subunit A from crystal form II, stripped of ligands and solvent molecules, provided the search model for molecular replacement calculations to solve the structure of crystal form I. Molecular replacement was carried out using the program PHASER. The asymmetric unit of form I also presents four subunits, again labeled A-D, and each was positioned and then refined as a rigid body using REFMAC5 with data between 20.0 and 2.0 Å. The resulting electron density map provided a basis for automatic model building (ARP/wARP), and a model consisting of 992 glycine residues was built. Similar protocols to those applied in the analysis of form II concluded the structure determination. Summaries of the composition and geometry of the final models for both crystal forms along with refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The stereochemistry of the final models was assessed using PROCHECK. Ramachandran plots (not shown) indicate excellent main chain geometry. However, in all subunits, Asn-233 has Φ and Ψ angles, which place it in a disallowed region. This residue is well defined by the electron density, and the strained conformation is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the main chain amide and the carbonyl of Glu-217. The programs DM, MOSFLM, PHASER, PROFESS, PROCHECK, REFMAC5, SCALA, TRUNCATE and GuiSIDE are part of the CCP4 software package (28The Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Crystallographic Analyses—To solve the structure of LacC, we produced the SeMet variant of an L124M,L125M double mutant. This sample (crystal form II) provided an anomalous signal large enough to be exploited for structure determination. The choice of residues to mutate was guided by the knowledge that mutation of Leu to Met has little effect on protein structure (29Gassner N.C. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 57: 401-411Google Scholar), coupled with secondary structure predictions for LacC (data not shown) that indicated the residues concerned are located in an α-helix. Our crystal structure analyses proved this prediction to be correct. Subsequently, molecular replacement methods allowed us to determine the structure of crystal form I. Both crystal forms have been refined to high resolution (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of each form contains four subunits organized as a pair of homodimers. A New Motif for the pfkB Subfamily—Among the sequences aligned in Fig. 2, there is clearly a previously unreported third region of amino acid conservation common to fructose phosphate kinases and LacC. This conserved region, Motif III, is common to the pfkB subfamily of carbohydrate kinases but not to members of the ribokinase superfamily of proteins in general and has the sequence Ser-Gly-Ser-Leu-Pro-Xaa-Gly. Motif III may thus be assigned as being the characteristic signature of the pfkB family carbohydrate kinases, and as will be described, this motif is specifically involved in the binding of the tagatose substrate. The Overall Structure of LacC—The primary structure of S. aureus LacC consists of 310 amino acids. The tertiary structure of a LacC monomer is composed of two domains (Fig. 3a). A large α/β core domain comprises residues 1-7, 37-83, and 110-310 and presents a Rossmann-type fold in which the central β-sheet has been extended. Additional α-helices abut this central β-sheet along its entire length. A smaller lid domain protrudes from the α/β domain. It is constructed from residues 10-33 and 89-104 and comprises five β-strands, four of which are organized in a mixed β-sheet with strand order β2-β4-β7-β8. The fifth strand in this domain (β3) is part of the turn linking β2 and β4. Four polypeptide segments comprising residues 7-9, 34-37, 83-88, and 105-110 connect the two domains. The lack of secondary structure for these connecting elements is suggestive of a potential flexibility in the relative orientation of the two domains. The LacC monomer structure is closely related to other members of the ribokinase superfamily. The common structural feature in this superfamily is the large α/β domain, whereas the lid domain is less well conserved. Thus ribokinase (17Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), adenosine kinase (30Cook W.J. DeLucas L.J. Chattopadhyay D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and glucokinase (31Ito S. Fushinibu S. Yoshioka I. Koga S. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Structure. 2001; 9: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have lid domains, but 4-amino-5-hydromethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate kinase (32Cheng G. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and 4-methyl-5-β-hydroxy-ethylthiazole kinase (33Campobasso N. Mathews I.I. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7868-7877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) lack this feature. When both core and lid domains are present, their folds are conserved, but their relative orientations may differ. A superposition of the LacC monomers in the crystal forms described here (data not shown) confirms this conformational flexibility with subunits being found in either open (monomers AI BI,CI,AII,BII,DII), semi-closed (DI), or fully closed (CII) conformations (the subscript denotes crystal form). In common with other members of the ribokinase superfamily, LacC forms a dimer similar to that seen for E. coli ribokinase (Fig. 3b) (17Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Two monomers associate via interactions between their lid domains, which come together to form a β-barrel structure known as a β-clasp. The two β-sheets of the lid domains pack face to face and are rotated ∼90° with respect to each other. Each face of the β-barrel is made up of a five-stranded β-sheet; four strands from one monomer, the fifth from the second. β-clasp structures display closed and splayed corners. In the LacC dimers, the distances between the diagonally opposite closed and splayed corners are ∼17 and 25 Å, respectively. Monomer-monomer interactions within the interior of the barrel are plentiful and are both hydrophobic and polar in nature. The Active Site of LacC—Crystal form I was obtained by co-crystallization with ATP. However, only two molecules of ADP, bound to monomers BI and DI, were identified. Monomers AI and CI represent the structure of the apoform of the enzyme. That ADP, and not ATP, is found bound to monomers BI and DI should not be surprising. In the crystal structure of E. coli ribokinase (17Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), ADP is found in the co-factor binding site even though the protein was incubated with AMP-PNP (often used because of its stability) before crystallization. In that case, the authors speculated that AMP-PNP had hydrolyzed before binding to the protein. Given the much greater propensity of ATP to hydrolyze, it is likely that the same situation has occurred here. The ADP binding site is on the surface of the α/β domain constructed using residues from β11, the C terminus of β12 and the turn linking it to β13, the long loop linking β14 to α8, the N terminus of the latter, and the C terminus of α9. Aliphatic side chains form a binding pocket in which the adenine base is held in an anti-conformation stabilized only by hydrophobic interactions. The ribose O-2* interacts with the main chain carbonyl and ND2 of Asn-278. A well ordered water molecule mediates hydrogen bonds between the ribose O-3* and the amide and carbonyl groups of Gly-224 and Gly-227. The ribose O-3* atom also accepts a hydrogen bond from Asn-278 ND2. The α-phosphate group interacts with Ser-222 OG and via a water molecule with Lys-38 NZ. The O-3A link between α- and β-phosphate groups accepts a hydrogen bond from the main chain amide of Gly-253. The β-phosphate forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of Pro-249 (we assume that a phosphate O is protonated), the amide group of Gly-253, and (via water molecules) the amide groups of Gly-251 and Asp-254. Crystal form II, from which the first experimental phases were actually determined, was obtained from protein incubated with 5 mm substrate (d-tagatose-6-phosphate) and a co-factor analogue (AMP-PNP). Here, positive difference electron density (mFo - DFc, αcalc) was observed in the active sites of all four monomers of the asymmetric unit. In the active sites of subunits AII,BII, and DII, this was assigned as AMP-PNP with a hydrated Mg2+ ion binding between the β- and γ-phosphate. In monomer CII, two different moieties were bound in the active site. One is clearly tagatose-6-phosphate (Fig. 4a, right). The OMIT (mFo - DFc, αcalc) difference density (Fig. 4a, left) indicated that an initial model for the second moiety should be AMP-PNP with two hydrated cations bound to its phosphate tail. However, such a model resulted in significant negative difference density centered on the γ-phosphate group of the AMP-PNP, an indication that this model was not correct. Clean difference density maps were eventually obtained in the active site of subunit CII by modeling AMP-PNP and ADP, each with half occupancy, coupled with the presence of two fully occupied hydrated cations. One of the two cations binds between the α- and β-phosphates of AMP-PNP and (when present) ADP. The second cation is bound between the β- and γ-phosphates of AMP-PNP or to the β-phosphate group of ADP. Further discussion of the structure of crystal form II of LacC assumes the presence of a fully occupied AMP-PNP. Fig. 4b shows where the ligands bind to the LacC subunit, and Fig. 5 shows the key interactions in the active site that will be discussed.FIGURE 5The active site of LacC.

https://openalex.org/W2087278553,"Flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) and exonuclease 1 (Exo1) have sequence homology and similar nuclease capabilities. Both function in multiple pathways of DNA metabolism, but appear to have distinct in vivo nucleic acid substrates, and therefore distinct metabolic roles. When combined with Apc1638N, Fen1 promotes tumor progression. Because of functional similarity to Fen1, and because Exo1 is involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) by interaction with Msh2 and Mlh1, genes that cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), we investigated the possibility that Exo1 might also act as a modifier to Apc1638N. We present evidence that mice with combined mutations in Apc1638N and Exo1 and Apc1638N, Exo1 and Fen1 genes show moderate increased tumor incidence and multiplicity in comparison to Apc1638N siblings, implying a low penetrance role for Exo1 in early gastrointestinal (GI) tumorigenesis. Despite a decrease in median survival (10 months) in Apc1638N Exo1 mice, their tumors do not progress any more rapidly than those of Apc1638N. Instead these animals die from infections that are the result of impaired immune response. Apc1638N Exo1 Fen1 mice survive longer (18 months), and therefore appear relatively immune competent. They die of invasive GI tumors that display microsatellite instability (MSI). Our results show that Exo1 has a modest tumor suppressor function."

We report here that E2F-1 acts as a transcriptional regulator of MKP-2 (MAPK phosphatase-2), a dual specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP4) with stringent substrate specificity for MAPKs. We show that E2F-1 is required for the cellular apoptotic response to oxidative damage. MKP-2 is greatly increased following oxidative stress, and E2F-1 is necessary for that induction. We found that E2F-1 is physically associated with the MKP-2 promoter and can transactivate the promoter of the MKP-2 gene. Specifically, E2F-1 binds to a perfect palindromic motif in the MKP-2 promoter. Finally, we show that this E2F-1/MKP-2 pathway mediates apoptosis under oxidative stress and that MKP-2 suppresses tumor formation in nude mice. Our findings demonstrate that E2F-1 is a transcriptional activator of MKP-2 and that MKP-2 is an essential cell death mediator in the E2F-1 pathway. Characterization of MKP-2 as a cell death mediator may lead to the development of new strategies for cancer treatment. Transcription factor E2F-1 mediates apoptosis and suppresses tumorigenesis.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; HMECs, human mammary epithelial cells; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling. such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals are highly relevant to multiple biological processes. High levels of oxidative stress cause damage to multiple cellular components, including DNA, lipid membranes, and protein (1Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar, 2Janssen Y.M. Van Houten B. Borm P.J. Mossman B.T. Lab. Investig. 1993; 69: 261-274PubMed Google Scholar). ROS play a key role in disease initiation and progression. Cells under oxidative stress initiate protective responses for repair or elimination of damaged cells (3Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ROS are involved in normal cellular processes such as activation of several growth factor receptors. Generation of hydrogen peroxide is required for platelet-derived growth factor signal transduction (4Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Oxidative species are also involved in the regulation of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases that connect with a variety of signal transduction networks (5Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki Y. Ohsugi K. Ono Y.

Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Thus, oxidative species might be intermediates that widely influence the cellular balance between protein kinases and phosphatases (8Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). It has been reported that oxidative stress causes cell death by apoptosis in some lymphocyte cell lines (9Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). It is known that ROS are downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis (10Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Our previous data show that oxidative stress by H2O2 is a damage signal for the activation of the p53 pathway that leads to apoptosis (11Yin Y. Terauchi T. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that ROS may serve both as damage signals that initiate cellular responses and as intermediates for signal transduction important for survival of organisms. Thus, identification of important components involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress may reveal targets for chemotherapeutic strategies. The E2F family includes eight distinct but closely related transcription factors (E2F-1-8) that regulate cell proliferation, development, and apoptosis (13Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 14Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bell L.A. Ryan K.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The best known member of the E2F family is E2F-1 (16Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). E2F-1 binds to variants of the consensus sequence TTTCGCGC (17Yee A.S. Reichel R. Kovesdi I. Nevins J.R.

This consensus sequence is found in the promoters of a number of genes important for cell cycle progression, including c-myc, cdc2, cdc6, dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, and the E2F-1 gene itself (21Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 22Neuman E. Flemington E.K. Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell.

E2F-1 plays an important role in both cell cycle regulation (24Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (25Denchi E.L. Helin K. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It promotes entry into S phase and stimulates cell cycle progression (26Zhu L. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Starz M.A. Moberg K.H. Lees J.A. Dyson N. Harlow E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). E2F-1 function is regulated by the retinoblastoma protein, which binds to the transactivation domain of E2F-1 and suppresses E2F-1-mediated transcriptional activation (27Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 28Weinberg R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 758: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). E2F-1 acts as a cell death mediator in certain settings and functions as a tumor suppressor in a tissue-specific manner (29Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J.

Genet. 1998; 18: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Overexpression of E2F-1 can trigger apoptosis (32Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 33Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that E2F-1 is involved in cell death control. E2F-1 was initially considered to be an oncogene until 1996, when two reports were published on E2F-1 knock-out mice. Mice lacking E2F-1 develop a broad spectrum of tumors (30Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Also, E2F-1-deficient mice exhibit defects in apoptosis and aberrant cell proliferation in some tissues (35Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrated that E2F-1 is a tumor suppressor. Thus, E2F-1 has two opposing properties: it can stimulate cell cycle progression as an oncogene, or it can promote apoptosis and suppress tumorigenesis as a tumor suppressor gene. The mechanisms by which E2F-1 inhibits tumor progression are unknown. It is commonly believed that E2F-1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene through its induction of apoptosis in p53-dependent and p53-independent manners (36Pan H. Griep A.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2157-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). One current focus is on its downstream effectors that signal apoptosis. The most significant target identified so far for E2F-1 function in apoptosis is the p53 homolog p73, which is a tumor suppressor gene (37Oren M. Cell. 1997; 90: 829-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). It was reported that E2F-1 regulates transcription of p73, which can induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 (39Irwin M. Marin M.C. Philips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin W.G.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 40Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irwin M. Kaelin W.G.J. Dowdy S.F. Nature. 2000; 407: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Also, the p14ARF tumor suppressor is a transcriptional target for E2F-1 in cell death and tumor suppression (41Zhu J.W. DeRyckere D. Li F.X. Wan Y.Y. DeGregori J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 829-838PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In this work, we found that E2F-1 is essential for the cellular response to oxidative stress. We further identified MKP-2 (MAPK phosphatase-2) as a transcriptional target of E2F-1 in this process. MAPKs are key elements in mediating signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus (43Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 44Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The MAPK cascade is one of the most predominant pathways for cell growth and proliferation (44Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 45Qi M. Elion E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3569-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 46Reddy K.B. Nabha S.M. Atanaskova N. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). MAPKs can be grouped into three families: ERK, JNK, and p38 (47Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The activity of MAPKs is regulated by dual phosphorylation of their tyrosine and threonine residues. MAPKs are activated upon dual phosphorylation by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which in turn is activated by the Ras/Raf pathway (48Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon activation, MAPKs, including ERK1 and ERK2, translocate into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate transduction targets, including transcription factors (49Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). In contrast, MAPKs are inactivated upon dephosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues by MAPK phosphatases (50Dickinson R.J. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 51Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (reviews3009)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). MKP-2 is a dual threonine/tyrosine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPKs (54Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). MKP-2 (or HVH2) selectively dephosphorylates the MAPK. Recombinant MKP-2/HVH2 phosphatase exhibits a high substrate specificity toward activated ERK and dephosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues of activated ERK1 and ERK2 (55Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby MKP-2 is regulated and its role during tumorigenesis are largely unknown. We found that MKP-2 is transcriptionally regulated by E2F-1. Expression of MKP-2 is increased following oxidative stress, which causes apoptosis in an E2F-1-dependent manner. However, MKP-2 is not responsive to γ-irradiation, which causes DNA damage and leads to cell cycle arrest. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism whereby E2F-1 regulates the expression of MKP-2. Further-more, we found that MKP-2 is an essential target of E2F-1 function in signaling apoptosis following oxidative stress. Our data reveal a molecular link between E2F-1 and the MAPK cascade, which provides insight into the mechanism whereby E2F-1 controls cell death. Cell Lines, Construction of MKP-2 Promoter-Reporters, MKP-2 Expression, and MKP-2 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Vectors—E2F-1+/+ and E2F-1-/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from E2F-1+/+ and E2F-1-/- embryos (30Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Mkp-2+/+ and Mkp-2-/- MEFs were purchased from ArtisOptimus Inc. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells were from American Type Culture Collection. Human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., and were cultured with mammary epithelium basal medium. The MKP-2 promoter was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using the following primers. 5′-GAGCGCGGAGGAGCATTAATA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAACTTGGTCCTCAAGGGCTC-3′(reverse). The PCR product was subcloned into a pT-A vector (Clontech) for sequencing. The promoter was ligated into the pGL3-Basic reporter (Promega), resulting in pGL3/MKP-2-luc. pGL3/MKP-2mt-luc was generated by changing the palindromic sequence from 5′-CTGGCGCCAG-3′ to 5′-CGGGCGCCAG-3′ using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The human MKP-2 expression vector was constructed from a selectable constitutive expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The coding region of human MKP-2 was amplified from a human cDNA library by PCR using the following primers: MKP-2-20up1, 5′-GCGTCCCTTCTTAGCTCTCG-3′ (forward); and MKP-2-20dn1, 5′-TGGGAGCCAGCTCTGGTTCT-3′ (reverse). The resulting PCR product (1321 bp) was ligated into pT-Adv and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 at HindIII and XhoI sites, resulting in pcDNA3/MKP-2. An E2F-1 siRNA expression vector (U6/siE2F-1) was constructed as described previously (56Shen W.H. Yin Y. Broussard S.R. McCusker R.H. Freund G.G. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7438-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to generate the MKP-2 siRNA vector: 5′-CACCGACTACCCCGGACCCTTCAAGAGAGGGTCCGGGGTAGTCGGTGTTTTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTAAAAAACACCGACTACCCCGGACCCTCTCTTGAAGGGTCCGGGGTAGTCGGTGGGCC-3′ (reverse). A random sequence from human intracellular interleukin-1 receptor agonist noncoding sequence was ligated into U6 as a scrambled control. The constructs were sequenced to confirm that the designed fragments were introduced in-frame into vectors. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into the designed sites of ApaI and EcoRI in the pSilencer 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector (Ambion, Inc.). Gene Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase reporters were transfected into MCF-7 cells along with a pCMV-β-gal reporter plasmid to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were processed using a Dual-Light kit (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with a Berthold Autolumat LB953 rack luminometer. Luciferase values were normalized against β-galactosidase activity. RNA Isolation and Northern and Western Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from growing cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern analysis, RNA was run on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a HN membrane using a TurboBlotter system (Schleicher & Schüll). DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). The membrane was hybridized with labeled DNA probes in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 2 h and developed for autoradiography. For Western blotting, growing cells were lysed in cold Nonidet P-40 buffer with protease/phosphatase inhibitors. The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described (57Maiyar A.C. Huang A.J. Phu P.T. Cha H.H. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human GST-E2F-1 fusion protein was produced from growing Escherichia coli BL21 cells transfected with pGEX-2T-E2F-1 and induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (58Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The E2F-1 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was conducted as described previously (12Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled probes were mixed with 0.5 μg of purified recombinant GST-E2F-1 fusion protein in 20 μl of DNA binding reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% Ficoll 400, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg of poly(dI-dC). For supershift detection, an anti-E2F-1 monoclonal anti-body (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was included in reactions. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, and exposed for autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Growing cells were harvested and processed for ChIP using the anti-E2F-1 antibody and a ChIP assay kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and chromatin was sonicated to 500-2000-bp fragments. Precleared lysates were incubated with the anti-E2F-1 monoclonal antibody. The chromatin samples without addition of the antibody were used as negative controls, and genomic DNA was used as a positive control for PCR (input). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A beads; protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by boiling for 30 min in 100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 4% SDS; and DNA was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The precipitated MKP-2 promoter was amplified by PCR using the primers spanning the potential E2F-1-binding site. E2F-1 Is Necessary for the Cellular Response to Oxidative Stress—A wide variety of mutagenic agents are toxic to cells, but the mechanisms of toxicity can vary. Some agents irreversibly induce growth arrest, whereas others induce cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. For example, γ-radiation causes cell cycle arrest in MEFs (59Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar, 60Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), whereas oxidative stress induces cell death by apoptosis in the same cells (61Yin Y. Solomon G. Deng C. Barrett J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that p53 is required for the cellular response to oxidative stress, leading to cell death (11Yin Y. Terauchi T. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because E2F-1 plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis and because E2F-1 cooperates with p53 in mediating apoptosis in some cell types (32Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 33Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), it is possible that E2F-1 is also involved in the cellular defense against oxidative damage. To determine whether E2F-1 is necessary for the cellular response to oxidative stress, we chose an E2F-1 knock-out system (E2F-1+/+ and E2F-1-/- MEFs) and tested the susceptibility of these cells to oxidative damage. As shown in Fig. 1A, E2F-1+/+ MEFs were extremely sensitive to H2O2 treatment. Most E2F-1+/+ MEFs were rapidly killed by H2O2. In contrast, E2F-1-/- MEFs were highly resistant to cell killing by H2O2. To determine the nature of oxidative cell death, we performed a TUNEL assay to identify apoptotic cells in MEF population. As shown in Fig. 1B, the majority of E2F-1+/+ MEFs were killed under oxidative stress through typical apoptosis because the apoptotic cells were stained as double-colored cells by the TUNEL assay (panel a versus panel b). In contrast, a much lower percentage of E2F-1-/- MEFs was stained as apoptotic cells following oxidative damage by H2O2 (panel c versus panel d). These data suggest that E2F-1 is necessary for the cellular response to cell death induction following oxidative stress. To determine whether E2F-1 mediates cell death by oxidative damage, we established a cell system in which E2F-1 is ectopically expressed. We introduced the cytomegalovirus-driven human E2F-1 expression vector (pCMV/E2F-1) into a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. We obtained stable clones expressing ectopic E2F-1 through G418 selection and confirmed the expression of E2F-1 protein by immunoblotting using the anti-E2F-1 antibody. These clones were designated as MCF-7/E2F-1, followed by clone number, such as MCF-7/E2F-1-C3, -C5, and -C8 (Fig. 1C). To test whether these cells expressing E2F-1 are sensitive to oxidative damage, we treated these clones and MCF-7/pCMV cells as a control with H2O2 for different times. As shown in Fig. 1D, although MCF-7/pCMV cells were resistant to cell killing by H2O2, MCF-7/E2F-1 cells were highly susceptible to treatment with H2O2. The apoptotic process was extensive, and most cells were killed within 24 h of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1D). To avoid the interference of clonal variation, we also obtained three clones of MCF-7/pcDNA3 cells and did not find significantly different sensitivity of these cell clones to H2O2-induced cell death compared with parental MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that E2F-1 effectively mediates cell death following oxidative damage. Transcriptional Regulation of MKP-2 by E2F-1 in Response to Oxidative Stress—Transcription factors execute their function by regulating downstream target genes. To identify potential targets of E2F-1 in cell death induction, we utilized GeneChip technology (62Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) to analyze the gene expression profiles in MEFs with or without E2F-1 (E2F-1+/+ and E2F-1-/- MEFs) under normal and stress conditions. MKP-2 was among the genes responsive to oxidative stress in E2F-1+/+ MEFs, but not in E2F-1-/- MEFs (data not shown). To confirm the data from the microarray readout, we performed Northern and Western analyses of MKP-2 expression in the same cell model. E2F-1+/+ and E2F-1-/- MEFs were either exposed to γ-irradiation, which causes cell cycle arrest at G1 (60Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), or treated with H2O2, which induces cell death by apoptosis (61Yin Y. Solomon G. Deng C. Barrett J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), MKP-2 was low in E2F-1+/+ MEFs and not induced by γ-irradiation (lanes 1 and 2). However, MKP-2 was markedly increased following oxidative damage by H2O2 (lane 3 versus lane 1). Furthermore, the transcriptional response of MKP-2 to oxidative damage was ablated in E2F-1-/- MEFs (lane 6 versus lane 3). These observations suggest that MKP-2 is inducible by oxidative stress and that E2F-1 is required for induction of MKP-2 in response to oxidative damage. It is well known that MAPK family members, including ERK, JNK, and p38, are involved in apoptosis (63Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Because MKP-2 is an inhibitor of MAPKs, it is possible that E2F-1 can also influence these MAPKs following oxidative stress. Thus, we examined the relationship between the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 and the status of E2F-1. As shown in Fig. 2C, the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was largely reduced in E2F-1+/+ MEFs upon oxidative damage (lane 2) but remained unchanged in E2F-1-/- MEFs upon the same treatment (lane 4). Although p38 was slightly dephosphorylated following oxidative damage (Fig. 2D, lane 2), this change was independent of E2F-1 status because p38 was dephosphorylated in both E2F-1+/+ and E2F-1-/- MEFs (lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, JNK was phosphorylated following oxidative damage in an E2F-1-independent manner (middle panel). These results indicate that ERK1, but not p38 and JNK, is the major target of E2F-1 signaling. It has been reported that MKP-2 selectively dephosphorylates the MAPK ERK1/2 (55Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and our data are consistent with this observation. To determine whether E2F-1 regulates the expression of MKP-2 and suppresses the activity of the MAPK ERK1/2, we chose the MCF-7/E2F-1 cell system described for Fig. 1C. As shown in Fig. 2E, the MKP-2 transcript was low in MCF-7/pCMV cells (lane 1). However, MKP-2 transcription was increased in MCF-7/E2F-1-C3, -C5, and -C8 (lanes 2-4). Correspondingly, the levels of MKP-2 protein were also increased by E2F-1 (Fig. 2F, lanes 2-4). These results suggest that MKP-2 transcription is up-regulated by E2F-1 in MCF-7 cells. MKP-2 can inactivate ERK1 and ERK2 kinase activity through dephosphorylation o"

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this action of JNK remain elusive. On the contrary, there has been increasing evidence for a negative correlation of JNK activity with MDR1 expression under normoxic conditions. Here, we present evidence that the JNK pathway represses MDR1 expression in normoxia and activates MDR1 expression in hypoxia. Our data show that JNK pathway-induced MDR1 repression in normoxia is mediated by increased c-Jun binding to activator protein 1 site, located in the MDR1 promoter, and requires the activity of histone deacetylase 5. In contrast, JNK pathway-induced MDR1 activation in hypoxia is independent of the activator protein 1 site. Rather, this action is dependent on increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) binding to the hypoxia response element in the MDR1 promoter, which is promoted by the interaction of HIF1α with c-Jun in the nucleus and requires the activity of the p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) coactivator.

Tissue hypoxia, a decrease in local oxygen tension (PO2), is a common feature of developing tumors. Tumor cells develop various adaptive programs in response to hypoxia, including up-regulation of specific genes that promote tumor survival and growth (1Harris A.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4287) Google Scholar). The key factor that regulates cellular adaptation to low PO2 is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), 2The abbreviations used are: HIF1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; MDR, multidrug resistance; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; AP1, activator protein 1; HRE, hypoxia response element; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase kinase; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA. a heterodimer comprising α- and β-subunits (2Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Although HIF1α protein is stable only in hypoxia and rapidly degraded in normoxia, HIF1β protein level is not altered by PO2. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1α translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with HIF1β to form HIF1, which then binds to the hypoxia response elements (HREs) of target genes and activates their transcription (2Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, encoding the transmembrane drug transporter P-glycoprotein, is induced in response to hypoxia (3Comerford K.M. Wallace T.J. Karhausen J. Louis N.A. Montalto M.C.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 503-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may contribute to the observed chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer cells under hypoxic conditions (5Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia-induced MDR1 expression is mediated by the binding of HIF1 to the HRE located in the MDR1 promoter (3Comerford K.M. Wallace T.J. Karhausen J. Louis N.A. Montalto M.C. Colgan S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3387-3394PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, has been implicated in hypoxia-induced MDR1 expression (6Comerford K.M. Cummins E.P. Taylor C.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol.

However, it remains to be elucidated how JNK activation contributes to MDR1 expression in hypoxia. On the other hand, there is a growing body of evidence supporting a negative correlation of JNK activity with MDR1 expression under normoxic conditions (9Kang C.D. Ahn B.K. Jeong C.S. Kim K.W.

Liu M. Aneja R. Chandra R. Lage H. Joshi H.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present whether the discrepancy between these studies results from the use of different cell lines or the variation in experimental protocols or whether it simply reflects different roles for JNK in regulating MDR1 gene expression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In this study, our data demonstrate for the first time that the JNK pathway plays PO2-dependent different roles in regulating MDR1 expression, i.e. down-regulation of MDR1 expression in normoxia and up-regulation of MDR1 expression in hypoxia. Moreover, our data provide important mechanistic insights into the above mentioned PO2-dependent differential regulation of MDR1 expression by the JNK pathway. Cells, Plasmids, and Adenoviruses—HOP62 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For hypoxic exposure, cells were placed in an airtight incubator chamber flushed with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Plasmids and adenoviruses encoding JNK, c-Jun, and other proteins used in this study were prepared as described previously (11Zhou J. Liu M. Aneja R. Chandra R. Lage H. Joshi H.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Zhou J. Gupta K. Yao J. Ye K. Panda D. Giannakakou P. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39777-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis, Immunocomplex Kinase Assay, and Relevant Antibodies—Proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10 μg of total protein was loaded per lane), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and exposed to primary and secondary antibodies, and specific proteins were then visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent as described (13Liu M. Aneja R. Liu C. Sun L. Gao J. Wang H. Dong J.T. Sarli V. Giannis A. Joshi H.C. Zhou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18090-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). JNK activity was measured using the immunocomplex JNK kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). Antibodies against P-glycoprotein (1:500 dilution), JNK (1:2000 dilution), c-Jun (1:1000 dilution), phosphorylated c-Jun (1:1000 dilution), and histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) (1:500) were obtained from Calbiochem; HIF1α antibody (1:500 dilution) was from BD Transduction Laboratories; and β-actin antibody (1:5000 dilution) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (both at a 1:2500 dilution) were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate as described (14Chen C. Sun X. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Sethi P. Cheng X. Zhou J. Ling J. Simons J.W. Lingrel J.B. Dong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41553-41561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Ct values in log linear range representing the detection threshold values were used for quantification by the ΔΔCt method, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control to normalize the reading for MDR1 in each sample. Luciferase Reporter Assay—MDR1 promoter activity was measured by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega), with the MDR1 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pMDR1-Luc and the thymidine kinase-driven Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK. In the pMDR1-Luc plasmid, the MDR1 promoter (from –189 to +133 relative to the major site of transcriptional initiation) was used to drive the firefly luciferase gene as described (15Strauss B.E. Haas M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To minimize experimental variability caused by differences in cell viability and transfection efficiency, the measured firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the thymidine kinase-driven Renilla luciferase activity. Transcription Factor Binding Assay—Nuclear extracts, prepared as described (12Zhou J. Gupta K. Yao J. Ye K. Panda D. Giannakakou P. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39777-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), were incubated in 96-well plates with immobilized oligonucleotide sequences that contain the activator protein 1 (AP1) site or HRE in the MDR1 promoter. The plates were incubated in succession with c-Jun or HIF1α antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and SigmaFast peroxidase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm was then measured to quantify c-Jun/AP1 site and HIF1/HRE binding activities. JNK Represses MDR1 Expression in Normoxia and Activates MDR1 Expression in Hypoxia—By Western blot analysis, we found that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of JNK in HOP62 cells reduced P-glycoprotein level in normoxia but enhanced P-glycoprotein level in hypoxia, and hypoxia alone also induced a modest increase in P-glycoprotein level (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantitative real time RT-PCR revealed a similar PO2-dependent regulatory effect of JNK on MDR1 mRNA expression, i.e. down-regulation of MDR1 expression in normoxia and up-regulation of MDR1 expression in hypoxia (Fig. 1C). Hypoxia alone significantly increased MDR1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1C) despite its modest effect on the P-glycoprotein level. Luciferase reporter assay using the MDR1 promoter further showed that transfection of cells with JNK reduced MDR1 promoter activity in normoxia and enhanced MDR1 promoter activity in hypoxia (Fig. 1D). There was also a dramatic increase in MDR1 promoter activity in response to hypoxia alone (Fig. 1D). Together these data demonstrate that JNK regulates MDR1 gene expression negatively in normoxia and positively in hypoxia, in addition to documenting the previous finding that hypoxia is able to activate MDR1 expression (3Comerford K.M. Wallace T.J. Karhausen J. Louis N.A. Montalto M.C. Colgan S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3387-3394PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wartenberg M. Ling F.C. Muschen M. Klein F. Acker H. Gassmann M. Petrat K. Putz V. Hescheler J. Sauer H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 503-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Comerford K.M. Cummins E.P. Taylor C.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To examine whether endogenous JNK also plays distinct roles in regulating MDR1 expression in normoxia and hypoxia, we antagonized the expression of endogenous JNK using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and then examined the P-glycoprotein level. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown of JNK was able to induce P-glycoprotein expression in normoxia and decrease P-glycoprotein expression in hypoxia (Fig. 1, E and F). Similarly, knockdown of JNK by siRNA could increase MDR1 mRNA expression and promoter activity in normoxia and decrease MDR1 mRNA expression and promoter activity in hypoxia (data not shown). Thus, endogenous JNK also possesses the ability to differentially regulate MDR1 expression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Regulation of MDR1 Expression by JNK Is Dependent on JNK Activity and c-Jun in Both Normoxia and Hypoxia—JNK activation is known to contribute to hypoxia-induced MDR1 expression (6Comerford K.M. Cummins E.P. Taylor C.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8Ledoux S. Yang R. Friedlander G. Laouari D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7284-7290PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we found a time-dependent increase of JNK activity in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2, A and B). Suppression of JNK activity by a specific inhibitor, SP600125, completely abrogated hypoxia-induced MDR1 expression and promoter activity (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Moreover, SP600125 completely inhibited the ability of JNK to repress MDR1 in normoxia and activated MDR1 in hypoxia (Fig. 2C and data not shown), indicating a critical requirement of JNK activity for its regulation of MDR1 expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We next investigated whether JNK exerts its PO2-dependent regulatory effect on MDR1 expression through its substrate, the c-Jun transcription factor. As shown in Fig. 2D, knockdown of c-Jun expression using specific siRNA blocked hypoxia-induced MDR1 promoter activity. In addition, JNK-induced repression of MDR1 in normoxia and activation of MDR1 in hypoxia were both abolished by c-Jun siRNA (Fig. 2D). Transfection of cells with c-Jun also exhibited a PO2-dependent regulatory effect on MDR1 promoter activity (Fig. 2E) similar to that observed for transfection with JNK. Thus, c-Jun acts as a pivotal mediator for JNK to regulate MDR1 expression in both normoxia and hypoxia. We also checked the effects of other components of the JNK pathway, including the upstream kinase MKK4 and upstream kinase kinase MEKK1 (16Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar), on MDR1 gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2E, both MKK4 and MEKK1 could decrease MDR1 promoter activity in normoxia and increase MDR1 promoter activity in hypoxia. In contrast, MKK3 and MEKK2, two molecules not critically involved in the JNK pathway (16Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar), did not have obvious effects on MDR1 promoter activity (Fig. 2E). We also found that MKK4 and MEKK1, but not MKK3 and MEKK2, were able to decrease MDR1 mRNA expression in normoxia and increase MDR1 mRNA expression in hypoxia (data not shown). These results indicate that the PO2-dependent differential regulation of MDR1 expression represents a specific property of the JNK pathway. Distinct Roles for the AP1 Site and HRE in the MDR1 Promoter in Mediating PO2-dependent Differential Regulation of MDR1 Expression by the JNK Pathway—The MDR1 promoter is known to harbor multiple binding elements, including a negative binding site for the heterodimeric transcription factor AP1 (notably c-Jun/c-Fos), located from –119 to –113 relative to the major transcription start site, and a functional HRE (3Comerford K.M. Wallace T.J. Karhausen J. Louis N.A. Montalto M.C. Colgan S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3387-3394PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17432-17436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ikeguchi M. Teeter L.D. Eckersberg T. Ganapathi R. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the regulatory effect of the JNK pathway on MDR1 expression is mediated by the alteration of c-Jun binding to the AP1 site. As shown in Fig. 3A, in normoxia both JNK and c-Jun adenoviruses significantly increased c-Jun binding to the AP1 site, whereas in hypoxia neither of them changed the binding of c-Jun to the AP1 site. To further investigate the role for the AP1 site, we performed luciferase reporter assay using an MDR1 promoter harboring mutations in the AP1 site. We found that JNK/c-Jun-induced reduction of MDR1 promoter activity in normoxia was completely abrogated by AP1 site mutations; however, JNK/c-Jun-induced enhancement of MDR1 promoter activity in hypoxia was not obviously affected (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that JNK pathway-induced MDR1 down-regulation in normoxia is mediated by increased c-Jun binding to the AP1 site, whereas JNK pathway-induced MDR1 up-regulation in hypoxia is independent of the AP1 site. We then investigated the effects of JNK/c-Jun overexpression on HIF1 binding to the HRE in the MDR1 promoter. We found that JNK and c-Jun adenoviruses did not alter HIF1/HRE binding in normoxia (Fig. 3C). Hypoxia alone significantly increased HIF1/HRE binding, which was further enhanced by overexpression of JNK or c-Jun (Fig. 3C). Luciferase reporter assay using an MDR1 promoter harboring mutations in the HRE revealed that JNK/c-Jun-induced enhancement of MDR1 promoter activity in hypoxia was entirely blocked by HRE mutations (Fig. 3D). In contrast, JNK/c-Jun-induced reduction of MDR1 promoter activity in normoxia was not affected by HRE mutations (Fig. 3D). These data thus indicate that the JNK pathway-induced MDR1 up-regulation in hypoxia is mediated by increased binding of HIF1 to the HRE in MDR1 promoter, but the JNK pathway-induced MDR1 down-regulation in normoxia is independent of the HRE. The JNK Pathway-induced Increase of HIF1 Binding to the HRE Is Mediated by the Interaction of HIF1α with c-Jun in the Nucleus—One possibility for the JNK pathway-induced increase of HIF1/HRE binding in hypoxia is that the JNK pathway may increase the HIF1α protein level. It is also possible that the JNK pathway increases HIF1/HRE binding through a direct or indirect association between nuclear c-Jun and HIF1α. Western blot analysis of the HIF1α protein level revealed that JNK/c-Jun overexpression did not affect HIF1α level in hypoxia (data not shown), thus ruling out the first possibility. We also tested the potential interaction between nuclear c-Jun and HIF1α in hypoxia. Immunoprecipitation of the nuclear lysate with a c-Jun antibody showed a clear association of endogenous HIF1α and c-Jun in the nucleus (Fig. 3E). To investigate whether the JNK pathway-induced increase of HIF1/HRE binding in hypoxia is mediated by HIF1α/c-Jun interaction, we depleted c-Jun from the nuclear lysate using a c-Jun antibody and then examined HIF1/HRE binding. As shown in Fig. 3F, c-Jun depletion not only largely abolished hypoxia-induced HIF1/HRE binding, but it also abolished the ability of JNK and c-Jun to increase HIF1/HRE binding. Furthermore, add-back of purified c-Jun significantly restored HIF1/HRE binding. These results thus indicate that in hypoxia, nuclear HIF1α/c-Jun interaction plays an important role in mediating the JNK pathway-induced increase of HIF1 binding to the HRE in the MDR1 promoter. MDR1 Repression in Normoxia and Activation in Hypoxia by the JNK Pathway Are Mediated by HDAC5 and p300/CBP, Respectively—To gain more mechanistic insights into the PO2-dependent differential regulation of MDR1 expression by the JNK pathway, we sought to look for additional protein partners of the c-Jun transcription factor. In yeast two-hybrid experiments using c-Jun as bait, we identified several clones of different sizes that encode for HDAC5, a transcriptional repressor belonging to the class II HDAC family (19Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the nuclear lysate with a c-Jun antibody revealed that in normoxia c-Jun interacted with HDAC5 in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). However, the interaction between nuclear HDAC5 and c-Jun was not detected under the hypoxic condition (Fig. 4A). A parallel immunoprecipitation experiment with a HIF1α antibody revealed an association of nuclear HIF1α with c-Jun, but not with HDAC5, in hypoxia (Fig. 4B). HDAC5 is known to repress gene transcription by promoting histone deacetylation and generating a stabilized, transcriptionally repressive chromatin structure (20Bertos N.R. Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The interaction between HDAC5 and c-Jun in normoxia suggests that the activity of HDAC5 might underlie the JNK pathway-induced repression of MDR1 under the normoxic condition. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of JNK and c-Jun on MDR1 promoter activity in the presence of a dominant-negative, catalytic mutant of HDAC5. As shown in Fig. 4C, the repression of MDR1 promoter activity by JNK and c-Jun in normoxia was largely blocked by dominant-negative HDAC5. In contrast, JNK or c-Jun-induced up-regulation of MDR1 in hypoxia was not obviously affected. These results thus reveal a role for HDAC5 in mediating the down-regulatory effect of the JNK pathway on MDR1 expression in normoxia. We next investigated whether in hypoxia the HIF1α-dependent MDR1 activation by the JNK pathway requires the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator, which is known to contain histone acetyltransferase activity and promote the transcriptional activity of HIF1α (21Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 22Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings, our data also revealed that p300/CBP interacted with HIF1α in the nucleus (data not shown). In addition, we found that the JNK pathway-induced MDR1 activation in hypoxia was significantly abrogated by co-transfection with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A, a well known suppressor of p300/CBP activity (23Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar); in contrast, a mutant E1A, which is unable to bind p300/CBP (23Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), did not inhibit JNK pathway-induced MDR1 activation (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that in hypoxia the HIF1α-dependent up-regulatory effect of the JNK pathway on MDR1 expression requires the activity of the p300/CBP coactivator. Drug resistance, particularly multidrug resistance, is a primary cause of cancer chemotherapy failure. A major mechanism underlying MDR is excessive induction of the MDR1 gene, ultimately leading to enhanced expression of P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane. P-glycoprotein extrudes a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents out of cells, causing decreased intracellular drug accumulation and therefore decreased drug effectiveness. MDR1/P-glycoprotein overexpression has been reported to confer MDR in cultured cancer cells and has also been correlated with drug resistance and poor prognosis in cancer patients (24Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 25Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar). However, it remains largely unknown how MDR1 expression is up-regulated in various types of cancer. Elucidating the molecular events that regulate MDR1 expression may contribute to the development of appropriate agents combating MDR and improving chemotherapeutic efficacy. Recent studies have demonstrated that oxygen deprivation within the microenvironment of developing tumors can induce MDR1 gene expression in a HIF1-dependent manner (3Comerford K.M. Wallace T.J. Karhausen J. Louis N.A. Montalto M.C. Colgan S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3387-3394PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wartenberg M. Ling F.C. Muschen M. Klein F. Acker H. Gassmann M. Petrat K. Putz V. Hescheler J. Sauer H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 503-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and JNK activation has been suggested to mediate the above effect (6Comerford K.M. Cummins E.P. Taylor C.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol.

Intriguingly, in normoxia JNK activity appears to negatively correlate with MDR1 expression (9Kang C.D. Ahn B.K. Jeong C.S. Kim K.W. Lee H.J. Yoo S.D. Chung B.S. Kim S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Miao Z.H. Ding J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4527-4532PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhou J. Liu M. Aneja R. Chandra R. Lage H. Joshi H.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although it is still ambiguous today as to how JNK functions in MDR1 expression, our results demonstrate clearly that the JNK pathway down-regulates MDR1 expression in normoxia and up-regulates MDR1 expression in hypoxia. These data provide the first direct evidence that the JNK pathway plays different PO2-dependent roles in regulating MDR1 expression. In addition, these data suggest that strategies targeting the JNK pathway for the manipulation of MDR should include PO2 as a critical factor of consideration. MDR1 expression is known to undergo transcriptional regulation (24Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 26Baker E.K. El-Osta A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The MDR1 promoter bears a number of binding sites for transcription factors such as Y-box-binding protein 1, nuclear transcription factor Y, and the Sp1 transcription factor (27Cornwell M.M. Smith D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19505-19511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ohga T.

Montalto M.C. Colgan S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3387-3394PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ikeguchi M. Teeter L.D. Eckersberg T. Ganapathi R. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, cross-coupled nuclear factor-κB/p65 and c-Fos transcription factors are shown to bind to the CAAT box in the MDR1 promoter, to negatively regulate MDR1 expression (30Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and p53 is shown to regulate MDR1 either positively or negatively (31Lecureur V. Thottassery J.V. Sun D.

Cancer Lett. 1997; 119: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data in the present study show that the JNK pathway-induced down-regulation of MDR1 in normoxia is mediated by increased c-Jun binding to the AP1 site in the MDR1 promoter, whereas the JNK pathway-induced up-regulation of MDR1 in hypoxia is mediated by increased HIF1 binding to the HRE in the MDR1 promoter. A natural question to be addressed in the future then is how c-Jun and HIF1 coordinate with other transcription factors in regulating MDR1 expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our data reveal that in hypoxia, the JNK pathway-induced increase in HIF1 binding to the HRE in the MDR1 promoter is mediated by the interaction between nuclear HIF1α and c-Jun. It will be interesting to investigate, in the future, whether the HIF1α/c-Jun interaction is direct or is mediated by other protein(s) present in the nucleus. In this study, we have also presented evidence that MDR1 repression in normoxia and activation in hypoxia by the JNK pathway are mediated by the HDAC5 transcriptional repressor and the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator, respectively. These data provide important mechanistic insights into the PO2-dependent differential regulation of MDR1 expression by the JNK pathway. Download .pdf (.04 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2136360787,"Abstract In response to DNA damage, p53 and its homolog p73 have a function antagonistic to NF-κB in deciding cell fate. Here, we show for the first time that p73, but not p53, is stabilized by physical interaction with nuclear IκB kinase (IKK)-α to enhance cisplatin (CDDP)-induced apoptosis. CDDP caused a significant increase in the amounts of nuclear IKK-α and p73α in human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells. Ectopic expression of IKK-α prolonged the half-life of p73 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and thereby enhancing its transactivation and pro-apoptotic activities. Consistent with these results, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous IKK-α inhibited the CDDP-mediated accumulation of p73α. The kinase-deficient mutant form of IKK-α interacted with p73α, but failed to stabilize it. Furthermore, CDDP-mediated accumulation of endogenous p73α was not detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from IKK-α-deficient mice, and CDDP sensitivity was significantly decreased in IKK-α-deficient MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the nuclear IKK-α-mediated accumulation of p73α is one of the novel molecular mechanisms to induce apoptotic cell death in response to CDDP, which may be particularly important in killing tumor cells with p53 mutation."

In these cases, it is thought that the replication fork halts and retreats to impede its collapse (1Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol.

The resulting structure resembles a Holliday junction that behaves as a substrate for recombination enzymes (3Michel B. Grompone G. Flores M.J. Bidnenko V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was also found that for covalently closed circles of bacterial plasmids exposed to moderate concentrations of intercalating agents in vitro, whereas unreplicated forms acquire positive (+) supercoiling after all their native negative (–) supercoiling was removed, partially replicated forms appear unable to acquire (+) supercoiling and keep the same electrophoretic mobility as their nicked counterparts (7Olavarrieta L.

These results were interpreted as an indication that partially replicated plasmids containing a fork are unable to acquire (+) supercoiling as all of it is adsorbed by RFR. Curiously, in this case, RFR does not affect the electrophoretic mobility of RIs as in the presence of intercalating agents, these CCRIs show the same electrophoretic mobility as their nicked counterparts (7Olavarrieta L.

In the autoradiograms of these two-dimensional gels, the identification of a diffused pattern named “cone signal” led some authors to claim that the molecules responsible for this pattern contained reversed forks formed in vivo (13Lopes M.

However, whether or not the cone signal detected in repair-deficient mutants is due to RIs containing reversed forks that formed in vivo is uncertain as an identical pattern previously described as a “triangular smear” was also detected in two-dimensional gels of DNA isolated from undamaged wild-type cells of a number of different species and interpreted as indicative for delocalized termination of DNA replication (16Dijkwel P.A.

An important drawback of all these studies is the random location of the event under study, namely a DNA lesion or the site where two forks growing in opposite directions meet. To overcome this potential problem, here we studied RFR in RIs containing a fork stalled at a specific site (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L. Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B.

Digestion of the RIs of these plasmids with restriction enzymes that cut inside as well as inside and outside the replication bubble generates double- and simple-Ys, respectively (Fig. 1). The RIs of plasmids where the fork stalls at a specific site accumulate, generating a prominent signal in two-dimensional gel autoradiograms that can be readily distinguished on top of the simple- or double-Y patterns (7Olavarrieta L.

Analysis of these plasmids undigested and after restriction enzyme digestion revealed that RFR readily forms in vitro but that fork retreat is severely limited in covalently closed domains (33Fierro-Fernández M.

Extensive retreat and total extrusion of the nascent-nascent duplex, on the other hand, occurs spontaneously after nicking or restriction enzyme digestion. Bacterial Strains and Culture Medium—The E. coli strain used in this study was DH5αF′. Competent cells were transformed with monomeric forms of the plasmids as described before (7Olavarrieta L.

Plasmid DNA isolation was performed as described previously (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L. Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B.

Two-dimensional Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and Southern Transfer—The first dimension was in a 0.4% agarose gel in Trisborate-EDTA buffer at 1 V/cm at room temperature for 22 h. The agarose lane containing the λ DNA/HindIII marker was excised, stained with 0.3 μg/ml EthBr, and photographed. During this period, the agarose lane containing the DNA sample was kept in the dark. The second dimension was in 1% agarose gel in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml EthBr run perpendicular with respect to the first dimension. The dissolved agarose was poured around the excised agarose lane from the first dimension, and electrophoresis was at 5 V/cm in a 4 °C cold chamber for 10 h. Southern transfer was performed as described before (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L. Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B.

Psoralen Cross-linking—To perform psoralen cross-linking, 50–100 ng of DNA in a total volume of 20 μl was incubated with 10 μg/ml 4,5′, 8 trimethylpsoralen (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark in a 96-well open plate and subsequently irradiated with a 500-watt high pressure mercury lamp (model TQ 700; Original Hanau) on ice in a open plastic dish for 15 min. The lamp was placed 7 cm above the plastic dish, and the light was filtered through a Pyrex glass to eliminate radiation below 300 nm. Psoralen stock solution was prepared in 100% ethanol. This procedure was performed either before or after DNA digestion. Subsequently, the two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out as described before. Non-radioactive Hybridization—pBR322 that only hybridizes to the plasmid was used as a probe. DNA was labeled with the random primer fluorescein kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were prehybridized in a 20-ml prehybridization solution (2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.5% Blotto, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.5 mg/ml sonicated and denaturated salmon sperm DNA) at 65 °C for 4–6 h. Labeled DNA was added, and hybridization lasted for 12–16 h. Hybridized membranes were sequentially washed with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at room temperature except for the last wash, which took place at 65 °C. Detection was performed with an antifluorescein-AP conjugate and CDP-Star (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Preparation of DNA Samples Enriched for Specific RIs—Specific molecules were isolated from agarose gels following the procedure described by Olavarrieta et al. (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L.

After restriction digestion, DNA isolated from exponentially growing cells was analyzed in a one-dimensional agarose gel, the lane was cut and incubated with 0.1 m NaCl in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) at 65 °C for 4 h, and the selected DNA sample was electroeluted out of the agarose gel and resuspended in distilled water. Electron Microscopy—The purified DNA sample was spread on EM grids under non-denaturating conditions in redistilled water by the benzyldimethyl-alkyl ammonium chloride (BAC) method (34Sogo J.M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Branch Migration and Extrusion Assay—The agarose lane of the first dimension containing the DNA sample was incubated with 0.1 m NaCl in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) at 65 °C for 4 h without 0.3 μg/ml EthBr or in the presence of 0.3 μg/ml EthBr. Subsequently, the second dimension was performed as described before. It is generally thought that RFR is repressed in (–) supercoiled molecules and favored by (+) supercoiling (7Olavarrieta L.

To confirm this observation for a different plasmid, we used a modification of two-dimensional gels where the agarose lane containing the DNA that came out from the first dimension was heated at 65 °C in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl for 4 h before the second dimension took place (33Fierro-Fernández M.

Yates III, J.R. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8342-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This condition favors branch migration and extrusion of the fourth arm of Holliday junctions in vitro (37Allers T. Lichten M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: e6Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The corresponding autoradiograms are shown in Fig. 2 together with interpretative diagrams. Detection of two novel signals (Fig. 2, marked in the diagrams with black arrows) and their electrophoretic mobility during the second dimension clearly indicated that in some, although not all, DNA molecules, heating caused extrusion of the two nascent strands (nascent-nascent duplex). During the second dimension, the new molecular species migrated as open circles and linear forms of 2627 bp, precisely the distance between the ColE1 origin and the TerE site in [email protected], indicating that the new linear fragment corresponded in fact to the extruded double-stranded fourth arm. In the very same autoradiograms, however, no extrusion occurred for CCRIs. Therefore, we concluded that extensive branch migration and extrusion of the fourth arm was impeded in CCRIs regardless of whether the DNA was (–) or (+) supercoiled. This was unexpected as it is generally thought that (+) supercoiling actually favors RFR and complete extrusion of the nascent-nascent duplex (8Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C.

Microbiol. 2004; 52: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This observation, on the other hand, agrees with the finding that RIs are able to acquire electrophoretic mobility and become (+) supercoiled when exposed to very high (0.3 μg/ml and above) concentrations of EthBr (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L. Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Fierro-Fernández M.

Postow et al. (8Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2790-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) used atomic force microscopy to study the topology of RIs containing stalled forks in the presence of 5 μm EthBr (equivalent to 1.97 μg/ml). They noticed that under these conditions, RIs become heavily supercoiled but interpreted that this supercoiling was an artifact induced during deposition of the molecules onto mica. It was later shown, however, that RIs recover electrophoretic mobility and are able to acquire (+) supercoiling when exposed to 0.3 μg/ml and higher concentrations of EthBr (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L. Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) due to the topological locking mechanism activated as soon as RFR forms at both forks of a replication bubble (33Fierro-Fernández M.

The observation that extensive RFR and complete extrusion of the nascent-nascent duplex are prevented in (–) as well as (+) supercoiled RIs prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not the DNA molecules containing reversed forks that are putatively responsible for the cone signal identified in two-dimensional gels indeed form in vivo (10Chow K.H. Courcelle J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3492-3496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T.

Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). To this end, we combined two-dimensional gels with psoralen cross-linking, the branch migration and extrusion assay described above, and EM. If RFR occurs in vivo, the signal should be detected in restriction fragments of all sizes regardless of the extent of replication (Fig. 3). Moreover, if RFR forms and retreats unconstrained once a replication fork stalls at a DNA lesion and these lesions occur at random, the mass of the RI with the stalled fork would vary between 1.0 and 2.0×. As clearly depicted in Fig. 3, the signal expected for a mix of molecules where the fork stalls and retreats from different sites is not the cone depicted in Fig. 3B as a gray triangle but rather a smear covering the whole area limited by X-shaped recombinants to the left, and the ascending portion of the simple-Y pattern to the right, as also painted in Fig. 3D in gray. We used two-dimensional gels to examine restriction fragments of different sizes (4.3, 4.4, 3.1, and 3.6 kb, respectively) where the RIs containing stalled forks were double-Ys of 1.26× (1.26 times the mass of unreplicated fragments) for [email protected] digested with AflIII and 1.60× for [email protected] also digested with AflIII. We also examined simple-Ys of 1.81× for [email protected] digested with AflIII and PvuI and 1.70× for the same plasmid digested with PstI and EcoRI (Fig. 1, circular and linear maps). The spikes emanating from the prominent spot on top of the simple- or double-Y arcs (Fig. 4, represented in red in the diagrams) were easily recognized, although their location, intensity, and extension varied from one gel to the other. Moreover, they did not necessarily fit into the so-called cone signal described elsewhere (10Chow K.H. Courcelle J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3492-3496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T.

Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This spike extended almost exclusively below the accumulated spot for the 1.26× RI, and it also extended below the accumulated spot but showed a small bulge above it for the 1.60× RI and extended both above and below the accumulated spot for the 1.81× RI. Similar signals have been observed for RIs of specific masses in other systems as well (15Vengrova S. Dalgaard J.Z. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Bessler J.B. Zakian V.A. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that only a small fraction of the accumulated RIs experienced RFR (Fig. 4). The strength of the spot generated by accumulated RIs indicated that most of them were pretty stable, and a discrete signal for molecules that experienced RFR was detected only for RIs that accumulated due to fork stalling. To confirm that these signals were generated by molecules displaying reversed forks, the agarose lane containing the DNA that came out of the first dimension was heated at 65 °C in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl for 4 h before the second dimension took place. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 4, middle vertical panel, with corresponding interpretative diagrams. Note that heating between the first and second dimensions eliminated the original diagonal signals and generated novel ones that ran perpendicular to the first dimension in all cases (this was remarkable for the 1.81× RI) and are represented in Fig. 4 in red in the middle vertical diagrams. It seems likely that the bulk of materials that run at the position of the TerE-stalled RIs contained molecules where the fork retreated to some extent but where the nascent-nascent duplexes were too small to affect their mobility in an appreciable manner. These molecules were nevertheless susceptible to branch migration and extrusion by heat. This interpretation would account for both the new vertical spike, if not all such molecules completely extruded in response to heat, as well as the new spots. We speculated that molecules where the replication fork stalled at TerE and have undergone various extents of RFR, which in turn altered both their first and their second dimension mobilities, generated the original diagonal spikes. As DNA heating was performed after the first dimension was completed, it could not alter first dimension mobilities, but after total extrusion of the nascent-nascent duplexes, the molecules that originally gave rise to the diagonal spikes would now yield a horizontal bulge that should be detected aside of the new signals. In fact, this was clearly the case for both of the two new spots observed, particularly in the case of the 1.81× sample (Fig. 4, indicated with blue arrows in the middle bottom diagram).FIGURE 4RIs containing a fork stalled at a specific site display a spike signal in two-dimensional gels that corresponds to molecules containing reversed forks. Autoradiograms of two-dimensional gels corresponding to three different fragments where the RI that accumulated was 1.26×, 1.60×, and 1.81× are shown to the far left, with corresponding interpretative diagrams to their right. In these diagrams, the spikes emanating from the accumulated RI are depicted in red and indicated by blue arrows. The signal depicted as a dotted black arc corresponds to broken RIs (49Martín-Parras L. Hernández P. Martínez-Robles M.L. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol.

Autoradiograms of two-dimensional gels corresponding to the same fragments where the DNA was exposed to 65 °C in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl between the first dimensions (1st dim) and the second dimensions are shown in the middle, with corresponding interpretative diagrams to their right.

In these diagrams, numbers indicate the percentage figure represented by each arm. The parental duplex is indicated in blue and green, whereas the nascent strands are depicted in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For all the fragments studied, the identification of prominent spots that migrated together with the accumulated RI during the first dimension and as linear molecules with the same electrophoretic mobility of unreplicated forms during the second dimension indicated that these molecules resulted from complete extrusion of the fourth arm. Moreover, in the autoradiogram corresponding to the 1.81× RI, a second smaller spot was detected that corresponded to the extruded nascent-nascent linear duplex of 2567 bp. This linear duplex was not detected for the other two fragments examined due to their smaller size. To further confirm that these vertical signals were indeed generated by molecules containing reversed forks, a DNA sample enriched for the 1.60× molecules (Fig. 4, encircled by a black dotted line in the corresponding middle autoradiogram) was prepared and examined at the EM (shown in Fig. 4, at the far right panel). As this sample included molecules of different sources (plasmid as well as chromosomal) and the extent of fork retreat was expected to vary significantly from molecule to molecule, the criterion employed to select those molecules that experienced RFR was the following one. Molecules containing a reversed fork are only those where two arms are identical and the increase in length of each of the other two compensate the progressive loss in length of the first pair (Fig. 3). This criterion allowed us to select a number of molecules where the fourth arm was readily identified (Fig. 4, right panel, indicated by black arrows in the interpretative diagrams) and confirmed that these were indeed RIs where the replication fork had retreated to different extents (7Olavarrieta L. Martínez-Robles M.L. Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Once we confirmed that molecules containing reversed forks generated the vertical signal emanating from the accumulated spots, we investigated whether RFR occurred at the stalled fork in vivo or in vitro. To this end, we used two different and complementary approaches. First, [email protected] was digested with PstI and EcoRI to generate RIs of 1.70× containing no replication fork stalled at TerE. In this case, the fork of the RI that accumulated corresponded to the ColE1 unidirectional origin (Fig. 1, D and H). Analysis of these RIs by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a spike and a pattern that were almost identical to the one shown in Fig. 4 at the bottom left (data not shown). This observation suggested that RFR was likely to occur after digestion in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we used psoralen cross-linking to prevent any further branch migration (41Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). DNA molecules corresponding to the 1.81× sample (Figs. 1 and 5) were cross-linked with psoralen either after or before DNA digestion and analyzed in two-dimensional gels. Notice that the pattern corresponding to the sample cross-linked with psoralen after DNA digestion (Fig. 5B) was almost identical to the one generated by the untreated sample (Fig. 5A) except that the spike generated by molecules containing reversed forks was now decorated with a number of regularly distributed extra spots. Psoralen intercalation and cross-linking do not occur in a uniform fashion (41Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The extra spots might well correspond to sites where psoralen cross-linking occurred in a preferential mode. Branch migration could still shift between cross-links but could not move across them. Surprisingly, no signal for molecules containing reversed forks was detected when psoralen cross-linking took place before DNA digestion (Fig. 5C). In addition, in this case, each of the spots was duplicated. It is well known that the amount of intercalating agents is reduced almost by half in nicked as compared with covalently closed circles (42Sinden R.R. Carlson J.O. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 21: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The detection of doublets in this autoradiogram was a consequence of this phenomenon. For each doublet, the spot showing slower electrophoretic mobility derived from molecules that were covalently closed at the time of psoralen cross-linking and, in consequence, captured almost double the amount of psoralen (43Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 44Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that our results do not indicate that RFR does not occur in vivo. It has been well established that in E. coli, once a replication fork hits a DNA lesion, RecA (45Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and/or RecG (4McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8235-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) promotes regression of the stalled fork, generating a Holliday-like junction (HLJ) that is subsequently processed by the RuvABC complex to allow replication restart by PriA (3Michel B.

This retreat of the forks that occurs in vivo, however, is severely constrained by DNA supercoiling and probably cannot extend very long (33Fierro-Fernández M. Hernandez P. Krimer D.B. Stasiak A.

In summary, here we showed that extensive RFR and extrusion of the fourth arm occurs spontaneously but only after nicking or DNA restriction enzyme digestion. These results strengthen the observation that the extent of fork retreat is severely constrained in supercoiled domains, probably due to the topological locking that triggers when RFR forms at both forks of a replication bubble (33Fierro-Fernández M.

https://openalex.org/W2051303456,"Acetylation is thought to be a key event for p53 activation. We demonstrate that p14ARF-induced senescence of human mammary epithelial cells (MEC) is associated with p53 acetylation and requires hAda3, a component of histone acetyltransferase complexes and a p53 transcriptional coactivator. Expression of the N-terminal domain of hAda3 that binds p53 but not p300 blocked p14ARF-induced p53 acetylation and protected MECs from senescence. Consistent with these findings, the human papillomavirus 16 E6 mutant Y54D, which selectively targets hAda3 but not p53 for degradation and protects MECs from p14ARF-induced senescence, inhibited p53 acetylation. In H1299 cells, hAda3 overexpression increased p300-mediated p53 acetylation, which conversely decreased following small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of hAda3. Moreover, depletion of hAda3 by siRNA inhibited endogenous p53 acetylation and accumulation of p21cip1 in response to ectopic p14ARF. These studies reveal that, in addition to its known ability to inhibit Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation, p14ARF signals through hAda3 to stimulate p53 acetylation and the induction of cell senescence."

To examine the reaction mechanism of a eukaryotic GS, 24 Arabidopsis thaliana GS (AtGS) mutants were kinetically characterized. Within the γ-glutamylcysteine/glutathione-binding site, the S153A and S155A mutants displayed less than 4-fold changes in kinetic parameters with mutations of Glu-220 (E220A/E220Q), Gln-226 (Q226A/Q226N), and Arg-274 (R274A/R274K) at the distal end of the binding site resulting in 24-180-fold increases in the Km values for γ-glutamylcysteine. Substitution of multiple residues interacting with ATP (K313M, K367M, and E429A/E429Q) or coordinating magnesium ions to ATP (E148A/E148Q, N150A/N150D, and E371A) yielded inactive protein because of compromised nucleotide binding, as determined by fluorescence titration. Other mutations in the ATP-binding site (E371Q, N376A, and K456M) resulted in greater than 30-fold decreases in affinity for ATP and up to 80-fold reductions in turnover rate. Mutation of Arg-132 and Arg-454, which are positioned at the interface of the two substrate-binding sites, affected the enzymatic activity differently. The R132A mutant was inactive, and the R132K mutant decreased kcat by 200-fold; however, both mutants bound ATP with Kd values similar to wild-type enzyme. Minimal changes in kinetic parameters were observed with the R454K mutant, but the R454A mutant displayed a 160-fold decrease in kcat. In addition, the R132K, R454A, and R454K mutations elevated the Km value for glycine up to 11-fold. Comparison of the pH profiles and the solvent deuterium isotope effects of A. thaliana GS and the Arg-132 and Arg-454 mutants also suggest distinct mechanistic roles for these residues. Based on these results, a catalytic mechanism for the eukaryotic GS is proposed.

Mutation of Arg-132 and Arg-454, which are positioned at the interface of the two substrate-binding sites, affected the enzymatic activity differently. The R132A mutant was inactive, and the R132K mutant decreased kcat by 200-fold; however, both mutants bound ATP with Kd values similar to wild-type enzyme. Minimal changes in kinetic parameters were observed with the R454K mutant, but the R454A mutant displayed a 160-fold decrease in kcat. In addition, the R132K, R454A, and R454K mutations elevated the Km value for glycine up to 11-fold. Comparison of the pH profiles and the solvent deuterium isotope effects of A. thaliana GS and the Arg-132 and Arg-454 mutants also suggest distinct mechanistic roles for these residues. Based on these results, a catalytic mechanism for the eukaryotic GS is proposed. Glutathione is a key modulator of the intracellular reducing environment that provides protection against reactive oxygen species and the detoxification of xenobiotics (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5997) Google Scholar). In plants, metabolic pathways for the detoxification of herbicides, air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, and heavy metals rely on glutathione (2May M.J. Vernoux T. Leaver C. Van Montagu M. Inze D. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 649-667Google Scholar, 3Noctor G. Arisi A.C. Jouanin L. Kunert K.J. Rennenberg H. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 423-647Google Scholar, 4Zenk M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of glutathione occurs through a two-step pathway found in mammals, bacteria, yeast, and plants. In the first reaction, glutamate-cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.2) catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of the dipeptide γ-glutamylcysteine from cysteine and glutamate (5Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33463-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the second step, glutathione synthetase (GS, 3The abbreviations used are: GS, glutathione synthetase; AtGS, A. thaliana glutathione synthetase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. EC 6.3.2.3) catalyzes the addition of glycine to the dipeptide (Fig. 1) (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this reaction, transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to the C-terminal carboxylic acid of γ-glutamylcysteine yields an acylphosphate intermediate. Nucleophilic attack on the acylphosphate intermediate by glycine results in formation of glutathione with release of ADP and inorganic phosphate (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5997) Google Scholar, 7Nishimura J.S. Dodd E.A. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2553-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial and eukaryotic GS form two distinct families that share no amino acid sequence homology. Structural and functional studies of the GS from Escherichia coli show that the enzyme functions as a homotetramer composed of ∼300 amino acid monomer subunits (8Tanaka T. Kato H. Nishioka T. Oda J.

In contrast, the GS from mammals, yeast, and plants, which are related by ∼30% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 2A), are active as homodimeric enzymes, with each monomer consisting of ∼470 amino acids (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Dodd-Mooz E. Meister A.

Despite the lack of sequence homology and different oligomeric structures, the E. coli, human, and yeast GS share a common structural fold and are part of the ATP-grasp structural family (17Fan C.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Limited mechanistic information is available for the eukaryotic GS. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the human enzyme and the random sequential kinetic mechanism of Arabidopsis thaliana GS (AtGS) have been described (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Njalsson R. Carlsson K. Olin B. Carlsson B. Whitbread L. Polekhina G. Parker M.W. Norgren S.

Board P.G. Gali R.R. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3204-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Gogos A. Shapiro L. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1669-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the reaction mechanism for the eukaryotic GS has not been tested. Based on the structures of the human and yeast enzymes, the active site of AtGS can be delineated into two regions, as shown in a structural model of the enzyme (Fig. 2B). The amino acids forming the active site of the human, yeast, and Arabidopsis GS are invariant. One-half of the active site consists of the γ-glutamylcysteine/glutathione-binding site and includes Arg-132, Ser-153, Ser-155, Glu-220, Gln-226, and Arg-274. The second half forms the ATP-binding site. Within this site, multiple residues (Lys-313, Lys-367, Asn-376, Glu-429, Arg-454, and Lys-456) contact the bound nucleotide, and a cluster of acidic amino acids (Glu-148, Asn-150, and Glu-371) coordinates binding of two magnesium ions to ATP. Analysis of the kinetic properties of human GS variants containing mutations found in patients with glutathione deficiency showed that certain residues in the active site, including those corresponding to Arg-132 and Arg-274, are important for enzyme function (20Njalsson R. Norgren S. Larsson A. Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Luo J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but their possible catalytic roles have not been examined. Additional mutagenesis studies of human GS focused on four residues, corresponding to Glu-148, Asn-150, Lys-313, and Lys-367, in the ATP-binding site that are highly conserved in other ATP-grasp family members (21Dinescu A. Cundari T.R. Bhansali V.S. Luo J.L. Anderson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22412-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutation of these amino acids showed that each was needed for efficient catalysis; however, the role of these residues to ATP binding was not demonstrated. Moreover, a chemical mechanism for the enzyme was not proposed. To date, a complete analysis of the contribution of active site residues to the reaction mechanism of the eukaryotic GS has not been reported. In this study, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on the 15 amino acids forming the AtGS active site and examine the effect of these mutations on steady-state kinetics, ATP binding, pH dependence of catalysis, and solvent kinetic isotope effects. Overall, GS is sensitive to minor amino acid changes in the active site, which suggests that the enzyme is optimized for catalyzing the ATP-dependent peptide ligation reaction that results in the tripeptide glutathione. Our results, in combination with available structural information, suggest a chemical mechanism for glutathione synthesis in humans, plants, and yeast. Materials—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. E. coli C41(DE3) cells were purchased from Avidis, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—Site-directed mutants of AtGS (R132A, R132K, E148A, E148Q, N150D, N150A, S153A, S155A, E220Q, E220A, Q226N, Q226A, R274K, R274A, K313M, K367M, N376A, E371Q, E371A, E429Q, E429A, R454A, R454K, and K456M) were generated using oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation and the QuikChange PCR method (Stratagene) with the pET28a-AtGS expression vector as template (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Automated nucleotide sequencing confirmed the fidelity of the mutant gene sequences (Washington University Sequencing Facility, St. Louis). Recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli C41(DE3) and were purified by Ni2+ affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies, as described previously (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Enzymatic activity of GS was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of ADP formation using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Standard reactions were performed at 25 °C in a 0.5-ml reaction volume containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm γ-glutamylcysteine, 10 mm glycine, 2.5 mm disodium ATP, 2 mm sodium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 units of type III rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, and 10 units of type II rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of decrease in A340 nm was followed using a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by initial velocity experiments in which one substrate was varied such that eight substrate concentrations covering 0.1-to 10 times Km values were used with the other two substrate concentrations fixed at saturation. Kinetic parameters were calculated using Kaleidagraph (Synergy software) to fit untransformed data to v = kcat[S]/(Km + [S]). The pH dependence of activity was performed using the above assay conditions with the HEPES buffer replaced by a triple buffer system (50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm MES, and 50 mm Tris, final concentrations) to maintain constant ionic strength across a range of pH values (22Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Data were fit either to the equation for increasing activity versus pH, logY = log(c/(1 + H/Ka)), or the equation for a bell-shaped activity dependence versus pH, logY = log(c/(1 + H/Ka + Kb/H)), where Y is the measured parameter (kcat or kcat/Km), Ka and Kb are the dissociation constant for the titrated groups, and c is the pH-independent value of Y (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Solvent deuterium isotope effects were determined using the assay system described above except that reactions were performed in 90% (v/v) D2O. All reagents were prepared in D2O, and the HEPES reaction buffer was adjusted to pD = 7.9 using NaOD or DCl. Proteins were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm HEPES (pD 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 in D2O. Isotope effects on kcat and Km are expressed as DV = kH2O/kd2O and DV/K = (kcat Km)H2O/(kcat/Km)D2O. Fluorescence Titration of ATP Binding—Binding of ATP to AtGS was determined by monitoring the change in protein fluorescence upon ligand addition. Measurements were made on a Varian Cary fluorimeter (λexcitation = 280 nm and λemission = 330 nm; slit widths = 5 nm). Titrations were performed at 25 °C by addition of ATP (1 m stock) to 0.5 ml of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm MgCl2 containing 100 μg of protein. To avoid dilution effects, volume change during the titration was limited to 3% of total volume. Control titrations with buffer alone did not produce any change in emission signal. The Kd value was calculated using Kaleidagraph with the data fit to ΔF = (ΔFmax[L])/([L] + Kd), where ΔF is the change in emission signal in the presence of ligand (L), and ΔFmax is the maximal change in signal. The data were also replotted as a linear transformation of the same equation (R versus R/[L]), where R is the fluorescence change. The pH dependence of ATP binding for wild-type AtGS was determined using the 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm MES, and 50 mm Tris buffer system in place of HEPES buffer. Data were fit to logY = log(c/(1 + Ka/H)), as described above (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—Twenty four point mutants of AtGS were generated to evaluate the role of each active site residue in catalyzing the formation of glutathione. Wild-type and mutant AtGS was overexpressed in E. coli and purified using a two-step purification procedure (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All of the mutant enzymes were isolated as soluble homodimeric proteins that displayed the same mobility on SDS-PAGE and elution profile by gel filtration chromatography as wild-type enzyme (not shown). Effect of Mutations in the γ-Glutamylcysteine/Glutathione-binding Site—Based on comparison with the human and yeast GS, the AtGS γ-glutamylcysteine/glutathione-binding site includes Arg-132, Ser-153, Ser-155, Glu-220, Gln-226, and Arg-274 (Fig. 2). A series of point mutations (R132A, R132K, S153A, S155A, E220Q, E220A, Q226N, Q226A, R274K, and R274A) were used to probe the role of residues in the site. The effect of mutating these amino acids can be grouped into three outcomes as follows: minimal changes in the steady-state kinetic parameters, decreased turnover rate, and increased Km values for γ-glutamylcysteine (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of mutations in the γ-glutamylcysteine/glutathione-binding siteEnzymeSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μmm−1 s−1AtGSγEC732 ± 1839 ± 5313,000ATP726 ± 3057 ± 10212,000Gly756 ± 201,510 ± 888,340R132KγEC3.51 ± 0.28129 ± 16454ATP4.26 ± 0.30125 ± 15568Gly3.72 ± 0.137,570 ± 2307.73S153AγEC319 ± 7166 ± 1332,030ATP342 ± 24116 ± 2749,100Gly432 ± 293,410 ± 882,110S155AγEC211 ± 835 ± 6100,600ATP305 ± 19189 ± 3326,900Gly311 ± 122,250 ± 392,300E220AγEC90.6 ± 3.61,940 ± 230778ATP87.6 ± 7.7180 ± 478,110Gly64.8 ± 1.04,040 ± 160267E220QγEC195 ± 3.8954 ± 663,410ATP191 ± 3.8190 ± 1116,800Gly155 ± 3.21,670 ± 1341,550Q226AγEC58.4 ± 1.63,600 ± 290270ATP43.2 ± 2.889.0 ± 118,090Gly22.2 ± 0.63,450 ± 330107Q226NγEC89.1 ± 3.23,340 ± 323445ATP95.6 ± 5.4194 ± 328,210Gly79.8 ± 3.21,690 ± 294790R274KγEC50.5 ± 4.27,030 ± 1,290120ATP27.0 ± 2.2175 ± 442,570Gly13.2 ± 0.22,160 ± 140102 Open table in a new tab Minor changes in AtGS activity are observed with removal of the side-chain hydroxyl group from either Ser-153 or Ser-155 by mutation to alanine, which results in 2-fold lower kcat values and at most a 4-fold change in Km values for γ-glutamylcysteine. Mutation of Arg-132 drastically affects the turnover rate of AtGS. The rate of catalysis is decreased 200-fold by mutation of Arg-132 to lysine. The R132K mutant also shows a modest 5-fold increase in the Km value for glycine. The R132A mutant displayed no enzymatic activity above background using up to 100-fold more protein than used in wild-type assays and over a longer time. To evaluate if the loss of activity was because of compromised ATP binding to AtGS, a fluorescence titration assay was used. Addition of ATP quenches the fluorescence emission signal of AtGS (Fig. 3A). Titration of wild-type enzyme with increasing amounts of ATP yields a binding isotherm with a Kd = 1.3 mm (Fig. 3B and Table 2). Previous examination of the random sequential kinetic mechanism of AtGS yielded an estimated Kd of 0.7 mm for ATP binding (6Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42726-42731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The R132A and R132K mutants bind ATP with affinity similar to wild-type enzyme (Table 2). The effects of mutating Arg-132 imply a key role for this residue in catalysis.TABLE 2ATP-binding constants for wild-type and mutant AtGSEnzymeKdmmAtGS1.29 ± 0.09R132A3.52 ± 0.22R132K2.31 ± 0.33S153A2.15 ± 0.18S155A1.64 ± 0.03E220A1.84 ± 0.10E220Q2.09 ± 0.15Q226A1.35 ± 0.23Q226N2.26 ± 0.20R274A1.89 ± 0.21R274K2.08 ± 0.17E371Q>30N376A>30R454A16.8 ± 1.3R454K6.18 ± 0.55K456M>30 Open table in a new tab Mutations of Glu-220, Gln-226, and Arg-274 at the distal end of the binding site alter γ-glutamylcysteine binding. Removal of the charged side chain of Glu-220 (E220A or E220Q) from the binding site results in a 24-fold higher Km value for γ-glutamylcysteine. Nearly 100-fold higher Km values are observed with substitution of Gln-226 by either an alanine or asparagine residue. Mutation of either Glu-220 or Gln-226 also slows kcat by 4-15-fold. The R274K mutant showed the largest (180-fold) change in the Km value for γ-glutamylcysteine with a 24-fold decrease in kcat. Mutation of Arg-274 to alanine inactivates the enzyme, although the protein binds ATP with wild-type affinity (Table 2). These results suggest a primary role for Glu-220, Gln-226, and Arg-274 in the recognition of γ-glutamylcysteine. Effect of Mutations in the ATP-binding Site—Substitution of residues interacting with the magnesium ions in the ATP-binding site (Fig. 2), i.e. Glu-148, Asn-150, and Glu-371, either abrogated enzymatic activity (E148A, E148Q, N150A, N150D, and E371A) or severely reduced the rate of catalysis (E371Q) (Table 3). The loss of activity in the E148A, E148Q, N150A, N150D, and E371A mutants results from the inability to bind ATP, as evaluated by fluorescence titration (not shown). Circular dichroism spectroscopy of these mutants indicates that each protein adopts a similar fold as wild-type enzyme (not shown). Addition of higher magnesium concentrations (up to 100 mm) did not restore ATP binding or catalytic activity. Replacement of Glu-371 with a glutamine lowered the turnover rate by 80-fold with 4-7-fold increases in Km for ATP and γ-glutamylcysteine (Table 3). Fluorescence emission changes were observed for the E371Q mutant at 30 mm ATP, but insufficient quenching prevented accurate determination of Kd values (Table 2).TABLE 3Effect of mutations in the ATP-binding siteEnzymeSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μmm−1 s−1AtGSγEC732 ± 1839 ± 5313,000ATP726 ± 3057 ± 10212,000Gly756 ± 201,510 ± 888,340E371QγEC9.49 ± 0.75273 ± 21579ATP10.2 ± 1.1346 ± 49491Gly9.43 ± 0.221,180 ± 146133N376AγEC23.0 ± 0.5271 ± 211,413ATP36.6 ± 0.9785 ± 76777Gly61.8 ± 2.76,590 ± 930156R454AγEC4.64 ± 0.81146 ± 17530ATP4.71 ± 0.20370 ± 58212Gly4.79 ± 0.7216,100 ± 2554.62R454KγEC229 ± 14143 ± 3326,700ATP131 ± 9171 ± 2112,800Gly148 ± 134,170 ± 220592K456MγEC6.54 ± 0.18425 ± 49256ATP9.00 ± 0.66695 ± 91216Gly17.4 ± 2.22,400 ± 45121 Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis of residues contacting the bound nucleotide (Fig. 2) produced results similar to those observed for mutations of amino acids coordinating the magnesium ions to ATP (Tables 2 and 3). Binding of ATP was not observed by fluorescence titration for the K313M, K367M, E429A, and E429Q mutants, all of which showed no enzymatic activity, even though each mutant is properly folded as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (not shown). Mutation of Asn-376 to alanine and Lys-456 to methionine reduced kcat by 18- and 67-fold, respectively, and increased the Km values for ATP and γ-glutamylcysteine by 7-14-fold. Kd values for ATP binding to the N376A and K456M mutants could not be accurately measured because of insufficient quenching of the fluorescence emission signal (Table 2). The R454K mutant displayed modest 3-4-fold differences in steady-state kinetic parameters and ATP binding affinity. Replacement of Arg-454 with an alanine resulted in an 80-fold decrease in kcat, a 6-fold increase in the Km values for ATP, a 13-fold decrease in binding affinity for ATP, and an 11-fold increase in the Km values for glycine. pH Rate Profiles for Wild-type AtGS—The effect of pH on the steady-state kinetic parameters of AtGS for γ-glutamylcysteine, ATP, and glycine was examined (Fig. 4 and Table 4). AtGS displayed the same breakpoint (pKa ∼ 7.3) in the V versus pH profile obtained for each substrate (Fig. 4A), which indicates that deprotonation of a charged species in the enzyme-substrate complex is required for maximal activity. Bell-shaped curves with pKa ∼ 7.2 and pKb = 9.4-9.7 were observed in the pH profiles of V/K for γ-glutamylcysteine and ATP (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the V/K pH profile with glycine showed an increase with pH and a pKa = 8.6 (Fig. 4B). The pH dependence of ATP binding was analyzed and showed a decrease in binding affinity with increasing pH (Fig. 4C and Table 4), indicating that a protonated functional group increases binding affinity. The observed breakpoint for ATP binding (pKa = 9.6) was at a similar pH as the second inflection point observed in the V/K pH profiles for ATP and γ-glutamylcysteine.TABLE 4pH dependence of steady-state kinetic and ATP-binding parameters for AtGSSubstrateVV/Km1/KdpKacpKapKbcpKacs−1M−1 S−1 × 105mm−1γEC7.36 ± 0.0453.9 ± 1.17.16 ± 0.229.41 ± 0.244.95 ± 0.74ATP7.29 ± 0.0650.4 ± 1.37.21 ± 0.139.73 ± 0.154.65 ± 0.389.58 ± 0.210.79 ± 0.06Gly7.26 ± 0.1048.8 ± 2.28.58 ± 0.072.44 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab pH Rate Profiles for the Arg-132 and Arg-454 Mutant AtGS—Given the location of Arg-132 and Arg-454 at the interface between the two substrate-binding sites in the active site (Fig. 2B) and the effects of mutating these residues on catalysis, we examined the pH dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters for the R132K, R454A, and R454K AtGS mutants (Fig. 5 and Table 5). The R132K mutant displayed curves that rose with increasing pH with pKa values ranging from 6.4 to 6.6 for the V versus pH and the V/K versus pH curves for each substrate (Fig. 5, A and B). This difference from wild-type enzyme suggests a change in the rate-limiting step of the chemical mechanism. Mutation of Arg-454 to an alanine abolished the pH dependence of V/K for glycine, but the breakpoints for V and V/K for the other substrates were similar to those observed for wild-type AtGS (Fig. 5, A and C). The steady-state kinetic parameters of the R454K mutant displayed wild-type behavior over the pH range examined (Fig. 5, A and D). The pKa values for ATP binding to the R132K, R454A, and R454K mutants were all similar to wild-type AtGS (Table 5), indicating that Arg-132 and Arg-454 are not responsible for the observed inflection point.TABLE 5pH dependence of steady-state kinetic parameters and ATP binding for the Arg-132 and Arg-454 mutant AtGSpKacR132KV6.60 ± 0.074.37 ± 0.11V/K γEC6.61 ± 0.06429 ± 7V/K ATP6.52 ± 0.04500 ± 27V/K Gly6.37 ± 0.088.74 ± 0.231/Kd(ATP)9.42 ± 0.200.42 ± 0.07R454AV7.33 ± 0.035.58 ± 0.38V/K γEC7.53 ± 0.13514 ± 21V/K ATP7.38 ± 0.06330 ± 46V/K Gly1/Kd(ATP)9.56 ± 0.230.060 ± 0.008R454KV7.24 ± 0.05132 ± 4V/K γEC7.13 ± 0.0920,420 ± 580V/K ATP7.08 ± 0.0619,010 ± 380V/K Gly8.08 ± 0.23637 ± 151/Kd(ATP)9.47 ± 0.230.16 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Solvent Kinetic Isotope Effects—The solvent deuterium isotope effects on wild-type, R132K, and R454A AtGS were determined (Table 6). With wild-type enzyme and the R454A mutant, similar normal solvent kinetic isotope effects on the turnover rate and V/K values were observed. In contrast, mutation of Arg-132 to a lysine, which reduces kcat by 200-fold, yielded a mutant enzyme with DV and DV/K values ranging from 1.0 to 1.2, which provides additional evidence that mutation of this arginine alters the rate-limiting step in glutathione formation and that Arg-132 plays an important catalytic function.TABLE 6Solvent kinetic isotope effects for wild-type, R132K, and R454A AtGSDVDV/KAtGSγEC2.4 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.2ATP2.1 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.2Gly2.2 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.1R132KγEC1.0 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.2ATP1.1 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.2Gly1.2 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.3R454AγEC1.9 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.2ATP2.1 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.3Gly2.2 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab GS catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of glutathione, the most abundant thiol peptide in eukaryotic cells (1Meister A.

https://openalex.org/W2024360982,"Recently, two members of the P4 family of P-type ATPases, Dnf1p and Dnf2p, were shown to be necessary for the internalization (flip) of fluorescent, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl(NBD)-labeled phospholipids across the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the current study, we have demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis is not sufficient for phospholipid flip in the absence of the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. This requirement was demonstrated by two independent means. First, collapse of the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) almost completely blocked NBD-phospholipid flip while only moderately reducing the cytosolic ATP concentration. Second, strains with point mutations in PMA1, which encodes the plasma membrane proton pump that generates the proton electrochemical gradient, are defective in NBD-PC flip, whereas their cytosolic ATP content is actually increased. These results establish that the proton electrochemical gradient is required for NBD-phospholipid flip across the plasma membrane of yeast and raise the question whether it contributes an additional required driving force or whether it functions as a regulatory signal.

The redistribution of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane of cells has been implicated in numerous cell functions including membrane budding, vesicle fusion, and intercellular signaling (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Daleke D.L.

Investigation of the mechanism of phospholipid redistribution across membranes and its role in these cellular functions has been stimulated by the identification of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases as candidates for the inwardly directed trans-bilayer transport (referred to as “flip”) of phospholipids across the plasma membrane (5Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Members of this subfamily play a necessary role in the flip of phospholipids in several different species (6Gomes E. Jakobsen M.K. Axelsen K.B. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G.

Because P-type ATPases are known to couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the movement of ions across membranes (9Catty P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and ATP is required for phospholipid flip across the plasma membrane (8Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Dnf1p and Dnf2p, as well as other members of this subfamily, have been proposed to directly couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport of phospholipids (5Tang X.

This interpretation is complicated by the observation that treatment of S. cerevisiae with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) almost completely blocks the flip of NBD-PC, NBD-PE (11Hanson P.K.

Although CCCP collapses the mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradient in addition to that across the plasma membrane, yeasts grown in glucose do not depend on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP and would not be expected to have significantly reduced cytosolic ATP content (13Serrano R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These data were interpreted to indicate that the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient is necessary for the flip of NBD-labeled phospholipids, even in the presence of normal levels of cytosolic ATP (11Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the cellular ATP content was not measured, it was assumed to be maintained within normal limits and was required for the maintenance of the proton electrochemical gradient by the P-type ATPase Pma1p (11Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we measured the ATP content of cells following treatment with CCCP and observed that the concentrations of CCCP that almost completely inhibited the flip of NBD-PC only moderately reduced cytosolic ATP levels. Furthermore, in pma1 mutant strains with reduced proton electrochemical gradients, we observed that NBD-PC flip was almost completely blocked, whereas the cytosolic ATP levels were actually increased. These data confirm a requirement for the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane for NBD-PC flip in yeast. This gradient may provide an additional driving force or a regulatory signal that is necessary for phospholipid flip in S. cerevisiae. Materials—Yeast medium was purchased from Difco. NBD-PC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The ATP assay kit was purchased from Cambrex, Inc. Unless otherwise noted, all of the other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Yeast Strains and Culture—All strains used in this study (Table 1) were either from our laboratory collection or pma1 point mutant strains kindly donated by John McCusker (14Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ρ° petite cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, were made by treatment with ethidium bromide at 25 μg/ml in SDC synthetic complete medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and complete amino acid supplements) (15Fox T.D.

Cells were grown overnight in SDC containing ethidium bromide, diluted 1:100 in the same medium and regrown overnight. The ρ° phenotype was tested by growth on glucose plates and lack of growth on glycerol plates. For all of the experiments, cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD (2% dextrose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) diluted to A600 = 0.1 in SDC and grown to A600 = 0.2– 0.4 prior to performing experiments.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceLMY65HO arg6 pma1-105 (Ser-368→Phe)J.

Open table in a new tab Internalization of Phospholipids into Yeast Cells—NBD-PC internalization by yeast was performed as previously described (11Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, NBD-PC was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1.25 mm. 2 μl of NBD-PC was added to early log phase cultures (A600 = 0.2–0.4) in 0.5 ml of SDC for a final concentration of 5 μm NBD-PC. Cells were vortex-mixed and then incubated on ice for 1 h. Afterward, cells were harvested and washed three times with two volumes of ice-cold SC azide (SDC lacking glucose but containing 2% sorbitol and 20 mm sodium azide) to prevent lipid efflux. Flow Cytometry—Samples were analyzed via flow cytometry (FACSCalibur cytometer; BD Biosciences) as previously described (16Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To detect and gate out dead cells, 10 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) was added to ∼4 × 105 NBD-PC-labeled cells in ∼100 μl of SC azide immediately prior to analysis. Readings were taken on the flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser at 488 nm. Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.) were used to analyze and quantify the data. For comparison of parent cells to mitochondrial petite cells (ρ°), gating was performed for the analysis between forward scatter of 150–750 to ensure that similarly sized cells were compared. Drug Treatment—For some experiments, cells were treated with CCCP prior to labeling. CCCP was resuspended in ethanol (5 mm stock) and added at various μm concentrations to the cells for 10 min at room temperature (30 min at 30 °C for ρ° experiment) before NBD-PC internalization assay or ATP assay was performed. ATP Assay—A commercial ATP assay kit was purchased from Cambrex, Inc. and used in conjunction with ATP standards purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 100 μl of CCCP- or ethanol-treated control cells were removed and added to a 96-well Costar plate. 100 μl of bactolyze reagent (Cambrex, Inc.) was added to each well and mixed via pipetting. ATP Assay Mix, purchased from Cambrex, Inc., containing luciferase, was added via direct injection by a Turner model 20/20 D luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) and gently shaken for 2 s. Chemiluminescence readings (in arbitrary light units) were then made for the next 12 s, whereas the temperature was held constant at 25 °C. A standard curve was created, and the amount of ATP in each sample was compared with the standard curve to determine the amount of ATP in each sample. Inhibition of NBD-PC Flip by CCCP Is Not Correlated with a Reduction in Cellular ATP—In previous work from our laboratory, we have demonstrated that collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane almost completely blocks the flip of NBD-PC and NBD-PE (11Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) under conditions that were not expected to significantly lower cytosolic ATP levels (13Serrano R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend this observation, we have measured the internalization of NBD-PC on ice and the cellular ATP levels following the treatment of yeast with varying concentrations of CCCP (Fig. 1). The results indicated that treatment with 5 μm CCCP inhibited NBD-PC flip by ∼75% while only lowering cellular ATP by ∼25%. Treatment with 50 μm CCCP decreased NBD-PC flip by ∼90% while reducing ATP content by only 35%. Thus, upon CCCP treatment, NBD-PC flip is substantially inhibited with only a modest reduction in cellular ATP. We concluded from this experiment that the inhibition of NBD-PC flip by CCCP does not result from the inhibition of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. In addition to collapsing the plasma membrane and mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradients in intact cells (17Beauvoit B. Rigoulet M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11212-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18McLaughlin S.G. Dilger J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 825-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), CCCP also results in the acidification of the cytosol, which may inhibit the activity of any putative flippases. To test this possibility, we treated wild type cells in buffered SDC medium at pH values of 5, 6, and 7 with 50 μm CCCP and found no difference in NBD-PC flip (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that the effect of CCCP was a result of its collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient and not cytosolic acidification. The Effect of CCCP Is Not Mediated by Collapse of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—In addition to inhibition of ATP synthesis, collapse of the mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradient by CCCP may activate a signaling pathway that down-regulates flip activity at the plasma membrane. Mitochondrial depolarization resulting from a loss of mitochondrial DNA has been shown to generate a retrograde signal to the nucleus that regulates genes involved in drug resistance (19Moye-Rowley W.S. Gene. 2005; 354: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the rapid effect of CCCP is not likely to be mediated by transcriptional regulation, an acute signaling pathway may exist that senses mitochondrial membrane depolarization and down-regulates phospholipid flip activity at the plasma membrane. To determine whether this hypothetical signaling pathway is necessary to mediate inhibition of phospholipid flip, we measured the effect of CCCP on NBD-PC flip in ρo petite cells. These cells are devoid of mitochondrial DNA and, as a result, have a defective electron transport chain. Thus, ρo petite cells cannot reduce NADH and FADH equivalents to produce a proton electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, but they do maintain a normal gradient across the plasma membrane. The results (Fig. 2) indicate that the ρo petite cells have slightly reduced NBD-PC flip compared with their isogenic parent cells but still responded to CCCP by decreasing NBD-PC flip by >90%. The slightly reduced NBD-PC flip in the untreated ρo cells may result from the up-regulated retrograde signaling pathway that is known to increase the efflux of amphiphilic drugs and may also down-regulate influx (19Moye-Rowley W.S. Gene. 2005; 354: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The almost complete inhibition of NBD-PC flip by CCCP argues that a signal resulting from the collapse of the mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradient is not necessary for the inhibition of NBD-PC flip across the plasma membrane by CCCP. This does not rule out the possibility that such a signaling pathway exists in normal mitochondria, but does rule out a requirement for this collapse to signal the almost complete block of NBD-PC flip following CCCP treatment. Thus, we concluded that the effect of CCCP on NBD-PC flip does not result from either a collapse of the mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradient or from an acute signal emanating from the mitochondria. Mutations in PMA1 That Reduce the Plasma Membrane Proton Electrochemical Gradient Inhibit NBD-PC Flip and Increase Cellular ATP—To gain further insight into the relationship of the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient to phospholipid flip, we assayed NBD-PC flip in a strain carrying a mutation in the gene encoding Pma1p. Pma1p is also a member of the P-type ATPase family. It is essential because it electrogenically pumps protons out of the cell to create the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane that is required for ionic homeostasis and the uptake of nutrients (20Serrano R. Broach J. Pringle J. Jones E. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Planeview, NY1991: 523-585Google Scholar). Because it is necessary for growth, mutations in PMA1 that cause a partial defect in pumping activity have been isolated and studied (21McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One particular mutation, which was independently isolated in two mutant strains, pma1–105 and pma1–141 (14Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused a 65% reduction in ATPase activity and an inability to maintain an intracellular pH required for growth when incubated in acidic medium (21McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted to reflect a reduced ability to pump protons from the cells (21McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). By comparing NBD-PC flip activity and cellular ATP levels in the pma1–105 and pma1–141 mutant strains relative to their isogenic parent strain, we could test the effect of reducing the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane without affecting the mitochondrial potential or reducing cellular ATP. Thus, the effect of decreasing the plasma membrane electrochemical proton gradient on NBD-PC flip could be tested in the absence of confounding effects that might arise from depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The results (Fig. 3) indicated that the uptake of NBD-PC was reduced 75–80% in these mutant strains, whereas the amount of cellular ATP actually increased 2–2.5-fold. Cellular ATP increased presumably because of the reduced activity of Pma1p, which is a major consumer of cellular ATP (20Serrano R. Broach J. Pringle J. Jones E. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Planeview, NY1991: 523-585Google Scholar). Conversely, an increase in Pmalp activity is the probable cause of the observed decrease in cytosolic ATP following collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient by CCCP treatment (Fig. 1). The data in Fig. 3 show that, even in the presence of excess cellular ATP, the flip of NBD-PC is decreased in the PMA1 mutant strains due to a presumed dependence on the activity of Pma1p to generate a proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. We concluded from these data that ATP hydrolysis is not sufficient to drive the flip of NBD-PC across the plasma membrane in the absence of a plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient. The simplest model to explain the requirement of the P-type ATPases Dnf1p and Dnf2p for NBD-labeled phospholipid flip (8Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) is one in which the energy released from ATP hydrolysis is directly coupled to phospholipid translocation. Although no direct evidence exists to demonstrate ATP hydrolysis by either Dnf1p or Dnf2p, it can be inferred from experiments performed on other members of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases.

Furthermore, phospholipid flip in isolated preparations of trans-Golgi vesicles (25Natarajan P. Wang J. Hua Z. Graham T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and post-Golgi synaptic vesicles (26Alder-Baerens N. Lisman Q. Luong L. Pomorski T. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) depends on the expression of members of the P4 subfamily and ATP. These data provide a strong case for the involvement of the P4 subfamily in phospholipid transport. However, their molecular role in this process remains to be definitively established (27Pomorski T. Menon A.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2908-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The results presented here do not directly address the role of ATP in the flip of NBD-PC but do establish an additional requirement (the proton electrochemical gradient) that must be incorporated into the molecular model describing flippase activity. This conclusion is supported by the experiments summarized below. First, we demonstrated that cells treated with CCCP show a strong inhibition of NBD-PC flip at the plasma membrane, although the ATP content of these cells was only modestly reduced (Fig. 1). Thus, the inhibition of NBD-PC flip by the collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient is not the result of reduced cellular ATP content. An indirect effect of CCCP on the mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradient was ruled out as the cause of reduced NBD-PC flip by showing that CCCP treatment blocked NBD-PC flip in ρ° cells that have a reduced mitochondrial potential (Fig. 2). In addition, CCCP treatment of cells previously labeled with NBD-PE (11Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or NBD-PC (data not shown) does not alter the distribution of intracellular fluorescence. Thus, accumulation of NBD-PC and NBD-PE in the mitochondria is not dependent on the mitochondrial proton electrochemical gradient. From these experiments, we conclude that the inhibition of NBD-PC flip by CCCP does not result secondarily from a lack of its accumulation in mitochondria. The possibility that NBD-PC flip activity was inhibited by an increase in the intracellular pH resulting from CCCP treatment was ruled out by showing that the same inhibition was obtained in medium buffered at pH 5 as at pH 7. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mutations in the gene encoding Pma1p that partially disabled its ability to generate the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane also inhibited NBD-PC flip. Although methods are not currently available to measure the flip of endogenous phospholipids in yeast, inhibition by CCCP is not unique to the NBD-labeled phospholipids, because the flip of several BODIPY-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogues are inhibited by CCCP, even though they are flipped by different mechanisms than NBD-PC (12Elvington S.M. Bu F. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40957-40964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data argue that, in addition to ATP hydrolysis, the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient is necessary for NBD-PC flip across the plasma membrane. The role of the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient for phospholipid flip is unclear at this time. It could provide an additional contribution to the driving force for phospholipid flip across the bilayer. The energy gained from the hydrolysis of ATP may be insufficient in the absence of a favorable proton electrochemical gradient to overcome the high activation barrier for movement of a large hydrophilic head-group through the hydrophobic bilayer interior. On the other hand, a reduced proton electrical chemical gradient may produce a signal that down-regulates phospholipid flip. One example of an alternative function of a P-type ATPase is the recent identification of a pool of sodium/potassium ATPase molecules that does not pump ions but instead binds Src kinase and regulates its activity (28Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The possibility that P-type ATPases have signaling functions in addition to ion pumping activity opens the possibility that more complex models will be required to explain their role in phospholipid flip and membrane asymmetry. Determining the role of the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient and its relationship to the yeast P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases in the movement of phospholipids across the plasma membrane remains a challenge to understanding the functional significance of the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane.

Formation of the glycan layer requires nucleotide-activated sugars as the donor molecules. Whereas the enzymes involved in the synthesis of GDP-rhamnose have been well characterized, less is known regarding the structures and enzymatic mechanisms of the enzymes required for the production of dTDP-Fucp3NAc.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments, enzymatic assays, and x-ray crystallographic analyses suggest that His49 functions as an active site base. Many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some Archaea, synthesize cell surface envelopes referred to as surface or S-layers. These outermost cell layers are composed of proteins or glycoproteins that self-assemble into two-dimensional arrays. Depending upon the organism, these arrays can form hexagonal, square, trimeric, or oblique crystalline lattices (1Claus H. Akca E. Debaerdemaeker T. Evrard C. Declercq J.P. Harris J.R. Schlott B. Konig H. Can. J. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 731-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For those bacteria with an S-layer, it has been estimated that ∼20% of the total cellular protein synthesis is devoted to its production (2Novotny R. Pfoestl A. Messner P. Schaffer C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With respect to the level of protein glycosylation, it varies from 2 to 10% (w/w) depending upon the organism (2Novotny R. Pfoestl A. Messner P. Schaffer C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the function of the S-layer is still not well understood, it has been postulated to be involved in bacterial virulence by facilitating invasion of host tissue and by protecting the pathogen against host defense mechanisms (3Sabet M. Lee S.W. Nauman R.K. Sims T. Um H.S. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Garduno R.A. Moore A.R. Olivier G. Lizama A.L. Garduno E. Kay W.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2000; 46: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the S-layer glycans can be lost after prolonged growth of bacteria in rich media, and thus it has been speculated that the carbohydrate components of the S-layer confer a selective advantage on the bacteria in their natural habitat (2Novotny R. Pfoestl A. Messner P. Schaffer C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In recent years, the bacteria Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus strains L420-91T and DSM 10155/G+ and Geobacillus stearothermophilus strain NRS2004/3a have served as model systems for probing the nature of the S-layer glycans (5Schäffer C. Messner P. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T, the S-layer is composed of identical 109-kDa glycoprotein subunits arranged in a square lattice (6Kosma P. Neuninger C. Christian R. Schulz G. Messner P. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The repeating unit of the glycan chain is a hexasac-charide composed of four α-d-rhamnose units and two 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-α-d-galactose residues linked together as indicated in Scheme 1. Formation of the glycan chains occurs in the cytoplasm and requires nucleotide-activated sugars as the donor molecules (7Gronow S. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar). For S-layer production in A. thermoaerophilus, both GDP-rhamnose and dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-α-d-galactose (abbreviated as dTDP-Fucp3NAc) are required. The biosynthetic pathway for the production of dTDP-Fucp3NAc in A. thermoaerophilus was elucidated in 2003 and is indicated in Scheme 2. Like most of the pathways for the synthesis of 3,6-dideoxyhexoses, the formation of this unusual sugar begins with the attachment of α-d-glucose 1-phosphate to dTMP via the action of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyl-transferase. In the next step, the 6-hydroxyl group is removed, and the 4-hydroxyl group is oxidized to a keto-functionality yielding dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose. This reaction is catalyzed by dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase. Both the thymidylyl-transferase and the dehydratase have been well characterized with respect to structure and function (8He X. Liu H.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9He X.M. Liu H.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 701-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Three additional enzymes are ultimately required for the synthesis of dTDP-Fucp3NAc, namely an isomerase, an aminotransferase, and an acetylase (Scheme 2). These enzymes are encoded by the fdtA, fdtB, and fdtC genes, respectively (10Pfoestl A. Hofinger A. Kosma P. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26410-26417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The isomerase, hereafter referred to as FdtA, is especially intriguing in that it catalyzes the conversion of a 4-keto substrate into a 3-keto product with accompanying epimerization about C-4 of the hexose ring. From previous biochemical studies, it appears that FdtA does not require cofactors for activity (11Melancon III, C.E. Hong L. White J.A. Liu Y.N. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus it can be speculated that the reaction catalyzed by FdtA proceeds via a concerted acid-base mechanism similar to that proposed for triose-phosphate isomerase, the well known enzyme of the glycoly. To date, at least 65 ORFs 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TEV, tobacco etch virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TEV, tobacco etch virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid. demonstrating homology to FdtA in the NCBI data base have been identified, but until now, no three-dimensional structures have been reported (11Melancon III, C.E. Hong L. White J.A. Liu Y.N. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These ORFs are found only in bacteria and are typically associated with additional genes thought to be involved in the production of outer membrane polysaccharides (11Melancon III, C.E. Hong L. White J.A. Liu Y.N. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we report the first x-ray structure of FdtA, complexed with dTDP and determined to a nominal resolution of 1.5 Å. Each subunit of the dimeric enzyme adopts a β-barrel motif with the dTDP ligand positioned near the opening of the barrel. Inspection of the active site region reveals a cluster of the following histidine residues: His49, His51, and His95. Both His49 and His51 are strictly conserved among the amino acid sequences presently reported. To probe the biological role of these two residues, each was changed to an asparagine via site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were assayed for activity. In addition, a double mutant protein was prepared whereby both histidines were substituted with asparagines. Whereas the H51N mutant protein retained limited activity, both the H49N and the H49N/H51N proteins were catalytically inactive. X-ray crystallographic analyses of these mutant proteins revealed no significant structural perturbations of their active site regions. On the basis of both biochemical and x-ray crystallographic data, we propose that His49 functions as an active site base to abstract the hydrogen from C-3 of the sugar and to deliver it to C-4, whereas His51 serves to shuttle protons between the C-3 and C-4 sugar oxygens. Details concerning the overall structure and function of FdtA are presented. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase was obtained from Invitrogen. Reagents for DNA purifications were manufactured by Qiagen. Isolation of Genomic DNA—A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T was obtained from ATCC (700303). The freeze-dried pellet was reconstituted in sterile SVIII media (10Pfoestl A. Hofinger A. Kosma P. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26410-26417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and subsequently used to inoculate a small volume of SVIII media. Cells were grown overnight at 55 °C with shaking and then harvested by centrifugation. Genomic DNA was isolated according to standard protocols (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Cloning of the fdtA Gene—The gene encoding the isomerase was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA. Forward and reverse primers containing the restriction sites for NdeI and NotI, respectively, were used to amplify the gene. The gene was subsequently ligated into a modified pET28b(+) vector (Novagen) in which the thrombin cleavage site was replaced with the recognition sequence for TEV protease. Proteins expressed with this modified vector possess an N-terminal hexahistidine tag that can be released by cleavage with TEV protease. Plasmids were tested for successful ligation by digestion with NdeI and NotI. Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant pET28-fdta plasmid was utilized for the transformation of Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) cells (Novagen). A single colony was picked to inoculate an overnight starter culture of LB media. Subsequently, the starter culture was used to inoculate several large scale cultures of TB media. Cells were grown at 37 °C until an absorbance of ∼1.0 at 600 nm was reached. Flasks were transferred to a shaker held at 22 °C, and cells were allowed to grow for 18 h. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. For protein purification, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and maintained at 4 °C for all subsequent steps. Cells were lysed by sonication, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The clarified lysate was then loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The recombinant His6-tagged protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10-250 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. On the basis of SDS-PAGE analysis, fractions containing FdtA were pooled and dialyzed overnight against an excess of lysis buffer. The tag was removed with TEV protease, and cleaved FdtA was separated from the protease and uncut protein by running the digestion mixture over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The protein was concentrated to 17 mg/ml (using an extinction coefficient of 0.91 (mg/ml)-1·cm-1 as calculated with Protean (DNAstar)) and dialyzed overnight against 1.0 liter of storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl). Dialyzed protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Construction of Site-directed Mutant Proteins—Using the pET28-fdtA construct, mutations were introduced into the gene using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Three mutated genes were generated as follows: H49N, H51N, and H49N/H51N. Prior to expression of the proteins, the genes were sequenced to ensure no additional mutations had been introduced during the mutagenesis process. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described above for the wild-type enzyme. Activity Assays for Wild-type Protein and Mutant Forms of FdtA—The wild-type and mutant forms of FdtA were qualitatively assayed for activity via HPLC. Reaction mixtures contained 0.5 μmol of dTDP-glucose, 10 nmol RmlB (Scheme 2), 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 10 nmol of FdtA. A reaction containing no isomerase was used as a negative control. For the reactions containing mutated FdtA, the wild-type reaction served as a positive control. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then boiled to denature the protein. Protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was run over a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Each sample was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium acetate at pH 4.0. ESI mass spectrometry was used to identify the reaction products. To verify the results of these assays, 10 nmol of the second enzyme in the N-acetylfucosamine pathway, FdtB (Scheme 2), was added to each reaction mixture. Each sample was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.5. As before, ESI mass spectrometry was employed to analyze the eluted compounds. Preparation of Selenomethionine-labeled Protein—A starter culture of E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells harboring the pET28-fdtA plasmid was grown overnight at 37 °C in M9 minimal media. Subsequently, the overnight culture was used to inoculate several large scale cultures of M9 minimal media supplemented with 5 mg/liter thiamine. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of ∼0.9 at 600 nm and then cooled on ice. Flasks were transferred to a shaker held at 16 °C, and expression of selenomethionine-labeled protein was induced as described previously (13Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and selenomethionine-labeled protein was purified to homogeneity as described for the wild-type protein. Crystallization of Wild-type and Selenomethionine-labeled FdtA—An “in-house” sparse matrix screen consisting of 144 unique conditions was used to identify crystallization conditions. The hanging-drop method of vapor diffusion was employed, and crystallization trials were conducted at both 25 and 4 °C. Preliminary crystals of the cleaved protein in complex with 10 mm dTDP and 20 mmd-fucose grew at 25 °C from poly(ethylene glycol) 3400 and KCl solutions at pH 7.5. Crystallization conditions were subsequently optimized to 20-21% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 150-200 mm KCl, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals routinely grew in 1-2 days to maximum dimensions of ∼0.4 × 0.4 × 1.0 mm. They belonged to the space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 62.7 Å and c = 201.3 Å and one dimer per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the selenomethionine-labeled protein in complex with dTDP grew out of conditions similar to those for the unlabeled protein (22% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 200 mm KCl, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). These crystals belonged to the same space group and had similar unit cell dimensions. Crystallization of the Mutant Proteins—All crystals of the mutated proteins were grown in the presence of 10 mm dTDP and 20 mm fucose and achieved similar dimensions as the wild-type protein crystals within several days. Crystals of the H51N and H49N/H51N protein grew out of 18% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400 with 100 mm CHES, pH 9.0, and 150 mm LiCl. Crystals of the H49N protein grew out of 18% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000 with 100 mm HEPPS, pH 8.5, and 100 mm KCl. The space groups for all of the mutant protein crystals were the same as that for the wild-type protein, and the unit cell dimensions were very similar. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—Crystals of both the selenomethionine-labeled and wild-type protein were stabilized for x-ray data collection by harvesting them into a synthetic mother liquor composed of 17% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 150 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dTDP, 20 mm fucose, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. They were subsequently frozen after transfer into a cryoprotectant solution composed of 25% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 225 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm dTDP, 20 mm fucose, 15% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. X-ray data from both the selenomethionine-labeled and wild-type protein crystals were collected on a CCD detector at SBC Beamline 19-BM (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). These data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Crystals of the mutant proteins were stabilized for x-ray data collection in a similar manner, and x-ray data sets from these crystals were collected at 100 K with a Bruker AXS Platinum 135 CCD detector controlled with the Proteum software suite (Bruker (2004), PROTEUM, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI). The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator equipped with montel optics and operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. These data were processed with SAINT (version V7.06A, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI) and internally scaled with SADABS (version 2005/1, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI).

Open table in a new tab X-ray Structural Analysis of FdtA—The three-dimensional structure of FdtA was solved via MAD phasing. The program SOLVE was used to locate the positions of seven of the eight selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit and to calculate initial protein phases (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening with RESOLVE produced a readily interpretable electron density map calculated to 2.2 Å resolution (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The entire polypeptide chain for the FdtA subunit was traced, with the exception of residues Met1 and Glu136 to Gly139. In addition, the N-terminal Gly-His residues resulting from the tag were not visible. The FdtA model was then employed as a search probe for molecular replacement with the software package EPMR (17Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) against the x-ray data set collected to 1.5 Å resolution from the wild-type crystal. Alternate cycles of manual model building and least squares refinement with the program TnT (18Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar) reduced the R-factor to 19.5% for all measured x-ray data from 50.0 to 1.5 Å.

Open table in a new tab Overall Three-dimensional Structure of FdtA—Crystals of the wild-type protein employed for the structural analysis presented here diffracted to a nominal resolution of 1.5 Å and contained a complete dimer in the asymmetric unit. The electron densities for the polypeptide chain backbones were very well ordered for both subunits with electron density missing for only Met1, Lys137, Glu138, and Gly139 in subunit 1 and Met1, Glu136, Lys137, Glu138, and Gly139 in subunit 2. The quality of the model is excellent with 90.1% of the residues adopting φ, ψ angles in the “most favored” and 9.9% in the “additionally allowed” regions of the Ramachandran plot. A ribbon representation of the dimer is presented in Fig. 1a. The dimer has overall dimensions of ∼47 × 51 × 64 Å and assumes an almost jellyfish-like appearance with the sole α-helices representing the tentacles. The subunit-subunit interface is rather extensive with a total buried surface area of ∼3100 Å2. Formation of the FdtA dimer represents a classic example of domain swapping whereby β-strands 2 and 3 from one subunit form part of a β-sheet in the second subunit (19Bennett M.J. Sawaya M.R. Eisenberg D. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The “hinge” loop required for the domain swapping is formed by a type II turn (Glu22 to Lys25) and a loop (Asn26 to Lys32) that together connect β-strands 3 and 4. This type of swapping phenomenon was first revealed in the dimeric structure of diphtheria toxin (20Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and has now been observed in at least 40 structurally and biologically diverse proteins (21Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that some domain-swapped multimeric proteins may have arisen from monomeric proteins as a result of destabilizing mutations (20Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 22Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The overall tertiary structure of each subunit is dominated by two layers of anti-parallel β-sheet that form a flattened barrel as can be seen in Fig. 1b. The two layers of sheet within the subunit each contain five β-strands. As indicated in the topology plot presented in Fig. 1c, one layer is composed of β-strands 1, 4, 6, 9, and 11, and the second layer contains β-strands 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. Because of domain swapping, however, one layer of sheet contains an additional two anti-parallel β-strands contributed by the second subunit with β-strand 3 in one subunit abutting β-strand 4 in the second subunit. As a consequence, β-strands 3 from each subunit contribute significantly to the dimer interface. In addition to β-strand 3, the dimeric interface is also formed by the β-sheet composed of β-strands 1, 4, 6, 9 and 11, which projects primarily hydrophobic side chains into the interstitial space. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, a and b. Not surprisingly, given the hydrophobic character of the subunit-subunit interface, there is a striking absence of ordered water molecules lining this region. Although most of the amino acid residues lie within strands of β-sheet, there is one major α-helix that initiates with Tyr123 at the end of β-strand 12 and extends to the C terminus. A variety of loops connect these secondary structural elements, including four type I turns (Asp13-Gly16, Ser82-Val85, Ser101-Cys104, and Asp115-Asp118) and one type II turn (Glu22 to Lys25). Approximately 70% of the amino acid residues adopt φ,ψ angles corresponding to classical secondary structural elements. Recently, the biochemical properties for a similar 3,4-ketoisomerase from Streptomyces fradiae, referred to as Tyl1a, were reported (11Melancon III, C.E. Hong L. White J.A. Liu Y.N. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given that FdtA and Tyl1a share a 42% amino acid sequence identity (supplemental Fig. 1), it can be speculated that the overall molecular architecture of Tyl1a will be similar to that described here for FdtA. Both of these enzymes belong to the RmlB-like cupin superfamily (11Melancon III, C.E. Hong L. White J.A. Liu Y.N. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Dunwell J.M. Khuri S. Gane P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The Active Site of FdtA—Electron density corresponding to the dTDP ligand in subunit 2 is presented in Fig. 3a, and as can be seen, the nucleotide is well ordered. Unlike that observed in subunit 2, however, the electron density for the ligand in subunit 1 is indicative of multiple conformations. Consequently, for the sake of simplicity, the following discussion only refers to subunit 2 because the nucleotide adopts a single conformation. A close-up view of the region surrounding the dTDP is displayed in Fig. 3b. The deoxyribose adopts the C2′-endo pucker. The C-4 carbonyl oxygen of the thymine base is located within 2.7 Å of Nη1 of Arg33. There are no other direct contacts between the thymine ring and the protein, but rather N-3 and the C-2 carbonyl oxygen interact with ordered water molecules. Likewise, there are no side chains or ordered water molecules located within 3.2 Å of the 3-hydroxyl group of the deoxyribose. The α-phosphoryl oxygens of dTDP are surrounded by three waters and the si"

We show that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the dominant negative form of c-Jun (dn-c-Jun) in C57BL/6 mice increased greatly apoE hepatic mRNA and plasma levels, increased plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low density lipoprotein levels, and resulted in the accumulation of discoidal high density lipoprotein particles. A similar but more severe phenotype was generated by overexpression of the mouse apoE in C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that dyslipidemia induced by dn-c-Jun was the result of apoE overexpression. Unexpectedly, infection of apoE(-/-) mice with adenovirus expressing dn-c-Jun reduced plasma cholesterol by 70%, suggesting that dn-c-Jun affected other genes that control plasma cholesterol levels. To identify these genes, we performed whole genome expression analysis (34,000 genes) of isolated livers from two groups of five apoE(-/-) mice, infected with adenoviruses expressing either the dn-c-Jun or the green fluorescence protein. Bioinformatic analysis and Northern blotting validation revealed that dn-c-Jun increased 40-fold the apoE mRNA and reduced by 70% the Scd-1 (stearoyl-CoA-desaturase 1) mRNA. The involvement of Scd-1 in lowering plasma cholesterol was confirmed by restoration of high cholesterol levels of apoE(-/-) mice following coinfection with adenoviruses expressing dn-c-Jun and Scd-1. In conclusion, dn-c-Jun appears to trigger two opposing events in mice that affect plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels as follows: one results in apoE overexpression and triggers dyslipidemia and the other results in inhibition of Scd-1 and offsets dyslipidemia."

These proteins have been grouped as ubiquitous lens crystallins and taxon-specific crystallins. α-, β- and γ-Crystallins are ubiquitous lens crystallins because they are generally present in the lenses of all vertebrates (1Wistow G.J.

Because their expression in corneal epithelium is significantly high, these proteins have been termed corneal crystallins, analogous to the multifunctional lens crystallins (9Jester J.V.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the idea of corneal crystallins has gained considerable support (9Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T.

Cornea. 2001; 20: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although the exact function of the corneal crystallins is not established for any species. The recognition that, akin to lens crystallins, corneal crystallins exist is a novel concept that has implications that involve the process by which multifunctional gene products have evolved. It is not known whether the corneal crystallins contribute to the optical properties of a cornea. Thus, the structural and functional relationship between the lens and corneal crystallins remains ambiguous. In some cases, corneal crystallins perform several functions; aldehyde dehydrogenase is shown to play a protective role against oxidative stress and in the regulation of cell cycle (18Uma L. Hariharan J. Sharma Y. Balasubramanian D. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Estey T. Piatigorsky J. Lassen N. Vasiliou V. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 84: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family are lens as well as corneal crystallins (20Cooper D.L. Isola N.R. Stevenson K. Baptist E.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although not many examples of crystallins common to the lens and cornea are known, there are a few examples such as τ-crystallin, which is present in the lenses of several species and is also a corneal crystallin (6Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Kathiresan T. Krishnan K. Krishnakumar V. Agrawal R. Anand A.

Some invertebrates (e.g. squid and scallop) accumulate lens crystallins in their corneas, suggesting that common lens and corneal crystallins exist (21Piatigorsky J. Kozmik Z. Horwitz J. Ding L.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the validity of this concept still requires more verification. Vertebrate ubiquitous lens α-, β-, and γ-crystallins have not been found to accumulate in the cornea of any species studied so far. If it were true that these crystallins are also corneal crystallins, it would be really important and possible to correlate the optical functions of corneal crystallins. As mentioned, corneas of only a few species have been analyzed for the presence of abundant proteins. It is, therefore, important to identify the abundant proteins in the cornea of a number of diverse species in order to understand the nature of corneal crystallins. We have attempted to identify the major soluble proteins expressed in anuran cornea. After lentectomy, anuran such as Xenopus laevis exhibits a unique property of regenerating a lens by transdifferentiation of the outer corneal epithelium (23Freeman G. J. Exp. Zool. 1963; 54: 39-66Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Henry J.J. Elkins M.B. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Reyer R.W. Q. Rev.

This transdifferentiation process is known to be triggered by several factors such as fibroblast growth factors and vitamin A (27Filoni S. Bosco L. Cioni C. Acta Embryol. Morphol. Exp. 1982; 3: 15-28PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bosco L. Valle C. Willems D. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 257-270Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Bosco L. Venturini G. Willems D.

In fact, when implanted into the vitreous chamber of a host larva, fragments of outer cornea transdifferentiate into lens fibers (31Reeve J.G. Wild A.E. J. Embryol. Exp.

Differentiation. 1999; 64: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of this lens-forming competence of the corneal epithelium is not understood and has been a subject of intense investigations. The focus has been largely on the identification of factors that could induce lens formation. However, a major unanswered question is: Why does only an anuran cornea have lens-forming competence? Is the composition of an anuran cornea different from that of others? Do anuran corneas have abundant transcripts for the α-, β-, and γ-crystallins? To the best of our knowledge, no study has been directed toward the identification of the abundant proteins in anuran cornea or understanding its protein composition and its comparison with other species that could throw light on this unique property of anuran cornea. With these objectives, we undertook detailed analysis of the major corneal proteins from an Indian toad (Bufo melanostictus) as a representative of anuran amphibian. To our utmost surprise, we found that cornea of the Indian toad contains almost the full complement of vertebrate ubiquitous lens α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. The major protein spots observed on a two-dimensional gel of the toad cornea and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF 4The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF/TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; ESI-Q-TOF, electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. and ESI-Q-TOF belong to these ubiquitous lens crystallins, namely αA-, αB-, βB2-, βA1/A3-, βA2-, and γ-crystallins. Immunofluorescence analysis using mouse polyclonal antibodies for αB-, βB2-, and γ-crystallins demonstrates that these crystallins are largely localized in the corneal epithelium, thus supporting the hypothesis of corneal crystallins (15Piatigorsky J.

Cornea. 2001; 20: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and suggesting that they are essential for the visual functions of cornea. Indian Toad and Frog Corneas—The adult toads and frogs were caught from the field and identified as B. melanostictus and Rana tigrina. The animals were handled according to Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology guidelines and approved by the institutional ethics committee for handling animals. The corneas were surgically removed, carefully avoiding the lens tissues, homogenized in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The total water-soluble protein was estimated in the supernatant using rapid protein estimation reagents (Bio-Rad) and used for the experiment. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using immobilized pH gradient strips, pH 3-10 (Protean IEF cell; Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) in the second dimension. Protein spots were visualized by Coomassie blue R 250 staining and were identified based on their discrete presence in the gel and processed further. In-gel Tryptic Digestion—The selected spots of proteins were excised manually from gels and were subjected to in-gel digestion using sequencing grade bovine trypsin (Sigma) reconstituted in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 at a molar ratio of the protein to trypsin between 10:1 and 30:1. After digestion, peptides from the gel were extracted twice using 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass Spectrometry—Peptide mass fingerprinting of the reconstituted peptides was obtained using MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyzer (MDS SCIEX, Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer. For determination of internal sequence tags of the protein, MS/MS fragmentation spectra were obtained using API Q-STAR Pulsar from PE SCIEX, Applied Biosystems, with nanospray source at 1000 V spraying voltage. Protein identifications by peptide mass fingerprinting were examined for the number of peptides matched (at least 5) or the sequence coverage (15-20%) using MASCOT search on the NCBI data base. Protein identification was confirmed with MS/MS data that were analyzed by the program Bio-Analyst from PE SCIEX, Canada, and homology searches were carried out using sequence tags. We have included only those protein identifications that were confirmed by MS/MS analysis. Preparation and Validation of Anti-βB2- and Anti-γ-Crystallin Antibodies—Recombinant purified γ- and βB2-crystallins (∼150 μg) cloned from bovine lens were emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and injected into Balb/c mouse subcutaneously. Serum was separated, and antibody titer and specificity were assessed by Western blot analysis using recombinant-specific proteins. Western Immunoblot and RT-PCR—Corneas of common Indian toad and frog were removed surgically and homogenized in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA. ∼60 μg of protein was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences) membrane, probed with polyclonal mouse anti-βB2- or γ-crystallin antibodies (1:5000 dilution) and secondary antibody anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase, and visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Polyclonal anti-αB-crystallin antibody raised against αB-crystallin-specific peptide (kindly provided by Dr. Mohan Rao, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology) was used to probe αB-crystallin. For RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from the whole cornea using TRIzol reagent, and first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a kit from Invitrogen. The RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers designed from the crystallin sequences of frog for αB, βB2, and βA1-crystallins and γII-crystallin from bovine. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Imaging—The frozen sections of cornea (10 μm) were prepared by a cryomicrotome (Leica Microsystems), fixed in 100% methanol for 1 min, and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The sections were incubated with appropriate antibody (mouse polyclonal) at 1:100 dilution. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories) at a 1:200 dilution. The nucleus was stained with propidium iodide. Dual immunofluorescence microscopy was also carried out on a confocal microscope (model LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss) using a 488-nm excitation and 540-nm long pass emission filter. Cornea is a transparent tissue, composed of an outer layer called the corneal epithelium, middle stroma, and inner endothelial layer. The morphology of a toad cornea is shown in Fig. 1. The stroma, which forms a major part of the cornea, is largely made up of type II collagen and keratan sulfate proteoglycans. Corneal epithelium is made up of three layers of cells, whereas endothelium is a single cell layer. Abundant proteins in the corneal epithelium from a few species (such as mammal, birds, and zebrafish) have been identified. Corneal epithelium of these species is known to accumulate several metabolic enzymes, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (7Abedinia M. Pain T. Algar E.M. Holmes R.S. Exp.

In this study, we have selected the Indian toad as a representative of anuran amphibian and identified major soluble proteins in the cornea. This would be important not only because anuran corneas are known to have lens-forming competence but also to understand the nature of corneal crystallins in these amphibians. To analyze the abundant proteins expressed in toad cornea, we have resolved corneal soluble proteins on a 12% two-dimensional gel and identified the major protein spots by mass spectrometry. High Accumulation of Ubiquitous Lens Crystallins in the Cornea of Common Indian Toad and Frog—Fig. 2 shows two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of toad (Bufo) total corneal extract. Most of the spots in the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE accumulated in the range of 20 and 50 kDa (Fig. 2). The major spots seen on a two-dimensional gel pattern of toad corneal homogenate were quite similar to those of the spots on two-dimensional gel of the homogenate of a toad lens (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3A and B, two-dimensional analysis of proteins of Bufo cornea and Bufo lens for the sake of direct comparison depicting the separation and position of various crystallins in both tissues. Spots on two-dimensional gel of Bufo lens were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF only. Protein identification of the spots of Bufo cornea is shown in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We selected the major spots (38 spots) of molecular mass between 15 and 50 kDa from one two-dimensional gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. All the protein spots were also subjected to ESI-Q-TOF for final confirmation. Of the 38 spots selected, 17 were confirmed by MS/MS analysis. Of them, 14 spots were confirmed as lens α-, β-, or γ-crystallins. Spots for αA-crystallin, αB-crystallin, and some β-crystallins, namely βB1-, βB3-, βB2-, βA1-, and βA2-, were identified. These MS/MS identification data are presented in Table 1. Two spots for αA and αB-crystallin each were identified. Expression of αB-crystallin is not surprising because it is known to be expressed in a large number of tissues. However, the expression of αA-crystallin in cornea is important because it is considered a lens-specific crystallin. There were five spots for βB2-crystallins, suggesting different forms of this crystallin with similar molecular mass but different pI (Fig. 2, Table 1). Alternatively spliced forms of some β-crystallins have earlier been observed in the lens, where more than one protein spot was identified as βB2-crystallin (35Lampi K.J. Shih M. Ueda Y. Shearer T.R. David L.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 216-224PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wilmarth P.A. Taube J.R. Riviere M.A. Duncan M.K. David L.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2705-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar composition of lens and corneal crystallins. Due to high internal sequence homology, it was difficult to clearly distinguish some spots between various β-crystallins, such as MS/MS data of one spot (spot 15) matched to βA4-crystallin as well as to βB2-crystallin (Table 1). One spot was identified as γI-crystallin (Table 1). These crystallins form >60% of the total proteins from corneal epithelium as approximately estimated by densitometry scan. Because these results were unexpected and could possibly be due to contamination with lens crystallins, we took extreme care during surgical removal of a cornea to make sure that the iris and the lens were not damaged so that potential contamination from lens tissue was avoided. Additionally, before scraping the epithelium, corneas were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline. We obtained similar results analyzing the spots from several other two-dimensional gels by MALDI-TOF/TOF. Almost all the lens-specific crystallins mentioned above were also identified in these independent two-dimensional gels (data not shown).TABLE 1Protein identifications for spots from two-dimensional gel of water-soluble fractions of Bufo corneal epithelium shown in Fig. 2 by MS/MS sequencing MS/MS sequencing was done on one or two precursor ions, and the proteins were identified using internal sequence/sequence tags.

MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis of the major spots from a two-dimensional gel identified several lens crystallins in R. tigrina cornea, suggesting that the accumulation of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins is an inherent characteristic of anuran cornea (Fig. 4, Table 2).TABLE 2Major proteins expressed in R. tigrina corneal epithelium Protein spots from two-dimensional gel shown in Fig. 4 were excised; protein was in-gel digested with trypsin, eluted, and identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF peptide mass fingerprinting.Spot numberProtein identificationMASCOT searchNumber of peptides matchedSequence coveragePeptide mass fingerprint spanTheoretical massObserved mass%kDa1α-Enolase10310289-25047.340.32Phytanol-CoA hydroxylase72102581-2763938.63Solute carrier family 257672635-1362933.94βB1-Crystallin13695125-25329.028.05βB3-Crystallin8573925-19529.024.36βA3-2 Crystallin14196611-21124.025.17βA3-1 Crystallin11884917-21124.025.19B-lymphocyte stimulator8663822-17524.322.710γ-Crystallin I8152322-12217.916.511Glutathione S-transferase998321-13520.325.712βB2-Crystallin short isoform18113451-21220.125.013Tripartite motif protein11993814-13620.923.9 Open table in a new tab Presence of Enzyme Crystallins (Taxon-specific Crystallins) in Anuran Cornea—As many taxa ranging from cephalopods to mammals have enzyme crystallins in their cornea, we expected the expression of some taxon-specific corneal crystallins in the amphibian cornea too. Interestingly, we found several taxon-specific lens crystallins such as τ-crystallin/α-or β-enolase in the toad cornea (Table 1). This taxon-specific lens crystallin is also corneal crystallin in several species (6Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 463: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), including Bufo lens (Fig. 3). Three spots of different pI were identified for τ-crystallin/α-enolase, suggesting the presence of alternatively spliced or post-translationally modified forms (Fig. 2). Such isoforms of τ-crystallin have also been seen in crocodile cornea (14Kathiresan T. Krishnan K. Krishnakumar V. Agrawal R. Anand A. Muralidhar D. Mishra A.K. Dhople V.M. Aggrawal R.K. Sharma Y. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as well as in Bufo lens. Our data demonstrate that toad cornea not only expresses lens α-, β-, and γ-crystallins but some taxon-specific lens crystallins too. We have also identified some proteins in the toad cornea, such as albumin and calgizzarin. However, we have not verified their identification by another method. It is interesting to note that this protein has not been reported in the corneas of bovine, crocodile, fish, and chicken. The function of these proteins in anuran cornea is yet to be ascertained. At this stage, we do not propose to classify them as corneal crystallins. Western Blot and RT-PCR Analysis—We further confirmed by Western blot and RT-PCR analyses that Bufo and Rana corneas express ubiquitous lens crystallins. The proteins of the total corneal homogenate were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Using properly validated antibodies the expression of αB-, βB2-, and γ-crystallins in anuran cornea was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 5A). The observed comparable intensities in the Western blot seen in the case of βB2- and γII-crystallins (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-5) could be due to underestimation of corneal proteins, because many of these proteins have no or little aromatic amino acids. We also used the RT-PCR strategy for confirmation of the expression of a few selected crystallins. Gene-specific primers were designed from different exons to avoid any amplification from genomic DNA contamination. Using gene-specific primers for αA, βB2, βA1, and γII-crystallins, we have demonstrated that transcripts for all these crystallins are present in the cornea (Fig. 5B), thus confirming the results of our proteomics analysis. αB-, βB2-, and γII-Crystallins Localize in Corneal Epithelial Layers—As cornea has several distinct layers (Fig. 1), we probed the localization of these crystallins, selecting a crystallin from each group (αB, βB2, and γ-crystallins). Using properly validated antibodies for specificity against these crystallins, we performed the immunofluorescence localization of these proteins in an adult toad cornea. As seen in Fig. 6, all three crystallins are localized largely in the corneal epithelium (outer cornea). However, low levels of expression of these proteins are also seen in the corneal stroma. The tissue specimens were also stained with secondary antibody, leaving primary antibody to check the specificity. As expected, we did not observe any staining in these samples, indicating that there is no artifact due to non-specific staining (data not shown). These results are consistent with earlier studies in which high accumulation of several proteins has been reported in the epithelial cell layers in cornea (12Xu Y.S. Kantorow M. Davis J. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24645-24652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been considered a characteristic for defining a corneal crystallin (9Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J.

Ubiquitous Crystallins as Crystallins in Lens and Cornea of Anurans—Accumulation of enzymes and proteins in the corneas of several taxa such as cephalopods, fish, crocodiles, and mammals raises the question as to whether the abundant corneal proteins in these species can logically be considered as crystallins (15Piatigorsky J.

Some invertebrates (e.g. squid and scallop) have high concentrations of glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in their corneas that are also lens crystallins (21Piatigorsky J. Kozmik Z. Horwitz J. Ding L. Carosa E. Robison Jr., W.G. Steinbach P.J. Tamm E.R. J. Biol.

(Bangalore). 2002; 27: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The accumulation of ubiquitous lens α-, β-, and γ-crystallins in a cornea has never been reported. However, expression of γ- and αB-crystallins in some corneas could be detected by Western blot or PCR only, suggesting their weak or basal level expression (42Sinha D. Esumi N. Jaworski C. Kozak C.A. Pierce E. Wistow G. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 8-12PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gopal-Srivastava R. Kays W.T. Piatigorsky J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression of αB-crystallin in a cornea is not surprising, as it is known to express widely in several tissues. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the cornea of a toad and frog has abundant ubiquitous lens α-, β-, and γ-crystallins, expressed largely in the outer cornea or corneal epithelium. We now present the anuran case where the same crystallins are used in the lens and cornea. This supports the idea that crystallins are essential for the visual functions of the cornea just as they are for the visual functions of the lens, although their precise role in the two tissues is still not known. This new finding about the accumulation of lens crystallins in anurans cornea supports the idea of the “refracton,” that cornea and lens have many similarities and can be considered as a single refractive unit (17Piatigorsky J. Cornea. 2001; 20: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our data also support the earlier idea that diverse, abundant corneal proteins may have evolved for a crystallin-like role, in addition to their enzymatic or cytoskeletal functions, by a gene-sharing mechanism similar to the lens crystallins (17Piatigorsky J. Cornea. 2001; 20: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 44Piatigorsky J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that during evolution most species have recruited a different set of proteins in cornea; only anurans express ubiquitous lens crystallins in cornea. Possible Implications of Abundant Lens Crystallins in Corneal Transdifferentiation—Our results demonstrate that Bufo and Rana corneas are rich in lens crystallins, unlike the corneas of many other species studied so far. Interestingly, it is well known that the outer cornea of Xenopus transdifferentiates into lens fibers (23Freeman G. J. Exp. Zool. 1963; 54: 39-66Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Henry J.J.

There have also been few reports on the occurrence of corneal transdifferentiation in Rana and Bufo (25Reyer R.W. Q. Rev. Biol. 1954; 29: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 38Simirskii V.N. Ontogenez. 1982; 13: 281-288PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of corneal transdifferentiation to lens is not clearly understood. The prevalence of lens crystallins in anuran cornea is consistent with the lens-forming competence of their cornea, and further studies are necessary to establish the relationship between the presence of lens crystallins in the cornea and the mechanism of transdifferentiation from cornea to lens. It appears that anuran cornea could partly be a lens even before transdifferentiation, and therefore, the final conversion into lens is relatively easy to accomplish as the pathway for differentiation is already in motion. It is possible that the same crystallin transcripts are used during transdifferentiation of corneas into lens as are used in the development of cornea before transdifferentiation. We propose this as a possibility, and this connection is worthy of further studies in order to understand the mechanism of transdifferentiation, which would have significant clinical implications in regenerative biology.

https://openalex.org/W2108018224,"The highly homologous β-arrestin1 and -2 adaptor proteins play important roles in the function of G protein-coupled receptors. Either β-arrestin variant can function as a molecular chaperone for clathrin-mediated receptor internalization. This role depends primarily upon two distinct, contiguous C-terminal β-arrestin motifs recognizing clathrin and the β-adaptin subunit of AP2. However, a molecular basis is lacking to explain the different endocytic efficacies of the two β-arrestin isoforms and the observation that β-arrestin N-terminal substitution mutants can act as dominant negative inhibitors of receptor endocytosis. Despite the near identity of the β-arrestins throughout their N termini, sequence variability is present at a small number of residues and includes tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions. Here we show that corresponding N-terminal (Y/F)VTL sequences in β-arrestin1 and -2 differentially regulate μ-adaptin binding. Our results indicate that the β-arrestin1 Tyr-54 lessens the interaction with μ-adaptin and moreover is a Src phosphorylation site. A gain of endocytic function is obtained with the β-arrestin1 Y54F substitution, which improves both the β-arrestin1 interaction with μ-adaptin and the ability to enhance β2-adrenergic receptor internalization. These data indicate that β-arrestin2 utilizes μ-adaptin as an endocytic partner, and that the inability of β-arrestin1 to sustain a similar degree of interaction with μ-adaptin may result from coordination of Tyr-54 by neighboring residues or its modification by Src kinase. Additionally, these naturally occurring variations in β-arrestins may also differentially regulate the composition of the signaling complexes organized on the receptor.

However, a molecular basis is lacking to explain the different endocytic efficacies of the two β-arrestin isoforms and the observation that β-arrestin N-terminal substitution mutants can act as dominant negative inhibitors of receptor endocytosis. Despite the near identity of the β-arrestins throughout their N termini, sequence variability is present at a small number of residues and includes tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions. Here we show that corresponding N-terminal (Y/F)VTL sequences in β-arrestin1 and -2 differentially regulate μ-adaptin binding. Our results indicate that the β-arrestin1 Tyr-54 lessens the interaction with μ-adaptin and moreover is a Src phosphorylation site. A gain of endocytic function is obtained with the β-arrestin1 Y54F substitution, which improves both the β-arrestin1 interaction with μ-adaptin and the ability to enhance β2-adrenergic receptor internalization. These data indicate that β-arrestin2 utilizes μ-adaptin as an endocytic partner, and that the inability of β-arrestin1 to sustain a similar degree of interaction with μ-adaptin may result from coordination of Tyr-54 by neighboring residues or its modification by Src kinase. Additionally, these naturally occurring variations in β-arrestins may also differentially regulate the composition of the signaling complexes organized on the receptor. The classical view of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 5The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; MEM, minimum essential medium; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; 125I-CYP, [I125]-iodocyanopindolol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HT, histidine-tagged; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; RFP, red fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. signaling describes events that occur via the activation of intracellular G proteins. This type of signaling rapidly wanes as receptors desensitize in the continued presence of ligand, and one of the contributing mechanisms involves ligand-activated GPCRs binding either of the two ubiquitously expressed β-arrestin proteins (1 or 2) (1Lefkowitz R.J.

Evidence indicates that in addition to competitively preventing G protein activation, the β-arrestins can serve both as endocytic adaptors for the GPCRs and simultaneously initiate a signaling phase of their own. The latter phase originates from complexes nucleated by receptor-activated β-arrestins and agonist-occupied receptors (5Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and adaptors mediating cargo recognition play a central role in this process. The main clathrin adaptor AP2 contains four distinct subunits, including the homologous 100-kDa α and β chains that interact with clathrin, a 50-kDa μ chain, which acts as the predominant cargo adaptor, and a smaller 19-kDa σ chain (14Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins containing tyrosine and di-leucine based internalization motifs are recognized and sorted by the μ-adaptin subunit of AP2 (15Pearse B.M. Smith C.J. Owen D.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

However, ligand-activated GPCRs presumably do not directly interact with μ-adaptins, but instead use β-arrestin1 and -2 as primary adaptors. β-arrestins have been shown to bind the β-subunit of AP2, clathrin, and also recruit Src kinases that regulate internalization checkpoints (7Goodman Jr., O.B.

Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), with β-arrestin2 being considerably better than β-arrestin1 in this role. Given the high degree of β-arrestin homology, the marked difference in their endocytic abilities must arise from minor variations in their structures. The β-arrestin1/2 N termini contain several positions where tyrosine is not conserved, suggesting possible regulatory sites underlying some of the differences between their endocytic properties. In this study we show that the conservative substitution of β-arrestin1 tyrosine 54 by phenylalanine (corresponding to phenylalanine 55 in β-arrestin2) increases β-arrestin1 interaction with μ-adaptin and enhances β-arrestin1-mediated β2AR endocytosis to the levels mediated by β-arrestin2. This phenylalanine substitution also results in the loss of a Src phosphorylation site. These findings provide a molecular basis for the preferential internalization of the β2AR via β-arrestin2 and uncover new regulatory functions originating from a single substitution of the β-arrestin N terminus. Materials—Monoclonal antibody against AP-50/μ2 (μ-adaptin) was from BD Biosciences. Anti-hemagglutinin antibody was obtained from Roche Pharmaceuticals, X22 anti-clathrin antibody was purified from a hybridoma cell line (9Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.

Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Sciences Technologies and the yeast two-hybrid vectors and reagents from Clontech. Plasmid Constructs—cDNA vectors for the β2AR/β-arrestin2 full-length and N-terminal fusion proteins used for binding, adenylyl cyclase, and sequestration measurements were constructed in the following manner using the vector containing β2AR/GFP (26Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A 5′ primer containing a 9-base overhang, a SalI restriction site, and 18–21 bases of β-arrestin2, and a 3′ primer with a 9-base overhang, a BglII restriction site followed by a stop codon, and 18–21 bases of β-arrestin2 were used to generate cDNA inserts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing rat β-arrestin2 as a template. The fragments were digested using SalI and BglII and ligated into the β2AR/GFP vector cut with SalI and BamH1. GFP variants of the corresponding fusion proteins were similarly constructed by eliminating the stop codon from the 3′ primer. Fusion proteins of β-arrestin and GFP containing point mutations in the N terminus were constructed using a similar strategy and cloned into the β-arrestin/GFP vector (8Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.

The cDNA for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was also constructed by PCR. A fragment derived from the N-terminal domain (1–80) of the human β-arrestin2 was cloned into EcoRI and XhoI of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences AB). Sequences were confirmed using an automated ABI DNA sequencer. Point mutations were generated in β-arrestin1(Y54F) and β-arrestin2(F55Y) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Receptor Binding Assays—Agonist and antagonist binding assays using 125I-CYP were performed as described (27Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Adenylyl Cyclase Assays—Measurement of whole cell cAMP was performed using Dowex and Alumina column chromatography as described (28Barak L.S. Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G.

Sequestration Assays—Measurement of receptor sequestration by flow cytometry was performed as described in (27Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of sequestration by [3H]CGP-12177 was performed as follows. HEK-293 cells plated at a density of 3 × 106/100-mm dish were transfected with receptor cDNA augmented with empty vector cDNA to a total of 5 μg using a calcium phosphate protocol (28Barak L.S. Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cells were trypsinized 5–6 h later and plated at a density of 750,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate and incubated in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and the media replaced with warm MEM or MEM containing 500 nm isoproterenol. After 30 min at 37° C in a 5% CO2 incubator the cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, covered with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended by trituration at a density of 1.25 × 106/ml. 100 μl volumes of cells were incubated in 15 ml of polypropylene tubes (Fisher) with 50 μl of 30 nm [3H]CGP-12177 (Amersham Biosciences) with or without 1 μm propranolol for 90 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and collected on a Brandel harvester with Whatman GF/C filters for β analysis. GST Fusion Protein Purification—GST pull-down experiments using GST-β-arrestin1, GST-β-arrestin1(Y54F), GST-β-arrestin2, GST-β-arrestin2-(N1–80) and GST-β-arrestin2(N1–372) were performed as described previously (29Beaulieu J.M.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Fusion genes expressing either β-arrestin2 or the N-terminal 80 amino acids of β-arrestin2 were transformed into Tyr-187 yeast strains or AH-109 as described previously (9Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The ability of the expressed proteins to interact in yeast was assessed by a growth assay using histidine- or adenine-deficient media as opposed to a primary β-galactosidase activity screen as described previously (9Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Sequences inserted into the yeast vectors were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Peptide Phosphorylation—Peptides were synthesized (Sigma Genosys) and diluted to a working concentration of ∼0.5–1 mm in sterile water. Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol provided with the purified, active c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 20 units of active c-Src was added to a reaction mixture containing substrate peptide (100 μm/assay), [α-32P]ATP (1 mCi/100 μl; 3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1× Src reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol). After 10 min at 30 °C, 40% trichloroacetic acid was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was transferred to the center of a 2 × 2 cm2 P81 Whatman paper square. The squares were washed five times for 5 min each wash in 0.75% phosphoric acid. The squares were then washed once in acetone, transferred to a scintillation vial with scintillation mixture, and incorporated counts were measured in a scintillation counter. Background reactions (no enzyme) for each peptide were performed. This recorded value (no enzyme added) was then subtracted from the respective reactions. The normalized (substrate concentration), background-subtracted values were plotted using GraphPad Prism. The positive control was a peptide optimized for Src substrate specificity (Upstate Biotechnology). β-Arrestin1 Purification and Phosphorylation—β-Arrestin1-HT (histidine tagged) and β-arrestin1(Y54F)-HT were subcloned into the pET-21b vector (Novagen) and expressed in DH5α cells (37 °C) with a 16 h isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. β-arrestins were partially purified from bacterial lysates using Probond nickel-charged resin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 proteins (done with increasing amounts of purified protein) was performed with the same reaction conditions as with the peptide reactions (described above) for 10 min at 30 °C. SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added to the reactions, and they were immediately boiled for 3 min and loaded to a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and exposed directly to film or blotted for antityrosine (PY99, SantaCruz Biotechnology) or for β-arrestin1 (BD Biosciences). Western blots were visualized using ECL (Pierce). β-Arrestin Phosphorylation in HEK-293 Cells—β-Arrestin-FLAG cDNAs were transfected into HEK-293-β2AR stable cell lines grown in 12-well plates using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 nm isoproterenol for 1 min, lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with protease inhibitors added (Roche). Lysates were diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). M2 anti-FLAG conjugated agarose (Sigma) beads were added to the diluted lysates and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times in Tris-buffered saline, and 2× SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added directly to the beads and gently mixed. The supernatants were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies against phosphotyrosines (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the FLAG tag (Sigma). Blots were visualized with ECL (Pierce), and densitometry was performed with the FluoroS Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad). The phosphotyrosine signal was confirmed by directly treating the immunoprecipitates with 10–20 units of YOP (Yersinia outermembrane protein) tyrosine phosphatase (Upstate) at 30 °C for 3 min followed by Western analysis as described above. Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy and immunostaining of hemagglutinin-tagged receptor or clathrin was performed as described (9Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 26Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. β-Arrestin1 is identical to β-arrestin2 at ∼80% of their N-terminal residues. Of the 32 nonidentical residues, five occur at tyrosines, shown in bold in Fig. 1A. Four of these tyrosines occur in β-arrestin1 and are conservatively substituted in β-arrestin2 by three phenylalanines and nonconservatively by a histidine. Of particular note is the first variation corresponding to Y54/F55 (β-arrestin1/2) because mutation of V53/D54 (β-arrestin1/2) generates internalization-deficient dominant negative β-arrestins (30Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The flanking sequences (Y54/F55)VTL (β-arrestin1/2) form the only putative contiguous endocytic motifs present in the N termini of β-arrestin1 or 2 that could potentially interact with AP2. In β-arrestin1 the YXXL sequence mirrors a classical cargo AP2, μ-adaptin sorting signal, whereas in β-arrestin2 the FXXL sequence mirrors the μ-subunit sorting signal observed in membrane-associated GP180/carboxypeptidase D (13Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the residues Tyr/Phe of the respective sequences in β-arrestin1/2 are conserved across species (Fig. 1B). To determine whether β-arrestin2 could directly bind μ-adaptin we employed a yeast two-hybrid assay. cDNAs for full-length β-arrestin2, truncated β-arrestin2(N1–55), truncated β-arrestin2(N1–80), and for the substitution mutant β-arrestin2(F55A, L58A) were cloned into yeast two-hybrid bait vectors. cDNA for the full-length μ-adaptin subunit of AP2 was cloned into a yeast prey vector. We then assessed the binding interaction corresponding to a distinct bait vector and the μ-adaptin prey vector using a growth assay on media deficient in leucine/tryptophan/histidine. The full-length β-arrestin2 (Fig. 2A) and β-arrestin2(N1–80) (data not shown) rescued the growth of the yeast on the histidine-deficient plate. In contrast, the β-arrestin2(N1–55) bait vector (data not shown) and β-arrestin2(F55A, L58A) (Fig. 2A), the full-length β-arrestin2 mutant with alanine substitutions at the putative μ-adaptin binding motif, were unable to promote yeast growth on the histidine-deficient plate. We employed a GST fusion approach to test further whether β-arrestin2 could bind to an AP2 complex in vitro. This requires modifying the C terminus of β-arrestin2 that contains clathrin and β-adaptin binding motifs, because isolation of μ-adaptin might occur from its association with a clathrin-β-adaptin complex. In the C-terminal β-arrestin2 truncation mutant, β-arrestin2(N1–372) the clathrin and β-adaptin binding motifs are absent. Columns containing C-terminal GST fusion proteins of either full-length β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin2(N1–372) were exposed to a mouse brain lysate. Anti μ-adaptin antibody immunoblotting of the retained protein eluate from either the β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin2(N1–372) column demonstrated a 50-kDa band characteristic of μ-adaptin. The relative amount of each GST-fused β-arrestin protein present on a column is shown by the Coomassie staining (Fig. 2B, lower panel). This result suggests that a site responsible for μ-adaptin binding exists in β-arrestin2 that is independent of the C-terminal β-adaptin and clathrin binding motifs. Surprisingly, β-arrestin2(N1–372) bound 3-fold more μ-adaptin than full-length β-arrestin2. Han et al. (31Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that C-terminal β-arrestin truncation mutants assume pre-activated conformations. This suggests that a μ-adaptin binding motif of β-arrestin2 may become fully exposed only upon β-arrestin-receptor binding, in a manner analogous to that postulated for the β-arrestin-β-adaptin binding motif (31Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We next passed a mouse brain lysate through a column containing a C-terminal GST fusion protein of β-arrestin2(N1–80) to determine whether the β-arrestin2 N terminus could be responsible for the previous observations. The immunoblot corresponding to GST-β-arrestin2(N1–80), but not GST alone, also yielded a 50-kDa band when probed with anti-μ adaptin antibody (Fig. 2C). The immunostaining of the total brain lysate, which contains μ-adaptin as part of the AP2 complex, is shown as positive control. If residues 55–58 of β-arrestin2 are implicated in μ-adaptin binding and act as a receptor sorting motif, then fusion of the N-terminal part of β-arrestin2 to the β2AR could affect the cellular localization of the receptor. To test this hypothesis we constructed a β2AR fused to the first 78 residues of β-arrestin2, β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1–78) and characterized its response to agonist. We first assessed some pharmacological properties of β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1–78) compared with the wild type β2AR. The two receptors have equal affinities for the antagonist iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP, Table 1) and the agonist isoproterenol (as measured with membrane preparations of receptors by displacement of 125I-CYP). They also express similarly in terms of the proportion of receptors in the G protein-bound high affinity state (Table 1), and despite a shift in the EC50 for cAMP production (Table 1), the β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1–78) chimera-activated adenylyl cyclase with similar efficacy to the β2AR (not shown).TABLE 1Pharmacological profile and basal sequestration of β2AR chimeras in HEK-293 cells Binding of [125I]CYP or CGP-12177 was measured on membrane preparations of HEK-293 cells expressing the β2AR or β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1-78). Results are representative of three independent experiments. Competitive displacement of [125I]CYP by isoproterenol in membrane preparations derived from HEK-293 cells that were transfected with bovine Gs-α subunits and either β2AR or β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1-78). Normalized adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in HEK-293 cells in response to increasing concentrations of isoproterenol for those cells transfected with either of the receptor chimeras. Basal sequestration of the two receptor isoforms in HEK-293 cells as measured by ligand binding was not significantly different.

To identify the amino acids responsible, sequestration of β2AR/β-arrestin2 fusion proteins constructed using different peptide segments of the β-arrestin2 N terminus was assessed by the binding of the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177 (Fig. 3A). The ability of the peptide fusions to augment sequestration disappeared with truncation at Phe-55, suggesting that amino acids 50–60 may contain a canonical sorting signal. If β-arrestin2(N1–78) does contain an internalization signal normally employed by β-arrestin2 for endocytosis of GPCRs, then β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1–78) should traffic to an endosomal vesicular compartment containing wild type β2AR. In Fig. 3B isoproterenol-activated wild type β2AR-GFP is observed to redistribute from the plasma membrane to endosomes that contain a fluorescent transferrin marker (32Sheff D. Pelletier L. O'Connell C.B. W-arrestinen G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist a GFP fusion protein of β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1–78) is also predominantly plasma membrane bound (Fig. 3C) like the β2AR (26Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When expressed in the same cell, β2AR-RFP (Fig. 3C, lower left panel) and β2AR/β-arrestin2N(1–78/GFP) (Fig. 3C, upper right panel) redistribute to a common intracellular vesicular compartment in response to agonist (Fig. 3C, lower right panel). The type of fluorescent protein tag (RFP versus GFP) attached to the β2AR does not influence its endosomal localization (data not shown). These data establish that the β2AR and β2AR/β-arrestin2(N1–78) share a similar pattern of cellular distribution before and after agonist stimulation. Altogether, our data are consistent with a hypothesis that the N terminus of β-arrestin2 functions as an FVTL μ-adaptin binding motif (YVTL in β-arrestin1) that could participate in the regulation of β2AR internalization. An interesting difference between the two putative μ-adaptin binding motifs is the potential for regulation of YVTL in β-arrestin1 by tyrosine phosphorylation. However, there are four tyrosines present in the N-terminal part of β-arrestin1 that are not conserved in β-arrestin2 (Fig. 4A). Using an in vitro assay, we investigated whether β-arrestin1 is a Src substrate because β2AR stimulation leads to a rapid association of the activated tyrosine kinase Src to the receptor in a β-arrestin1-dependent fashion (19Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). To assess the phosphorylation of the N-terminal tyrosines in β-arrestin1 that are not conserved in β-arrestin2, we synthesized the corresponding peptides (Fig. 4, A and B). The site prediction program NetPhos (Expasy Tools) had scored two of the β-arrestin1 N-terminal tyrosines as phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4B). Even though it did not score highly as a phosphorylation candidate, β-arrestin1 peptide 2 was the only substrate that underwent significant in vitro Src phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, peptide 2 contains the canonical Y54XXϕ sorting signal and corresponds to the F55XXϕ sequence that we described above as a potential μ-adaptin binding motif in β-arrestin2. Examination of the crystal structure of inactive β-arrestin1 indicates that Tyr-54 is only partially exposed. Therefore we sought to establish whether this residue could be phosphorylated by Src in full-length β-arrestin1. Co-incubation in vitro of purified Src and β-arrestin1 revealed that Src was able to phosphorylate full-length β-arrestin1 (Fig. 4C), and the single point mutation Y54F was sufficient to prevent it (Fig. 4D). To confirm that similar Src phosphorylation occur in cells, we measured the tyrosine phosphorylation of over-expressed β-arrestin1 before and after exposing the β2AR to agonist. The specificity of the phosphotyrosine antibody used in this assay was assessed by immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged β-arrestin1 and treating the immunoprecipitates with YOP tyrosine phosphatase (Fig. 5A). Tyrosine phosphatase treatment almost completely eliminated the anti-phosphotyrosine PY99 signal confirming the specificity. We next observed in cells that β-arrestin1 as well as β-arrestin1(Y54F) are both constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 5B). However, isoproterenol exposure leads to a significant increase in β-arrestin1 tyrosine phosphorylation that is not observed in β-arrestin1(Y54F) (Fig. 5, B and C). These data suggest that β-arrestin1 is tyrosine phosphorylated on residue 54 in response to β2AR stimulation. Agonist-induced β2AR sequestration is greatly reduced in β-arrestin2 knock-out cells and unaffected in β-arrestin1 knock-out cells (33Kohout T.A. Lin F-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar), and these observations are in agreement with the idea that β-arrestin2 is the predominant regulator of GPCR internalization. Therefore we examined whether the Y54F mutation in β-arrestin1, which recreates the FVTL sequence of β-arrestin2, would provide a gain of function for β2AR internalization. HEK-293 cells expressing the β2AR were transiently transfected with either β-arrestin1, β-arrestin1(Y54F) or β-arrestin2, and agonist-induced sequestration of the β2AR was measured. Over-expression of β-arrestin1 did not change the extent of β2AR internalization (Fig. 5D). By contrast, overexpression of β-arrestin1(Y54F) or β-arrestin2 increased β2AR sequestration by 18 and 28%, respectively (Fig. 5D). Using GST pull-down, we evaluated the interaction of β-arrestin1, β-arrestin1(Y54F), and β-arrestin2 with μ-adaptin to determine whether the gain of function of β-arrestin1(Y54F) in promoting sequestration correlated with an increase in its affinity toward μ-adaptin. The three GST β-arrestin fusion proteins interact equally well with clathrin, and the β-arrestin1 GST fusion interacts much less well with μ-adaptin than the β-arrestin2 fusion protein (Fig. 5E). Remarkably, β-arrestin1(Y54F) is able to pull-down μ-adaptin like β-arrestin2 (Fig. 5E). No clathrin or μ-adaptin was retained by the GST alone (Fig. 5E, left lane control). These data strongly support the hypothesis that the FVTL sequence in β-arrestin2 mediates an interaction with the μ-adaptin subunit of the AP2 complex during receptor endocytosis. Moreover it suggests that the tyrosine at position 54 of β-arrestin1 reduces the extent of this interaction. Sequence differences between the two β-arrestin isoforms are highly conserved across species, suggesting that differences in their activities may arise even from seemingly conserved amino acid substitutions. To date, few differences between the regulatory behaviors of the β-arrestins have been demonstrated, but cell-based studies have indicated a preference of many GPCRs for β-arrestin2 during clathrin-mediated internalization (24Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the natural Tyr to Phe variation between position 54 in β-arrestin1 and position 55 in β-arrestin2 generates differences in β-arrestin binding to μ-adaptin and β-arrestin-promoted β2AR internalization. Interestingly, despite β-arrestin1 Y54LTV defining a canonical YXXϕ μ-adaptin binding motif, β-arrestin1 has less affinity for μ-adaptin than β-arrestin2. However, the β-arrestin1(Y54F) mutant binds μ-adaptin as well as β-arrestin2 and is a gain of function mutation for β2AR sequestration. According to available structural information, in the absence of tyrosine 54 phosphorylation, this same tyrosine is presumably engaged via a hydrogen bond with Arg-52 (31Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), constraining its availability for interaction with μ-adaptin. Crystal structure of the β-arrestin indicates that the Tyr/Phe of this putative motif is not fully exposed, however the in vitro and in cellulo phosphorylation of Tyr-54 by Src demonstrate the accessibility of this residue. Src-mediated β-arrestin1 phosphorylation appears within a minute of receptor activation, and therefore most likely precedes the recruitment of activated β-arrestin-receptor complexes to coated pits, where Src is known to phosphorylate at a minimum both clathrin and dynamin (20Wilde A.

Notably, the Src inhibitor PP2 does not perturb the recruitment rate of β-arrestin1 to the β2AR (data not shown). Therefore, a Src-dependent Tyr-54 β-arrestin1 phosphorylation could potentially serve either as a negative regulator for stabilizing AP2/β-arrestin1/receptor scaffolds or possibly represents a means for recruiting SH2-directed signaling proteins modulating the nature of signaling scaffold organized by β-arrestins. Such a prospect is of specific interest for receptors like the mGluR1a, which can recruit, depending on the nature of the ligand, either of the β-arrestins or selectively only β-arrestin1 (34Mundell S.J. Matharu A.L. Pula G. Holman D. Roberts P.J. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure of the inactive β-arrestin1 indicates that a direct μ-adaptin interaction via the sequence (Y/F)XXL alone would require a major conformational change in β-arrestin to unmask the leucine upon receptor binding. Evidence suggests that receptor-activated β-arrestin can undergo substantial conformational rearrangement with receptor activation (36Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, we observed an interaction between β-arrestin and μ-adaptin in the absence of receptor activation, suggesting a less substantial molecular rearrangement, but one also consistent with predicted β-arrestin behavior (36Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Identifying the aggregate of binding determinants on the β-arrestin surface that engage μ-adaptin pre- and post-receptor activation will most probably require co-crystallization of the participating components including adaptins, β-arrestins, and receptors. The β-arrestin2 interaction with both μ- and β-adaptin raises the question of the chronology for these interactions. The proposed β-arrestin2 C-tail conformational change upon receptor binding likely occurs before the tail is able to interact with β-adaptin (31Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) through arginine residues 394/396 (18Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Indeed, arginine 394 forms part of the β-arrestin2 polar core and is thus unavailable for binding β-adaptin unless a conformational rearrangement occurs in this region secondary to receptor interaction (31Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Our data show that inactive β-arrestin2 can interact with the μ-subunit. Therefore inactive β-arrestin2 might first bind AP2 through μ-adaptin. Next, a stronger interaction with AP2 would follow because of the additional β-adaptin binding that occurs after receptor-mediated conformational changes of β-arrestin2. An increasing number of signaling proteins like mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), JNK, and NF-κB, have been associated with scaffolds formed by receptors and β-arrestins. The demonstration that β-arrestin-dependent signaling requires clathrin-dependent localization of receptor-β-arrestin complexes suggests sequence differences between β-arrestin1 and 2 that modulate the membrane localization of activated receptors could affect this novel, nonclassical means of GPCR signal transduction. Consequently, elucidating the principles underlying the dynamics of receptor-β-arrestin scaffold formation will help explain the G-protein-independent cellular response to a large variety of agonists ranging from ions to hormones.
