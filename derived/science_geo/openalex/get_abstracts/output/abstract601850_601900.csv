Here, we found that microglia undergo differentiation phases, discernable by transcriptomic signatures and chromatin accessibility landscapes, which can diverge in adult males and females.

Microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS, constitute the first line of defense against injury and infections. They originate from yolk-sac macrophages (YSM), enter the brain when the first neurons are generated (around embryonic day [E] 9.5 in mice) (Casano and Peri, 2015Casano A.M. Peri F.

Alongside their immune roles, recent studies have shown that both fetal and adult microglia also contribute to a variety of processes including brain development, homeostasis, and function. At the cellular or circuit level, microglia regulate synaptic transmission, synaptic pruning and formation, cell death and survival, as well as embryonic wiring (Hong et al., 2016Hong S.

Consistent with their diverse roles, microglia have been linked to the initiation or progression of several developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), several auto-immune diseases, and multiple sclerosis (MS) (Colonna and Butovsky, 2017Colonna M.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). In recent years, the microbiome has emerged as a key regulator of brain circuitry, neuro-physiology, and behavior (Braniste et al., 2014Braniste V. Al-Asmakh M. Kowal C. Anuar F. Abbaspour A. Tóth M.

As such, the absence of gut microbiota in germ-free mice (GF) or its dysbiosis constitutes an aggravating factor in mouse models of ASD and PD (Hsiao et al., 2013Hsiao E.Y. McBride S.W. Hsien S.

Remarkably, the lack of microbiome perturbs microglial properties via the release of short-chain fatty acids (Erny et al., 2015Erny D. Hrabě de Angelis A.L. Jaitin D. Wieghofer P. Staszewski O. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Mahlakoiv T. Jakobshagen K. Buch T. et al.Host microbiota constantly control maturation and function of microglia in the CNS.Nat.

David E. Zelada González F. Perrin P. et al.Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis.Science. 2016; 353: aad8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Thus, microglia that lie at the interface between environmental signals and brain circuitry throughout embryonic and adult life are prime candidates for contributing to these effects. In addition to extrinsic signals, intrinsic factors such as sexual identity may play important roles in microglial function. Rodent microglia exhibit sexually dimorphic properties in pain perception, contribute to brain masculinization, and show differences in brain colonization in males and females (Lenz and McCarthy, 2015Lenz K.M. McCarthy M.M. A starring role for microglia in brain sex differences.Neuroscientist. 2015; 21: 306-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Mapplebeck et al., 2016Mapplebeck J.C. Beggs S.

Sex differences in microglial colonization of the developing rat brain.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 948-963PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently reported that microglia show transcriptomic differences in females and males along postnatal development (Hanamsagar et al., 2017Hanamsagar R. Alter M.D. Block C.S. Sullivan H. Bolton J.L. Bilbo S.D. Generation of a microglial developmental index in mice and in humans reveals a sex difference in maturation and immune reactivity.Glia. 2017; 65: 1504-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Given that some disorders show marked sexual bias, with, for instance, ASD affecting more males and auto-immune diseases more females (McCarthy and Wright, 2017McCarthy M.M. Wright C.L. Convergence of sex differences and the neuroimmune system in autism spectrum disorder.Biol. Psychiatry. 2017; 81: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Nelson and Lenz, 2017Nelson L.H. Lenz K.M. The immune system as a novel regulator of sex differences in brain and behavioral development.J. Neurosci. Res. 2017; 95: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it will be essential to dissect how sexual identity affects microglial differentiation or function. Here, we asked how the microbiome and intrinsic properties of males and females contribute to the differentiation and maturation of microglia. We performed developmental transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses on microglia purified from male and female mice under either specific-pathogen free (SPF) or GF conditions at different stages of development and found that microglia undergo distinct phases of differentiation, start expressing sensome genes in utero, and acquire sexually dimorphic transcriptomic profiles postnatally. Intriguingly, microglia from male and female mice responded differently to the permanent lack of microbiome: GF conditions most severely affected embryonic microglia in males, whereas in females the most marked perturbations were seen in adults. Antibiotic treatment of adult mice revealed that microbiome depletion has both short- and long-term impact on microglia with distinct sexually biased components. Finally, in human fetal microglia, we uncovered significant overlap with the murine microglial transcriptome and a parallel lack of microglial sexual dimorphism in mid-gestation. Taken together, our work reveals that the maternal microbiome influences the maturation of embryonic microglia. Furthermore, it shows a remarkable sexually dimorphic response of microglia to environmental perturbations, which has major implications for our comprehension of the roles of these cells in physiological and pathological conditions. To investigate how microglia differentiate, we first performed microarrays to examine gene expression profiles of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified YS progenitors and microglia, at five embryonic stages, on the day of birth (P0), and in adults (P60), by pooling microglia from males and females together (Figures 1A–1C and S1A–S1C). Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), we identified distinct phases of differentiation (Figures 1A and 1B): (1) progenitor phase (YSM and E10.5), (2) embryonic phase 1 (E12.5 to E14.5), (3) embryonic phase 2 (E16.5 to P0), and (4) adult stage, consistent with previous studies (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016Matcovitch-Natan O. Winter D.R. Giladi A. Vargas Aguilar S. Spinrad A. Sarrazin S. Ben-Yehuda H. David E. Zelada González F. Perrin P. et al.Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis.Science. 2016; 353: aad8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). To examine biological differences between phases, we performed gene ontology (GO) analyses on significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Figures 1C and S1C; Table S1). The progenitor phase was characterized by enriched expression of 4,582 genes (clusters 1 to 3) involved in cell cycle, proliferation, and DNA replication, including Klf9 and E2f6 (Figures 1C and S1C), consistent with anatomical studies (Swinnen et al., 2013Swinnen N. Smolders S. Avila A. Notelaers K. Paesen R. Ameloot M. Brône B. Legendre P. Rigo J.M. Complex invasion pattern of the cerebral cortex bymicroglial cells during development of the mouse embryo.Glia. 2013; 61: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To assess proliferation, we used FUCCI mice, in which cell-cycle phases can be visualized by expression of fluorescent protein reporters (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S. Fukami K. Miyata T. Miyoshi H. et al.Visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular cell-cycle progression.Cell. 2008; 132: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar), and confirmed that CD45+CD11b+ cells, likely representing microglial precursors (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F. Greter M. Leboeuf M. Nandi S. See P. Gokhan S. Mehler M.F. Conway S.J. Ng L.G. Stanley E.R. et al.Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages.Science. 2010; 330: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (3174) Google Scholar), displayed the highest proliferative rate during the progenitor phase (Figures 1D and S1B). Embryonic phases 1 (1,299 DEGs; cluster 4) and 2 (2,116 DEGs; cluster 5) were characterized by high expression of genes linked with nervous system development and function, cellular assembly and organization, cell-to-cell signaling, and cellular movement, including PlexinA2, Cxcr4, and Igf1 (Figures 1C and S1C) (Marín, 2013Marín O. Cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the migration of neocortical interneurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2013; 38: 2019-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Ueno et al., 2013Ueno M. Fujita Y. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Kikuta J. Ishii M. Yamashita T. Layer V cortical neurons require microglial support for survival during postnatal development.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Finally, the adult stage was characterized by differential expression of 3,508 genes (clusters 6 and 7) involved in cellular development and immune activation, including Ccr5, Mafb, and Jun (Figures 1C and S1C) (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016Matcovitch-Natan O. Winter D.R. Giladi A. Vargas Aguilar S. Spinrad A. Sarrazin S. Ben-Yehuda H. David E. Zelada González F. Perrin P. et al.Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis.Science. 2016; 353: aad8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Thus, our analysis indicates that microglia exhibit the potential for specific functions at distinct stages of brain development. One key function of microglia is to respond to their environment through the expression of the sensome genes, which were first described in adult microglia (Hickman et al., 2013Hickman S.E. Kingery N.D. Ohsumi T.K. Borowsky M.L. Wang L.C. Means T.K. El Khoury J. The microglial sensome revealed by direct RNA sequencing.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). We found that 9 sensome genes were specifically highly expressed in the progenitor phase and 9 others in embryonic phases, and the majority of the sensome genes showed highest levels of transcripts in adults (Figures 1E and 1F; Table S1). Thus, microglia begin to express sensome genes in utero, raising the possibility that they could respond to local or systemic changes during embryogenesis.Figure S1Microglial Changes during Development, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Gating strategy for flow cytometry purification of CD45low, CD11b+, F4/80+, CD64+, Ly6C- yolk-sac progenitors and microglia.(B) Gating strategy of flow cytometric analysis of cells from FUCCI mice showing CD45low, CD11b+, F4/80+, and Azami green+ cells.(C) The seven clusters characterizing the different developmental phases of microglia.The plots show the expression of the corresponding genes that are associated with these functions during development.

To understand how microglia evolves during differentiation, we applied co-expression network analyses (CENA) (Ulas et al., 2017Ulas T. Pirr S. Fehlhaber B. Bickes M.S. Loof T.G. Vogl T. Mellinger L. Heinemann A.S. Burgmann J. Schöning J. et al.S100-alarmin-induced innate immune programming protects newborn infants from sepsis.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which highlight gene clusters strongly expressed in each phase as well as their temporal evolution, focusing either on transcription factors (TFs) or all DEGs (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S1). Genes encoding TFs, including Sall1 or Irf8 that have been linked to microglial differentiation (Buttgereit et al., 2016Buttgereit A. Lelios I. Yu X. Vrohlings M. Krakoski N.R. Gautier E.L.

Using Sall1gfp/+ mice (Takasato et al., 2004Takasato M. Osafune K. Matsumoto Y. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Meguro H. Aburatani H. Asashima M. Nishinakamura R. Identification of kidney mesenchymal genes by a combination of microarray analysis and Sall1-GFP knockin mice.Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we confirmed this temporal progression: few cells expressed Sall1 at E11.5, 72.8% of microglia were GFP+ at E14.5, and almost all the cells were labeled in adults (Figure 2D). To assess whether the identified DEGs might regulate early microglial activity, we focused on genes specifically expressed during embryonic phases, such as Cxcr4. This gene encodes a chemokine receptor expressed by microglia and was proposed to regulate microglial colonization in response to focal expression of its ligand, CXCL12 (Arnò et al., 2014Arnò B. Grassivaro F. Rossi C. Bergamaschi A. Castiglioni V. Furlan R. Greter M. Favaro R. Comi G. Becher B. et al.Neural progenitor cells orchestrate microglia migration and positioning into the developing cortex.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The abundance of Cxcr4 transcripts peaked at E16.5 (Figure 2E), and protein expression was confirmed at E18.5 in the neocortex (Figure 2F). To investigate the role of this receptor, we generated mice in which Cxcr4 could be conditionally knocked out (Cxcr4 cKO) using tamoxifen-inducible cre under the control of cx3cr1 (Cx3cr1creERT2/+;Cxcr4flox/flox mice), which is expressed by microglia (Yona et al., 2013Yona S. Kim K.W. Wolf Y. Mildner A. Varol D. Breker M. Strauss-Ayali D. Viukov S. Guilliams M. Misharin A. et al.Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis.Immunity. 2013; 38: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Conditional inactivation of microglial Cxcr4 was confirmed by CXCR4 immunostaining (Figure 2F). Using specific markers to delineate cortical layers, we observed a significant and region-specific decrease in the number of microglia in the neocortex SVZ/VZ of cKO at E18.5, 2 days after the peak of Cxcr4 expression (Figures 2E and 2G). These results indicate a cell-autonomous role of CXCR4 in the embryonic distribution of microglia and highlights the validity of our approach to identify candidate regulators of stage-dependent microglial activity. To investigate whether sexual identity influences microglial development, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on FACS-purified microglia from E18.5, shortly after the initiation of production of sex hormones (Nelson and Lenz, 2017Nelson L.H. Lenz K.M. The immune system as a novel regulator of sex differences in brain and behavioral development.J. Neurosci. Res. 2017; 95: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as well as from adult brains of female and male SPF mice (Figure S2). At E18.5, microglia purified from female and male brains displayed low numbers of DEGs mostly present on the X and Y chromosomes (Figure S2A; Table S2). This limited embryonic transcriptomic sexual dimorphism increased in adult females and males (Figures S2A and S2E), consistent with recent studies (Hanamsagar et al., 2017Hanamsagar R. Alter M.D. Block C.S. Sullivan H. Bolton J.L. Bilbo S.D. Generation of a microglial developmental index in mice and in humans reveals a sex difference in maturation and immune reactivity.Glia. 2017; 65: 1504-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar): female microglia displayed higher expression of genes associated with inflammatory response, apoptotic process, and response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figure S2B; Table S2), revealed by GO analyses using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Thus, microglia appeared to be in a more immune-activated state in females, in line with previous studies showing stronger innate and adaptive immune responses in females (Klein and Flanagan, 2016Klein S.L. Flanagan K.L. Sex differences in immune responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Among the adult DEGs, expression of 9 genes described as interferon-stimulated genes (S100a8, S100a9, Ifit1, Ifit2, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Irf1, Ccnd3, and Gbp5) was higher in female SPF mice, and the expression of sensome genes, such as Gpr34 and Ccrl2, also differed between males and females (Table S2). We confirmed the differential expression of several DEGs using real-time qPCR (qRT-PCR, n = 12 DEGs) (Figure S2C; Table S3). Furthermore, we examined the distribution of microglia in males and females that have been reported to exhibit sex-specific differences in microglial density (Lenz and McCarthy, 2015Lenz K.M. McCarthy M.M. A starring role for microglia in brain sex differences.Neuroscientist. 2015; 21: 306-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As illustrated in the neocortex, while there was a small transient increase in microglial density at E18.5 in females as compared to males, the colonization was largely similar in both sexes (Figures S2D and S2E). Thus, adult microglia show some sex-specific divergence in their transcriptomic signatures although with limited differences in their colonization patterns. Considering the effect of gut microbiota in adults (Erny et al., 2015Erny D. Hrabě de Angelis A.L. Jaitin D. Wieghofer P. Staszewski O. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Mahlakoiv T. Jakobshagen K.

Most GWAS loci represent clusters of common, noncoding variants from which pinpointing causal genes remains challenging. Here we combined data from 718,734 individuals to discover rare and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%) coding variants associated with BMI. We identified 14 coding variants in 13 genes, of which 8 variants were in genes (ZBTB7B, ACHE, RAPGEF3, RAB21, ZFHX3, ENTPD6, ZFR2 and ZNF169) newly implicated in human obesity, 2 variants were in genes (MC4R and KSR2) previously observed to be mutated in extreme obesity and 2 variants were in GIPR. The effect sizes of rare variants are ~10 times larger than those of common variants, with the largest effect observed in carriers of an MC4R mutation introducing a stop codon (p.Tyr35Ter, MAF = 0.01%), who weighed ~7 kg more than non-carriers. Pathway analyses based on the variants associated with BMI confirm enrichment of neuronal genes and provide new evidence for adipocyte and energy expenditure biology, widening the potential of genetically supported therapeutic targets in obesity. Exome-wide analysis identifies rare and low-frequency coding variants associated with body mass index.

Despite decades of neuroscience research using MRI, there is still a lack of validated and widely accessible tools for mapping the large-scale network architecture of anatomically connected regions in an individual human brain. There are currently two standard approaches available for imaging anatomical connectivity in humans: tractography from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and structural covariance network (SCN) analysis. Diffusion-weighted tractography seeks to reconstruct the trajectory of axonal tracts from the principal directions of the diffusion of water molecules, which tend to move in parallel to bundles of nerve fibers. This technique applies to data collected from a single participant and is a powerful tool for elucidating localized patterns of anatomical connectivity. However, it remains challenging to use tractography to map connectivity between all brain regions because long-distance projections (e.g., between bilaterally homologous areas of the cortex via the corpus callosum) are systematically under-recovered (Dauguet et al., 2007Dauguet J.

Moreover, there is growing concern that the statistical analysis of diffusion-weighted data is compromised by head movement (Walker et al., 2012Walker L. Gozzi M. Lenroot R. Thurm A. Behseta B.

USA. 2014; 111: 16574-16579Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Future improvements seem likely to depend, in part, on advances in scanner design and image acquisition methods, which may become increasingly the domain of a few highly specialized centers (Lerch et al., 2017Lerch J.P. van der Kouwe A.J. Raznahan A. Paus T. Johansen-Berg H. Miller K.L. Smith S.M. Fischl B. Sotiropoulos S.N. Studying neuroanatomy using MRI.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Structural covariance analysis uses simpler measurements to reconstruct whole-brain networks, but the neurobiological interpretation of SCNs is problematic, and, crucially, this method typically depends on MRI data collected from a large number of participants. The basic idea of structural covariance analysis is simple: a single morphometric feature, like cortical thickness, is measured at each region in multiple images. Then the covariance (usually, in fact, the correlation) between regional estimates of cortical thickness is estimated for each possible pair of regions, resulting in a single SCN for the whole group (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013aAlexander-Bloch A. Giedd J.N. Bullmore E. Imaging structural co-variance between human brain regions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Despite the existence of methods for generating SCNs in individual subjects (Batalle et al., 2013Batalle D. Muñoz-Moreno E. Figueras F. Bargallo N. Eixarch E. Gratacos E.

Similarity-based extraction of individual networks from gray matter MRI scans.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 1530-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), these techniques have been restricted to the use of morphometric variables available through standard structural T1-weighted (T1w) MRI sequences. Here we explore a different approach to human cortical network mapping that leverages the growing capacity to extract multiple different anatomical indices across multiple imaging modalities (Lerch et al., 2017Lerch J.P. van der Kouwe A.J. Raznahan A. Paus T. Johansen-Berg H. Miller K.L. Smith S.M. Fischl B. Sotiropoulos S.N. Studying neuroanatomy using MRI.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rather than estimating the inter-regional correlation of a single macro-structural variable (like cortical thickness or volume) measured in multiple individuals (structural covariance analysis), we estimated the inter-regional correlation of multiple macro- and micro-structural multimodal MRI variables in a single individual (morphometric similarity mapping). This novel strategy integrates three complementary strands of research for the first time. First, there is histological evidence from non-human primates that axo-synaptic connectivity is stronger between micro-structurally similar cortical regions than between cytoarchitectonically distinct areas (Barbas, 2015Barbas H. General cortical and special prefrontal connections: principles from structure to function.Annu. Rev.

Hilgetag C.C. Principles of ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-cortical connectivity in the mouse.Brain Struct. Funct. 2017; 222: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, there is encouraging evidence that conventional MRI sequences can serve as proxy markers of cortical microstructure. Cortical MRI metrics—such as magnetization transfer (MT), a marker of myelination—show spatial gradients in humans (Glasser et al., 2016Glasser M.F. Coalson T.S. Robinson E.C. Hacker C.D. Harwell J. Yacoub E. Ugurbil K. Andersson J. Beckmann C.F. Jenkinson M. et al.A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex.Nature. 2016; 536: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) that align closely with known histological gradients in non-human primates (Wagstyl et al., 2015Wagstyl K. Ronan L. Goodyer I.M. Fletcher P.C. Cortical thickness gradients in structural hierarchies.Neuroimage. 2015; 111: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Third, there is emerging evidence that structural properties of the human cortex are more precisely estimated by combined analysis of more than one MRI morphometric index at each region; e.g., cortical thickness and sulcal depth (Vandekar et al., 2016Vandekar S.N. Shinohara R.T. Raznahan A. Hopson R.D. Roalf D.R. Ruparel K. Gur R.C. Gur R.E. Satterthwaite T.D. Subject-level measurement of local cortical coupling.Neuroimage. 2016; 133: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), cortical thickness and myelination (Glasser and Van Essen, 2011Glasser M.F.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11597-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, Whitaker et al., 2016Whitaker K.J. Vértes P.E. Romero-Garcia R. Váša F. Moutoussis M. Prabhu G. Weiskopf N. Callaghan M.F. Wagstyl K. Rittman T. et al.NSPN ConsortiumAdolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 9105-9110Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), or cortical thickness and gray matter volume (Sabuncu et al., 2016Sabuncu M.R. Ge T. Holmes A.J. Smoller J.W. Buckner R.L. Fischl B. Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging InitiativeMorphometricity as a measure of the neuroanatomical signature of a trait.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E5749-E5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On this basis, we predicted that morphometric similarity mapping with multiple MRI morphometric indices could provide a new way of estimating the linked patterns of inter-regional histological similarity and anatomical connectivity within an individual human brain. First we demonstrated the feasibility of morphometric similarity mapping and network analysis of multi-parameter MRI data by estimating individual human brain structural network properties for each member of a cohort of healthy young people (N = 296). Then we assessed the robustness of the methods and results to variation in data acquisition and pre-processing parameters and assessed replicability by analysis of a second, independent human MRI dataset (N = 124). To test the biological validity of human MRI-based morphometric similarity mapping, we focused on two hypotheses: that the edges between nodes in each morphometric similarity network (MSN) linked cortical areas of the same cytoarchitectonic class and that MSN edges linked nodes with high levels of co-expression of genes specialized for neuronal functions. We used MRI and tract-tracing data of the macaque cortex to demonstrate the generalizability of the methods to non-human species and to test a third key biological hypothesis: that MSN edges link nodes that are directly anatomically connected by an axonal projection from one cortical area to another. Finally, on the basis of these critical foundational steps, we tested a fourth hypothesis: that inter-individual differences in human MSNs are related to differences in intelligence (IQ). To investigate the feasibility of morphometric similarity mapping, we first analyzed MRI data on 10 morphometric variables measured at each of 308 cortical regions in a primary cohort of 296 healthy young adults. These data were collected as part of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN) collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University College London (STAR Methods). The morphometric similarity analysis pipeline (Figure 1) transformed each individual’s set of multimodal MRI feature maps into a morphometric similarity matrix of pairwise inter-regional Pearson correlations of morphometric feature vectors. The strength of association (morphometric similarity) between regions decayed exponentially as a function of increasing anatomical (Euclidean) distance between areas (median R2Adjusted across 296 subjects = 0.05, range = 0.02–0.13, σ = 0.02, all p < 0.001). This was also the case in the sample mean MSN (R2Adjusted = 0.15, p < 0.001) (Figure S4A). For each individual, we also estimated the morphometric similarity of each region to the rest of the regions in the brain simply by averaging the edge weights connecting it to all other nodes (i.e., the average of the off-diagonal elements of a row or column in the morphometric similarity matrix). Consistently across individuals, the regions with morphometric profiles more similar, on average, to all other regions (i.e., high nodal similarity values) were located in the frontal and temporal association cortex, whereas regions with more distinctive morphometric profiles compared, on average, with other regions (i.e., low nodal similarity) were located in the occipital cortex (Figure 2A; Figure S1). Nodal similarity in the sample mean MSN was also patterned anatomically as in typical individual MSNs (Figure 2A; Figure S1), with the highest nodal similarity concentrated in the frontal and temporal cortex (Figure 2B). We verified that MSN matrices were stable to the use of varying feature sets for calculation of inter-regional similarity by calculating the correlation in edge strengths between the full 10-feature MSN and MSNs with one feature removed. Using this leave-one-feature-out approach, we demonstrate high stability of the MSN edges between NSPN subjects’ 10-feature MSNs and their leave-one-feature-out MSNs (Figure S6). In light of known artefactual relationships between nodal size and nodal connectivity strength in fMRI studies (Wang et al., 2009Wang J. Wang L. Zang Y. Yang H. Tang H. Gong Q. Chen Z. Zhu C. He Y. Parcellation-dependent small-world brain functional networks: a resting-state fMRI study.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2009; 30: 1511-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), we conducted a series of analyses to quantify the potential contribution of nodal differences in size (surface area) to nodal differences in morphometric similarity (degree). We observed a weak correlation between nodal similarity and nodal density (person-level spatial correlations between density and degree: mean r = 0.03, ranging from −0.20 to 0.13), calculated as the number of distinct regions within 4 cm of the center of mass of the given region. We observed a weak-moderate positive correlation between nodal size and nodal similarity that was highly variable across individuals (person-level spatial correlations between size and degree: mean r = 0.34, ranging from −0.37 to 0.78) and nodes (node-level inter-individual correlations between size and degree: mean r = 0.20, ranging from −0.18 to 0.51). To test whether this positive size-degree relationship generalizes to other parcellations, we regenerated MSNs using a recently published multimodal imaging parcellation (Glasser et al., 2016Glasser M.F. Coalson T.S. Robinson E.C. Hacker C.D. Harwell J. Yacoub E. Ugurbil K. Andersson J. Beckmann C.F. Jenkinson M. et al.A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex.Nature. 2016; 536: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) that proposes a biologically grounded division of the cortical sheet into 360 nodes (symmetric, 180 per hemisphere) that show a 3-fold greater variation in node size relative to our parcellation. With this parcellation, we observed lower correlations between nodal size and nodal degree across the cortex (sample mean r = −0.05, range = −0.18-0.08) and across individuals (node mean r = −0.18, range = −0.56-0.13). Then, by calculating morphometric similarity matrices using our parcellation for each of 14 T1w scans taken in short succession from a single individual (MyConnectome Project; Poldrack et al., 2015Poldrack R.A. Laumann T.O. Koyejo O. Gregory B. Hover A. Chen M.Y. Gorgolewski K.J. Luci J. Joo S.J. Boyd R.L. et al.Long-term neural and physiological phenotyping of a single human.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we established that signal to noise in estimation of nodal degree does not increase with nodal size (correlation between nodal size and median absolute deviation in nodal degree: r = 0.05, p = 0.36). We thresholded the individual morphometric similarity matrices to generate binary graphs or MSNs. To characterize the topology of these MSNs, we calculated binarized and weighted graph metrics at a range of connection densities (2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%–40% in 5% increments) generated by thresholding the morphometric similarity matrices to include varying percentages of the most strongly positive edge weights or pairwise inter-regional correlations (Figure S3A). At all connection densities (Figure S2), the individual MSNs consistently demonstrated a repertoire of complex topological features shared by diverse naturally occurring networks (Barabási, 2016Barabási A.L. Network science. Cambridge University Press, 2016Google Scholar, Fornito et al., 2016Fornito, A., Zalesky, A., and Bullmore, E. (2016). Fundamentals of brain network analysis. (Academic Press)Google Scholar), including a fat-tailed (i.e., right or positively skewed) degree distribution, implying the existence of hub nodes; small-worldness (near-random path length or global efficiency combined with greater-than-random clustering); and a community structure comprising hierarchical modules and a rich club (Figure 2). We next resolved the modular community structure of MSNs by partitioning the sample mean MSN from coarse- to fine-grained scales defined by the resolution parameter (γ) of a consensus (1,000 runs) Louvain modularity algorithm (Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2012Lancichinetti A. Fortunato S. Consensus clustering in complex networks.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 336Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar; Figure 2C; Figure S2C; STAR Methods). At all scales of the modular hierarchy, the community structure consists of bilaterally symmetric and spatially contiguous modules tiling the cortex in a pattern that respects macro-structural features of the cortical sheet (Figure 2C). For example, the 6-module solution subdivides the temporal module of the 4-module solution into anterior, middle, and superior (encompassing the insula) portions of temporal cortex (Figure S2C). These results are qualitatively consistent with a prior study of the hierarchical patterning of the heritability of cortical surface area (Chen et al., 2012Chen C.H. Gutierrez E.D. Thompson W. Panizzon M.S. Jernigan T.L. Eyler L.T. Fennema-Notestine C. Jak A.J. Neale M.C. Franz C.E. et al.Hierarchical genetic organization of human cortical surface area.Science. 2012; 335: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), suggesting that the topological community structure of morphometric similarity could arise, at least in part, from genetic contributions to regional brain morphology. We also demonstrated another aspect of network community structure—a core/periphery organization comprising a core of highly interconnected hub nodes (a rich club). The rich club of the sample mean MSN included hubs that were distributed across all network modules (Figure 2C), as reported previously for DWI networks (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011van den Heuvel M.P. Sporns O. Rich-club organization of the human connectome.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 15775-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Individual MSNs typically demonstrated a similar community structure (modules and rich club) to that of the sample mean MSN (Figure S2D). Moreover, rich club properties were detectable across a range of MSN densities (Figure S5). First, we established that individual MSNs show moderate-high consistency with the group average MSN, both in terms of the average correlation between individual MSN edge weights and the sample mean MSN edge weights (average r = 0.60, SD = 0.05, all p < 0.001) and the average correlation between individual MSN nodal similarities and the sample mean MSN nodal similarities (average r = 0.66, SD = 0.10, all p < 0.001) (Figure 2; Figure S1). Second, we quantified the robustness of MSNs to methodological variations, including a reduction in the number of morphometric features available for analysis (i.e., using only 5 T1-weighted features rather than all 10 features estimated in the NSPN cohort) and construction of MSNs using MRI data collected at lower magnetic field strength (1.5 T) in a second, independent cohort and pre-processed using different segmentation and parcellation tools. We re-analyzed the NSPN cohort of 296 participants using a reduced set of 5 morphometric features that can be derived from any T1-weighted MRI scan: cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), gray matter volume (GM), mean curvature (MC), and intrinsic (Gaussian) curvature (IC). We found that the 5-feature MSNs were very similar to the 10-feature MSNs; for example, the sample mean edge weights and nodal similarities were strongly correlated between the 5-feature and 10-feature MSNs (r = 0.68, p < 0.001 and r = 0.91, p < 0.001, respectively). However, the SD for edge weight and nodal similarity was greater in the 5-feature MSNs (0.506 and 0.028, respectively) than in the 10-feature MSNs (0.346 and 0.016, respectively) (Figure S4B), indicating greater precision of MSN estimation based on a larger number of parameters or features per regional node. To test replicability, we used identical methods to construct MSNs from T1-weighted MRI data collected at 1.5 T field strength from an independent cohort of 124 healthy participants (NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development; Giedd et al., 1999Giedd J.N. Blumenthal J. Jeffries N.O. Castellanos F.X. Liu H. Zijdenbos A. Paus T. Evans A.C. Rapoport J.L. Brain development during childhood and adolescence: a longitudinal MRI study.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 861-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (4017) Google Scholar, Giedd et al., 2015Giedd J.N. Raznahan A. Alexander-Bloch A. Schmitt E. Gogtay N. Rapoport J.L. Child psychiatry branch of the National Institute of Mental Health longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging study of human brain development.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2015; 40: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures S2 and S3, the 5-feature NIH MSNs had a complex topology comparable with the 5- and 10-feature MSNs from the NSPN cohort (i.e., small-worldness, hubs, modularity, and a rich club). The SD of edge-wise and nodal similarity statistics in the NIH 5-feature MSNs (0.431 and 0.028, respectively) was approximately the same as the NSPN 5-feature MSNs but greater than the SDs in the 10-feature MSNs (Figure S4B). To test the first biological hypothesis that regions connected by an edge in a MSN are more likely to belong to the same cytoarchitectonic class, we compared the anatomical distribution of network edges with the histological classification of cortical areas (Solari and Stoner, 2011Solari S.V. Stoner R. Cognitive consilience: primate non-primary neuroanatomical circuits underlying cognition.Front. Neuroanat. 2011; 5: 65PubMed Google Scholar, von Economo and Koskinas, 1925von Economo C.F. Koskinas G.N. Die cytoarchitektonik der hirnrinde des erwachsenen menschen. J. Springer, 1925Google Scholar). Our adapted cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the human cortex defines 7 spatially contiguous and bilaterally symmetric cortical classes that are microscopically differentiated by cortical lamination patterns (Figure 3A). At a nodal level of analysis, we explored the distribution of nodal similarity in the individual MSNs in relation to the cytoarchitectonic classification of each node. Across subjects, there were significant differences in mean nodal similarity between classes (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1, 2,077) = 796.5, p < 0.001). Cytoarchitectonic classes 1, 2, and 3 (corresponding to motor and association cortices) comprised cortical areas with a higher nodal similarity and degree than cytoarchitectonic classes 4, 5, and 6 (mostly corresponding to primary and secondary sensory cortical areas) (Figure 3A). These results confirm that MSN hubs are predominantly located in motor and association cortical areas. The cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the cortex also provided a benchmark for triangulating the comparison between MSNs and two other MRI-based networks measured in the same NSPN cohort: the SCN based on inter-regional correlations of a single feature (cortical thickness) measured across all 296 participants and the sample mean DWI network based on tractographic reconstruction of white matter connections between cortical areas (weighted by mean diffusivity) in each participant (STAR Methods). To compare MSN, DWI, and SCN results, we constructed a series of sparsely connected graphs (with connection density ranging from 0.5% to 5% in 0.5% increments) that represented the most strongly connected edges in each of the MRI networks and calculated the percentage of edges that linked areas in the same cytoarchitectonic class. For the most sparsely connected MSN (0.5% density), more than 90% of edges connected areas in the same class, and this declined monotonically as a function of increasing density so that about 60% of edges connected areas in the same class in the MSN at 5% density. The SCN and DWI networks demonstrated similar trends, but the percentage of intra-class connectivity was consistently lower for both of these networks compared with the MSN across all connection densities (Figure 3B). We confirmed the clear separation between MSNs and both SCN and DWI networks in terms of their overlap with cytoarchitectonic classes by re-calculating network-specific overlap percentages across a range of network densities for each of 1,000 bootstrapped resamplings of the participant pool. Additional analyses verified that the non-random relationship of MSN architecture with cytoarchitectonic maps holds after controlling for the effects of distance or spatial auto-correlation. Specifically, we generated 1,000 pseudoparcellations of the cortical sheet into 7 classes that conserved the spatial contiguity of the classes as well as the relative proportion of cortex assigned to each class. Across a range of MSN densities, the percentage of MSN edges that overlapped with true cytoarchitectonic classes was greater than the distribution of these overlap values from all 1,000 pseudoparcellations (Figure S5). We observed that only about 60% of edges in the DWI network connected areas of the same cytoarchitectonic class, even at the sparsest connection density. This proportion decreased to about 30% when using a distance-dependent consistency thresholding approach for group-level DWI network construction (Mišić et al., 2015Mišić B. Betzel R.F. Nematzadeh A. Goñi J. Griffa A. Hagmann P. Flammini A. Ahn Y.Y. Sporns O. Cooperative and competitive spreading dynamics on the human connectome.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1518-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; STAR Methods). The weaker coherence between DWI network topology and cytoarchitectonic class compared with MSN network topology appeared to involve the relative failure of DWI tractography to recover inter-hemispheric connections between bilaterally symmetric areas belonging to the same class (Figure 3C). To quantitatively address this hypothesis while controlling for connection length, we compared a binarized group-level DWI network with an equally dense binarized group-level MSN network. We then used binomial (logistic) regr"

We used yeast-display libraries of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) to screen for antigens of “orphan” T cell receptors (TCRs) expressed on TILs from human colorectal adenocarcinoma. Four TIL-derived TCRs exhibited strong selection for peptides presented in a highly diverse pHLA-A∗02:01 library. Three of the TIL TCRs were specific for non-mutated self-antigens, two of which were present in separate patient tumors, and shared specificity for a non-mutated self-antigen derived from U2AF2. These results show that the exposed recognition surface of MHC-bound peptides accessible to the TCR contains sufficient structural information to enable the reconstruction of sequences of peptide targets for pathogenic TCRs of unknown specificity.

This finding underscores the surprising specificity of TCRs for their cognate antigens and enables the facile indentification of tumor antigens through unbiased screening. T cells are integral to the adaptive immune system and provide protection against pathogens and cancer (Davis and Bjorkman, 1988Davis M.M. Bjorkman P.J. T-cell antigen receptor genes and T-cell recognition.Nature. 1988; 334: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). They function through extracellular recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR), which is specific for short peptides presented on the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on cells (Rossjohn et al., 2015Rossjohn J. Gras S. Miles J.J. Turner S.J. Godfrey D.I. McCluskey J. T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Diversity inherent to the TCR, peptide, and HLA molecules makes identifying the specificity of any one TCR an extremely complex problem. While our ability to characterize T cells and sequence their TCRs has improved considerably (Han et al., 2014Han A. Glanville J. Hansmann L. Davis M.M. Linking T-cell receptor sequence to functional phenotype at the single-cell level.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the ability to determine and study the antigen specificities of T cells has remained a major bottleneck. Approaches to determining the specificity of “orphan” TCRs (i.e., TCRs of unknown antigen specificity) could help uncover potential targets for cancer immunotherapy, autoimmunity, and infection. A number of strategies have been used to determine the specificity of “orphan” TCRs (Birnbaum et al., 2012Birnbaum M.E. Dong S. Garcia K.C. Diversity-oriented approaches for interrogating T-cell receptor repertoire, ligand recognition, and function.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry can provide an unbiased method of antigen isolation (Abelin et al., 2017Abelin J.G. Keskin D.B. Sarkizova S. Hartigan C.R. Zhang W. Sidney J. Stevens J. Lane W. Zhang G.L. Eisenhaure T.M. et al.Mass Spectrometry Profiling of HLA-Associated Peptidomes in Mono-allelic Cells Enables More Accurate Epitope Prediction.Immunity. 2017; 46: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), but requires large cell numbers, typically 107 to 109 cells. Most studies of T cell antigen specificities involve testing candidate antigens empirically. For example, studies of anti-tumor T cell specificities have shown productive T cell responses toward neo-antigens. Such studies entail sequencing tumors to identify mutations, using epitope prediction algorithms to predict immunogenic mutant peptides and testing for T cell responses directed at these mutant peptides (Kreiter et al., 2015Kreiter S.

Other strategies query established T cell specificities in patients by using pHLA multimers (Bentzen et al., 2016Bentzen A.K. Marquard A.M. Lyngaa R. Saini S.K. Ramskov S. Donia M. Such L. Furness A.J. McGranahan N. Rosenthal R. et al.Large-scale detection of antigen-specific T cells using peptide-MHC-I multimers labeled with DNA barcodes.Nat.

Combinatorial tetramer staining and mass cytometry analysis facilitate T-cell epitope mapping and characterization.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We sought to extend a previously reported technology using yeast-display of pHLA libraries as an approach to TCR ligand discovery, an approach that requires no a priori knowledge regarding the nature of these antigens (Adams et al., 2011Adams J.J. Narayanan S. Liu B. Birnbaum M.E. Kruse A.C. Bowerman N.A. Chen W. Levin A.M. Connolly J.M. Zhu C. et al.T cell receptor signaling is limited by docking geometry to peptide-major histocompatibility complex.Immunity. 2011; 35: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This approach is an unbiased, affinity-based selection of a diverse pHLA library by a TCR of interest (Figure 1A). This technique has been previously used to study the cross-reactivity of TCRs of known peptide specificities (Adams et al., 2016Adams J.J. Narayanan S. Birnbaum M.E. Sidhu S.S. Blevins S.J. Gee M.H.

Other variations of a library strategy have been used to study TCR specificities and/or mimotopes (Birnbaum et al., 2012Birnbaum M.E. Dong S. Garcia K.C.

Using a baculovirus display library to identify MHC class I mimotopes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Through pHLA library screening, previously unknown stimulatory human antigens and mimotopes derived from the library were identified for two TCRs of known specificity for myelin basic protein (MBP) (Birnbaum et al., 2014Birnbaum M.E. Mendoza J.L. Sethi D.K. Dong S. Glanville J. Dobbins J. Ozkan E. Davis M.M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Garcia K.C. Deconstructing the peptide-MHC specificity of T cell recognition.Cell. 2014; 157: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This result suggested that this approach could, in principle, enable recovery of full peptide sequences of ligands to orphan TCRs. Here, we have attempted to identify antigens recognized by TCRs derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (Figure 1B). We applied single-cell T cell phenotyping and TCR sequencing (Han et al., 2014Han A. Glanville J. Hansmann L. Davis M.M. Linking T-cell receptor sequence to functional phenotype at the single-cell level.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) of CD8+ TILs in two HLA-A∗02:01 homozygous patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma to predict candidate antigen targets from yeast-display library selections. Of the TCRs screened, four TCRs isolated peptide targets in the HLA-A∗02:01 library. Two of these TCRs shared antigen specificity. The synthetic peptides isolated from the library, in addition to predicted peptides from the Uniprot human reference genome, stimulated the respective TCRs of interest. Surprisingly, three of the four receptors recognized unmutated self-antigens. This serves as proof-of-principle for linking T cell immune responses and their clonal TCRs with a direct antigen identification method that can serve as a powerful tool to identify novel cancer antigens recognized by the immune response. The HLA-A∗02:01 allele is present in up to 50% of a number of populations (González-Galarza et al., 2015González-Galarza F.F. Takeshita L.Y. Santos E.J. Kempson F. Maia M.H. da Silva A.L. Teles e Silva A.L. Ghattaoraya G.S. Alfirevic A. Jones A.R. Middleton D. Allele frequency net 2015 update: new features for HLA epitopes, KIR and disease and HLA adverse drug reaction associations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D784-D788Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The binding motifs for peptides presented by HLA-A∗02 have been well characterized (Falk et al., 1991Falk K. Rötzschke O. Stevanović S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Allele-specific motifs revealed by sequencing of self-peptides eluted from MHC molecules.Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar) and a number of restricted clinically relevant TCRs identified (Johnson et al., 2009Johnson L.A. Morgan R.A. Dudley M.E. Cassard L. Yang J.C. Hughes M.S. Kammula U.S. Royal R.E. Sherry R.M. Wunderlich J.R. et al.Gene therapy with human and mouse T-cell receptors mediates cancer regression and targets normal tissues expressing cognate antigen.Blood. 2009; 114: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). We generated a yeast-display library for screening potential HLA-A∗02:01-restricted TCRs (Figure 1A). Individual yeast expresses a random peptide covalently linked to the HLA molecule, which enables peptide identification by DNA sequencing (Figure 1C) (Adams et al., 2016Adams J.J. Narayanan S. Birnbaum M.E. Sidhu S.S. Blevins S.J. Gee M.H. Sibener L.V. Baker B.M. Kranz D.M. Garcia K.C.

Garcia K.C. Deconstructing the peptide-MHC specificity of T cell recognition.Cell. 2014; 157: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This pHLA library features an N-terminal peptide library linked to wild-type β-2-microglobulin (B2M) and HLA-A∗02:01 heavy chain with a single point mutation Y84A (see STAR Methods; Hansen et al., 2009Hansen T. Yu Y.Y. Fremont D.H. Preparation of stable single-chain trimers engineered with peptide, beta2 microglobulin, and MHC heavy chain.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2009; Chapter 17 (Unit17.5)Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To ensure proper display of peptides in the binding groove, the peptide library restricts amino acid usage at P2 and PΩ to the aliphatic hydrophobic residues preferred by HLA-A∗02:01 (Rammensee et al., 1999Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanović S. SYFPEITHI: database for MHC ligands and peptide motifs.Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) (Figures 1D–1F). At other positions, NNK codons randomly encode all 20 amino acids to provide an unbiased library. Because HLA-A∗02:01 typically presents peptides 8 to 11 amino acids in length (Hassan et al., 2013Hassan C. Kester M.G. de Ru A.H. Hombrink P. Drijfhout J.W. Nijveen H. Leunissen J.A. Heemskerk M.H. Falkenburg J.H. van Veelen P.A. et al.The human leukocyte antigen-presented ligandome of B lymphocytes.Mol Cell Proteomics. 2013; 12: 1829-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we generated multiple peptide length libraries using epitope tags for multiplexed selections (Figure 1F). Each library has a theoretical nucleotide diversity dictated by the library composition and length, but the functional diversity of the library is limited (Figure 1F). In total, we estimate that approximately 400 million unique peptides ranging from 8 to 11 amino acids are represented in the combined libraries. To determine whether the HLA-A∗02:01 complex is properly folded to present peptides, we used a “proxy” TCR with known specificity. We used the DMF5 TCR (Johnson et al., 2009Johnson L.A. Morgan R.A. Dudley M.E. Cassard L. Yang J.C. Hughes M.S. Kammula U.S. Royal R.E. Sherry R.M. Wunderlich J.R. et al.Gene therapy with human and mouse T-cell receptors mediates cancer regression and targets normal tissues expressing cognate antigen.Blood. 2009; 114: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), which is a naturally occurring TCR that recognizes a 10 amino acid sequence (EAAGIGILTV) derived from the MART-1 melanoma antigen bound to HLA-A∗02:01 (Borbulevych et al., 2011Borbulevych O.Y. Santhanagopolan S.M. Hossain M. Baker B.M. TCRs used in cancer gene therapy cross-react with MART-1/Melan-A tumor antigens via distinct mechanisms.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To validate the HLA-A∗02:01 library, the 10-mer peptide ELAGIGILTV, which has improved HLA stability (Cole et al., 2010Cole D.K. Edwards E.S. Wynn K.K. Clement M. Miles J.J. Ladell K. Ekeruche J. Gostick E. Adams K.J. Skowera A. et al.Modification of MHC anchor residues generates heteroclitic peptides that alter TCR binding and T cell recognition.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was displayed with HLA-A∗02:01 on yeast and stained by both an anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody and 400 nM tetramerized DMF5 TCR, indicating surface expression of the protein complex and proper folding of the pHLA (Figure 2A). To confirm that the library could be used to identify the antigen of the DMF5 TCR, the HLA-A∗02:01 10-mer library (Figure 1F) was selected by MACS bead-multimerized DMF5 TCR (see Figure 2B; STAR Methods). A sample of the fourth round of selection was sequenced to identify enriched peptides, most of which were found to be highly related to the MART-1 10-mer peptide. The yeast containing these sequences were stained with TCR tetramer (Figure 2C) and anti-HLA-A∗02 (Figure S1A).Figure S1Validation of the HLA-A∗02:01 Library with the DMF5 TCR, Related to Table S1Show full caption(A) MA2.1 antibody staining for correctly folded HLA-A∗02:01 complex with DMF5 TCR wildtype peptide or peptide mimotopes.

(C) The scores of the top 10 peptides identified in Figure S1B. All rounds of the yeast-display selection by the DMF5 TCR were deep-sequenced. The library converged significantly by round 3 of the selection to 68 unique peptides, of which the top 10 peptides dominated 91.7% of the library (Figure 2D). The most striking observation was that almost all peptides selected had a Gly at P6 (P6G) (Table S1), consistent with the DMF5-MART-1/HLA-A∗02:01 crystal structure showing that P6G provides flexibility to allow a cleft for CDR3β 100F, to which P6G hydrogen bonds (Borbulevych et al., 2011Borbulevych O.Y. Santhanagopolan S.M. Hossain M. Baker B.M. TCRs used in cancer gene therapy cross-react with MART-1/Melan-A tumor antigens via distinct mechanisms.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Deep-sequencing revealed two major clusters of peptide sequences (Figure 2E). To clarify these clusters, the reverse hamming distance, which is a metric used to identify the number of exact amino acid matches between two peptides, was calculated between all peptides and then clustered by score (Figure 2E; Table S1). The two major clusters diverged at P4 to P6 with a central “GIG” motif in 29 peptides (cluster 1) and a central “DRG” motif in 32 peptides (cluster 2). Cluster 1 peptides were used in a position probability matrix (PPM) to score potential human peptide targets, a method used previously to predict human antigens from yeast-display selection data (2014PPM) (Birnbaum et al., 2014Birnbaum M.E. Mendoza J.L. Sethi D.K. Dong S. Glanville J. Dobbins J. Ozkan E. Davis M.M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Garcia K.C. Deconstructing the peptide-MHC specificity of T cell recognition.Cell. 2014; 157: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, because the 10-mer library did not allow for Ala at P2 of the library, P2A was manually included in the search matrix matching the anchor with the lowest frequency: Leu at 16.67%. From this analysis, 9 peptides from the human proteome were predicted with varying probabilistic scores to bind the DMF5 TCR (Figure 2F; Table S1). Strikingly, the human MART-1 peptide was the most probable to bind the DMF5 TCR of the 9 peptides predicted (Figure 2F). Using cluster 2, orders of magnitude more peptides were predicted to bind the TCR (Figures S1B and S1C; Table S1). However, the DMF5 TCR has not shown any off-target toxicity (Johnson et al., 2009Johnson L.A. Morgan R.A. Dudley M.E. Cassard L. Yang J.C. Hughes M.S. Kammula U.S. Royal R.E. Sherry R.M. Wunderlich J.R. et al.Gene therapy with human and mouse T-cell receptors mediates cancer regression and targets normal tissues expressing cognate antigen.Blood. 2009; 114: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), indicating that this other “DRG” peptide motif may not be physiologically relevant. We screened three TCRs derived from a melanoma patient, in which all TCRs had blinded specificities to neoantigens. These antigens had been identified independently by exome sequencing of tumor material, predicting neoantigen presentation by HLA-A∗02:01 and staining of patient-derived tumor-infiltrating T cells with peptide-loaded HLA-A∗02:01 multimers (van Rooij et al., 2013van Rooij N. van Buuren M.M.

The three recombinant TCRs, labeled NKI1, NKI2, and NKI3, were used to select the HLA-A∗02:01 library containing all four peptide lengths. Only the selection for NKI2 produced 400 nM tetramer-positive yeast beginning at round 2 of the selection, indicating strong binding of the peptide-HLA-A∗02:01 library (Figure 3A; Table S2). The peptides converged by round 3 of the selection and peptides were clustered by reverse hamming distance (Figure 3B). The selection results for NKI2 showed similarity in 9-mer, 10-mer, and 11-mer sequences, sharing a conserved Glu in the 9-mer, 10-mer, and 11-mer sequences at P6, P7, and P8, respectively, and the peptides share a positively charged residue at P5 of the 9-mer, 10-mer, and 11-mer. As part of the blinded validation, a list of 127 neoantigens predicted to be presented by HLA-A∗02:01 served as candidate ligands for the NKI2 TCR (Strønen et al., 2016Strønen E. Toebes M. Kelderman S. van Buuren M.M. Yang W. van Rooij N. Donia M. Böschen M.L. Lund-Johansen F. Olweus J. Schumacher T.N. Targeting of cancer neoantigens with donor-derived T cell receptor repertoires.Science. 2016; 352: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The reverse hamming distance was calculated for each of these 127 potential neoantigen peptides compared to the list of 10-mer synthetic peptides selected by NKI2 (Figure 3C). ALDPHSGHFV, a peptide neoantigen derived from cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), had 5 and 6 of the 10 positions being identical to library peptides Lib-1 and Lib-2, respectively (Figure 3D). CDK4 was correctly identified and confirmed as the neoantigen target of NKI2. The targets of NKI1 and NKI3 could not be unambiguously identified through this blinded validation. We next asked whether the predicted peptides could stimulate NKI2-expressing T cells. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were transduced with NKI2 and co-cultured with HLA-A∗02:01+ JY cells loaded with each of the top 5 peptides selected by NKI2. Interestingly, all 5 peptides elicited interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by NKI2 transduced T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E). Furthermore, the most selected peptide mimotope ALDSRSEHFM stimulated these cells as potently as the CDK4 neoantigen ALDPHSGHFV itself. Our ultimate goal is to identify peptide ligands for TCRs derived from expanded and cytotoxic T cell populations infiltrating patient tumors using the yeast-display platform (Figure 1B). Single-cell technology for analyzing T cells (Han et al., 2014Han A. Glanville J. Hansmann L. Davis M.M. Linking T-cell receptor sequence to functional phenotype at the single-cell level.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) provides a means to individually phenotype single T cells and to sequence their paired αβ TCRs in a high-throughput manner. We selected patients homozygous for the HLA-A∗02 allele (Figure 4A). This improves the probability that a T cell isolated from a patient has a receptor restricted to the HLA-A∗02 allele. The full HLA locus was typed for both patients sans HLA-C (Table S3). HLA-A∗02:01 and HLA-A∗02:06 suballeles have been described to share a subset of presentable peptide antigens (Sudo et al., 1995Sudo T. Kamikawaji N. Kimura A. Date Y. Savoie C.J. Nakashima H.

Both patients were males in their mid-60s with colorectal adenocarcinoma (Figure 4A). Tissue samples of the tumors were analyzed for infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and the overall structure observed by H&E staining (Figure S2A). For patient A, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found in the lamina propria of the colon, but less in the tumor. For patient B, CD4+ T cells were not abundant within the colon tissue; however, there was significant CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor. From these two patients, several hundred CD8+ T cells were phenotyped and sequenced from the site of the tumor with 53-paired sequences from the healthy tissues and 709-paired sequences from the tumor tissues (Figure 4B). Any clone seen more than once at the site of the tumor is considered an expanded clone. In both cases, there were expanded TCR clones in the tumor, suggesting antigen-specific expansion. The most expanded TCR clones comprised 12.9% (23/178) of the sequenced population in patient A and 6.67% (35/526) in patient B, respectively. This level of expansion at the tumor is consistent with other reports of T cell repertoire populations in primary liver carcinoma (Shi et al., 2017Shi L. Zhang Y. Feng L. Wang L. Rong W. Wu F. Wu J. Zhang K. Cheng S. Multi-omics study revealing the complexity and spatial heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary liver carcinoma.Oncotarget. 2017; 8: 34844-34857Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and CD4+ T cells infiltrating colorectal carcinoma (Han et al., 2014Han A. Glanville J. Hansmann L. Davis M.M. Linking T-cell receptor sequence to functional phenotype at the single-cell level.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Because not many T cells were identified from healthy tissue, clones were considered exclusive to the tumor and not shared with healthy tissue if either α or β chain is not shared. For both patients, both α and β chain sequences showed only a small overlap of sequences between tumor and healthy tissues (Figure 4C). This suggests that most TIL T cell clones are enriched and present in the tumor as a result of tumor-driven responses; however, we cannot conclude that any TIL TCR is exclusively present within tumor due to limited sampling of healthy tissue. The TCRs sequenced from the patients exhibited typical CDR3α and CDR3β lengths (Rock et al., 1994Rock E.P. Sibbald P.R. Davis M.M. Chien Y.H. CDR3 length in antigen-specific immune receptors.J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B). Both patients had a predominance of TRAV8-3, TRAV19 (Figure S2C), and TRBV7-2 (Figure S2D) expression. Unlike T cells from patient A, T cells from patient B were analyzed by index sorting, allowing for pairing of cell-surface marker expression and transcript expression. When separating T cell populations based on cell-surface markers and transcriptional profiles using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008Van der Maaten L. Hinton G. Visualizing data using t-SNE.J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2008; 9: 2579-2605Google Scholar), CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations separated into major clusters (Figure S2E). For patient B, there was significant CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor and the majority of cells sampled co-expressed PD-1 and IFN-γ with a heterogenous expression of other cytotoxic markers granzyme B, perforin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). It has been suggested that the PD-1+CD8+ T cell population is the tumor-reactive population (Gros et al., 2014Gros A. Robbins P.F. Yao X. Li Y.F. Turcotte S. Tran E. Wunderlich J.R. Mixon A. Farid S.

These findings suggest that preventing degradation of the endosteal vasculature may improve current paradigms for treating AML. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow (BM), where they receive survival and differentiation signals from several cell types, including endothelial and multiple lineages of peri-vascular mesenchymal cells (Morrison and Scadden, 2014Morrison S.J. Scadden D.T. The bone marrow niche for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2014; 505: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Similarly, cancer growth and chemo-resistance have been hypothesized to be dependent on a malignant microenvironment that is highly vascularized (Duan et al., 2014Duan C.W. Shi J. Chen J. Wang B.

This relationship is well illustrated in epithelial cancers, where increased angiogenesis supports growth and metastasis (Quail and Joyce, 2013Quail D.F. Joyce J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (4443) Google Scholar). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive leukemia often accompanied by life-threatening cytopenias. The cure rate of AML is only 5%–15% in patients greater than 60 years old (Döhner et al., 2015Döhner H. Weisdorf D.J. Bloomfield C.D. Acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 1136-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for more effective therapies, especially because the mainstay of treatment has not changed significantly in the last 30 years (Döhner et al., 2015Döhner H. Weisdorf D.J. Bloomfield C.D. Acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 1136-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). To develop more selective and better-tolerated therapies, it is critical that we understand how AML cells grow, outcompete healthy hematopoiesis, and eventually generate an environment supportive of chemo-resistant leukemia stem cells. Alterations in BM innervation and stroma have been described in late stages of disease (Hanoun et al., 2014Hanoun M. Zhang D. Mizoguchi T. Pinho S. Pierce H. Kunisaki Y. Lacombe J. Armstrong S.A.

However, the dynamic process leading to this stage is unknown, and its dissection promises to uncover new therapeutic targets. There are reports of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by AML cells (Fiedler et al., 1997Fiedler W. Graeven U. Ergün S. Verago S. Kilic N. Stockschläder M. Hossfeld D.K. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a possible paracrine growth factor in human acute myeloid leukemia.Blood. 1997; 89: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of increased BM microvasculature density in patients (Aguayo et al., 2000Aguayo A.

However, clinical trials investigating anti-angiogenic therapy in AML patients have been disappointing (Fiedler et al., 2003Fiedler W. Mesters R. Tinnefeld H. Loges S. Staib P. Duhrsen U. Flasshove M. Ottmann O.G. Jung W.

Thus, questions remain about the effect of AML growth on BM vasculature and whether vascular remodeling may be beneficial for the disease. We hypothesized that AML-induced BM vascular remodeling may be more complex than simple induction of angiogenesis and that progressive, nuanced changes could shape the ecological competition between leukemia and healthy hematopoiesis. A spatiotemporal understanding of these changes may point to novel candidate interventions that could restore BM normal ecology, including HSC function, and in turn make AML cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. Here, we present a high-resolution, longitudinal analysis of the progressive and region-specific vasculature remodeling induced by AML, with a particular focus on the implications for healthy hematopoiesis. We uncovered (1) morphological and functional changes in surviving vessels, namely attempted but failed angiogenesis and increased transendothelial migration of hematopoietic cells; (2) specific loss of endosteal vessels, accompanied by loss of osteoblastic cells and, most importantly, HSCs; and (3) endosteal vasculature induction as a successful approach to rescue healthy HSCs and improve the efficacy of induction chemotherapy. To study the effects of AML growth on BM vasculature and HSCs as disease propagates through the tissue, we used the well-established MLL-AF9-driven murine model of AML, which recapitulates phenotypic and pathological features of human MLL-rearranged AML (Krivtsov et al., 2006Krivtsov A.V. Twomey D. Feng Z. Stubbs M.C. Wang Y. Faber J. Levine J.E. Wang J. Hahn W.C.

Cleary M.L. Identification and characterization of leukemia stem cells in murine MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 257-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To generate leukemia cells detectable by intravital microscopy, we harvested myeloid progenitor cells from donor mice that expressed high levels of fluorescent proteins (FP), transduced them with a retroviral vector encoding the oncogene and GFP, and injected them into sub-lethally irradiated recipients. With this approach, we generated multiple batches of GFP+ FP+ primary blasts (Figure 1A) that were all CD11b+ and contained varying proportions of cells expressing progenitor markers, such as c-Kit, CD34, and FCγRII/III (data not shown). Experiments were repeated using blasts from different primary recipients to ensure identification of consistent features of AML growth and to discount any possible primary donor-specific phenotype. To achieve reliable disease progression while minimizing the number of blasts injected, 100,000 primary AML blasts were transplanted by tail vein injection into non-irradiated secondary recipients. This strategy was critical as potential myelo-ablative conditioning regimens that could favor AML progression and cause hematopoietic and stromal damage were avoided. In all secondary recipients, progressive blast expansion was observed from days 8 to 10 post-transplantation with full BM infiltration typically reached between day 20 and 28, with the variation depending on the source of the primary blasts analyzed. This leukemic engraftment was accompanied by infiltration of the spleen, typically delayed compared to BM infiltration (Figure 1A). In each mouse, healthy hematopoiesis was progressively lost with AML expansion (Figure 1B). AML cells, vasculature, and hematopoietic cells were visualized by intravital microscopy (IVM) performed on mouse calvarium BM (Figure 1C), which has been shown to be representative of long bones’ marrow in terms of stroma composition and ability to support functional HSCs and their homing and engraftment (Lassailly et al., 2013Lassailly F. Foster K. Lopez-Onieva L. Currie E. Bonnet D.

Live-animal tracking of individual haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in their niche.Nature. 2009; 457: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). This approach is minimally invasive and allows longitudinal observation of cellular dynamics (including cell migration, proliferation, and death) taking place within the tissue over the course of hours or days. This approach has been essential for us to uncover previously unappreciated biological processes, such as the ability of HSCs exposed to acute infection to engage wider than normal BM niches (Rashidi et al., 2014Rashidi N.M. Scott M.K. Scherf N. Krinner A. Kalchschmidt J.S. Gounaris K. Selkirk M.E. Roeder I. Lo Celso C. In vivo time-lapse imaging shows diverse niche engagement by quiescent and naturally activated hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2014; 124: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the migratory behavior of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells during disease progression and response to chemotherapy, and T-ALL-induced osteoblastic cells remodeling (Hawkins et al., 2016Hawkins E.D.

Ruivo N. et al.T-cell acute leukaemia exhibits dynamic interactions with bone marrow microenvironments.Nature. 2016; 538: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In particular, tile scan images of the entire BM space contained within the calvarium provide a comprehensive, three-dimensional, single-cell resolution overview of the overall organization of the tissue and are therefore ideal to uncover complex remodeling processes that are still poorly understood. To identify progressive changes of blood vessels in situ during AML progression, we performed IVM of Flk1-GFP transgenic mice, in which phenotypic endothelial cells (ECs) express GFP (Figure 2A) and can be visualized lining BM blood vessels labeled with Cy5-dextran (Figure 2B). We observed multiple, significant changes in Flk-1 GFP+ blood vessels in mice burdened with AML (Figure S1). First, most vessels were narrower than those in control mice (Figure 2C). Second, they were characteristically further from the endosteal bone surface (Figures 2D and 2E). Imaging of partially infiltrated mice was consistent with the findings of (Hérault et al., 2017Hérault A. Binnewies M. Leong S. Calero-Nieto F.J. Zhang S.Y. Kang Y.A. Wang X. Pietras E.M. Chu S.H. Barry-Holson K. et al.Myeloid progenitor cluster formation drives emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis.Nature. 2017; 544: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in revealing that AML cells clustered in patches of highly infiltrated areas, whereas the remaining BM space contained only sparse AML cells (Figure 2F). Blood vessels in highly infiltrated areas appeared unusually barbed and presented dynamic subcellular protrusions toward the parenchyma (Figure 2F, right panels). High-resolution time-lapse recording of blood vessels at late stages of AML revealed sequential formation and retraction of sprouts (Figure 2G; Movie S1), similar to those described in response to strong angiogenic stimuli (Gerhardt et al., 2003Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. VEGF guides angiogenic sprouting utilizing endothelial tip cell filopodia.J.

Thurston G. Medvinsky A. et al.Endothelial cells dynamically compete for the tip cell position during angiogenic sprouting.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). However, this sprouting process was never efficient, and we could not detect formation of any steady lateral branches. This is consistent with the increased levels of VEGF-A detected in mice infiltrated with AML (Figure 2H). We also occasionally observed vascular damage caused by EC breakage into small fragments (Movie S2). Consistent with this observation, we observed abundant 1- to 4-μm-sized cellular debris of endothelial origin (GFP+) in the vascular lumen of AML-burdened mice (Figures S2A and S2B; Movie S3). These debris particles maintained expression of phenotypic endothelial markers, including high levels of CD31 and endomucin (Figure S2C), and contained nucleic acids within an intact membrane (Figure S2D). Prompted by our initial observations, we performed in-depth analysis of blood vessels in the endosteal areas of long bones using immunofluorescence of whole, undecalcified long bone sections from healthy and diseased mice (Figure 3A). This approach allowed us to simultaneously investigate AML-mediated changes in the vasculature of different BM areas: the central marrow diaphysis; the bone-lining endosteum; and the trabecular metaphysis. We were able to detect a significant decrease of vessels in the endosteum and metaphysis over time (Figures 3B and 3C). The endosteal vessels were significantly, and progressively, lost at both intermediate (40%–50% BM infiltration) and advanced (>80% BM infiltration) disease stages (Figure 3C). Notably, vessel loss was specific to these areas and not observed in the diaphysis region, where vessels were either maintained or transiently increased (Figures 3B and 3C). To investigate the relevance of these observations in humans, we performed additional histological analysis of BM trephine biopsies from AML patients with >80% infiltration and confirmed that endosteal vessels were decreased (Figures 3D and 3E). Additionally, endosteal vessels were maintained in a murine model of Notch-driven T-ALL (Figures S3A and S3B), suggesting that the vascular remodeling we observed is specific to AML. These findings pointed to a specific depletion of the functionally unique endosteal endothelium, recently shown to regulate osteogenesis (Kusumbe et al., 2014Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Adams R.H. Coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis by a specific vessel subtype in bone.Nature. 2014; 507: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and to maintain HSCs (Itkin et al., 2016Itkin T. Gur-Cohen S. Spencer J.A. Schajnovitz A. Ramasamy S.K. Kusumbe A.P. Ledergor G. Jung Y. Milo I. Poulos M.G. et al.Distinct bone marrow blood vessels differentially regulate haematopoiesis.Nature. 2016; 532: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, Kusumbe et al., 2016Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Itkin T. Mäe M.A. Langen U.H. Betsholtz C. Lapidot T. Adams R.H. Age-dependent modulation of vascular niches for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2016; 532: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Because we observed differential remodeling of the microenvironment in AML-burdened mice, we questioned whether they could be triggered by regional variations in leukemia cells. To address this question, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on sorted AML cells from trabecular-rich areas (crushed metaphysis) or central BM areas (flushed diaphysis; Figure 3F). We compared the transcriptome of endosteal and central AML cells originating from three independent primary donors to non-transformed granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) from the BM of healthy mice. Gene expression and multi-dimensional scale analyses illustrated that each AML batch had its own unique gene expression signature, consistent with clonal evolution of tumor cells, whereas control GMPs were extremely homogeneous (Figures 3G–3I). Despite the similarity in gene expression between endosteal and central AML cells, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated endosteal AML cells were enriched for expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response (Figure 3J) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways (Figure 3K). Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic cytokine Cxcl2 (also known as MIP-2α or chemokine gro-β; downstream of TNF; Tessier et al., 1997Tessier P.A. Naccache P.H. Clark-Lewis I. Gladue R.P. Neote K.S. McColl S.R. Chemokine networks in vivo: involvement of C-X-C and C-C chemokines in neutrophil extravasation in vivo in response to TNF-alpha.J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3595-3602PubMed Google Scholar) was significantly more expressed in endosteal AML cells (Figures 3L and 3M). Analysis of TNF and CXCL2 levels in BM fluids confirmed that both cytokines were specifically and highly increased in endosteal areas of AML-burdened mice (Figures 3N and 3O). These results highlight the importance of inflammation in AML pathogenesis and support a role for CXCL2 and TNF in the remodeling of endosteal vessels. Flow cytometry analysis (Figures S3C–S3H) demonstrated that, although the proportion of ECs in surviving stroma was increased in AML-burdened mice (Figure S3E), the absolute number of ECs was not statistically significantly different (Figure S3F). However, phenotypically defined endosteal ECs (CD31hiEndomucinhi or CD31+Sca-1+) were significantly reduced in diseased mice (Figures S3G and S3H). To better understand how AML affects overall BM stroma, we imaged chimeric mice bearing membrane-bound Tomato+ stroma and wild-type, non-fluorescent hematopoietic cells injected with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)+GFP+ double-positive AML blasts. At >50% BM infiltration, we observed a dramatic reduction of overall stromal cells in vivo, including the stroma surrounding blood vessels and adjacent to bone (Figure S4A). Consistent with this pattern, extensive IVM time-lapse (7–12 hr) of these mice revealed that blood vessels underwent abnormal oscillations, suggesting that their anchorage to the surrounding parenchyma had been lost (Figure S4B; Movie S4, arrowheads). Extensive stroma loss was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of non-chimeric mice, revealing a >10-fold reduction in the number of CD45− Ter119− cells in the BM of AML-burdened mice (Figure S4C). To better understand the process leading to such dramatic overhaul of BM stroma, we performed live imaging at earlier stages (days 10–12 post-injection of leukemia blasts; 5%–15% infiltration). At these earlier time points, we could compare areas with low and high infiltration within the same mouse (Figure S4D). Here, peri-vascular and endosteal stroma were depleted in highly infiltrated areas, whereas both components maintained a normal appearance in weakly infiltrated areas, suggesting that AML cells remodel the stroma locally after reaching a certain threshold density. Because the endosteal endothelium has been shown to locate next to and sustain osteoblasts (Kusumbe et al., 2014Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Adams R.H. Coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis by a specific vessel subtype in bone.Nature. 2014; 507: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), we expanded our analysis of the endosteal microenvironment to include a focused investigation of osteoblastic cells (CFP+ or GFP+ cells in Col2.3-CFP/GFP reporter mice, respectively) during AML growth. IVM of the calvarium of Col2.3-GFP mice revealed that GFP+ osteoblastic cells were significantly reduced in an infiltration-dependent manner (Figures 4A and 4B ). IVM of chimeras containing CFP+ osteoblastic cells, mTomato+ healthy hematopoietic cells, and YFP+GFP+ leukemia revealed that AML cells, as they remodel stroma and vessels locally, also outcompete healthy hematopoietic cells and eliminate osteoblastic cells (Figures 4C and 4D). This finding indicated that microenvironmental and hematopoietic changes induced by leukemia evolve focally and in parallel. IVM of healthy and highly infiltrated double-transgenic Flk1-GFP/Col2.3-CFP mice confirmed that osteoblasts and endosteal vessels were lost in the presence of AML, whereas central vessels were maintained (Figure 4E). To understand whether one microenvironment component may be lost first, we analyzed long bone sections from mice at intermediate stages of disease (Figure 4F). Within the same bone, osteoblasts were significantly decreased only in areas with high levels of leukemic infiltration (Figure 4G), whereas we could detect loss of endosteal vessels in areas with intermediate levels of infiltration (Figure 4H). These data suggest that endosteal vessels may be lost earlier than osteoblasts. We next investigated the hematopoietic changes associated with microenvironment remodeling. Analysis of non-chimeric mice with increasing AML infiltration by flow cytometry showed a progressive decrease of overall normal hematopoietic cells in the BM (Figure 1B) and more specifically of Lineage−, cKit+ Sca-1+ (LKS) progenitor cell and LKS CD48− CD150+ HSC populations (Figures 5A and S5A). Importantly, HSCs in the BM were significantly reduced only at late stages of disease (Figure 5A), when endosteal and metaphyseal vessels, as well as osteoblastic cells, were all drastically reduced (Figures 3 and 4). Furthermore, whereas LKS cells are lost in areas both distant from (flushed diaphysis) and close to (crushed metaphysis) the bone (Figure 5B), HSCs are most dramatically lost in the bone-rich metaphysis (Figure 5C). This observation highlights the association and consequent tandem collapse of endosteal vessels and HSCs at late stages of AML. We also observed that, as disease progresses, the number of HSCs in the spleen increases (Figures 5D, 5E, and S5B). Notably, this hematopoietic elevation coincides with an increase of splenic ECs (Figure 5F). To reconcile our initial observations on the morphological and structural changes in BM vessels of AML-infiltrated animals (Figures 2 and 3) with the progressive loss of normal hematopoietic cells (Figures 5A–5F), we asked whether they could result in increased hematopoietic cell trafficking. We performed paired IVM of BM and spleen in the same AML-burdened and control mice (Figure S5C) and observed increased numbers of healthy hematopoietic cells adhering to (Figures 5G and 5H; Movie S5) and transmigrating across (Figures 5I and 5J; Movie S6) endothelial cells in leukemic mice. This pattern of egress may contribute to the loss of BM hematopoiesis. We also observed AML cell clusters that adhered to the endothelial cells on their intravascular surface and compromised blood flow (Movie S7), likely contributing to the observed functional alterations of the endothelium (Ramasamy et al., 2016Ramasamy S.K. Kusumbe A.P. Schiller M. Zeuschner D. Bixel M.G. Milia C. Gamrekelashvili J. Limbourg A. Medvinsky A. Santoro M.M. et al.Blood flow controls bone vascular function and osteogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13601Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To confirm that HSC loss from the BM was due to the microenvironmental changes we observed rather than a direct effect of leukemia cells on the stem cells, we asked whether the remodeled BM would still have the capacity to support homing of HSCs. To this end, we transplanted DiD-labeled HSCs into lethally irradiated control and leukemic mice (Figure 6A). Two days after transplantation, significantly lower numbers of HSCs were found in the BM of leukemic mice (Figure 6B). This observation suggests that AML leads to a specific collapse of HSC-supportive BM niches, as previously hypothesized for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Colmone et al., 2008Colmone A. Amorim M. Pontier A.L. Wang S. Jablonski E. Sipkins D.A. Leukemic cells create bone marrow niches that disrupt the behavior of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.Science. 2008; 322: 1861-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether maintenance of BM endosteal endothelium during AML growth would protect HSCs in endosteal areas. To address this, we treated leukemic mice with deferoxamine (DFO), a clinically approved prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor normally administered as an iron chelator but also recently described to induce endosteal vessel expansion through enhancement of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) stability and activity (Kusumbe et al., 2014Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Adams R.H. Coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis by a specific vessel subtype in bone.Nature. 2014; 507: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). DFO or control (PBS) treatment started 8 days post-injection of AML blasts and continued until day 22 post-transplantation, at which time point the BM was heavily infiltrated (Figure 6C). DFO-treated mice had similar numbers of AML cells in the BM (Figure 6D) and similar disease progression (Figures S6A and S6B) and survival (Figure S6C). Endosteal blood vessels were increased in DFO-treated mice (Figures 6E and 6F). Consistent with our hypothesis that HSC numbers depend on endosteal vessels, we observed that leukemic mice receiving DFO had significantly higher numbers of HSCs in the trabecular-rich metaphysis, but not in flushed diaphyseal BM (Figures 6G and 6H). A direct positive effect of DFO on HSC numbers was excluded through in vitro culture (Figures S6D–S6G). To further investigate the clinical utility of DFO, we investigated the homing of HSCs in mice infiltrated with AML and treated with DFO or vehicle (Figure 6I). In line with our hypothesis, DFO-treated mice supported HSC homing to the BM (Figure 6J). Altogether, these data suggested that rescue of endosteal vessels can support HSCs despite AML growth and improve HSC homing. The obse"

We now show that reducing the RBP T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1) in vivo protects against neurodegeneration and prolongs survival in transgenic P301S Tau mice. Biochemical fractionation shows co-enrichment and co-localization of tau oligomers and RBPs in transgenic P301S Tau mice. Reducing TIA1 decreased the number and size of granules co-localizing with stress granule markers. Decreasing TIA1 also inhibited the accumulation of tau oligomers at the expense of increasing neurofibrillary tangles. Despite the increase in neurofibrillary tangles, TIA1 reduction increased neuronal survival and rescued behavioral deficits and lifespan. These data provide in vivo evidence that TIA1 plays a key role in mediating toxicity and further suggest that RBPs direct the pathway of tau aggregation and the resulting neurodegeneration. We propose a model in which dysfunction of the translational stress response leads to tau-mediated pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2780673440,"Many tumors produce platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-DD, which promotes cellular proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stromal reaction, and angiogenesis through autocrine and paracrine PDGFRβ signaling. By screening a secretome library, we found that the human immunoreceptor NKp44, encoded by NCR2 and expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and innate lymphoid cells, recognizes PDGF-DD. PDGF-DD engagement of NKp44 triggered NK cell secretion of interferon gamma (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that induced tumor cell growth arrest. A distinctive transcriptional signature of PDGF-DD-induced cytokines and the downregulation of tumor cell-cycle genes correlated with NCR2 expression and greater survival in glioblastoma. NKp44 expression in mouse NK cells controlled the dissemination of tumors expressing PDGF-DD more effectively than control mice, an effect enhanced by blockade of the inhibitory receptor CD96 or CpG-oligonucleotide treatment. Thus, while cancer cell production of PDGF-DD supports tumor growth and stromal reaction, it concomitantly activates innate immune responses to tumor expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2778963731,"Self-reactive IgGs contribute to the pathology of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Paradoxically, IgGs are used to treat inflammatory diseases in the form of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Distinct glycoforms on the IgG crystallizable fragment (Fc) dictate these divergent functions. IgG anti-inflammatory activity is attributed to sialylation of the Fc glycan. We therefore sought to convert endogenous IgG to anti-inflammatory mediators in vivo by engineering solubilized glycosyltransferases that attach galactose or sialic acid. When both enzymes were administered in a prophylactic or therapeutic fashion, autoimmune inflammation was markedly attenuated in vivo. The enzymes worked through a similar pathway to IVIG, requiring DC-SIGN, STAT6 signaling, and FcγRIIB. Importantly, sialylation was highly specific to pathogenic IgG at the site of inflammation, driven by local platelet release of nucleotide-sugar donors. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of glycoengineering in vivo."

We previously generated directly reprogrammed induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) by overexpression of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) using retrovirus vectors. However, integrating vectors pose risks associated with insertional mutagenesis and disruption of gene expression and are inefficient. Here, we show that Sendai virus (SeV) vectors expressing cardiac reprogramming factors efficiently and rapidly reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts into integration-free iCMs via robust transgene expression. SeV-GMT generated 100-fold more beating iCMs than retroviral-GMT and shortened the duration to induce beating cells from 30 to 10 days in mouse fibroblasts. In vivo lineage tracing revealed that the gene transfer of SeV-GMT was more efficient than retroviral-GMT in reprogramming resident cardiac fibroblasts into iCMs in mouse infarct hearts. Moreover, SeV-GMT improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis after myocardial infarction. Thus, efficient, non-integrating SeV vectors may serve as a powerful system for cardiac regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2779884866,"Telomere maintenance dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). However, the mechanism of how telomere length is related to fibrosis in the lungs is unknown. Surgical lung biopsies of IPF patients typically show a heterogeneous pattern of non-fibrotic and fibrotic areas. Therefore, telomere length (TL) in both lung areas of patients with IPF and familial interstitial pneumonia was compared, specifically in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to determine TL in non-fibrotic and fibrotic areas of 35 subjects. Monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MMqPCR) was used for 51 whole lung biopsies and blood TL measurements. For sporadic IPF subjects, AT2 cell TL in non-fibrotic areas was 56% longer than in fibrotic areas. No such difference was observed in the surrounding lung cells. In subjects carrying a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mutation, AT2 cell TL was significantly shorter than in sporadic subjects. However, no difference in surrounding cell TL was observed between these subject groups. Finally, using biopsy MMqPCR TL measurements, it was determined that IPF subjects with shortest lung TL had a significantly worse survival than patients with long TL. This study shows that shortening of telomeres critically affects AT2 cells in fibrotic areas, implying TL as a cause of fibrogenesis. Furthermore, short lung telomere length is associated with decreased survival."

Our data provide the climate background to the destruction of the nearby Mycenaean Palace of Nestor at Pylos at the transition from Late Helladic (LH) IIIB to LH IIIC, ~3150-3130 years before present (before AD 1950, hereafter yrs BP) and the subsequent period. S1 is dated by 24 U-Th dates with an averaged precision of ±26 yrs (2σ), providing one of the most robust paleoclimate records from the eastern Mediterranean for the end of the Late Bronze Age (LBA). The δ18O record shows generally wetter conditions at the time when the Palace of Nestor at Pylos was destroyed, but a brief period of drier conditions around 3200 yrs BP may have disrupted the Mycenaean agricultural system that at the time was likely operating close to its limit. Gradually developing aridity after 3150 yrs BP, i.e. subsequent to the destruction, probably reduced crop yields and helped to erode the basis for the reinstitution of a central authority and the Palace itself."
https://openalex.org/W2778371518,"Summary Early life stress (ELS) in the form of child abuse/neglect is associated with an increased risk of developing social dysfunction in adulthood. Little is known, however, about the neural substrates or the neuromodulatory signaling that govern ELS-induced social dysfunction. Here, we show that ELS-induced downregulation of dopamine receptor 3 (Drd3) signaling and its corresponding effects on neural activity in the lateral septum (LS) are both necessary and sufficient to cause social abnormalities in adulthood. Using in vivo Ca 2+ imaging, we found that Drd3-expressing-LS (Drd3 LS ) neurons in animals exposed to ELS show blunted activity in response to social stimuli. In addition, optogenetic activation of Drd3 LS neurons rescues ELS-induced social impairments. Furthermore, pharmacological treatment with a Drd3 agonist, which increases Drd3 LS neuronal activity, normalizes the social dysfunctions of ELS mice. Thus, we identify Drd3 in the LS as a critical mediator and potential therapeutic target for the social abnormalities caused by ELS."

We conclude that gustatory detection of Ca2+ represents an additional sense of taste in Drosophila and is required for avoiding toxic levels of this mineral. The ability to discriminate the chemical composition of food is used by most animals to identify calorie-rich foods and to consume the appropriate concentrations of minerals. Many animals ranging from flies to humans, perceive sugars as attractive, and bitter compounds as aversive (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This differs from the behavioral responses to Na+, which reverse depending on the concentration (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Na+ is required for survival, and low levels are attractive, whereas high concentrations can be toxic and are repulsive to the taste. Similar to Na+, low or modest levels of Ca2+ promote survival, and high concentrations can lead to adverse effects. In humans, hypercalcemia is associated with many common diseases and can be life threatening (reviewed in Žofková, 2016Žofková I. Hypercalcemia. Pathophysiological aspects.Physiol. Res. 2016; 65: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the extensive behavioral and mechanistic studies focusing on other forms of taste, especially sweet and bitter (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), far less is known about Ca2+ taste. While some studies support the concept that humans perceive Ca2+ in food (Tordoff, 2001Tordoff M.G. Calcium: Taste, intake, and appetite.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1567-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the sensitivity of humans to Ca2+ is unresolved. One study suggests that a human taste receptor contributes to sensing Ca2+ (T1R3) (Tordoff et al., 2012Tordoff M.G. Alarcón L.K. Valmeki S. Jiang P. T1R3: A human calcium taste receptor.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 496Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism is unclear because this receptor also functions in the gustatory detection of sweet and umami in mammals (Max et al., 2001Max M. Shanker Y.G. Huang L. Rong M. Liu Z. Campagne F. Weinstein H. Damak S. Margolskee R.F. Tas1r3, encoding a new candidate taste receptor, is allelic to the sweet responsiveness locus Sac.Nat.

Nevertheless, due to the positive and negative effects of Ca2+ on health, in principle, detection of this mineral could be attractive or repulsive depending on its concentration. To address the fundamental questions concerning the behavioral, molecular, and cellular mechanisms through which an animal tastes Ca2+, we focused on the vinegar fly. We found that flies are indifferent to modest levels of Ca2+ in food. However, they show strong repulsion to high Ca2+, indicating that they possess the sense of Ca2+ taste. Ca2+ avoidance was mediated by neurons distinct from those that respond to bitter compounds. A diet containing high levels of Ca2+ diminished viability. We found that three members of family of variant ionotropic receptors (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) (IR25a, IR62a, and IR76b) are required for the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to Ca2+, indicating that they are critical molecular components that enable flies to avoid ingesting excessive levels of Ca2+. To determine the behavioral response of Drosophila to Ca2+, we employed a binary food choice assay (Meunier et al., 2003Meunier N. Marion-Poll F. Rospars J.P. Tanimura T. Peripheral coding of bitter taste in Drosophila.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Moon et al., 2006Moon S.J. Köttgen M. Jiao Y. Xu H. Montell C. A taste receptor required for the caffeine response in vivo.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1812-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We mixed 2 mM sucrose or 2 mM sucrose plus various concentrations of CaCl2 with either blue or red food dye and determined the feeding preferences by inspection of the colors of the abdomens. Complete preference for 2 mM sucrose or 2 mM sucrose and CaCl2 results in preference indexes (P.I.s) of 1.0 and −1.0, respectively, whereas no taste bias results in a P.I. of 0. In the absence of CaCl2, the flies show no discrimination (Figure 1A), demonstrating that the red and blue dyes do not affect this feeding behavior. 0.1 mM CaCl2 had no impact on their taste preference, demonstrating that it was neither attractive nor aversive (Figure 1A). However, higher concentrations of Ca2+ mixed with sucrose (0.5–10 mM CaCl2) induced progressively stronger avoidance (Figure 1A). The Cl2 was not responsible for this repulsion since flies show no distaste for 10–100 mM MgCl2 (Figure S1A), while 1 and 10 mM levels of other Ca2+-containing compounds were also aversive (Figure S1B). Thus, flies have a sense of Ca2+ taste. We tested a range of CaCl2 levels to determine the concentration necessary to eliminate the strong preference for 5 mM sucrose over 1 mM sucrose (Figure 1B). Addition of 10 mM CaCl2 neutralized this bias, while inclusion of ≥15 mM CaCl2 to the 5 mM sucrose caused the animals to prefer the lower concentration of sugar (Figure 1B). We also applied different concentration of CaCl2 mixed with sucrose directly to the labellum and performed the proboscis extension response (PER). 2% sucrose alone stimulated a PER in all flies, while addition of CaCl2 decreased this response in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure S1C). These data indicate that Ca2+ that is sensed by the labellum causes repulsion. To identify the gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) required for Ca2+ avoidance, we used the GAL4/UAS system to selectively express a pro-cell death gene (UAS-hid) under the control of GAL4s that mark different classes of GRNs. These include the Gr33a-GAL4 and the Gr5a-GAL4, which are expressed in all bitter- and sweet-sensing GRNs, respectively (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C.

We also used the ppk28-GAL4, which is expressed in GRNs that elicit attractive responses to water (Cameron et al., 2010Cameron P. Hiroi M. Ngai J. Scott K.

The Drosophila female aphrodisiac pheromone activates ppk23(+) sensory neurons to elicit male courtship behavior.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, expression of UAS-hid under control of the ppk23-GAL4/+ background greatly reduced the gustatory aversion to CaCl2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1D). In contrast, there were no significant effects from combining UAS-hid with the other GAL4s (Figures 1C and S1D). Thus, ppk23-positive GRNs are essential for tasting Ca2+. To test whether activation of ppk23 neurons causes aversive behavior, we activated these neurons by expressing the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1. We allowed the flies to choose between 2 mM sucrose versus 2 mM sucrose plus 100 μM capsaicin. Capsaicin alone does not cause repulsion in control flies or in animals expressing just the ppk23-GAL4 or UAS-trpV1 (Figure S1E) (Marella et al., 2006Marella S. Fischler W. Kong P. Asgarian S. Rueckert E. Scott K. Imaging taste responses in the fly brain reveals a functional map of taste category and behavior.Neuron. 2006; 49: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, flies expressing UAS-trpV1 under the control of the ppk23-GAL4 avoided capsaicin (Figure S1E), indicating that activation of ppk23 GRNs causes gustatory avoidance. To address whether Ca2+ induces action potentials in GRNs, we performed tip recordings. There are three size classes of taste sensilla. S- and I-type sensilla house both attractive and aversive GRNs, whereas L-type sensilla contain GRNs that respond to attractive but not aversive tastants (Freeman and Dahanukar, 2015Freeman E.G. Dahanukar A. Molecular neurobiology of Drosophila taste.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 34: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Weiss et al., 2011Weiss L.A. Dahanukar A. Kwon J.Y. Banerjee D. Carlson J.R. The molecular and cellular basis of bitter taste in Drosophila.Neuron. 2011; 69: 258-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We surveyed the taste sensilla using 50 mM CaCl2 and found that six S-type but no I- or L-type produced robust spikes (Figure 1E). S5 bristles responded with the highest action potential frequency. Therefore, we determined the dose-dependent responses of S5 and found that the action potential frequencies saturated at 50 mM CaCl2 (Figures 1F and 1G). The frequencies of Ca2+-induced action potentials were dramatically reduced in ppk23-GAL4/UAS-hid flies (Figure 1E), demonstrating that ppk23-positive GRNs mediate Ca2+-induced action potentials. Bitter organic tastants such as caffeine and DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) suppress feeding through two mechanisms. They activate bitter-responsive GRNs, and they suppress sugar-activated GRNs (Jeong et al., 2013Jeong Y.T. Shim J. Oh S.R. Yoon H.I. Kim C.H. Moon S.J. Montell C.

To investigate whether Ca2+ inhibits sugar-responsive GRNs, we tested 10, 25, and 50 mM CaCl2 and recorded from L4 and L6 sensilla. We found that CaCl2 reduced the neuronal firing activated by 50 mM sucrose (Figure 1H). In contrast, neither MgCl2 nor NaCl diminished sugar-induced action potentials (Figures 1I and 1J). Thus, high levels of Ca2+ suppress feeding through dual mechanisms: activation of ppk23-positive GRNs and inhibition of sugar-activated GRNs. To identify candidate receptors/cation channels that are required for Ca2+ taste, we performed two-way choice assays using 1 mM sucrose alone versus 5 mM sucrose plus 25 mM CaCl2. We screened mutations disrupting two GRs (GR33a and GR66a), which are broadly required for the aversive responses to most bitter compounds, and two other GRs (GR8a and GR98b), which are required for sensing the toxic amino acid, L-canavanine (Lee et al., 2010Lee Y.

None of these Gr mutations significantly impaired Ca2+ avoidance (Figure 2A), consistent with the absence of a significant impairment of Ca2+ repulsion after killing Gr33a GRNs with UAS-hid (Figure 1C). We also considered PPK23 because it is a member of the family of Degenerin/Epithelial Na+ channels, and ablation of ppk23-positive GRNs reduces Ca2+ avoidance. Although the ppk23-null mutant showed a reduced P.I., the difference from the control was not statistically significant (Figure 2A p = 0.45). Ionotropic receptors (IRs) (Benton et al., 2009Benton R.

Ni J. Montell C. The molecular basis for attractive salt-taste coding in Drosophila.Science. 2013; 340: 1334-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To interrogate potential roles for IRs, we tested requirements for family members that are expressed in the labellum, as well as in GRNs in taste sensilla decorating the legs and wing margins. We examined the effects of mutations and RNAi lines affecting 20 Ir genes and found that the Ir25a2, Ir62a1, and Ir76b1 mutations strongly impaired Ca2+ avoidance (Figure 2A) and did so over the range of CaCl2 concentrations tested (10–25 mM; Figure 2B). In contrast, we observed normal Ca2+ responses elicited by other existing Ir mutations (Ir21a1 and Ir56b1), by flies with mutations in Ir7a, Ir47a, Ir52a, Ir56a, and Ir94h, which we generated using homologous recombination as part of a separate study and by the RNAi lines tested (Figure 2A). The lack of phenotype using RNAi was not due to ineffectiveness of elav-GAL4;UAS-Dicer2, since we replicated the Ir25a2 phenotype by knocking down Ir25a (Figure 2A). To provide additional evidence that the deficits in Ca2+ avoidance were due to losses of Ir25a, Ir62a, or Ir76b, we conducted genetic rescue experiments. We found that the behavioral impairments exhibited by Ir25a2, Ir62a1, and Ir76b1 flies were suppressed by expression of the corresponding wild-type cDNAs using the Ir25a-GAL4, Ir76b-GAL4, or the ppk23-GAL4 (Figures 2C–2E). The deficit in Ir25a2 was also reversed using a genomic Ir25a transgene (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the profound deficits in Ca2+-activated action potentials in Ir25a2, Ir62a1, and Ir76b1 animals were significantly reversed by the wild-type transgenes (Figure 3). We conclude that these IRs are required for sensing Ca2+ in GRNs. However, they were not sufficient to confer Ca2+ sensitivity since misexpression of all three in sugar-responsive GRNs using the Gr5a-GAL4 did not confer attraction to Ca2+-containing food or induce Ca2+-activated action potentials (Figure S2). IR25a is expressed in the labellum (Croset et al., 2010Croset V. Rytz R. Cummins S.F. Budd A. Brawand D. Kaessmann H. Gibson T.J. Benton R. Ancient protostome origin of chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptors and the evolution of insect taste and olfaction.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001064Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), but the specific classes of GRNs expressing IR25a have not been analyzed. We first characterized the Ir25a-GAL4 reporter using UAS-mCD8::GFP to determine whether it reflected the same expression pattern as anti-IR25a. We found that anti-GFP and anti-IR25a staining overlapped extensively (Figures S3A–S3G). We introduced Ir25a-GAL4;UAS-mCD8::GFP into the Ir25a2 mutant background and found that the anti-GFP signals were indistinguishable between control and Ir25a2 flies (Figures S3H–S3J), indicating that the Ir25a2 mutation did not result in loss of IR25a-expressing GRNs. We compared anti-IR25a staining with a variety of reporters and found that IR25a exhibited wide overlap with different classes of GRNs. Anti-IR25a staining overlapped extensively with the ppk23-GAL4 reporter (Figures 4A–4C and S3K–S3P), and anti-IR25a staining was undetectable in labella expressing UAS-hid under control of the ppk23-GAL4 (Figures S3Q and S3R). We also detected anti-IR25a staining in all bitter-sensing GRNs, which are labeled by the Gr66a reporter (Figures 4D–4F), all carbonation buffer-sensing GRNs, which are stained by the E409 GAL4 enhancer trap reporter (Figures 4G–4I), and a subset of sugar-sensing GRNs, which are marked by the Gr5a reporter (Figures 4J–4L). This indicates that IR25a is an exceptionally widely expressed chemoreceptor. To address whether the three IRs are co-expressed in the same GRNs, we performed double-labeling experiments. We found that IR76b was co-expressed extensively with IR25a (Figures 4M–4O and S4A–S4C). The Ir62a-GAL4 reporter is not detected in the labellum (Koh et al., 2014Koh T.W. He Z. Gorur-Shandilya S. Menuz K. Larter N.K. Stewart S. Carlson J.R. The Drosophila IR20a clade of ionotropic receptors are candidate taste and pheromone receptors.Neuron. 2014; 83: 850-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, it is expressed in the legs (Koh et al., 2014Koh T.W. He Z. Gorur-Shandilya S. Menuz K. Larter N.K. Stewart S. Carlson J.R. The Drosophila IR20a clade of ionotropic receptors are candidate taste and pheromone receptors.Neuron. 2014; 83: 850-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), as are the Ir25a-GAL4 and Ir76b-GAL4 reporters (Figures S4D–S4L). Therefore, to explore whether Ir62a RNA is expressed in the labellum, we performed RT-PCR using dissected labella and found the predicted 1.8 kb band in wild-type labella (Figure S4M). However, we did not detect the band from labella from flies expressing UAS-hid under control of the Ir25a-GAL4 (Figure S4M). Combined, these data support the proposal that Ir25a, Ir62a, and Ir76b expression overlap extensively in the labellum. Because flies avoid high levels of Ca2+, we tested whether high Ca2+ is toxic to the flies. We compared the survival of flies maintained on 100 mM fructose or on fructose mixed with different concentrations of CaCl2 (Figure 4P). There was virtually no lethality after 8.5 days in the absence of Ca2+. We found that Ca2+ decreased viability in a concentration-dependent manner. There was only slight toxicity due to 10 mM Ca2+ (Figure 4P). However, if the fructose was laced with 25 or 50 mM CaCl2, none of the flies survived after 8.5 and 8 days, respectively (Figure 4P). The times in which 50% died (LT50) were 163.5 ± 9.3 hr and 121.9 ± 10.5 hr for flies fed 25 and 50 mM Ca2+, respectively. 100 mM CaCl2 feeding affected survival rate more significantly (64.1 ± 8.5 hr). If the flies were fed MgCl2 plus fructose, there was minimal lethality even after 204 hr (Figure 4Q). To clarify whether the death is due to Ca2+ toxicity or to the detection of an aversive compound that induces stress, we tested Ca2+-insensitive mutants using a binary food-choice survival assay (Figures S4N–S4O). The flies were allowed to choose between 100 mM fructose alone and 200 mM fructose mixed with either 50 mM Ca2+ (Figure S4N) or 100 mM Ca2+ (Figure S4O). Nearly all of the control flies survived for 10 days. However, Ir25a2, Ir62a1, and Ir76b1 flies as well as ppk23-GAL4/UAS-hid animals showed high levels of concentration-dependent lethality (Figures S4N–S4O). After 10 days on the fructose versus fructose plus 100 mM Ca2+, <26.5% of the Ir25a2 or Ir62a1 flies were alive, while none of the Ir76b1 flies survived (Figure S4O). These findings support the conclusion that feeding on high Ca2+ induces lethality due to Ca2+ toxicity. Ca2+ is an essential mineral. However, at high levels it causes toxicity (Žofková, 2016Žofková I. Hypercalcemia. Pathophysiological aspects.Physiol. Res. 2016; 65: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, consuming the ideal Ca2+concentration is critical. Despite the fundamental importance of Ca2+ for health, behavioral studies focusing on Ca2+ attraction or avoidance have been limited, and these areas are unexplored in Drosophila. We found that flies are endowed with the ability to taste Ca2+. Surprisingly, rather than displaying attraction and repulsion to low and high concentrations of Ca2+, respectively, which would be reminiscent of the Na+ response, there is no attraction to low Ca2+. The only reaction to Ca2+ is repulsion to high levels. The lack of Ca2+ attraction suggests that the normal environmental sources of nutrition for vinegar flies have ample Ca2+, and there is no need for selecting a taste modality for Ca2+ attraction. The avoidance behavior is due to Ca2+ rather than Cl–, because there is no avoidance to MgCl2, while other Ca2+ salts are aversive. The question arises as to why vinegar flies have the capacity to avoid very high levels of Ca2+. Indeed, the Ca2+ concentration in the leaves of plants, such as tomatoes, eggplants, and others, reaches 100 mM (Watanabe et al., 2016Watanabe T. Maejima E. Yoshimura T. Urayama M. Yamauchi A. Owadano M. Okada R. Osaki M. Kanayama Y. Shinano T. The ionomic study of vegetable crops.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0160273Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the capacity of flies to sense and avoid Ca2+ levels at least as high as 100 mM deters them from consuming high Ca2+ in their environment. Unexpectedly, in addition to activating GRNs in S-type sensilla, Ca2+ also suppresses sugar-activated GRNs in L-type sensilla. The influence of Ca2+ on two types of taste receptor cells is reminiscent of the simultaneous effects of bitter compounds on activation of avoidance GRNs and inhibition of sugar-activated GRNs (Jeong et al., 2013Jeong Y.T. Shim J. Oh S.R. Yoon H.I. Kim C.H. Moon S.J. Montell C.

Marion-Poll F. Rospars J.P. Tanimura T. Peripheral coding of bitter taste in Drosophila.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We suggest that employment of two strategies to detect high Ca2+ levels provides a double safeguard to avoid consuming excessive Ca2+, which is deleterious. Although the mechanism through which Ca2+ suppresses the sugar response remains to be defined, it might involve an odorant binding protein (OBP), as bitter compounds suppress the sugar response by binding to an OBP, which in turn associates with and inhibits sugar receptors (Jeong et al., 2013Jeong Y.T. Shim J. Oh S.R. Yoon H.I. Kim C.H. Moon S.J. Montell C. An odorant-binding protein required for suppression of sweet taste by bitter chemicals.Neuron. 2013; 79: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The taste of Ca2+ depends on three members of the variant Ir family: Ir25a, Ir62a, and Ir76b. Two of these IRs (IR25a and IR76b) are required to detect multiple types of stimuli, and this diversity appears to be defined by unique combinations of IRs, or by the IRs acting as homomeric IRs. For example, IR25a appears to be sufficient for sensing low-amplitude temperature cycles necessary for temperature synchronization of the circadian clock (Chen et al., 2015Chen C. Buhl E. Xu M. Croset V. Rees J.S. Lilley K.S. Benton R. Hodge J.J. Stanewsky R. Drosophila Ionotropic Receptor 25a mediates circadian clock resetting by temperature.Nature. 2015; 527: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) but collaborates with IR93a and IR21a for cool sensation (Knecht et al., 2016Knecht Z.A. Silbering A.F. Ni L. Klein M. Budelli G. Bell R. Abuin L. Ferrer A.J. Samuel A.D. Benton R. Garrity P.A. Distinct combinations of variant ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate thermosensation and hygrosensation in Drosophila.eLife. 2016; 5: e17879Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Ni et al., 2016Ni L.

The Ionotropic Receptors IR21a and IR25a mediate cool sensing in Drosophila.eLife. 2016; 5: e13254Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). IR25a also acts as a humidity sensor along with IR93a and IR21a. Similarly, IR76b is sufficient for sensing low salt and acts in concert with IR41a for olfactory attraction to polyamines (Hussain et al., 2016Hussain A. Zhang M. Üçpunar H.K. Svensson T. Quillery E. Gompel N. Ignell R. Grunwald Kadow I.C. Ionotropic chemosensory receptors mediate the taste and smell of polyamines.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e1002454Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2780278013,"Radial glia (RG) are embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) that produce neuroblasts and provide fibers that act as a scaffold for neuroblast migration during embryonic development. Although they normally disappear soon after birth, here we found that RG fibers can persist in injured neonatal mouse brains and act as a scaffold for postnatal ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)-derived neuroblasts that migrate to the lesion site. This injury-induced maintenance of RG fibers has a limited time window during post-natal development and promotes directional saltatory movement of neuroblasts via N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts that promote RhoA activation. Transplanting an N-cadherin-containing scaffold into injured neonatal brains likewise promotes migration and maturation of V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts, leading to functional improvements in impaired gait behaviors. Together these results suggest that RG fibers enable postnatal V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts to migrate toward sites of injury, thereby enhancing neuronal regeneration and functional recovery from neonatal brain injuries."

Using the Theory of Reasoned Action, we test the relationship between the beliefs and attitudes of scientists towards data reuse, and their self-reported data reuse behaviour. To do so, we used existing responses to selected questions from a worldwide survey of scientists developed and administered by the DataONE Usability and Assessment Working Group (thus practicing data reuse ourselves). Results show that the perceived efficacy and efficiency of data reuse are strong predictors of reuse behaviour, and that the perceived importance of data reuse corresponds to greater reuse. Expressed lack of trust in existing data and perceived norms against data reuse were not found to be major impediments for reuse contrary to our expectations. We found that reported use of models and remotely-sensed data was associated with greater reuse. The results suggest that data reuse would be encouraged and normalized by demonstration of its value. We offer some theoretical and practical suggestions that could help to legitimize investment and policies in favor of data sharing."

One mammalian phospholipid flippase at the plasma membrane is ATP11C, a type IV P-type ATPase (P4-ATPase) that forms a heterocomplex with the transmembrane protein CDC50A. However, the structural features in CDC50A that support the function of ATP11C and other P4-ATPases have not been characterized. Here, using error-prone PCR-mediated mutagenesis of human CDC50A cDNA followed by functional screening and deep sequencing, we identified 14 amino acid residues that affect ATP11C's flippase activity. These residues were all located in CDC50A's extracellular domain and were evolutionarily well-conserved. Most of the mutations decreased CDC50A's ability to chaperone ATP11C and other P4-ATPases to their destinations. The CDC50A mutants failed to form a stable complex with ATP11C and could not induce ATP11C's PtdSer-dependent ATPase activity. Notably, one mutant variant could form a stable complex with ATP11C and transfer ATP11C to the plasma membrane, yet the ATP11C complexed with this CDC50A variant had very weak or little PtdSer- or PtdEtn-dependent ATPase activity. These results indicated that the extracellular domain of CDC50A has important roles both in CDC50A's ability to chaperone ATP11C to the plasma membrane and in inducing ATP11C's ATP hydrolysis-coupled flippase activity."

Although the etiology is unknown, PE is thought to be caused by defective implantation and decidualization in pregnancy. Pregnant blood pressure high (BPH)/5 mice spontaneously develop placentopathies and maternal features of human PE. We hypothesized that BPH/5 implantation sites have transcriptomic alterations. Next-generation RNA sequencing of implantation sites at peak decidualization, embryonic day (E)7.5, revealed complement gene up-regulation in BPH/5 vs. controls. In BPH/5, expression of complement factor 3 was increased around the decidual vasculature of E7.5 implantation sites and in the trophoblast giant cell layer of E10.5 placentae. Altered expression of VEGF pathway genes in E5.5 BPH/5 implantation sites preceded complement dysregulation, which correlated with abnormal vasculature and increased placental growth factor mRNA and VEGF164 expression at E7.5. By E10.5, proangiogenic genes were down-regulated, whereas antiangiogenic sFlt-1 was up-regulated in BPH/5 placentae. We found that early local misexpression of VEGF genes and abnormal decidual vasculature preceded sFlt-1 overexpression and increased complement deposition in BPH/5 placentae. Our findings suggest that abnormal decidual angiogenesis precedes complement activation, which in turn contributes to the aberrant trophoblast invasion and poor placentation that underlie PE.-Sones, J.

To better understand disease etiology and the mechanisms of disease-risk factor associations, this analysis aimed to investigate the associations of anthropometric, sociodemographic and behavioural factors with a range of circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin. Methods Statistical analyses of individual participant data from 12,330 male controls aged 25–85 years from 25 studies involved in the Endogenous Hormones Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group. Analysis of variance was used to estimate geometric means adjusted for study and relevant covariates. Results Older age was associated with higher concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin and dihydrotestosterone and lower concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free testosterone, androstenedione, androstanediol glucuronide and free estradiol. Higher body mass index was associated with higher concentrations of free estradiol, androstanediol glucuronide, estradiol and estrone and lower concentrations of dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Taller height was associated with lower concentrations of androstenedione, testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin and higher concentrations of androstanediol glucuronide. Current smoking was associated with higher concentrations of androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin and testosterone. Alcohol consumption was associated with higher concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione and androstanediol glucuronide. East Asians had lower concentrations of androstanediol glucuronide and African Americans had higher concentrations of estrogens. Education and marital status were modestly associated with a small number of hormones. Conclusion Circulating sex hormones in men are strongly associated with age and body mass index, and to a lesser extent with smoking status and alcohol consumption."

We found that this pathway involves bortezomib-resistant degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα), despite efficient bortezomib-mediated inhibition of proteasome activity. Moreover, HAPLN1 can also confer bortezomib-resistant survival of MM cells. We propose that HAPLN1 is a novel pathogenic factor in MM that induces an atypical NF-κB activation and thereby promotes bortezomib resistance in MM cells. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a family of transcription factors that play a key role in cell survival and proliferation in many hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor used in the management of MM, can inhibit both canonical and noncanonical activation of NF-κB in MM cells.

https://openalex.org/W2781227670,"Cancer resistance is a major cause for longevity of the naked mole-rat. Recent liver transcriptome analysis in this animal compared to wild-derived mice revealed higher expression of alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and cell adhesion molecules, which contribute to the naked mole-rat’s cancer resistance. Notably, A2M is known to dramatically decrease with age in humans. We hypothesize that this might facilitate tumour development. Here we found that A2M modulates tumour cell adhesion, migration and growth by inhibition of tumour promoting signalling pathways, e.g. PI3K / AKT, SMAD and up-regulated PTEN via down-regulation of miR-21, in vitro and in tumour xenografts. A2M increases the expression of CD29 and CD44 but did not evoke EMT. Transcriptome analysis of A2M-treated tumour cells, xenografts and mouse liver demonstrated a multifaceted regulation of tumour promoting signalling pathways indicating a less tumorigenic environment mediated by A2M. By virtue of these multiple actions the naturally occurring A2M has strong potential as a novel therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2778430703,"Expression of the cell-surface glycoprotein MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) is induced in dangerous, abnormal, or ""stressed"" cells, including cancer cells, virus-infected cells, and rapidly proliferating cells. MICA is recognized by the activating immune cell receptor natural killer group 2D (NKG2D), providing a mechanism by which immune cells can identify and potentially eliminate pathological cells. Immune recognition through NKG2D is implicated in cancer, atherosclerosis, transplant rejection, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the wide range of potential therapeutic applications of MICA manipulation, the factors that control MICA expression are unclear. Here we use metabolic interventions and metabolomic analyses to show that the transition from quiescent cellular metabolism to a ""Warburg"" or biosynthetic metabolic state induces MICA expression. Specifically, we show that glucose transport into the cell and active glycolytic metabolism are necessary to up-regulate MICA expression. Active purine synthesis is necessary to support this effect of glucose, and increases in purine nucleotide levels are sufficient to induce MICA expression. Metabolic induction of MICA expression directly influences NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity by immune cells. These findings support a model of MICA regulation whereby the purine metabolic activity of individual cells is reflected by cell-surface MICA expression and is the subject of surveillance by NKG2D receptor-expressing immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2779624360,"Introduction This study was conducted to describe the changes in repeat multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) occurring in prostate cancer (PCa) patients during active surveillance (AS), and to study possible associations between mpMRI-related parameters in predicting prostate biopsy (Bx) Gleason score (GS) upgrading >3+3 and protocol-based treatment change (TC). Materials and methods The study cohort consisted of 76 AS patients with GS 3+3 PCa and at least two consecutive mpMRIs of the prostate performed between 2006–2015. Patients were followed according to the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol and an additional mpMRI. The primary end points were GS upgrading (GU) (>3+3) in protocol-based Bxs and protocol-based TC. Results Out of 76 patients, 53 (69%) had progression (PIRADS upgrade, size increase or new lesion[s]), while 18 (24%) had radiologically stable disease, and 5 (7%) had regression (PIRADS or size decrease, disappearance of lesion[s]) in repeat mpMRIs during AS. PIRADS scores of 4–5 in the initial mpMRI were associated with GU (p = 0.008) and protocol-based TC (p = 0.009). Tumour progression on repeat mpMRIs was associated with TC (p = 0.045) but not with GU (p = 1.00). PIRADS scores of 4–5 predict GU (sensitivity 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI); 0.51–0.95, specificity 0.62 [95% CI; 0.52–0.77]) with PPV and NPV values of 0.34 (95% CI; 0.21–0.55) and 0.93 (95% CI; 0.80–0.98), respectively. Conclusion mpMRI is a useful tool not only to select but also to monitor PCa patients on AS."
https://openalex.org/W2977532945,"The bark of Anadenanthera peregrina (L.) Speg and Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan were characterized in relation to anatomical and chemical features. The barks were similar and included a thin conducting phloem, a largely dilated and sclerified non-conducting phloem, and a rhyridome with periderms with thin phellem interspersed by cortical tissues. Only small differences between species were observed that cannot be used alone for taxonomic purposes. The summative chemical composition of A. peregrina and A. colubrina was respectively: 8.2% and 7.7% ash; 28.8% and 29.3% extractives; 2.4% and 2.6% suberin; and 18.9% lignin. The monosaccharide composition showed the predominance of glucose (on average 82% of total neutral sugars) and of xylose (9%). The ethanol-water extracts of A. peregrina and A. colubrina barks included a high content of phenolics, respectively: total phenolics 583 and 682 mg GAE/g extract; 148 and 445 mg CE/g extract; tannins 587 and 98 mg CE/g extract. The antioxidant activity was 238 and 269 mg Trolox/g extract. The barks of the Anadenanthera species are a potential source of polar extractives that will represent an important valorization and therefore contribute to improve the overall economic potential and sustainability of A. peregrina and A. colubrina."
https://openalex.org/W2781081280,"Compared to simple sugars, complex carbohydrates have been assumed invisible to taste. However, two recent studies proposed that there may be a perceivable taste quality elicited by complex carbohydrates independent of sweet taste. There is precedent with behavioural studies demonstrating that rats are very attracted to complex carbohydrates, and that complex carbohydrates are preferred to simple sugars at low concentrations. This suggests that rats may have independent taste sensors for simple sugars and complex carbohydrates. The aim of this paper is to investigate oral sensitivities of two different classes of complex carbohydrates (a soluble digestible and a soluble non-digestible complex carbohydrate), and to compare these to other caloric and non-nutritive sweeteners in addition to the prototypical tastes using two commonly used psychophysical measures. There were strong correlations between the detection thresholds and mean intensity ratings for complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin, oligofructose) (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). There were no significant correlations between the detection thresholds of the complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin, oligofructose) and the sweeteners (glucose, fructose, sucralose, Rebaudioside A, erythritol) (all P > 0.05). However, moderate correlations were observed between perceived intensities of complex carbohydrates and sweeteners (r = 0.48–0.61, P < 0.05). These data provide evidence that complex carbohydrates can be sensed in the oral cavity over a range of concentrations independent of sweet taste sensitivity at low concentrations, but with partial overlap with sweet taste intensity at higher concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2779295273,"Introduction Deployment of rotavirus vaccines has contributed to significant declines in diarrheal morbidity and mortality globally. Unfortunately, vaccine performance in low-middle income countries (LMICs) is generally lower than in developed countries. The cause for this has been associated with several host and maternal factors including poor water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) status, which are predominant in LMICs. More recently, environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) has specifically been hypothesized to contribute to poor vaccine uptake and response. The aim of this study was to examine the association between serological biomarkers of EED and seroconversion to rotavirus vaccine in Zambian infants. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 142 infants who had been fully immunized with Rotarix™, and had known seroconversion status. Seroconversion was defined as 4-fold or more increase in rotavirus-specific IgA titres between pre-vaccination and one month post-dose two vaccination. We performed ELISA assays to assess soluble CD14 (sCD14), Endotoxin Core IgG Antibodies (EndoCAb), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP) and Zonulin according to the manufacturers protocols. Generalised linear model with family-poisson, link-log and robust standard error was used to estimate the independent effects of biomarkers on seroconversion adjusting for important cofounders. Results The median concentration of Zonulin, Soluble CD14, EndoCaB, and IFABP were 209.3 (IQR = 39.7, 395.1), 21.5 (IQR = 21.5, 21.5), 0.3 (IQR = 0.3, 0.3), and 107.7 (IQR = 6.4, 1141.4) respectively. In multivariable analyses adjusting for the independent effect of other biomarkers and confounders (i.e. age of child at vaccination, breast-milk anti-rotavirus IgA, infant serum anti-rotavirus IgG, and IgA seropositivity at baseline), there was strong evidence of about 24% increase in seroconversion due to doubling Zonulin concentration (Adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.12 to1.37; p<0.0001). Similarly, we found about 7% increase in seroconversion due to doubling IFABP concentration (aRR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.13; p = 0.006). Conclusion We found that high levels of zonulin and IFABP played a role in seroconversion. It is plausible that increased gut permeability in EED allows greater uptake of the live virus within the vaccine, but later consequences result in deleterious local structural distortions and malabsorption syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2780638868,"Exchange activities, formal or otherwise, serve a variety of purposes and were prominent in many Pacific Island societies, both during island settlement and in late prehistory. Recent Polynesian studies highlight the role of exchange in the region’s most hierarchical polities where it contributed to wealth economies, emergent leadership, and status rivalry in late prehistory. Building on this research, we hypothesized that exchange in low hierarchy chiefdoms (kin-based polities where there are distinctions between commoners and elites but ranking within the latter is lacking, weak, or ephemeral) would differ in frequency and function from that associated with strongly hierarchical polities. We address this hypothesis through geochemical, morphological, and distributional analyses of stone tools on Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands. Non-destructive Energy-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) and destructive Wavelength-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (WDXRF) analyses of 278 complete and broken tools (adzes, chisels, preforms) from four valleys identify use of stone from at least seven sources on three islands: five on Nuku Hiva and one each on Eiao and Ua Pou. A functional analysis demonstrates that no tool form is limited to a particular source, while inter-valley distributions reveal that the proportions of non-local or extra-valley tools (43 to 94%, mean = 77%) approximate or exceed results from other archipelagoes, including those from elite and ritual sites of Polynesian archaic states. Intra-valley patterns also are unexpected, with non-local stone tools being recovered from both elite and commoner residential areas in near-equal proportions. Our findings unambiguously demonstrate the importance of exchange in late prehistoric Marquesan society, at varied social and geographic scales. We propose the observed patterns are the result of elites using non-local tools as political currency, aimed at reinforcing status, cementing client-patron relations, and building extra-valley alliances, consistent with prestige societies elsewhere and early historic accounts from the Marquesan Islands."

The molecular mechanisms by which protein machineries control force transmission along this molecular axis (i.e. modulating integrin activation and controlling actin polymerization) remain largely unknown. Talin is a major actin-binding protein that controls both the inside-out activation of integrins and actin filament anchoring and thus plays a major role in the establishment of the actin-extracellular matrix mechanical coupling. Talin contains three actin-binding domains (ABDs). The N-terminal head domain contains both the F3 integrin-activating domain and ABD1, whereas the C-terminal rod contains the actin-anchoring ABD2 and ABD3. Integrin binding is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal head and a C-terminal five-helix bundle (R9). Whether talin ABDs regulate actin polymerization in a constitutive or regulated manner has not been fully explored. Here, we combine kinetics assays using fluorescence spectroscopy and single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to examine relevant functions of the three ABDs of talin. We find that the N-terminal ABD1 blocks actin filament barbed-end elongation, whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not show any activity. By mutating residues in ABD1, we find that this activity is mediated by a positively charged surface that is partially masked by its intramolecular interaction with R9.

https://openalex.org/W2780898942,"Many animals go through one or more metamorphoses during their lives, however, the molecular underpinnings of metamorphosis across diverse species are not well understood. Medusozoa (Cnidaria) is a clade of animals with complex life cycles, these life cycles can include a polyp stage that metamorphoses into a medusa (jellyfish). Medusae are produced through a variety of different developmental mechanisms—in some species polyps bud medusae (Hydrozoa), in others medusae are formed through polyp fission (Scyphozoa), while in others medusae are formed through direct transformation of the polyp (Cubozoa). To better understand the molecular mechanisms that may coordinate these different forms of metamorphosis, we tested two compounds first identified to induce metamorphosis in the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita (indomethacin and 5-methoxy-2-methylindole) on a broad diversity of medusozoan polyps. We discovered that indole-containing compounds trigger metamorphosis across a broad diversity of species. All tested discomedusan polyps metamorphosed in the presence of both compounds, including species representatives of several major lineages within the clade (Pelagiidae, Cyaneidae, both clades of Rhizostomeae). In a cubozoan, low levels of 5-methoxy-2-methylindole reliably induced complete and healthy metamorphosis. In contrast, neither compound induced medusa metamorphosis in a coronate scyphozoan, or medusa production in either hydrozoan tested. Our results support the hypothesis that metamorphosis is mediated by a conserved induction pathway within discomedusan scyphozoans, and possibly cubozoans. However, failure of these compounds to induce metamorphosis in a coronate suggests this induction mechanism may have been lost in this clade, or is convergent between Scyphozoa and Cubozoa."

The fourth and fifth steps of LLO synthesis are catalyzed by Alg2, an unusual mannosyltransferase (MTase) with two different MTase activities; Alg2 adds both an α1,3- and α1,6-mannose onto ManGlcNAc2-PDol to form the trimannosyl core Man3GlcNAc2-PDol. The biochemical properties of Alg2 are controversial and remain undefined. In this study, a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based quantitative assay was established and used to analyze the MTase activities of purified yeast Alg2. Alg2-dependent Man3GlcNAc2-PDol production relied on net-neutral lipids with a propensity to form bilayers. We further showed addition of the α1,3- and α1,6-mannose can occur independently in either order but at differing rates. The conserved C-terminal EX7E motif, N-terminal cytosolic tail, and 3 G-rich loop motifs in Alg2 play crucial roles for these activities, both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insight into the unique bifunctionality of Alg2 during LLO synthesis and lead to a new model in which alternative, independent routes exist for Alg2 catalysis of the trimannosyl core oligosaccharide.-Li, S.-T., Wang, N., Xu, X.-X., Fujita, M., Nakanishi, H., Kitajima, T., Dean, N., Gao, X.-D.

https://openalex.org/W2778741173,"With globalization the Western honey bee has become a nearly cosmopolitan species, but it was originally restricted to the Old World. This renowned model of biodiversity has diverged into five evolutionary lineages and several geographic “subspecies.” If Apis mellifera unicolor is indubitably an African subspecies endemic to Madagascar, its relationship with honey bees from three archipelagos in the southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) hotspot of biodiversity is misunderstood. We compared recent mtDNA diversity data to an original characterization of the nuclear diversity from honey bees in the Mascarenes and Comoros archipelagos, using 14 microsatellites, but also additional mtDNA tRNALeu-cox2 analysis. Our sampling offers the most comprehensive dataset for the SWIO populations with a total of 3,270 colonies from 10 islands compared with 855 samples from Madagascar, 113 from Africa, and 138 from Europe. Comprehensive mitochondrial screening confirmed that honey bees from La Réunion, Mauritius, and Comoros archipelagos are mainly of African origin (88.1% out of 2,746 colonies) and that coexistence with European lineages occurs only in the Mascarenes. PCA, Bayesian, and genetic differentiation analysis showed that African colonies are not significantly distinct on each island, but have diversified among islands and archipelagos. FST levels progressively decreased in significance from European and African continental populations, to SWIO insular and continental populations, and finally among islands from the same archipelago. Among African populations, Madagascar shared a nuclear background with and was most closely related to SWIO island populations (except Rodrigues). Only Mauritius Island presented clear cytoplasmic disequilibrium and genetic structure characteristic of an admixed population undergoing hybridization, in this case, between A. m. unicolor and A. m. ligustica, A. m. carnica and A. m. mellifera-like individuals. Finally, global genetic clustering analysis helped to better depict the colonization and introduction pattern of honey bee populations in these archipelagos."
https://openalex.org/W2779696578,"Introduction Hospitals have seen a rise in Medical Emergency Team (MET) reviews. We hypothesised that the commonest MET calls result in similar treatments. Our aim was to design a pre-emptive management algorithm that allowed direct institution of treatment to patients without having to wait for attendance of the MET team and to model its potential impact on MET call incidence and patient outcomes. Methods Data was extracted for all MET calls from the hospital database. Association rule data mining techniques were used to identify the most common combinations of MET call causes, outcomes and therapies. Results There were 13,656 MET calls during the 34-month study period in 7936 patients. The most common MET call was for hypotension [31%, (2459/7936)]. These MET calls were strongly associated with the immediate administration of intra-venous fluid (70% [1714/2459] v 13% [739/5477] p<0.001), unless the patient was located on a respiratory ward (adjusted OR 0.41 [95%CI 0.25–0.67] p<0.001), had a cardiac cause for admission (adjusted OR 0.61 [95%CI 0.50–0.75] p<0.001) or was under the care of the heart failure team (adjusted OR 0.29 [95%CI 0.19–0.42] p<0.001). Modelling the effect of a pre-emptive management algorithm for immediate fluid administration without MET activation on data from a test period of 24 months following the study period, suggested it would lead to a 68.7% (2541/3697) reduction in MET calls for hypotension and a 19.6% (2541/12938) reduction in total METs without adverse effects on patients. Conclusion Routinely collected data and analytic techniques can be used to develop a pre-emptive management algorithm to administer intravenous fluid therapy to a specific group of hypotensive patients without the need to initiate a MET call. This could both lead to earlier treatment for the patient and less total MET calls."
https://openalex.org/W2779763963,"Eois is one of the best-investigated genera of tropical moths. Its close association with Piper plants has inspired numerous studies on life histories, phylogeny and evolutionary biology. This study provides an updated view on phylogeny, host plant use and temporal patterns of speciation in Eois. Using sequence data (2776 bp) from one mitochondrial (COI) and one nuclear gene (Ef1-alpha) for 221 Eois species, we confirm and reinforce previous findings regarding temporal patterns of diversification. Deep diversification within Andean Eois took place in the Miocene followed by a sustained high rate of diversification until the Pleistocene when a pronounced slowdown of speciation is evident. In South America, Eois diversification is very likely to be primarily driven by the Andean uplift which occurred concurrently with the entire evolutionary history of Eois. A massively expanded dataset enabled an in-depth look into the phylogenetic signal contained in host plant usage. This revealed several independent shifts from Piper to other host plant genera and families. Seven shifts to Peperomia, the sister genus of Piper were detected, indicating that the shift to Peperomia was an easy one compared to the singular shifts to the Chloranthaceae, Siparunaceae and the Piperacean genus Manekia. The potential for close co-evolution of Eois with Piper host plants is therefore bound to be limited to smaller subsets within Neotropical Eois instead of a frequently proposed genus-wide co-evolutionary scenario. In regards to Eois systematics we confirm the monophyly of Neotropical Eois in relation to their Old World counterparts. A tentative biogeographical hypothesis is presented suggesting that Eois originated in tropical Asia and subsequently colonized the Neotropics and Africa. Within Neotropical Eois we were able to identify the existence of six clades not recognized in previous studies and confirm and reinforce the monophyly of all 9 previously delimited infrageneric clades."

Yet, despite its increasingly recognized importance, how urbanization impacts on the health of individual animals, wildlife populations and on disease ecology remains poorly understood. To test whether, and how, urbanization-driven ecosystem alterations influence pathogen dynamics and avian health, we use house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and Yersinia spp. (pathogenic for passerines) as a case study. Sparrows are granivorous urban exploiters, whose western European populations have declined over the past decades, especially in highly urbanized areas. We sampled 329 house sparrows originating from 36 populations along an urbanization gradient across Flanders (Belgium), and used isolation combined with ‘matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization- time of flight mass spectrometry’ (MALDI-TOF MS) and PCR methods for detecting the presence of different Yersinia species. Yersinia spp. were recovered from 57.43% of the sampled house sparrows, of which 4.06%, 53.30% and 69.54% were identified as Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica and other Yersinia species, respectively. Presence of Yersinia was related to the degree of urbanization, average daily temperatures and the community of granivorous birds present at sparrow capture locations. Body condition of suburban house sparrows was found to be higher compared to urban and rural house sparrows, but no relationships between sparrows’ body condition and presence of Yersinia spp. were found. We conclude that two determinants of pathogen infection dynamics, body condition and pathogen occurrence, vary along an urbanization gradient, potentially mediating the impact of urbanization on avian health."

The aim of this study was to investigate if there are long-term (10 year) bilingual advantages in executive processing, as indexed by dual-task performance, in a sample that were 40-65 years at baseline. The bilingual (n = 24) and monolingual (n = 24) participants were matched on age, sex, education, fluid intelligence, and study sample. Participants performed free-recall for a 12-item list in three dual-task settings wherein they sorted cards either during encoding, retrieval, or during both encoding and retrieval of the word-list. Free recall without card sorting was used as a reference to compute dual-task costs. The results showed that bilinguals significantly outperformed monolinguals when they performed card-sorting during both encoding and retrieval of the word-list, the condition that presumably placed the highest demands on executive functioning. However, dual-task costs increased over time for bilinguals relative to monolinguals, a finding that is possibly influenced by retirement age and limited use of second language in the bilingual group."
https://openalex.org/W2776556691,"There is preliminary evidence that there are several types of submovements in movement aiming that reflect different processes of control and can result from particular task constraints. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of movement space and time task criteria on the prevalence of different submovement control characteristics in discrete aiming. Twelve participants completed 3 distance x 5 time conditions each with 100 trials in a target-aiming movement task. The kinematic structure of the trajectory determined the prevalence of 5 submovement types (none; pre-peak, post-peak movement velocity; undershoot, overshoot). The findings showed that the overall number of submovements increased in the slower space-time conditions and was predominantly characterized by post-peak trajectory submovements rather than discrete overshoot submovements. Overshoot submovements were more frequent in the high average movement velocity and short time duration conditions. We concluded that there are qualitatively different distributional patterns of submovement types in discrete aiming tasks that are organized by the quantitative scaling of the average movement velocity arising from multiple control processes to meet the specific space-time task constraints."

However, the emergence of viral resistance against NRTIs is a major threat to their therapeutic effectiveness. In HIV-1, NRTI resistance-associated mutations either reduce RT-mediated incorporation of NRTI triphosphates (discrimination mechanism) or confer an ATP-mediated nucleotide excision activity that removes the inhibitor from the 3′ terminus of DNA primers, enabling further primer elongation (excision mechanism). In HIV-2, resistance to zidovudine (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT)) and other NRTIs is conferred by mutations affecting nucleotide discrimination. Mutations of the excision pathway such as M41L, D67N, K70R, or S215Y (known as thymidine-analogue resistance mutations (TAMs)) are rare in the virus from HIV-2–infected individuals. Here, we demonstrate that mutant M41L/D67N/K70R/S215Y HIV-2 RT lacks ATP-dependent excision activity, and recombinant virus containing this RT remains susceptible to AZT inhibition. Mutant HIV-2 RTs were tested for their ability to unblock and extend DNA primers terminated with AZT and other NRTIs, when complexed with RNA or DNA templates.

Our work highlights critical HIV-2 RT residues impeding the development of excision-mediated NRTI resistance. Although the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is responsible for most of the global AIDS pandemic, it has been estimated that one to two million people are infected with HIV type 2 (HIV-2) worldwide (1Gottlieb G.S.

HIV-2 is endemic in West Africa, but it is also found in regions of Western Europe, India, Brazil, and South Africa. HIV-2 has a longer asymptomatic phase and shows slower progression to AIDS in comparison with HIV-1 (2Campbell-Yesufu O.T. Gandhi R.T. Update on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2 infection.Clin.

HIV RTs are heterodimeric enzymes that convert the single-stranded RNA genome into a double-stranded DNA that can be integrated in the host cell genome (7Sarafianos S.G. Marchand B. Das K.

RTs have two catalytic activities as follows: (i) a DNA polymerase activity that uses RNA or DNA as templates, and (ii) a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that degrades RNA from RNA/DNA hybrids. NRTIs are converted to triphosphate derivatives inside the cell and are incorporated into the DNA by the polymerase activity of the RT. Further DNA synthesis is then blocked due to the absence of a 3′-OH in the ribose moiety of the NRTI (9Menéndez-Arias L. Mechanisms of resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.Virus Res. 2008; 134 (18272247): 124-14610.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although HIV-1 and HIV-2 share some NRTI resistance mutations, clinical studies have shown that NRTI resistance emergence is faster in HIV-2. In HIV-1, NRTI resistance can be achieved through a discrimination mechanism (i.e. changes in RT's ability to incorporate nucleoside analogues versus natural dNTP substrates) or by an excision mechanism by which NRTI-resistant RTs are able to remove the inhibitor from the 3′-end of the primer, thereby allowing the extension of the unblocked DNA chain (6Menéndez-Arias L.

In patients receiving long-term therapy, TAMs appear in two clusters: TAM1 (M41L, L210W, and T215Y) and TAM2 (D67N, K70R, K219E/K219Q, and sometimes T215F) (16Yahi N. Tamalet C. Tourrès C. Tivoli N.

Amino acid changes in the HIV-1 RT that antagonize the effects of TAMs in excision while increasing NRTI susceptibility have been found at the dNTP-binding site (e.g. K65R, L74V, V75I, and M184V), the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor-binding site (e.g. L100I or Y181C), or have been related to foscarnet resistance (e.g. W88G, E89K, L92I, and S156A) (6Menéndez-Arias L.

K65R, Q151M (sometimes accompanied by V111I), and M184V are the major mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs in HIV-2 (18Damond F. Collin G. Matheron S. Peytavin G. Campa P. Delarue S. Taieb A.

Amino acid substitutions in this complex affect residues of the dNTP-binding site in the DNA polymerase domain of the RT, and biochemical studies carried out with the HIV-1 enzyme showed that those changes interfered with the incorporation of nucleotide analogues (9Menéndez-Arias L.

In contrast, TAMs are difficult to select in cell culture after HIV-2 passage in the presence of AZT (21Reid P. MacInnes H. Cong M.E. Heneine W. García-Lerma J.G.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs have similar levels of DNA polymerase activity, but the HIV-2 enzyme incorporates AZT-triphosphate (AZTTP) less efficiently than HIV-1 RT and shows a much lower ability to excise the inhibitor in the presence of ATP (25Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Clark P.K. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Why do HIV-1 and HIV-2 use different pathways to develop AZT resistance?.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2 (16485036): e1010.1371/journal.ppat.0020010Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, substituting Tyr for Ser215 in the HIV-2 RT did not increase its ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity but had a detrimental effect on polymerase activity (26Boyer P.L. Clark P.K. Hughes S.H. HIV-1 and HIV-2 reverse transcriptases: different mechanisms of resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.J.

In those studies, the authors speculated on the possibility that selection of TAMs would be detrimental for HIV-2 RT function, and this would justify why the excision mechanism has a negligible influence in HIV-2 resistance to NRTIs. Furthermore, the presence of Ile75 in HIV-2 RT instead of Val as in HIV-1 RT could be responsible in part for the lack of the excision-based resistance mechanism, as suggested by the antagonistic effect of V75I when combined with TAMs in the context of an excision-proficient HIV-1 RT (27Matamoros T. Nevot M. Martínez M.A. Menéndez-Arias L.

The presence of Ile75 is expected to facilitate the selection of Q151M, because this substitution together with A62V, V75I, F77L, and F116Y forms the “Q151M complex” that in HIV-1 confers resistance to all approved NRTIs except tenofovir (28Shirasaka T.

In this work, we show that HIV-2ROD RT with the four classical TAMs (M41L/D67N/K70R/S215Y) has negligible ATP-dependent excision activity. Despite the high level of amino acid sequence similarity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, there are important differences in their primary structures that affect residues in the β3–β4 hairpin loop (i.e. at positions 63–73), and around Tyr215, in addition to residues elsewhere that in HIV-1 have an antagonistic effect on TAMs. The systematic replacement of HIV-2 RT residues by those found in the HIV-1 RT and the subsequent analysis of the ATP-dependent excision activity of the resulting RTs, using different NRTIs and template–primers, shows that Met73 in HIV-2 RT (instead of Lys as found in HIV-1 RT) acts as a molecular barrier that curbs the possibility of developing HIV-2 resistance through the accumulation of TAMs. HIV-1BH10 and HIV-2ROD RTs share 61% amino acid sequence identity. The crystal structures of AZT-resistant HIV-1 RT containing TAMs M41L, D67N, K70R, T215Y, and K219Q in its unliganded form, in complex with AZT-terminated DNA/DNA template–primers, and with double-stranded DNA and AZT adenosine dinucleoside tetraphosphate (AZTppppA) have been reported (30Tu X.

Based on the available crystal structures and previous work with mutant RTs having insertions and deletions in the β3–β4 hairpin loop (31Cases-González C.E. Franco S. Martínez M.A. Menéndez-Arias L.

The amino acid sequences of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs show differences at those regions (Fig. 1a). In addition, HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs differ at specific positions that were previously shown to modulate the excision reaction in the presence of TAMs. Thus, previous studies demonstrated that by themselves V75I, W88G, and Y181C decrease the ATP-dependent excision activity of HIV-1 RTs carrying TAMs (6Menéndez-Arias L. Molecular basis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance: overview and recent developments.Antiviral Res. 2013; 98 (23403210): 93-12010.1016/j.antiviral.2013.01.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The wildtype (WT) HIV-2ROD RT contains Ile75, Thr88, and Ile181 instead of Val, Trp, and Tyr, as found in the HIV-1 RT. These differences could be also responsible for the suppression of the excision activity in HIV-2 RTs. Based on those observations, we obtained HIV-2ROD RT variants whose amino acid sequences are given in Fig. 1b. They included enzymes where the sequence of the β3–β4 hairpin loop of the HIV-1BH10 RT was introduced in the HIV-2ROD RT together with TAMs M41L and T215Y (e.g. 5M_STK), others that contained different substitutions in the 210–215 sequence (e.g. 5M_LRWL), or combinations of mutations, including potential antagonists of TAMs such as I75V, T88W, or I181Y. The enzymes were purified and tested for their ability to remove thymidine analogues and tenofovir, in rescue assays carried out with RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA template–primers. The ability of HIV-2ROD RTs to rescue AZTMP-terminated primers in the presence of ATP (3.2 mm) was first assessed with the RNA/DNA template–primer 31Trna/21P (Fig. 2). Reactions were carried out in two steps. The RT and the RNA/DNA hybrid were incubated in the presence of inhibitor (AZTTP) to generate a blocked 22-nucleotide primer. Then, the addition of dNTPs and ATP (the pyrophosphate donor) facilitated unblocking and further extension of the primer to obtain a product of 31 nucleotides. In these assays, the HIV-1BH10 RT that contained TAMs M41L and T215Y (LY_HIV-1) showed relatively high levels of excision activity. In contrast, the WT HIV-2ROD RT and the quadruple mutant M41L/D67N/K70R/S215Y (4M RT) showed almost negligible activity in the presence of 3.2 mm ATP. Although Asp67 and Lys70 are conserved in HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, there are differences at four residues of the β3–β4 hairpin loop region of both polymerases. By introducing the amino acids found at positions 68, 69, 73, and 75 in HIV-1BH10 RT in the sequence context of the 4M HIV-2 RT, we obtained enzymes with high ATP-dependent excision activity (Fig. 2). The substitution of Lys for Met73 in the HIV-2ROD RT had the largest impact on rescue activity among all tested polymerases. Thus, mutants 5M_STK and 5M_SK showed efficiencies that were almost 2-fold higher than those obtained with the reference HIV-1BH10 RT mutant M41L/T215Y, and well above the efficiencies of the WT HIV-2ROD RT. Other RTs showed lower ATP-dependent excision activities. However, substituting Val75 for Ile in the 4M RT produced a modest but significant increase in rescue efficiencies. The subsequent addition of K68S and/or N69T, several combinations of mutations in the vicinity of Tyr215, or substitutions with a potential antagonistic effect on TAMs (i.e. T88W and I181Y) had a minor effect on DNA primer rescue catalyzed by the 5M RT mutant enzyme. Similar assays carried out with a DNA–DNA complex containing an AZTMP-terminated primer also revealed that the substitution of Lys for Met73 in the HIV-2ROD RT had a large impact in the rescue activity of the polymerase (Fig. S1). Mutant derivatives containing M73K (i.e. 5M_SK and 5M_STK) rescued between 30 and 35% of the AZTMP-terminated primers after incubating the template–primer and the RT for 20 min in the presence of ATP and dNTPs. In contrast, 5M, 5M_K68S, and 5M_ST RTs had lower excision activity (<14%) under the same conditions. Nevertheless, these three enzymes showed a modest increase in rescue activity in comparison with the 4M RT. This could be attributed to the substitution of Val for Ile75 that could facilitate excision by neutralizing the small but significant antagonistic effect of Ile75. As in the case of experiments carried out with the RNA/DNA hybrid, T88W and I181Y had a minor effect on DNA primer rescue when combined with I75V and other TAMs, although we observed a slight increase with the substitution I181Y. In contrast, none of the mutations located in the vicinity of Tyr215 seemed to affect the rescue activity of the 5M mutant, because all tested HIV-2 RT variants showed rescue activities below 14%, after a 20-min incubation in the presence of ATP and dNTPs. In general, removal of AZTMP and further extension of the unblocked primer were more efficient with the RNA template than with the DNA template for all tested RTs. Analysis of the efficiencies of the rescue reactions with different RTs and the 31Trna–21P complex confirms the suppressor effect of Ile75, because mutant 5M shows higher rescue activity than 4M, although the addition of K68S and N69T produced a slight but non-significant increase in rescue efficiency. In any case, the effects of those substitutions were relatively small in comparison with the addition of M73K. The ATP-dependent rescue activity was also tested with all mutants using tenofovir-terminated primers and the DNA/DNA hybrid D38T/25PGA (Fig. S2). The observed ranking of rescue efficiencies was similar to those obtained with AZT-terminated primers, supporting the notion that the inhibitor had a minor impact on the relative excision activity of the RTs. The amounts of rescued primer obtained with the WT HIV-2 RT and its mutant derivative 4M were very small. Again, the presence of the additional substitution I75V produced a significant increase in tenofovir excision and further extension of the unblocked primer. This effect was reduced if other β3–β4 hairpin substitutions such as K68S or N69T were added to the mutational complex. However, in those cases, addition of M73K rendered excision-proficient RTs with rescue efficiencies higher than those observed for the well-characterized HIV-1BH10 RT mutant M41L/T215Y (LY_HIV-1). Assays described above have consistently shown that M73K and to a lesser extent I75V facilitate the rescue of NRTI-terminated primers by TAM-containing HIV-2 RTs. However, those assays combine excision with DNA primer extension. In Fig. 3, we show that I75V confers some ATP-dependent excision activity on primers terminated with AZT when added to the 4M complex, whereas the subsequent addition of M73K (in combination with K68S) results in a further enhancement of the excision activity. Interestingly, the effects of I"

It catalyzes the oxidation of (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA to α,β-unsaturated mesaconyl-CoA and shows only about 0.5% activity with succinyl-CoA. Here we report the crystal structure of MCD at a resolution of 1.37 Å. The enzyme forms a homodimer of two 60-kDa subunits. Compared with other ACDs, MCD contains an ∼170-residue-long N-terminal extension that structurally mimics a dimer–dimer interface of these enzymes that are canonically organized as tetramers. MCD catalyzes the unprecedented oxidation of an α-methyl branched dicarboxylic acid CoA thioester. Substrate specificity is achieved by a cluster of three arginines that accommodates the terminal carboxyl group and a dedicated cavity that facilitates binding of the C2 methyl branch. MCD apparently evolved toward preventing the nonspecific oxidation of succinyl-CoA, which is a close structural homolog of (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA and an essential intermediate in central carbon metabolism. For different metabolic engineering and biotechnological applications, however, an enzyme that can oxidize succinyl-CoA to fumaryl-CoA is sought after. Based on the MCD structure, we were able to shift substrate specificity of MCD toward succinyl-CoA through active-site mutagenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2775967924,"The opercle is a prominent craniofacial bone supporting the gill cover in all bony fish and has been the subject of morphological, developmental, and genetic investigation. We surveyed the shapes of this bone among 110 families spanning the teleost tree and examined its pattern of occupancy in a principal component-based morphospace. Contrasting with expectations from the literature that suggest the local morphospace would be only sparsely occupied, we find primarily dense, broad filling of the morphological landscape, indicating rich diversity. Phylomorphospace plots suggest that dynamic evolution underlies the observed spatial patterning. Evolutionary transits through the morphospaces are sometimes long, and occur in a variety of directions. The trajectories seem to represent both evolutionary divergences and convergences, the latter supported by convevol analysis. We suggest that that this pattern of occupancy reflects the various adaptations of different groups of fishes, seemingly paralleling their diverse marine and freshwater ecologies and life histories. Opercle shape evolution within the acanthomorphs, spiny ray-finned fishes, appears to have been especially dynamic."

Out of them, Kazakhstan alone has preserved about 20 billion tons. In the field of technogenic waste treatment, there is still no technical solution that leads it to be a profitable process. Recent global trends prompted scientists to focus on developing energy-saving and a highly efficient melting unit that can significantly reduce specific fuel consumption. This paper reports, the development of a new technological method—smelt layer of inversion phase. The introducing method is characterized by a combination of ideal stirring and ideal displacement regimes. Using the method of affine modelling, recalculation of pilot plant’s test results on industrial sample has been obtained. Experiments show that in comparison with bubbling and boiling layers of smelt, the degree of zinc recovery increases in the layer of inversion phase. That indicates the reduction of the possibility of new formation of zinc silicates and ferrites from recombined molecules of ZnO, SiO2, and Fe2O3. Calculations show that in industrial samples of the pilot plant, the consumption of natural gas has reduced approximately by two times in comparison with fuming-furnace. The specific fuel consumption has reduced by approximately four times in comparison with Waelz-kiln."
https://openalex.org/W2775987532,"During the Nubia Salvage Campaign and the subsequent expeditions from the 1960's to the 1980's, numerous sites attributed to the Late Palaeolithic (~25-15 ka) were found in the Nile Valley, particularly in Nubia and Upper Egypt. This region is one of the few to have allowed human occupations during the dry Marine Isotope Stage 2 and is therefore key to understanding how human populations adapted to environmental changes at this time. This paper focuses on two sites located in Upper Egypt, excavated by the Combined Prehistoric Expedition: E71K18, attributed to the Afian industry and E71K20, attributed to the Silsilian industry. It aims to review the geomorphological and chronological evidence of the sites, present a technological analysis of the lithic assemblages in order to provide data that can be used in detailed comparative studies, which will allow discussion of technological variability in the Late Palaeolithic of the Nile Valley and its place within the regional context. The lithic analysis relies on the chaîne opératoire concept combined with an attribute analysis to allow quantification. This study (1) casts doubts on the chronology of E71K18 and related Afian industry, which could be older or younger than previously suggested, highlights (2) distinct technological characteristics for the Afian and the Silsilian, as well as (3) similar technological characteristics which allow to group them under a same broad techno-cultural complex, distinct from those north or south of the area."
https://openalex.org/W2777689431,"Understanding the processes across childhood and adolescence that affect later life inequalities depends on many variables for a large number of individuals measured over substantial time periods. Linkable administrative data were used to generate birth cohorts and to study pathways of inequity in childhood and early adolescence leading to differences in educational attainment. Advantages and disadvantages of using large administrative data bases for such research were highlighted.Children born in Manitoba, Canada between 1982 and 1995 were followed until age 19 (N = 89,763), with many time-invariant measures serving as controls. Five time-varying predictors of high school graduation-three social and two health-were modelled using logistic regression and a framework for examining predictors across the life course. For each time-varying predictor, six temporal patterns were tested: full, accumulation of risk, sensitive period, and three critical period models.Predictors measured in early adolescence generated the highest odds ratios, suggesting the importance of adolescence. Full models provided the best fit for the three time-varying social measures. Residence in a low-income neighborhood was a particularly influential predictor of not graduating from high school. The transmission of risk across developmental periods was also highlighted; exposure in one period had significant implications for subsequent life stages.This study advances life course epidemiology, using administrative data to clarify the relationships among several measures of social behavior, cognitive development, and health. Analyses of temporal patterns can be useful in studying such other outcomes as educational achievement, teen pregnancy, and workforce participation."
https://openalex.org/W2778273053,"Explosives are a common soil contaminant at a range of sites, including explosives manufacturing plants and areas associated with landmine detonations. As many explosives are toxic and may cause adverse environmental effects, a large body of research has targeted the remediation of explosives residues in soil. Studies in this area have largely involved spiking ‘pristine’ soils using explosives solutions. Here we investigate the fate of explosives present in soils following an actual detonation process and compare this to the fate of explosives spiked into ‘pristine’ undetonated soils. We also assess the effects of the detonations on the physical properties of the soils. Our scanning electron microscopy analyses reveal that detonations result in newly-fractured planes within the soil aggregates, and novel micro Computed Tomography analyses of the soils reveal, for the first time, the effect of the detonations on the internal architecture of the soils. We demonstrate that detonations cause an increase in soil porosity, and this correlates to an increased rate of TNT transformation and loss within the detonated soils, compared to spiked pristine soils. We propose that this increased TNT transformation is due to an increased bioavailability of the TNT within the now more porous post-detonation soils, making the TNT more easily accessible by soil-borne bacteria for potential biodegradation. This new discovery potentially exposes novel remediation methods for explosive contaminated soils where actual detonation of the soil significantly promotes subsequent TNT degradation. This work also suggests previously unexplored ramifications associated with high energy soil disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2779125646,"In rodent models of experimentally induced fever, the important role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a circulating endogenous pyrogen is well established. Studies employing larger animal species and real infections are scarce. Therefore, we assessed bioactive IL-6 in peripheral blood and in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of calves after intra-bronchial inoculation with vital Chlamydia psittaci (Cp), with inactivated Cp, or with BGM cells. Only calves inoculated with vital Cp developed fever (peak at 2-3 days after challenge) and significantly increased IL-6 activity. Controls inoculated with either inactivated Cp or BGM cells also expressed increased bioactive IL-6, but no fever developed. Activity of IL-6 in BALF was significantly higher compared to blood serum. This experimental model of Cp infection revealed no apparent relation between IL-6 in blood and body temperature, but did reveal a relation between IL-6 and other markers of inflammation in BALF. We conclude that a local inflammatory response in the lungs of infected calves caused fever, which developed by mechanisms including other mediators besides IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W2776281759,"Wild ruminants, including deer species (cervids) have incorrectly been regarded as refractory to yew (Taxus) intoxication. This assumption has been based upon anecdotal observations of individual deer browsing on yew over time without apparent adverse effect. A single case of yew intoxication was reported in a free-ranging Norwegian moose (Alces alces) in 2008. The current report describes five additional cases of yew toxicosis in moose, seven in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and two in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), all in Norway. The animals were found dead during the winter, close to or within gardens containing yew plants showing signs of browsing. Gross findings included lung congestion and edema, thoracic and pericardial effusion, bilateral heart dilatation, epi- and endocardial hemorrhage, and enlarged (congested) spleen. Yew plant remnants were detected in the rumen of all animals with the exception of a single moose. Histology revealed multifocal acute myocardial degeneration and necrosis with hemorrhage in roe deer, but not in the two other species. A qualitative high performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry analysis was used to tentatively identify five major Taxus alkaloids (taxines) in crude yew extracts and in heart and liver samples from the moose cases. All five major taxines were detected with good signal/noise ratio in tissue samples from the four moose with visible ruminal yew content, whereas lower levels of taxines were detected in the moose without visible ruminal yew content. Possible differences in interspecies tolerance to taxines and role of individual protective adaptation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2778399728,"During the past 100 years in densely populated south-eastern Brazil, wetlands have been severely transformed due to urbanization, agriculture and mining. The recently discovered São Paulo Marsh Antwren (Formicivora paludicola) is endemic to these wetlands, and is listed as ""Critically Endangered"" by the IUCN. The species is only found in an area of 1.42 km2, it has a sparse and fragmented distribution, low dispersal capacity, and has probably lost around 300 km2 of habitat in the past 100 years. Furthermore, very little is known about F. paludicola natural history, and so it is difficult to construct a robust conservation plan. Using Kernel home range estimations and the Adjusted-SD/Torus Shift test (a novel tool for animal-habitat association studies), we showed that the species avoids patches of the alien invasive ginger lily (Hedychium coronarium). Given the high density of their population (3.6 mature individuals/ha), F. paludicola could thrive in relatively small areas of suitable wetlands protected from human occupation and water contamination, however special attention should be paid to biological invasions, which may represent a serious threat to the remaining populations. Protecting a few small wetlands used by F. paludicola would be an important step towards general conservation and restoration of Atlantic Forest wetlands and its endemic endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2780940149,"There is increasing evidence for a role of MaxiK potassium channel-activity in regulating the metabolism and intracellular signaling of non-contractile bladder mucosal tissues. At present however no studies have determined the impact of urothelial MaxiK-activity on overall bladder metabolism. To address this we have investigated the effect of bladder lumen instillation of the MaxiK inhibitor, iberiotoxin (IBTX), on mucosal and detrusor metabolism using metabolomics. Since IBTX does not cross plasma membranes, when instilled into the bladder lumen it would only effect urothelially expressed MaxiK-activity. Surprisingly IBTX treatment caused more effect on the metabolome of the detrusor than mucosa (the levels of 17% of detected detrusor metabolites were changed in comparison to 6% of metabolites in mucosal tissue following IBTX treatment). In mucosal tissues, the major effects can be linked to mitochondrial-associated metabolism whereas in detrusor there were additional changes in energy generating pathways (such as glycolysis and the TCA cycle). In the detrusor, changes in metabolism are potentially a result of IBTX effecting MaxiK-linked signaling pathways between the mucosa and detrusor, secondary to changes in physiological activity or a combination of both. Overall we demonstrate that urothelial MaxiK-activity plays a significant role in determining mitochondrially-associated metabolism in mucosal tissues, which effects the metabolism of detrusor tissue. Our work adds further evidence that the urothelium plays a major role in determining overall bladder physiology. Since decreased MaxiK-activity is associated with several bladder pathophysiology’s, the changes in mucosal metabolism reported here may represent novel downstream targets for therapeutic interventions."
