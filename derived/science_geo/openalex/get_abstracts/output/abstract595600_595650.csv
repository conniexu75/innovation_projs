https://openalex.org/W2726053863,"The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) has been widely repurposed for genome editing. High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced specificity (eSpCas9(1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target cleavage in human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the potential to further improve fidelity are unknown. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state when bound to mismatched targets. We find that a non-catalytic domain within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target complementarity and governs the HNH nuclease to regulate overall catalytic competence. Exploiting this observation, we design a new hyper-accurate Cas9 variant (HypaCas9) that demonstrates high genome-wide specificity without compromising on-target activity in human cells. These results offer a more comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing."

In an effort to promote safety and transparency to consumers, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has mandated that reports of accidents involving autonomous vehicles be drafted and made available to the public. The present work shows an in-depth analysis of the accident reports filed by different manufacturers that are testing autonomous vehicles in California (testing data from September 2014 to March 2017). The data provides important information on autonomous vehicles accidents' dynamics, related to the most frequent types of collisions and impacts, accident frequencies, and other contributing factors. The study also explores important implications related to future testing and validation of semi-autonomous vehicles, tracing the investigation back to current literature as well as to the current regulatory panorama."
https://openalex.org/W2755760896,"Zinc, an essential micronutrient, has a cancer preventive role. Zinc deficiency has been shown to contribute to the progression of esophageal cancer. Orai1, a store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channel, was previously reported to be highly expressed in tumor tissues removed from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with poor prognosis, and elevation of its expression contributes to both hyperactive intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and fast cell proliferation in human ESCC cells. However, the molecular basis of cancer preventive functions of zinc and its association with Orai1-mediated cell proliferation remains unknown. The present study shows that zinc supplementation significantly inhibits proliferation of ESCC cell lines and that the effect of zinc is reversible with N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine, a specific Zn2+ chelator, whereas nontumorigenic esophageal epithelial cells are significantly less sensitive to zinc treatment. Fluorescence live cell imaging revealed that extracellular Zn2+ exerted rapid inhibitory effects on Orai1-mediated SOCE and on intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in the ESCC cells. Knockdown of Orai1 or expression of Orai1 mutants with compromised zinc binding significantly diminished sensitivity of the cancer cells to zinc treatment in both SOCE and cell proliferation analyses. These data suggest that zinc may inhibit cell proliferation of esophageal cancer cells through Orai1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and reveal a possible molecular basis for zinc-induced cancer prevention and Orai1-SOCE signaling pathway in cancer cells.-Choi, S., Cui, C., Luo, Y., Kim, S.-H., Ko, J.-K., Huo, X., Ma, J., Fu, L.-W., Souza, R.

https://openalex.org/W2755007939,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most epidemic neurodegenerative diseases and is characterized by movement disorders arising from loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Recently, the relationship between PD and autophagy has received considerable attention, but information about the mechanisms involved is lacking. Here, we report that autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) is potentially important in protecting dopaminergic neurons in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model in zebrafish. Using analyses of zebrafish swimming behavior, in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and expressions of genes and proteins related to PD and autophagy, we found that the ATG5 expression level was decreased and autophagy flux was blocked in this model. The ATG5 down-regulation led to the upgrade of PD-associated proteins, such as β-synuclein, Parkin, and PINK1, aggravation of MPTP-induced PD-mimicking pathological locomotor behavior, DA neuron loss labeled by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT), and blocked autophagy flux in the zebrafish model. ATG5 overexpression alleviated or reversed these PD pathological features, rescued DA neuron cells as indicated by elevated TH/DAT levels, and restored autophagy flux. The role of ATG5 in protecting DA neurons was confirmed by expression of the human atg5 gene in the zebrafish model. Our findings reveal that ATG5 has a role in neuroprotection, and up-regulation of ATG5 may serve as a goal in the development of drugs for PD prevention and management."

Structural and biometric ocular characteristic were compared.MFS eyes were longer (axial length 24.25 ± 1.74 mm versus 23.89 ± 1.31 mm, p < 0.001) and had a flatter cornea than control eyes (mean keratometry 41.78 ± 1.80 diopters (D) versus 43.05 ± 1.51 D, p < 0.001). Corneal astigmatism was greater and the central cornea was thinner in MFS eyes (530.14 ± 41.31 μm versus 547.02 ± 39.18 μm, p < 0.001). MFS eyes were more myopic than control eyes (spherical equivalent -2.16 ± 3.75 D versus -1.17 ± 2.58 D, p < 0.001). Visual acuity was reduced (0.13 ± 0.25 logMAR versus 0.05 ± 0.18 logMAR, p < 0.001) and intraocular pressure was lower in MFS eyes (14.6 ± 3.4 mmHg versus 15.1 ± 3.2 mmHg, p = 0.01). Iris transillumination defects (ITD) were significantly more common in MFS eyes (odds ratio for MFS in the presence of ITD, 3.7). Ectopia lentis (EL) was only present in MFS eyes (33.4%). History of retinal detachment was significantly more common in MFS eyes. Glaucoma was equally common in both groups.ITD and EL are most characteristic findings in MFS. ITD and corneal curvature should be studied as diagnostic criteria for MFS. Visual acuity is reduced in MFS. MFS patients need regular eye exams to identify serious ocular complications."
https://openalex.org/W2755836317,"Regulation of our water homeostasis is fine-tuned by dynamic translocation of Aquaporin-2 (AQP2)-bearing vesicles to and from the plasma membrane of renal principal cells. Whereas binding of vasopressin to its type-2 receptor initiates a cAMP-protein kinase A cascade and AQP2 translocation to the apical membrane, this is counteracted by protein kinase C-activating hormones, resulting in ubiquitination-dependent internalization of AQP2. The proteins targeting AQP2 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation are unknown. In collecting duct mpkCCD cells, siRNA knockdown of NEDD4 and NEDD4L E3 ligases yielded increased AQP2 abundance, but they did not bind AQP2. Membrane Yeast Two-Hybrid assays using full-length AQP2 as bait, identified NEDD4 family interacting protein 2 (NDFIP2) to bind AQP2. NDFIP2 and its homologue NDFIP1 have PY motifs by which they bind NEDD4 family members and bring them close to target proteins. In HEK293 cells, NDFIP1 and NDFIP2 bound AQP2 and were essential for NEDD4/NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of AQP2, an effect not observed with PY-lacking NDFIP1/2 proteins. In mpkCCD cells, downregulation of NDFIP1, NEDD4 and NEDD4L, but not NDFIP2, increased AQP2 abundance. In mouse kidney, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 mRNA distribution was similar and high in proximal tubules and collecting ducts, which was also found for NDFIP1 proteins. Our results reveal that NEDD4/NEDD4L mediate ubiquitination and degradation of AQP2, but that NDFIP proteins are needed to connect NEDD4/NEDD4L to AQP2. As NDFIP1/2 bind many NEDD4 family E3 ligases, which are implicated in several cellular processes, NDFIP1/2 may be the missing link for AQP2 ubiquitination and degradation from different subcellular locations."
https://openalex.org/W2756087808,"Clip domain serine protease homologs (SPHs) are positive and negative regulators of Anopheles gambiae immune responses mediated by the complement-like protein TEP1 against Plasmodium malaria parasites and other microbial infections. We have previously reported that the SPH CLIPA2 is a negative regulator of the TEP1-mediated response by showing that CLIPA2 knockdown (kd) enhances mosquito resistance to infections with fungi, bacteria, and Plasmodium parasites. Here, we identify another SPH, CLIPA14, as a novel regulator of mosquito immunity. We found that CLIPA14 is a hemolymph protein that is rapidly cleaved following a systemic infection. CLIPA14 kd mosquitoes elicited a potent melanization response against Plasmodium berghei ookinetes and exhibited significantly increased resistance to Plasmodium infections as well as to systemic and oral bacterial infections. The activity of the enzyme phenoloxidase, which initiates melanin biosynthesis, dramatically increased in the hemolymph of CLIPA14 kd mosquitoes in response to systemic bacterial infections. Ookinete melanization and hemolymph phenoloxidase activity were further increased after cosilencing CLIPA14 and CLIPA2, suggesting that these two SPHs act in concert to control the melanization response.

The infection-induced melanotic response is initiated when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) bind to microbial cell components, triggering the activation of a cascade of serine proteases, constituted mostly of CLIPs, which culminates in the limited proteolytic cleavage of the zymogen prophenoloxidase (PPO) into active phenoloxidase (PO), the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthetic pathways. clip domain serine protease pattern recognition receptor clip domain serine protease homolog knockdown prophenoloxidase phenoloxidase prophenoloxidase-activating protease thioester-containing protein 1 full-length TEP1 processed form of TEP1 double-stranded double kd full-length CLIPA14 C-terminal domain of CLIPA14 ligase-independent cloning l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. The serine protease cascades acting upstream of PPO are complex and finely regulated to control the spatial, temporal, and intensity of PPO activation (for reviews, see Refs. 10Kanost M.R. Jiang H.

The initiator protease in these cascades is a modular serine protease composed of a complex assortment of domains that allow multiple interactions with upstream PRRs and downstream proteases (12Park J.W.

Among these are non-catalytic CLIPs (also called clip domain serine protease homologs (SPHs)), which lack one or more of the three residues (His, Asp, and Ser) that form the protease catalytic triad. Both catalytic CLIPs and SPHs are secreted as precursor proteins and require cleavage at a specific site between the clip and protease domains to become active. The role of SPHs as inferred from studies in other insects seems to be confined to the terminal step of PPO cleavage (for a review, see Ref. 10Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Clip-domain serine proteases as immune factors in insect hemolymph.Curr. Opin. Insect Sci. 2015; 11: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). SPHs act as cofactors for terminal CLIPs in the cascade, called prophenoloxidase-activating proteases (PAPs), for the efficient cleavage and activation of PPO (15Gupta S. Wang Y. Jiang H.

In general, PPOs cleaved by PAPs in the absence of SPH cofactors showed no activity in vitro even when the SPH was added later to the active PO (15Gupta S. Wang Y. Jiang H.

However, in one study, Anopheles gambiae CLIPB9 was shown to cleave Manduca sexta PPO in the absence of SPH, generating catalytically active PO, suggesting that in certain instances SPHs may not be required for PPO activation (20An C.

A systematic functional genetic screen by RNA interference (RNAi) identified several SPHs (CLIPA8, CLIPA2, CLIPA5, and CLIPA7) to be involved in the melanization of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei while invading the mosquito midgut epithelium (21Volz J.

The RNAi phenotypes of CLIPA2, CLIPA5, and CLIPA7 suggested a negative regulatory role for these SPHs in the melanization response to P. berghei (21Volz J. Müller H.M. Zdanowicz A. Kafatos F.C.

Leucine-rich repeat protein complex activates mosquito complement in defense against Plasmodium parasites.Science. 2009; 324: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A more recent study identified the SPH SPCLIP1 as a major positive regulator of TEP1 whereby the localization of TEP1 and SPCLIP1 to Plasmodium ookinetes was shown to be mutually dependent (23Povelones M. Bhagavatula L. Yassine H. Tan L.A. Upton L.M. Osta M.A. Christophides G.K. The CLIP-domain serine protease homolog SPCLIP1 regulates complement recruitment to microbial surfaces in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003623Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we show that a novel SPH termed CLIPA14 acts as a major negative regulator of the mosquito melanization response, acting downstream of TEP1 and SPCLIP1. We have previously shown that CLIPA14 coimmunoprecipitates with CLIPA2 from mosquito hemolymph extracts (29Kamareddine L. Nakhleh J. Osta M.A. Functional interaction between apolipophorins and complement regulate the mosquito immune response to systemic infections.J. Innate Immun. 2016; 8: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RNAi-mediated silencing of CLIPA14 in adult female A. gambiae mosquitoes triggered melanization of most P. berghei ookinetes invading their midgut in a TEP1-dependent manner. These mosquitoes exhibited an unusually high hemolymph PO activity following bacterial systemic infections in addition to strong resistance to systemic and oral bacterial infections. We also show that the melanization of ookinetes and hemolymph PO activity were significantly enhanced when CLIPA14 and CLIPA2 were cosilenced, suggesting that they act in concert to regulate the TEP1-mediated melanization response. Our results reveal a new level of complexity in SPH function in mosquito immunity and provide further evidence for their key role in regulating the mosquito complement-like response. We have previously identified CLIPA14 among the list of proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with CLIPA2 in hemolymph extracts of Beauveria bassiana-infected mosquitoes (29Kamareddine L. Nakhleh J. Osta M.A. Functional interaction between apolipophorins and complement regulate the mosquito immune response to systemic infections.J. Innate Immun. 2016; 8: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To address the function of CLIPA14 in mosquito immunity, we first silenced this gene in adult female A. gambiae mosquitoes by RNAi and scored the effect on the survival of P. berghei oocysts at day 7 after ingestion of an infectious blood meal. Interestingly, CLIPA14 kd triggered a potent melanization response against ookinetes, resulting in the melanotic encapsulation of the majority (86%) of these parasite stages (Fig. 1A); in 26% of dissected mosquitoes, midguts contained only melanized ookinetes with no single live oocyst detected. LacZ kd controls revealed a background level of melanization as expected for the G3 strain. This CLIPA14 RNAi phenotype is stronger than that observed for CLIPA2 (21Volz J. Müller H.M. Zdanowicz A.

Effects of mosquito genes on Plasmodium development.Science. 2004; 303: 2030-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Parasite melanization was abolished when CLIPA14 and TEP1 were cosilenced, and oocyst counts were similar to those in TEP1 single kd mosquitoes, indicating that the enhanced immunity against parasites is TEP1-dependent. This result confirms the central role of TEP1 in initiating the melanization response as reported previously in different mosquito genetic backgrounds (24Blandin S. Shiao S.H. Moita L.F. Janse C.J.

Phylogenetic analysis of A. gambiae CLIPAs revealed that CLIPA5 is the closest paralog to CLIPA14 (1Waterhouse R.M. Kriventseva E.V. Meister S. Xi Z. Alvarez K.S. Bartholomay L.C. Barillas-Mury C.

However, when we aligned the protein sequences of CLIPA5 and CLIPA14 (AGAP011788) available in VectorBase (www.vectorbase.org) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party-hosted site. using the MUSCLE alignment tool, we found that the CLIPA14 sequence is partial and is missing ∼146 amino acids from the C terminus of its protease-like domain (supplemental Fig. S1). We reconstructed the full-length CLIPA14 cDNA using the GENSCAN web server at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html)3 (35Burge C. Karlin S. Prediction of complete gene structures in human genomic DNA.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3055) Google Scholar) to determine coding sequences downstream (3′ flanking) of the CLIPA14 cDNA available in VectorBase. We designed primers based on the newly predicted sequence, amplified full-length CLIPA14 from A. gambiae G3 cDNA, and cloned it into pIEx-10 expression plasmid. The sequence of the cloned amplicon matched the predicted sequence we reconstructed using GENSCAN, indicating that CLIPA14 has a gene structure typical of a clip domain-containing SPH. However, we found that this gene segment of CLIPA14 that was missing from the annotation contained a contiguous sequence of 53 nucleotides that showed 100% complementarity to a region of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) we used previously to silence CLIPA5 (supplemental Fig. S2) in the context of a large genetic screen of A. gambiae CLIPs (21Volz J. Müller H.M. Zdanowicz A. Kafatos F.C. Osta M.A. A genetic module regulates the melanization response of Anopheles to Plasmodium.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1392-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that, at that time, CLIPA14 was absent from the initial list of A. gambiae annotated genes based on which the CLIP gene screen was performed (36Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. et al.Immunity-related genes and gene families in Anopheles gambiae.Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the CLIPA5 RNAi phenotype characterized by increased ookinete melanization (21Volz J. Müller H.M. Zdanowicz A. Kafatos F.C. Osta M.A. A genetic module regulates the melanization response of Anopheles to Plasmodium.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1392-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) could be due to cross-silencing CLIPA14. To address this issue, we resilenced CLIPA5 with a new gene-specific dsRNA complementary to the region situated between the clip domain and the beginning of the protease domain; this region shows significant sequence diversification in CLIPA14 and CLIPA5, which exhibit their highest sequence similarity in their protease domains, especially in the last 241 amino acids (supplemental Fig. S1). Following infection by P. berghei, CLIPA5 kd mosquitoes exhibited a basal level of ookinete melanization similar to that in LacZ kd controls (Fig. 1A), indicating that CLIPA5 does not regulate melanization and that its previous RNAi phenotype is due to cross-silencing CLIPA14. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed that CLIPA5 dsRNA used in our previous genetic screen (21Volz J. Müller H.M. Zdanowicz A. Kafatos F.C. Osta M.A. A genetic module regulates the melanization response of Anopheles to Plasmodium.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1392-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) silenced CLIPA14 with a similar efficiency as dsCLIPA14 did (Fig. 1C). Despite the significant sequence similarity between CLIPA14 and CLIPA5, CLIPA14 antibody does not cross-react with CLIPA5 because CLIPA14 signal in CLIPA14/CLIPA5 double kd (dkd) was similar to that in CLIPA14 single kd mosquitoes (supplemental Fig. S3B). It is worth noting that CLIPA14 kd strongly reduces CLIPA14 hemolymph levels but does not deplete it as reported for other CLIPA kd (22Schnitger A.K. Kafatos F.C.

Osta M.A. A serine protease homolog negatively regulates TEP1 consumption in systemic infections of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.J. Innate Immun. 2014; 6: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, this reduction is sufficient to observe the phenotype. CLIPA2 kd mosquitoes also melanize a significant number of ookinetes in a TEP1-dependent manner (30Yassine H. Kamareddine L. Chamat S. Christophides G.K. Osta M.A. A serine protease homolog negatively regulates TEP1 consumption in systemic infections of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.J. Innate Immun. 2014; 6: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The RNAi phenotypes of CLIPA2 and CLIPA14 suggest that they play non-redundant roles in fine-tuning the melanization response. Hence, we asked whether a higher level of parasite melanization can be achieved if both genes are cosilenced. Interestingly, most CLIPA14/CLIPA2 dkd mosquitoes were completely refractory to P. berghei; the infection prevalence (i.e. percentage of mosquitoes carrying live parasites) was 26% (Fig. 1B) as compared with 72 and 76% for CLIPA14 (Fig. 1A) and CLIPA2 (30Yassine H. Kamareddine L. Chamat S. Christophides G.K. Osta M.A. A serine protease homolog negatively regulates TEP1 consumption in systemic infections of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.J. Innate Immun. 2014; 6: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) single knockdowns, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that CLIPA2 was efficiently silenced by RNAi (Fig. 1D) as reported previously (30Yassine H. Kamareddine L. Chamat S. Christophides G.K. Osta M.A. A serine protease homolog negatively regulates TEP1 consumption in systemic infections of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.J. Innate Immun. 2014; 6: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This enhanced melanotic response is not due to cross-silencing between CLIPA2 and CLIPA14 nor is it due to the compromised secretion of CLIPA14 in CLIPA2 kd (supplemental Fig. S3A). Indeed, real-time PCR analysis revealed that dsCLIPA14 specifically silenced its target gene without affecting CLIPA2 or CLIPA5 expression levels (supplemental Fig. S3C). These resu"

This phenomenon, known as therapeutic misconception, undermines informed consent to clinical research, but to date there have been no effective interventions to reduce it and concerns have been expressed that to do so might impede recruitment. We determined whether a scientific reframing intervention reduces therapeutic misconception without significantly reducing willingness to participate in hypothetical clinical trials. Methods This prospective randomized trial was conducted from 2015 to 2016 to test the efficacy of an informed consent intervention based on scientific reframing compared to a traditional informed consent procedure (control) in reducing therapeutic misconception among patients considering enrollment in hypothetical clinical trials modeled on real-world studies for one of five disease categories. Patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, head/neck cancer, breast cancer, and major depression were recruited from medical clinics and a clinical research volunteer database. The primary outcomes were therapeutic misconception, as measured by a validated, ten-item Therapeutic Misconception Scale (range = 10–50), and willingness to participate in the clinical trial. Results 154 participants completed the study (age range, 23–87 years; 92.3% white, 56.5% female); 74 (48.1%) had been randomized to receive the experimental intervention. Therapeutic misconception was significantly lower (p = 0.004) in the scientific reframing group (26.4, 95% CI [23.7 to 29.1] compared to the control group (30.9, 95% CI [28.4 to 33.5], and remained so after controlling for education (p = 0.017). Willingness to participate in the hypothetical trial was not significantly different (p = 0.603) between intervention (52.1%, 95% CI [40.2% to 62.4%]) and control (56.3%, 95% CI [45.3% to 66.6%] groups. Conclusions An enhanced educational intervention augmenting traditional informed consent led to a meaningful reduction in therapeutic misconception without a statistically significant change in willingness to enroll in hypothetical clinical trials. Additional study of this intervention is required in real-world clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2754366368,"Minimum space allowances for laboratory rats are legislated based on weight and stocking rates, with the understanding that increased housing density encourages crowding stress. However, there is little evidence for these recommendations, especially when considering positive welfare outcomes. This study consisted of two experiments which investigated the effects of housing density (rats per cage), space allocation (surface area per rat) and social rank (dominance hierarchy) on the ability to perform simple behavioural tests. Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n = 64) were allocated to either high-density (n = 8) or low-density (n = 8) cages. The second experiment investigated the effects of surface area. SD rats (n = 40) were housed in dyads in either the large (n = 10) or small (n = 10) cage. In both experiments, animals were tested on a judgment bias paradigm, with their responses to an ambiguous stimulus being ascribed as optimistic or pessimistic. Animals were also tested on open-field, novel-object recognition and social-interaction tests. Recordings were taken from 1700-2100h daily for rat observation and social rank establishment. Dominant animals responded with significantly more optimistic decisions compared to subordinates for both the housing density (p<0.001) and space allocation (p = 0.0015) experiment. Dominant animals responded with increased social affiliative behaviours in the social-interaction test, and spent more time in the centre of the open-field test for both experiments. No significance was detected between housing density or space allocation treatments. These findings suggest that social rank is a significantly greater modifier of affective state than either housing density or space allocation. This finding has not yet been reported and suggests that future drafts of housing guidelines should consider animal social status in addition to floor space requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2754034664,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, autoimmune exocrinopathy that leads to severe dryness of the mouth and eyes. Exocrine function is highly regulated by neuronal mechanisms but little is known about the link between chronic inflammation, innervation and altered exocrine function in the diseased eyes and exocrine glands of SS patients. To gain a better understanding of neuronal regulation in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune exocrinopathy, we profiled a mouse model of spontaneous, autoimmune exocrinopathy that possess key characteristics of peripheral neuropathy experienced by SS patients. Mice deficient in the autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene developed spontaneous, CD4+ T cell-mediated exocrinopathy and aqueous-deficient dry eye that were associated with loss of nerves innervating the cornea and lacrimal gland. Changes in innervation and tear secretion were accompanied by increased proliferation of corneal epithelial basal cells, limbal expansion of KRT19-positive progenitor cells, increased vascularization of the peripheral cornea and reduced nerve function in the lacrimal gland. In addition, we found extensive loss of MIST1+ secretory acinar cells in the Aire -/- lacrimal gland suggesting that acinar cells are a primary target of the disease, Finally, topical application of ophthalmic steroid effectively restored corneal innervation in Aire -/- mice thereby functionally linking nerve loss with local inflammation in the aqueous-deficient dry eye. These data provide important insight regarding the relationship between chronic inflammation and neuropathic changes in autoimmune-mediated dry eye. Peripheral neuropathies characteristic of SS appear to be tightly linked with the underlying immunopathological mechanism and Aire -/- mice provide an excellent tool to explore the interplay between SS-associated immunopathology and peripheral neuropathy."

Skp1 is an adaptor linking the F-box protein (FBP) to the N terminus of cullin-1 (Cul1), and the E2-Ub donor is linked via the RING protein Rbx1 to the other end of Cul1 (1Willems A.R. Schwab M.

Substrates are selected by protein–protein interaction domains of FBPs, which number from dozens to hundreds, depending on the species. Alternatively, FBPs may be substrates themselves. The enzyme complex is subject to regulation at multiple levels. Substrate priming, such as by phosphorylation, can promote binding to its cognate FBP (3Skaar J.R. Pagan J.K. Pagano M.

Interactome studies with various subunits of the SCF complex confirm its existence in Dictyostelium and show, by analysis of mutants that interrupt the hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway, that the Skp1/FBP interaction is promoted by full glycosylation (11Sheikh M.O.

Fbs1 is unlikely to recognize the glycan directly, because Skp1 is not apparently glycosylated in animals. Because Pro-143 lies in the vicinity of the FBP-combining site of Skp1, this finding suggests that the glycan affects Fbs1 binding via an indirect, perhaps conformational, effect on Skp1.

The MD simulations of human Skp1 suggest greater mobility near the distal end of the C-terminal FBP interaction region, relative to the more stable N-terminal Cul1-binding region. Although glycans are typically thought to be relatively disordered and, therefore, to be freely rotating in solution at protein surfaces, there is precedent for glycans interacting with protein surfaces and influencing their conformation (20Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Introduction to Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2011Google Scholar). Given the effects of the Skp1 glycan on both its structure and its interactome and function in cells, we sought to investigate its effect on Skp1 at a more granular level. In this study, NMR was employed to identify the previously unknown linkage of the non-reducing terminal Gal (αGal2), confirm other linkages, and, together with MD simulations, investigate the organization and dynamics of the fully formed pentasaccharide and its relation to and influence on the Skp1 polypeptide. The studies indicate that the Skp1 glycan adopts a stable conformation that affects Skp1 organization in a way that can explain previous SAXS findings, resulting in a structural model that explains how glycosylation promotes binding to FBPs. The insights afforded by this model will open new avenues to evaluate the contribution of glycosylation to cellular proteostasis and its impact on protists, including infectivity of those that cause disease in plants, humans, and other animals. The Skp1 glycoprotein was purified from ∼2.4 × 1012 Dictyostelium cells as described under “Experimental procedures,” yielding ∼2 mg (100 nmol) of the native molecule. Because no method was known for release of the oligosaccharide from its hydroxyproline linkage, peptides were prepared using endo-Lys-C, and the glycopeptide was purified using HPLC (Fig. 1B). It is worth noting that some contaminating peptides remained after preparative purification and that a major loss (∼90%) of the glycopeptide occurred during the final HPLC step, which involved the use of trifluoroacetic acid. Less than 10 nmol was recovered using the preparation isolated directly from Dictyostelium. As outlined in Fig. 2A, this quantity was sufficient for partial analysis. Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of a portion of the intact glycopeptide sample indicated an oligosaccharide having three hexoses, one deoxyhexose, and one N-acetylhexosamine residue (Fig. 1C), attached at a hydroxyproline that was present in the NDFTPEEEEQIRK sequence of Skp1. A small contamination with a peptide having the sequence ENEWCEDK was observed. 1H NMR of the glycopeptide sample revealed four α-anomeric (H1) signals (Fig. 1D). One, later established as the αGlcNAc H1, showed heterogeneity in its frequency, due to either conformational or structural heterogeneity of the peptide component. An H1 signal of a β-linked sugar was not assigned due to overlap of peptide H α signals upfield of the HOD peak, but it was assigned later using recombinant glycopeptide and 2D NMR experiments. With the recent availability of multimilligram quantities of recombinant Skp1 glycoprotein modified with the GlcNAc at Hyp143 (12Sheikh M.O. Schafer C.M. Powell J.T. Rodgers K.K. Mooers B.H. West C.M. Glycosylation of Skp1 affects its conformation and promotes binding to a model F-Box protein.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), purified PgtA (βGalT/αFucT) and the AgtA α-galactosyltransferase were used to sequentially add the remaining four sugar residues (outlined in Fig. 2B, upper arm). The final two Gal residues, αGal1 and αGal2, were derived from UDP-Gal or UDP-[1-13C]Gal. It is important to note that enzymatic transfer of both the βGal residue and αGal2 required the intact Skp1 glycoprotein (i.e. they did not occur using glycopeptide substrates) (21Schafer C.M. Sheikh M.O. Zhang D. West C.M. Novel regulation of Skp1 by the Dictyostelium AgtA α-galactosyltransferase involves the Skp1-binding activity of its WD40 repeat domain.J. Biol.

Following incorporation of two [1-13C]Gal residues, the Skp1 glycoprotein product was digested with Pronase, and to facilitate glycopeptide purification, the Pronase digest was amended with 1% of material from a parallel reaction labeled with [3H]Gal. A neutral pH method was developed for isolation using C18-SepPak and Carbograph cartridges, which gave a 71% yield based on tritium recovery, the predominant glycopeptide product having two [1-13C]Gal residues. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed enrichment of four major Pronase glycopeptides, which corresponded to the sequences TP§EEEEQ, FTP§EEEEQ, DFTP§EEEEQ, and NDFTP§EEEEQ (Fig. 2, compare C and D), where § corresponds to the [1-13C]Gal-labeled pentasaccharide attached to a hydroxyproline residue, as indicated in Fig. 1A. The reason for incomplete Pronase digestion is unknown. Each glycopeptide contained a +2 m/z mass increment due to the presence of two [1-13C]Gal residues, as compared with an additional sample using unlabeled, conventional UDP-Gal (data not shown). A 1D 1H NMR spectrum of the [1-13C]Gal-containing glycopeptide preparation revealed six anomeric signals in the region downfield of the HOD peak where H1 signals of α-linked sugars commonly reside (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S1). Four of these corresponded to two 1-13C–labeled Gal residue H1 signals, each split further due to the one-bond JC,H coupling of nearly 170 Hz, whereas two other H1 signals were typical of unlabeled sugars. For the 13C-labeled Gal residues, the large 1JC,H coupling collapsed (Fig. 3B) when carbon decoupling was carried out during the directly detected free induction decay, enabling these H1 signals to be assigned to the αGal residues. It is also worth noting that due to peptide heterogeneity, the αFuc and αGlcNAc H1 signals showed some frequency heterogeneity (Fig. 3, A and B). Nearly identical 1D NMR results were observed for the authentic glycopeptide mixture isolated from Skp1 (Fig. 1D) and the recombinant glycopeptide mixture, with minor differences being attributed to differences in their attached peptide(s). For the recombinant sample, a fifth anomeric H1 signal (near 4.67 ppm), partially obscured near the HOD peak in 1D spectra, was only revealed in 2D experiments (see below). Two-dimensional 1H–1H gradient-enhanced correlation spectroscopy (gCOSY) experiments (Fig. 4, A and B) were performed, either containing [1-13C]Gal with 13C decoupling in the directly detected dimension (Fig. 4A) or without the 13C labeling using the native glycopeptide (Fig. 4B). The H1 and H2 chemical shift values of the glycopeptide from the enzymatically generated sample closely matched that of the glycopeptide from native Skp1 (supplemental Table S2), suggesting that ex vivo glycosylation was faithful. Assignments of the H1,H2 cross-peaks in the gCOSY experiment were made in conjunction with the purely absorptive, in-phase gradient total correlation spectroscopy (gTOCSY) experiments utilizing zero-quantum dephasing and 13C decoupling in the direct dimension (Fig. 4C). In-phase multiplet structures of each spin system revealed the endocyclic J couplings from H1 to H4 for the βGal and Fuc residues and to H5 for the GlcNAc (supplemental Table S1). Note that both Gal and Fuc residues have a small H4,H5 coupling, so magnetization transfer via Hartmann–Hahn matching that starts at H1 only proceeds during practical mixing times to the H4 for these sugars. Because experiments were carried out without 13C decoupling in the indirect dimension, the αGal spin systems were easily discerned from the αFuc, as there were two sets of signals for each αGal in the indirect dimension (Fig. 4, A and C). One β H1 was observed near 4.67 ppm, attributed to the βGal. Based on these experiments, the stereochemistry of each sugar could be ascertained from the measurements of their endocyclic J couplings (supplemental Table S1). However, 4JH,H couplings were not observed across glycosidic bonds. To assign the linkage positions of the αGal residues, a 1H–13C gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (gHMBC) experiment was performed, using a range of delays for different experiments. The spectrum shown in Fig. 4D was optimized for a 3.5-Hz J coupling between 13C and 1H. A large, unique interresidue 3JC,H from the internal αGal C1 to the Fuc H3 was observed, and an additional interresidue 3JC,H was seen from the terminal αGal (αGal2) C1 across the glycosidic bond to the internal αGal (αGal1) H3, which clearly indicated 1–3 linkages between both sugar pairs. The H3 of the external αGal2 had a chemical shift (0.002 ppm) slightly different from that of the H2 of the internal αGal1, so both the interresidue and intraresidue cross-peaks could be clearly discriminated. As indicated in the legend to Fig. 4D, two additional cross-peaks remained unassigned. They are possibly three-bond intraresidue couplings between C1 and H5 of the αGal residues but could not be unambiguously assigned because, in the gTOCSY experiment, magnetization did not extend beyond the H4 multiplet; thus, the H5 frequencies for these spin systems could not be independently assigned in this glycopeptide sample. These experiments established directly through bond the non-reducing terminal trisaccharide asα-d-Galp-(1–3)-α-d-Galp-(1–3)-α-l-Fucp-(1-R), R being the remaining β-d-Gal and α-d-GlcpNAc residues. It is also significant to note that corroborative data exists for the internal Galα1–3Fuc linkage through studies of the enzymatic product from the action of AgtA on p-nitrophenyl-Fuc, based on chromatographic co-elution with one of three synthetic standards (23Ketcham C. Wang F. Fisher S.Z. Ercan A. van der Wel H. Locke R.D. Sirajud-Doulah K. Matta K.L. West C.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29050-29059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both αGal linkages were susceptible to the action of green coffee bean α-galactosidase on the glycopeptide, and the terminal αGal2 was selectively released by Xanthomonas manihotis α-1,3/6-galactosidase. Thus, in the in vitro enzymatic synthesis using AgtA, both αGal residues were transferred to Fuc-Gal-GlcNAc-Skp1 in a manner consistent with the in vivo biosynthetic product (24Teng-umnuay P Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T West C.M. The cytoplasmic F-box binding protein SKP1 contains a novel pentasaccharide linked to hydroxyproline in Dictyostelium.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The glycan structure was determined to be linear based on MS/MS and MSn analysis of a permethylated derivative of the glycopeptide. Dissociation of the unlabeled, doubly charged sodium adduct of a permethylated Skp1 glycopeptide precursor ion (m/z 1226; Fig. 5), yielded a tetrasaccharide product ion of m/z 841 (Hex-Hex-deoxyHex-Hex), derived from the non-reducing end of the glycopeptide by fragmentation at the glycosidic linkage between a hexose and the core HexNAc residue. A further step of dissociation (MS3) yielded product ions of 619 and 637 (Hex-Hex-deoxyHex; Fig. 5B), with cleavages on either side of the glycosidic oxygen (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Isolation of the m/z 619 product ion and further dissociation (MS4; Fig. 5C) yielded a product ion characteristic of a Hex-Hex disaccharide (m/z 463). The deoxyHex is an α-l-Fuc residue, based on previous metabolic labeling and in vitro biosynthetic studies (25West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. Purification and characterization of an α1,2-l-fucosyltransferase, which modifies the cytosolic protein FP21, from the cytosol of Dictyostelium.J. Biol.

Also evident in the MS3 spectrum of the isolated m/z 841 ion (Fig. 5B) were cross-ring cleavages on the hexose at the reducing end, yielding product ions of m/z 679 and 723. These product ions contained 2- and 3-carbon fragments derived from the reducing end Hex and are characteristic of a 2-linked fucose residue (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). Corroborative evidence for the Fucα1–2Gal linkage is based on exoglycosidase treatment and preferences of the next glycosyltransferase in the pathway, AgtA (23Ketcham C. Wang F. Fisher S.Z.

They are also in agreement with those of the CASPER database of all Fuc-Gal regioisomers (28Rönnols J. Pendrill R. Fontana C. Hamark C. d’Ortoli T.A. Engström O. Ståhle J. Zaccheus M.V. Säwén E.

This database assigns NMR chemical shifts based on experimental data obtained from constituent mono- to tetrasaccharide structures (29Jansson P.E. Stenutz R. Widmalm G.

These values were more similar to the CASPER values for a βGal residue having a 2-linked αFuc than to any other regioisomers with a different Fuc linkage to βGal. The final linkage, that of the βGal to the core αGlcNAc, is based on the specificity of the fucosyltransferase activity for Galβ1–3GlcNAc substrates (25West C.M. Scott-Ward T.

Additional corroborative evidence for the primary structure (linkages) was observed in NMR experiments using specific sugar isotopic labeling with the intact Skp1 glycoprotein, described below, where interresidue nuclear Overhauser effects were observed between αGal2-H1 and αGal1-H3 and between the βGal-H1 and the GlcNAc-H3 (see Figure 6, Figure 7 and supplemental Fig. S5). This is corroborative evidence for the primary structure, but NOE data are not unambiguous because the strongest NOEs are not necessarily between protons directly across the glycosidic linkage. Taken together, the data from multiple experiments indicate that the primary structure of the oligosaccharide attached at the Hyp residue is α-d-Galp-(1–3)-α-d-Galp-(1–3)-α-l-Fucp-(1–2)-β-d-Galp-(1–3)-α-d-GlcpNAc-(1–4)-l-Hyp.Figure 71H–13C HSQC-NOESY spectrum of [U-13C]GlcNAc GGFGGn-Skp1.

https://openalex.org/W2756337841,"Osteocytes are master orchestrators of bone remodeling; they control osteoblast and osteoclast activities both directly via cell-to-cell communication and indirectly via secreted factors, and they are the main postnatal source of sclerostin and RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kB ligand), two regulators of osteoblast and osteoclast function. Despite progress in understanding osteocyte biology and function, much remains to be elucidated. Recently developed osteocytic cell lines—together with new genome editing tools—has allowed a closer look at the biology and molecular makeup of these cells. By using single-cell cloning, we identified genes that are associated with high Sost/sclerostin expression and analyzed their regulation and function. Unbiased transcriptome analysis of high- vs. low-Sost/ sclerostin-expressing cells identified known and novel genes. Dmp1 (dentin matrix protein 1), Dkk1 (Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1), and Phex were among the most up-regulated known genes, whereas Srpx2, Cd200, and carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) were identified as novel markers of differentiated osteocytes. Aspn, Enpp2, Robo2, Nov, and Serpina3g were among the transcripts that were most significantly suppressed in high-Sost cells. Considering that CAII was recently identified as being regulated by Sost/sclerostin and capable of controlling mineral homeostasis, we focused our attention on CAIII. Here, we report that CAIII is highly expressed in osteocytes, is regulated by parathyroid hormone both in vitro and in vivo, and protects osteocytes from oxidative stress.—Shi, C., Uda, Y., Dedic, C., Azab, E., Sun,N.,Hussein,A.I.,Petty,C.A.,Fulzele,K.,Mitterberger-Vogt,M.C.,Zwerschke,W.,Pereira,R.,Wang,K.,Divieti Pajevic, P.

Editorial strategies, sets of guidelines designed to speed up the process and reduce editors workloads, are treated as trade secrets by publishing houses and are not shared publicly. To improve the effectiveness of their strategies, editors in small publishing groups are faced with undertaking an iterative trial-and-error approach. We show that Cartesian Genetic Programming, a nature-inspired evolutionary algorithm, can dramatically improve editorial strategies. The artificially evolved strategy reduced the duration of the peer review process by 30%, without increasing the pool of reviewers (in comparison to a typical human-developed strategy). Evolutionary computation has typically been used in technological processes or biological ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that genetic programs can improve real-world social systems that are usually much harder to understand and control than physical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2605775151,"Recently, two influential PNAS papers have shown how our preferences for 'Hello Kitty' and 'Harley Davidson', obtained through Facebook likes, can accurately predict details about our personality, religiosity, political attitude and sexual orientation (Konsinski et al. 2013; Youyou et al 2015). In this paper, we make the claim that though the wide variety of Facebook likes might predict such personal traits, even more accurate and generalizable results can be reached through applying a contexts-specific, parsimonious data strategy. We built this claim by predicting present day voter intention based solely on likes directed toward posts from political actors. Combining the online and offline, we join a subsample of surveyed respondents to their public Facebook activity and apply machine learning classifiers to explore the link between their political liking behaviour and actual voting intention. Through this work, we show how even a single well-chosen Facebook like, can reveal as much about our political voter intention as hundreds of random likes. Further, by including the entire political like history of the respondents, our model reaches prediction accuracies above previous multiparty studies (60-70%). We conclude the paper by discussing how a parsimonious data strategy applied, with some limitations, allow us to generalize our findings to the 1,4 million Danes with at least one political like and even to other political multiparty systems."
https://openalex.org/W2754239371,"Cell size distribution is highly reproducible, whereas the size of individual cells often varies greatly within a tissue. This is obvious in a population of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf epidermal cells, which ranged from 1,000 to 10,000 μm2 in size. Endoreduplication is a specialized cell cycle in which nuclear genome size (ploidy) is doubled in the absence of cell division. Although epidermal cells require endoreduplication to enhance cellular expansion, the issue of whether this mechanism is sufficient for explaining cell size distribution remains unclear due to a lack of quantitative understanding linking the occurrence of endoreduplication with cell size diversity. Here, we addressed this question by quantitatively summarizing ploidy profile and cell size distribution using a simple theoretical framework. We first found that endoreduplication dynamics is a Poisson process through cellular maturation. This finding allowed us to construct a mathematical model to predict the time evolution of a ploidy profile with a single rate constant for endoreduplication occurrence in a given time. We reproduced experimentally measured ploidy profile in both wild-type leaf tissue and endoreduplication-related mutants with this analytical solution, further demonstrating the probabilistic property of endoreduplication. We next extended the mathematical model by incorporating the element that cell size is determined according to ploidy level to examine cell size distribution. This analysis revealed that cell size is exponentially enlarged 1.5 times every endoreduplication round. Because this theoretical simulation successfully recapitulated experimentally observed cell size distributions, we concluded that Poissonian endoreduplication dynamics and exponential size-boosting are the sources of the broad cell size distribution in epidermal tissue. More generally, this study contributes to a quantitative understanding whereby stochastic dynamics generate steady-state biological heterogeneity."

The current study determined whether disruption of endogenous glucocorticoid signaling in chondrocytes also modulates the course and severity of arthritis. Tamoxifen-inducible chondrocyte-targeted glucocorticoid receptor-knockout (chGRKO) mice were generated by breeding GRflox/flox mice with tamoxifen-inducible collagen 2a1 Cre (Col2a1-CreERT2) mice. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis (STIA) were induced in both chGRKO mice and their Cre-negative GRflox/flox littermates [wild type (WT)]. Arthritis was assessed by measurement of joint swelling and histology of joints collected at d 14. Neutrophil activity and gene expression patterns associated with cartilage damage were also evaluated. In both arthritis models clinical (joint swelling) and histologic indices of inflammatory activity were significantly greater in chGRKO than in WT mice. The STIA model was characterized by early up-regulation of CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand gene expression in ankle tissues, and significant and selective expansion of splenic CXCR2+ neutrophils in chGRKO arthritic compared to WT arthritic mice. At later stages, gene expression of enzymes involved in cartilage degradation was up-regulated in chGRKO but not WT arthritic mice. Therefore, we summarize that chondrocytes actively mitigate local joint inflammation, cartilage degradation and systemic neutrophil activity via a glucocorticoid-dependent pathway.-Tu, J., Stoner, S., Fromm, P.

https://openalex.org/W2756254981,"Reports of severe disease outbreaks in amphibian communities in mainland Europe due to strains of the common midwife toad virus (CMTV)-like clade of Ranavirus are increasing and have created concern due to their considerable population impacts. In Great Britain, viruses in another clade of Ranavirus–frog virus 3 (FV3)-like—have caused marked declines of common frog (Rana temporaria) populations following likely recent virus introductions. The British public has been reporting mortality incidents to a citizen science project since 1992, with carcasses submitted for post-mortem examination, resulting in a long-term tissue archive spanning 25 years. We screened this archive for ranavirus (458 individuals from 228 incidents) using molecular methods and undertook preliminary genotyping of the ranaviruses detected. In total, ranavirus was detected in 90 individuals from 41 incidents focused in the north and south of England. The majority of detections involved common frogs (90%) but also another anuran, a caudate and a reptile. Most incidents were associated with FV3-like viruses but two, separated by 300 km and 16 years, involved CMTV-like viruses. These British CMTV-like viruses were more closely related to ranaviruses from mainland Europe than to each other and were estimated to have diverged at least 458 years ago. This evidence of a CMTV-like virus in Great Britain in 1995 represents the earliest confirmed case of a CMTV associated with amphibians and raises important questions about the history of ranavirus in Great Britain and the epidemiology of CMTV-like viruses. Despite biases present in the opportunistic sample used, this study also demonstrates the role of citizen science projects in generating resources for research and the value of maintaining long-term wildlife tissue archives."

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated yet in children. Thus, the aims of the present study were to examine differences in ground reaction forces, loading rate, impulses, and free moment values during running in children with and without genu varus. Methods Thirty-six boys aged 9–14 volunteered to participate in this study. They were divided in two age-matched groups (genu varus versus healthy controls). Body weight adjusted three dimensional kinetic data (Fx, Fy, Fz) were collected during running at preferred speed using two Kistler force plates for the dominant and non-dominant limb. Results Individuals with knee genu varus produced significantly higher (p = .01; d = 1.09; 95%) body weight adjusted ground reaction forces in the lateral direction (Fx) of the dominant limb compared to controls. On the non-dominant limb, genu varus patients showed significantly higher body weight adjusted ground reaction forces values in the lateral (p = .01; d = 1.08; 86%) and medial (p < .001; d = 1.55; 102%) directions (Fx). Further, genu varus patients demonstrated 55% and 36% greater body weight adjusted loading rates in the dominant (p < .001; d = 2.09) and non-dominant (p < .001; d = 1.02) leg, respectively. No significant between-group differences were observed for adjusted free moment values (p>.05). Discussion Higher mediolateral ground reaction forces and vertical loading rate amplitudes in boys with genu varus during running at preferred running speed may accelerate the development of progressive joint degeneration in terms of the age at knee osteoarthritis onset. Therefore, practitioners and therapists are advised to conduct balance and strength training programs to improve lower limb alignment and mediolateral control during dynamic movements."
https://openalex.org/W2756255487,"Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are retroviruses present in nearly all nonhuman primates (NHPs), including Old World primates (OWP) and New World primates (NWP). While all confirmed human infections with SFV are from zoonotic transmissions originating from OWP, little is known about the zoonotic transmission potential of NWP SFV. We conducted a longitudinal, prospective study of 56 workers occupationally exposed to NWP in Brazil. Plasma from these workers was tested using Western blot (WB) assays containing NWP SFV antigens. Genomic DNA from blood and buccal swabs was analyzed for the presence of proviral SFV sequences by three nested PCR tests and a new quantitative PCR assay. Exposure histories were obtained and analyzed for associations with possible SFV infection. Ten persons (18%) tested seropositive and two persons were seroindeterminate (3.6%) for NWP SFV. Six persons had seroreactivity over 2-3 years suggestive of persistent infection. All SFV NWP WB-positive workers reported at least one incident involving NWP, including six reporting NWP bites. NWP SFV viral DNA was not detected in the blood or buccal swabs from all 12 NWP SFV seroreactive workers. We also found evidence of SFV seroreversion in three workers suggestive of possible clearance of infection. Our findings suggest that NWP SFV can be transmitted to occupationally-exposed humans and can elicit specific humoral immune responses but infection remains well-controlled resulting in latent infection and may occasionally clear."
https://openalex.org/W2754671536,"Self-control is often believed to operate as if it were a finite, domain-general resource. However, recent attempts to demonstrate this under transparent conditions have failed to yield positive results. In the current study, we monitor two groups of students (N1 = 8,867, N2 = 8,754) over separate 17-week intervals with 24-hour coverage, as they engage in voluntary learning and self-testing using an online program. We use daily behavior to assess whether time-of-day effects support domain-general theories of self-control. Additionally, we assess whether mental fatigue emerges within task during prolonged persistent effort. Results reveal within-task fatigue emerges within an hour on-task. However, there is a negligible effect on ability throughout the day. Additionally, time-of-day has no detrimental effect on motivation; rather there is a strong tendency to increase learning time at night. Results are consistent with theories indicating people lose motivation within a specific task, but at odds with theories that argue for a domain-general self-control resource."
https://openalex.org/W2754680784,"Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring is known to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes among both men and non-pregnant women. We examined the association of habitual snoring during early pregnancy with risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods A cohort of 1,579 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about snoring frequency during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic tests for IGT and GDM were abstracted from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of IGT and GDM associated with snoring in early pregnancy. Results Overall, women who snored “most or all of the time” had a 2.1-fold increased odds of IGT (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31–3.35) and a 2.5-fold increased odds of GDM (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.34–4.67) as compared with women who never snored. Compared with lean women (pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2) who did not snore, lean snorers had a 2-fold increased odds of GDM (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.07–3.68). The odds of GDM risk was particularly elevated among overweight women (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) who snored (OR = 5.01; 95% CI 2.71–9.26). However, there was no evidence of an interaction between overweight and snoring with GDM risk (p-value = 0.144). Conclusions These findings, if confirmed, may have important implications for tailoring prenatal care for overweight pregnant women, and /or those with a history of habitual snoring in early pregnancy."

In this study, we explored the response to the FOLFIRINOX regimen by gender within the trial PRODIGE4/ACCORD 11.Data were described by gender, both in FOLFIRINOX group and in the intention-to-treat population of the trial. The relative effect of gender (females in comparison to males) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival was estimated by using a Cox proportional hazard model and was presented with the Hazard Ratio and their 95% confidence interval. The analysis of prognostic factors of OS included also: age (older than 65 years), ECOG performance status, primary tumor location, synchronous metastases, number of metastatic sites, hepatic metastasis, pulmonary metastases, lymph node metastases, level of Albumin and level of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and three domains from the EORTC Quality of Life QLQC-30 questionnaire.The FOLFIRINOX group (N = 171 patients) included 106 women (62%) and 65 men. No significant differences were observed between genders regarding demographic and clinical parameters, excepted for lymph nodes metastasis (17% and 35% in women and men respectively; p = 0.012). Median OS was longer for females as compared to males in FOLFIRINOX group (13.1 versus 10.3 months respectively; HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06). Similarly, median PFS was superior (7.2 versus 5.9 months; HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10). Nevertheless, in both cases, the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.10 et p = 0.169, respectively).In this study, the overall survival and progression-free survival rates were not significantly higher for females than for males in FOLFIRINOX group (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06 and HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10 respectively). Even if the percentage of patients with lymph node metastasis is higher for males than for females, the interaction between gender and lymph node metastasis was non-significant. Our exploratory analysis did not permit to definitively conclude about a possible effect of gender on the prognosis of patients under FOLFIRINOX. This subject deserves further evaluation.ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00112658.Our analysis suggests that FOLFIRINOX, as first-line option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are younger than 76 years and who have a good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1), no cardiac ischemia and normal or nearly normal bilirubin levels, is beneficial, but not particularly in female patients."
https://openalex.org/W2754569203,"To investigate dual-process persuasion theories in the context of group decision making, we studied low and high need-for-cognition (NFC) participants within a mock trial study. Participants considered plaintiff and defense expert scientific testimony that varied in argument strength. All participants heard a cross-examination of the experts focusing on peripheral information (e.g., credentials) about the expert, but half were randomly assigned to also hear central information highlighting flaws in the expert’s message (e.g., quality of the research presented by the expert). Participants rendered pre- and post-group-deliberation verdicts, which were considered “scientifically accurate” if the verdicts reflected the strong (versus weak) expert message, and “scientifically inaccurate” if they reflected the weak (versus strong) expert message. For individual participants, we replicated studies testing classic persuasion theories: Factors promoting reliance on central information (i.e., central cross-examination, high NFC) improved verdict accuracy because they sensitized individual participants to the quality discrepancy between the experts’ messages. Interestingly, however, at the group level, the more that scientifically accurate mock jurors discussed peripheral (versus central) information about the experts, the more likely their group was to reach the scientifically accurate verdict. When participants were arguing for the scientifically accurate verdict consistent with the strong expert message, peripheral comments increased their persuasiveness, which made the group more likely to reach the more scientifically accurate verdict."
https://openalex.org/W2754810524,"Trypanosoma brucei causes African trypanosomiasis and contains three full-length oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) genes; two of which, TbSTT3A and TbSTT3B, are expressed in the bloodstream form of the parasite. These OSTs have different peptide acceptor and lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor specificities, and trypanosomes do not follow many of the canonical rules developed for other eukaryotic N-glycosylation pathways, raising questions as to the basic architecture and detailed function of trypanosome OSTs. Here, we show by blue-native gel electrophoresis and stable isotope labeling in cell culture proteomics that the TbSTT3A and TbSTT3B proteins associate with each other in large complexes that contain no other detectable protein subunits. We probed the peptide acceptor specificities of the OSTs in vivo using a transgenic glycoprotein reporter system and performed glycoproteomics on endogenous parasite glycoproteins using sequential endoglycosidase H and peptide:N-glycosidase-F digestions. This allowed us to assess the relative occupancies of numerous N-glycosylation sites by endoglycosidase H-resistant N-glycans originating from Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol transferred by TbSTT3A, and endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans originating from Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol transferred by TbSTT3B. Using machine learning, we assessed the features that best define TbSTT3A and TbSTT3B substrates in vivo and built an algorithm to predict the types of N-glycan most likely to predominate at all the putative N-glycosylation sites in the parasite proteome. Finally, molecular modeling was used to suggest why TbSTT3A has a distinct preference for sequons containing and/or flanked by acidic amino acid residues. Together, these studies provide insights into how a highly divergent eukaryote has re-wired protein N-glycosylation to provide protein sequence-specific N-glycan modifications. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD007236, PXD007267, and PXD007268."
https://openalex.org/W2755612899,"Introduction Data on renal impairment in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains scarce, determination of renal function is not part of routine assessments. We evaluated renal function and blood pressure in a cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the Renal Care Zambia project (ReCaZa). Methods Using routine data from an HIV outpatient clinic from 2011–2013, we retrospectively estimated the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, CKD-Epi formula) of PLWH on ART in Lusaka, Zambia. Data were included if adults had had at least one serum creatinine recorded and had been on ART for a minimum of three months. We investigated the differences in eGFR between ART subgroups with and without tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), and applied multivariable linear models to associate ART and eGFR, adjusted for eGFR before ART initiation. Results and discussion Among 1118 PLWH (63,3% female, mean age 41.8 years, 83% ever on TDF; median duration 1461 [range 98 to 4342] days) on ART, 28.3% had an eGFR <90 ml/min, and 5.5% <60 ml/min at their last measurement. Information on other conditions associated with renal impairment was not systematically documented. Fourteen per cent of the PLWH who later switched to TDF-free ART had an initial eGFR lower 60ml/min. Nineteen percent had first-time hypertensive readings at their last visit. The multivariable models suggest that physicians acted according to guidelines and replaced TDF-containing ART if patients developed moderate/severe renal impairment. Conclusions Assessment of renal function in SSA remains a challenge. The vast majority of PLWH benefit from long-term ART, including improved renal function. However, approximately 5% of PLWH on ART may have clinically relevant decreased eGFR, and 27% hypertension. While a routine renal assessment might not be feasible, strategies to identify patients at risk are warranted. Targeted monitoring prior and during ART is recommended, however, should not delay ART access."
https://openalex.org/W2754512332,"Whether the increase in prescription medication use over time differs by age and obesity status is unclear.National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1988 and 2012 was analyzed (n = 57,543).Increased medication use over time was seen in older individuals of all body mass index (BMI) classes, with the most prominent increase in those with obesity (p<0.001). For example, older men (≥65y) with obesity took 3.1 more medications between 1988 and 2012 versus 1.5 for normal weight older men. There were minimal differences in medication use over time in younger individuals. In men, the odds of taking antihypertensives, lipid-lowering medication, antidiabetics, and antidepressants increased with age, time and BMI wherein the association between age and medication use was magnified over time (age*time, p<0.05). In women, older women with overweight or obesity had a greater increase in the likelihood of antihypertensives and antidiabetics medication over time (BMI*time, p>0.05).Older individuals of all BMI classes may be driving the increase in medication use over time. However, the rise in the likelihood of taking cardiometabolic medications over time was generally not different between those with or without obesity in men with some increases seen in older women. Further research may be required to assess accessibility and barriers to medication use among certain demographics."
https://openalex.org/W2754646070,"The biological effects of low-dose or low-dose-rate ionizing radiation on normal tissues has attracted attention. Based on previous research, we observed the morphology of liver tissues of C57BL/6J mice that received <50, 50-500, and 500-1000 μGy/h of 137Cs radiation for 180 d. We found that the pathological changes in liver tissues were more obvious as the irradiation dose rates increased. Additionally, differential protein expression in liver tissues was analyzed using a proteomics approach. Compared with the matched group in the 2D gel analysis of the irradiated groups, 69 proteins had ≥ 1.5-fold changes in expression. Twenty-three proteins were selected based on ≥2.5-fold change in expression, and 22 of them were meaningful for bioinformatics and protein fingerprinting analysis. These molecules were relevant to cytoskeleton processes, cell metabolism, biological defense, mitochondrial damage, detoxification and tumorigenesis. The results from real-time PCR and western blot (WB) analyses showed that calreticulin (CRT) was up-regulated in the irradiated groups, which indicates that CRT may be relevant to stress reactions when mouse livers are exposed to low-dose irradiation and that low-dose-rate ionizing radiation may pose a cancer risk. The CRT protein can be a potential candidate for low-dose or low-dose-rate ionizing radiation early-warning biomarkers. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2755859791,"There has been a paucity of data on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri (MRSS) epidemiology in European healthcare settings. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of nasal and pharyngeal carriage and diversity of MRSS among inpatients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in the largest healthcare centre in Serbia, and to assess performance of different methods for MRSS screening. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were obtained from 195 patients and 105 HCWs in different departments. Each swab was inoculated directly onto MRSA-ID, oxacillin-resistance screening agar and mannitol salt agar (MSA) with 2 mg/L of oxacillin. After inoculation, each swab was dipped in Mueller-Hinton broth with 6.5% NaCl and after overnight incubation, subcultured onto oxacillin-MSA. Characterisation of isolated MRSS strains was determined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PFGE, SCCmec typing and antimicrobial resistance genes detection. MRSS nasal and pharyngeal carriage rate was high (5%) in our hospital and department-variable. PFGE revealed a possible cross-transmission of MRSS between a patient and an HCW, and dissemination across hospital wards. All analysed isolates were multidrug resistant. Fusidic acid resistance was discovered in 93.7% of isolates, but fusA mutations in EF-G and fusB/C genes were not detected. SCCmec regions of MRSS contained elements of classic methicillin-resistant S. aureus type III. Broth enrichment prior to isolation on oxacillin-MSA was superior to direct cultivation on different media with a sensitivity/specificity of 100% and 88.5%, respectively. MRSS is a significant coloniser of patients and HCWs in the hospital. Further research is needed to investigate the clinical significance of the bacterium in our settings."

A telephone survey was administered to a representative sample of 268 informal caregivers (age 45-80) who provide transportation assistance to older adults (age 70 and older) in Michigan. Responses were analyzed overall and by the caregiver sex and care recipient age. Informal transportation caregivers were: most often women; on average 61 years old; generally college educated; employed full- or part-time jobs; relatively healthy; providing care to a parent/family member 1-4 times per week, living close to the care recipient; and providing assistance by giving rides. Less than one-half of caregivers sought information to help them provide assistance. No significant burden was reported and there were few differences by sex of the caregiver of the age group of the care recipient."
https://openalex.org/W2753982899,"Although monotherapy (mART) effectiveness in maintaining viral suppression and CD4 cell count has been extensively examined in HIV-1-infected patients, its impact on HIV-1 reservoir, immune activation, microbial translocation and co-infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is unclear.This retrospective study involved 32 patients who switched to mART; patients were studied at baseline, 48 and 96 weeks after mART initiation. Thirty-two patients who continued combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) over the same period of time were included in the study. Markers of HIV-1 reservoir (HIV-1 DNA and intracellular HIV-1 RNA) were quantified by real-time PCR. Markers of T-(CD3+CD8+CD38+) and B-(CD19+CD80/86+ and CD19+CD10-CD21lowCD27+) cell activation were evaluated by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of microbial translocation markers were quantified by real-time PCR (16S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial [mt]DNA) or by ELISA (LPS and sCD14). EBV was typed and quantified by multiplex real-time PCR.At baseline, no differences were found between mART and cART groups. Three (10%) mART-treated patients had a virological failure vs none in the cART group. Levels of HIV-1 DNA, intracellular HIV-1 RNA and EBV-DNA remained stable in the mART group, while decreased significantly in the cART group. Percentages of T- and B-activated cells significantly increased in the mART-treated patients, while remained at low levels in the cART-treated ones (p = 0.014 and p<0.001, respectively). Notably, levels of mtDNA remained stable in the cART group, but significantly rose in the mART one (p<0.001).Long-term mART is associated with higher levels of T- and B-cell activation and, conversely to cART, does not reduce the size of HIV-1 reservoir and EBV co-infection."

To cope with the salt stress conditions, haloarchaea have developed two fundamentally different strategies: the ""salt-in"" strategy and the ""compatible-solute"" strategy. Although investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance to high salt concentrations has made outstanding achievements, experimental study from the aspect of transcription is rare. In the present study, we monitored cellular physiology of Natrinema sp. J7-2 cells incubated in different salinity media (15%, 25% and 30% NaCl) from several aspects, such as cellular morphology, growth, global transcriptome and the content of intracellular free amino acids. The results showed that the cells were polymorphic and fragile at a low salt concentration (15% NaCl) but had a long, slender rod shape at high salt concentrations (25% and 30% NaCl). The cells grew best in 25% NaCl, mediocre in 30% NaCl and struggled in 15% NaCl. An RNA-seq analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in various salinity media. A total of 1,148 genes were differentially expressed, consisting of 719 DEGs (348 up-regulated and 371 down-regulated genes) between cells in 15% vs 25% NaCl, and 733 DEGs (521 up-regulated and 212 down-regulated genes) between cells in 25% vs 30% NaCl. Moreover, 304 genes were commonly differentially expressed in both 15% vs 25% and 25% vs30% NaCl. The DEGs were enriched in different KEGG metabolic pathways, such as amino acids, glycerolipid, ribosome, nitrogen, protoporphyrin, porphyrin and porhiniods. The intracellular predominant free amino acids consisted of the glutamate family (Glu, Arg and Pro), aspartate family (Asp) and aromatic amino acids (Phe and Trp), especially Glu and Asp."
https://openalex.org/W2754108000,"From November 2014 to November 2015, an experiment in French community pharmacies replaced traditional pre-packed boxes by per-unit dispensing of pills in the exact numbers prescribed, for 14 antibiotics.A cluster randomised control trial was carried out in 100 pharmacies. 75 pharmacies counted out the medication by units (experimental group), the other 25 providing the treatment in the existing pharmaceutical company boxes (control group). Data on patients under the two arms were compared to assess the environmental, economic and health effects of this change in drug dispensing. In particular, adherence was measured indirectly by comparing the number of pills left at the end of the prescribed treatment.Out of the 1185 patients included during 3 sessions of 4 consecutive weeks each, 907 patients experimented the personalized delivery and 278 were assigned to the control group, consistent with a 1/3 randomization-rate at the pharmacy level. 80% of eligible patients approved of the per-unit dispensing of their treatment. The initial packaging of the drugs did not match with the prescription in 60% of cases and per-unit dispensing reduced by 10% the number of pills supplied. 13.1% of patients declared that they threw away pills residuals instead of recycling-no differences between groups. Finally, per-unit dispensing appeared to improve adherence to antibiotic treatment (marginal effect 0.21, IC 95, 0.14-0.28).Supplying antibiotics per unit is not only beneficial in terms of a reduced number of pills to reimburse or for the environment (less pills wasted and non-recycled), but also has a positive and unexpected impact on adherence to treatment, and thus on both individual and public health."

Primary cerebral hypoperfusion has been reported in brain demyelinating diseases. This study investigated whether peripapillary perfusion is changed in patients with acute optic neuritis (AON).This three-year cohort study was conducted from September 1 2012, to August 31, 2015. Two hundred and forty-one patients with non-glaucomatous acute optic neuropathy were screened, and 42 non-highly myopic patients who had suffered their first episode of unilaterally idiopathic AON were studied. All cases received spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination, general survey, and standard corticosteroid therapy. OCT images were analyzed using a customized MATLAB program for measuring peripapillary choroidal thickness (PCT). Multivariate regression models were constructed to identify factors that are significantly related to peripapillary perfusion.Decreased PCT was found in eyes experiencing AON combined with disc swelling (the ratio of lesion eye PCT/fellow eye PCT was 0.87 ± 0.08; range, from 0.75 to 1.00). In comparison to the healthy fellow eyes, approximately every 26% increase in the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer due to axonal swelling was associated with a 10% decreased thickness of PCT. Thinner PCT is also correlated with poorer trough vision, which may lead to poorer final vision. These findings were obvious in patients with optic papillitis but not in patients with retrobulbar neuritis.Peripapillary vascular hypoperfusion was found in patients experiencing AON combined with disc swelling. These findings are unlike those for other ocular inflammatory diseases but are consistent with cerebral hypoperfusion, which is found in brain demyelinating diseases; thus, these findings may represent a new neurovascular model in this field."
https://openalex.org/W2754054525,"Sign language is an essential medium for everyday social interaction for deaf people and plays a critical role in verbal learning. In particular, language development in those people should heavily rely on the verbal short-term memory (STM) via sign language. Most previous studies compared neural activations during signed language processing in deaf signers and those during spoken language processing in hearing speakers. For sign language users, it thus remains unclear how visuospatial inputs are converted into the verbal STM operating in the left-hemisphere language network. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated neural activation while bilinguals of spoken and signed language were engaged in a sequence memory span task. On each trial, participants viewed a nonsense syllable sequence presented either as written letters or as fingerspelling (4-7 syllables in length) and then held the syllable sequence for 12 s. Behavioral analysis revealed that participants relied on phonological memory while holding verbal information regardless of the type of input modality. At the neural level, this maintenance stage broadly activated the left-hemisphere language network, including the inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, for both letter and fingerspelling conditions. Interestingly, while most participants reported that they relied on phonological memory during maintenance, direct comparisons between letters and fingers revealed strikingly different patterns of neural activation during the same period. Namely, the effortful maintenance of fingerspelling inputs relative to letter inputs activated the left superior parietal lobule and dorsal premotor area, i.e., brain regions known to play a role in visuomotor analysis of hand/arm movements. These findings suggest that the dorsal visuomotor neural system subserves verbal learning via sign language by relaying gestural inputs to the classical left-hemisphere language network."
https://openalex.org/W2754743866,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease endemic to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The causative agent, Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), belongs to the genus Phlebovirus in the family Phenuiviridae and causes high rates of abortions in ruminants, and hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or blindness in humans. Viral maintenance by mosquito vectors has led to sporadic RVF outbreaks in ruminants and humans in endemic countries, and effective vaccination of animals and humans may minimize the impact of this disease. A live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain is one of the best characterized RVFV strains, and was conditionally approved as a veterinary vaccine in the U.S. Live-attenuated RVF vaccines including MP-12 strain may form reassortant strains with other bunyavirus species. This study thus aimed to characterize the occurrence of genetic reassortment between the MP-12 strain and bunyavirus species closely related to RVFV. The Arumowot virus (AMTV) and Gouleako goukovirus (GOLV), are transmitted by mosquitoes in Africa. The results of this study showed that GOLV does not form detectable reassortant strains with the MP-12 strain in co-infected C6/36 cells. The AMTV also did not form any reassortant strains with MP-12 strain in co-infected C6/36 cells, due to the incompatibility among N, L, and Gn/Gc proteins. A lack of reassortant formation could be due to a functional incompatibility of N and L proteins derived from heterologous species, and due to a lack of packaging via heterologous Gn/Gc proteins. The MP-12 strain did, however, randomly exchange L-, M-, and S-segments with a genetic variant strain, rMP12-GM50, in culture cells. The MP-12 strain is thus unlikely to form any reassortant strains with AMTV or GOLV in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2756335576,"Symbiont shift is rare in obligate mutualisms because both the partners are reciprocally dependent on and specialized to each other. In the obligate accommodation–transportation mutualism between walking corals and sipunculans, however, an unusual saltatory symbiont shift was discovered. In shallow waters of southern Japan, an undescribed hermit crab species was found living in corallums of solitary scleractinian corals of the genera Heterocyathus and Heteropsammia, replacing the usual sipunculan symbiont. We described the hermit crab as a new species Diogenes heteropsammicola (Decapoda, Anomura, Diogenidae), and explored its association with the walking corals. This hermit crab species obligately inhabits the coiled cavity of the corals, and was easily distinguished from other congeneric species by the exceedingly slender chelipeds and ambulatory legs, and the symmetrical telson. Observations of behavior in aquaria showed that the new hermit crab, like the sipunculan, carries the host coral and prevents the coral from being buried. This is an interesting case in which an organism phylogenetically distant from Sipuncula takes over the symbiotic role in association with a walking coral. The hermit crab species is unique in that its lodging is a living solitary coral that grows with the hermit crab in an accommodation–transportation mutualism."

Lagochilus has a distribution concentration in Tianshan Mountains and Central Asia. To investigate generic spatiotemporal evolution, we sampled most Lagochilus species and sequenced six cpDNA locations (rps16, psbA-trnH, matK, trnL-trnF, psbB-psbH, psbK-psbI). We employed BEAST Bayesian inference for dating, and S-DIVA, DEC, and BBM for ancestral area/biome reconstruction. Our results clearly show that the Tianshan Mountains, especially the western Ili-Kirghizia Tianshan, as well as Sunggar and Kaschgar, was the ancestral area. Ancestral biome was mainly in the montane steppe zone of valley and slope at altitudes of 1700-2700 m, and the montane desert zone of foothill and front-hill at 1000-1700 m. Here two sections Inermes and Lagochilus of the genus displayed ""uphill"" and ""downhill"" speciation process during middle and later Miocene. The origin and diversification of the genus were explained as coupled with the rapid uplift of the Tianshan Mountains starting in late Oligocene and early Miocene ca. 23.66~19.33 Ma, as well as with uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and Central Asian aridification."

The mean regional homogeneity values in the alerted brain regions of patients were correlated with the clinical measurements by using Pearson's correlation analyses. The CP/CPPS-patients had significantly decreased regional homogeneity in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, insular cortices and right medial prefrontal cortex, while significantly increased regional homogeneity in the brainstem and right thalamus compared with the healthy controls. In the CP/CPPS-patients, the mean regional homogeneity value in the left anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral insular cortices and brainstem were respectively correlated with the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index total score and pain subscale. These brain regions are important in the pain modulation process. Therefore, an impaired pain modulatory system, either by decreased descending pain inhibition or enhanced pain facilitation, may explain the pain symptoms in CP/CPPS."

Little is known about the frequency with which primary care physicians (PCPs) test for CD in patients with IDA. We aimed to describe how PCPs approach testing for CD in asymptomatic patients with IDA.We electronically distributed a survey to PCPs who are members of the American College of Physicians. Respondents were asked whether they would test for CD (serologic testing, refer for esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD], or refer to GI) in hypothetical patients with new IDA, including: (1) a young Caucasian man, (2) a premenopausal Caucasian woman, (3) an elderly Caucasian man, and (4) a young African American man. These scenarios were chosen to assess for differences in testing for CD based on age, gender, and race. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of testing.Testing for CD varied significantly according to patient characteristics, with young Caucasian men being the most frequently tested (61% of respondents reporting they would perform serologic testing in this subgroup (p<0.001)). Contrary to guideline recommendations, 80% of respondents reported they would definitely or probably start a patient with positive serologies for CD on a gluten free diet prior to confirmatory upper endoscopy.PCPs are under-testing for CD in patients with IDA, regardless of age, gender, race, or post-menopausal status. The majority of PCPs surveyed reported they do not strictly adhere to established guidelines regarding a confirmatory duodenal biopsy in a patient with positive serology for CD."
https://openalex.org/W2755486469,"Harsh adverse effects as a result of nonspecific targeting of chemotherapeutics currently pose obstacles in cancer therapy; thus, it would be invaluable to devise novel approaches to specifically target cancer cells. The natural compound pancratistatin (PST) has been shown to preferentially induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell types. Recently, several analogs of PST were shown to be efficacious in inducing apoptosis in a variety of aggressive cancer cell types via cancer cell mitochondrial targeting; it caused dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased oxygen consumption, and with isolated mitochondria, it induced the release of apoptogenic factors. The natural compound piperlongumine has been shown to target the stress response to reactive oxygen species in cancer cells. We explored the combinatorial potential of two small molecules (SVTH-6 and piperlongumine) that target these vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Interestingly, when combined with the PST analog, SVTH-6, an increase in mitochondrial dysfunction was observed, leading to an enhanced cytotoxic effect against several human cancer cell types. Additionally, this combination treatment was effective in reducing cancer cell growth in physiologically more relevant 3-dimensional spheroid cell cultures. This enhanced effect was found to be dependent on reactive oxygen species generation because an antioxidant could rescue cancer cells from this combination treatment. Importantly, noncancerous cells were markedly less sensitive to this combination treatment. Thus, targeting mitochondrial and oxidative stress vulnerabilities of cancer cells could be an effective strategy for cancer therapy.—Ma, D., Gilbert, T., Pignanelli, C., T arade, D., Noel, M., Mansour, F., Gupta, M., Ma, S., Ropat, J., Curran, C., Vshyvenko, S., Hudlicky, T., Pandey.

https://openalex.org/W2754869350,"It has been discovered that there are two stem cell groups in the intestinal crypts: central stem cells (CeSCs), which are at the very bottom of the crypt, and border stem cells (BSCs), which are located between CeSCs and transit amplifying cells (TAs). Moreover, backward cell migration from BSCs to CeSCs has been observed. Recently, a bi-compartmental stochastic model, which includes CeSCs and BSCs, has been developed to investigate the probability of two-hit mutant production in the stem cell niche. In this project, we improve this stochastic model by adding the probability of backward cell migration to the model. The model suggests that the probability of two-hit mutant production increases when the frequency of backward cell migration increases. Furthermore, a small non-zero probability of backward cell migration leads to the largest range of optimal values for the frequency of symmetric divisions and the portion of divisions at each stem cell compartment in terms of delaying 2-hit mutant production. Moreover, the probability of two-hit mutant production is more sensitive to the probability of symmetric divisions than to the rate of backward cell migrations. The highest probability of two-hit mutant production corresponds to the case when all stem cell's divisions are asymmetric."
https://openalex.org/W2755149320,"We propose a minimal model for the spontaneous and persistent generation of polarity in a spherical cell based on dynamic microtubules and a single mobile molecular component. This component, dubbed the polarity factor, binds to microtubules nucleated from a centrosome located in the center of the cell, is subsequently delivered to the cell membrane, where it diffuses until it unbinds. The only feedback mechanism we impose is that the residence time of the microtubules at the membrane increases with the local density of the polarity factor. We show analytically that this system supports a stable unipolar symmetry-broken state for a wide range of parameters. We validate the predictions of the model by 2D particle-based simulations. Our model provides a route towards the creation of polarity in a minimal cell-like environment using a biochemical reconstitution approach."
https://openalex.org/W2755630777,"Metformin is a biguanide drug that is widely used in the treatment of diabetes. Epidemiological studies have indicated that metformin exhibits anti-cancer activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity currently remain unclear. We hypothesized that metformin is cytotoxic in a tumor-specific environment such as glucose deprivation and/or low oxygen (O2) tension. We herein demonstrated that metformin was highly cytotoxic under glucose-depleted, but not hypoxic (2% O2) conditions. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this selective cytotoxicity, we treated exposed DNA repair-deficient chicken DT40 cells with metformin under glucose-depleted conditions and measured cellular sensitivity. Under glucose-depleted conditions, metformin specifically killed fancc and fancl cells that were deficient in FANCC and FANCL proteins, respectively, which are involved in DNA interstrand cross-link repair. An analysis of chromosomal aberrations in mitotic chromosome spreads revealed that a clinically relevant concentration of metformin induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in fancc and fancl cells under glucose-depleted conditions. In summary, metformin induced DNA damage under glucose-depleted conditions and selectively killed cells. This metformin-mediated selective toxicity may suppress the growth of malignant tumors that are intrinsically deprived of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2756273118,"Introduction Musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent and a burden to society, recurrent and persistent low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) being the most common conditions. They are associated with other poor health outcomes such as sleep problems. Physical activity (PA) prevents LBP and NP, but the direct effect on sleep is unclear. This study explored the effect of pain on insomnia, and examined if adherence to moderate-to-high intensity levels of PA influenced this relationship. Methods In this prospective observational study, 1821 workers were followed over 3 years. Data included self-rated measures of LBP and NP, insomnia and level and amount of PA. Pain variables were used in a “risk profile” for future sick-listing, insomnia was categorized into those with and without such problems, and adherence to PA was defined as reporting moderate-to-high levels in two consecutive years. In Poisson regression models, individuals with pain risk profiles were analysed according to PA adherence for the outcome insomnia. Repeated measurements allowed control for prior pain. Results In this mainly male working population, individuals with a risk profile for LBP and NP had a significant increased risk (RR = 1.5) of developing insomnia one year later when not adhering to moderate-to-high levels of PA. Among those not reporting prior pain, the risk was even larger (RR = 2.5). Generalizability may be restricted to relatively healthy males. The individuals who reported a pain risk profile two consecutive years did not get the buffer effect from adhering to moderate-to-high levels of PA in terms of developing insomnia."
https://openalex.org/W2754808561,"Humans and dogs have interacted for millennia. As a result, humans (and especially dog owners) sometimes try to interpret dog behaviour. While there is extensive research on the brain regions that are involved in mentalizing about other peoples’ behaviour, surprisingly little is known of whether we use these same brain regions to mentalize about animal behaviour. In this fMRI study we investigate whether brain regions involved in mentalizing about human behaviour are also engaged when observing dog behaviour. Here we show that these brain regions are more engaged when observing dog behaviour that is difficult to interpret compared to dog behaviour that is easy to interpret. Interestingly, these results were not only obtained when participants were instructed to infer reasons for the behaviour but also when they passively viewed the behaviour, indicating that these brain regions are activated by spontaneous mentalizing processes."
https://openalex.org/W2755194078,"The gene ectopic viral integration site 1 (EVI) and its variant myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS)/EVI encode zinc-finger proteins that have been recognized as important oncogenes in various types of cancer. In contrast to the established role of EVI and MDS/EVI in cancer development, their potential function during vertebrate postembryonic development, especially in organ-specific adult stem cells, is unclear. Amphibian metamorphosis is strikingly similar to postembryonic development around birth in mammals, with both processes taking place when plasma thyroid hormone (T3) levels are high. Using the T3-dependent metamorphosis in Xenopus tropicalis as a model, we show here that high levels of EVI and MDS/EVI are expressed in the intestine at the climax of metamorphosis and are induced by T3. By using the transcription activator-like effector nuclease gene editing technology, we have knocked out both EVI and MDS/EVI and have shown that EVI and MDS/EVI are not essential for embryogenesis and premetamorphosis in X. tropicalis. On the other hand, knocking out EVI and MDS/EVI causes severe retardation in the growth and development of the tadpoles during metamorphosis and leads to tadpole lethality at the climax of metamorphosis. Furthermore, the homozygous-knockout animals have reduced adult intestinal epithelial stem cell proliferation at the end of metamorphosis (for the few that survive through metamorphosis) or during T3-induced metamorphosis. These findings reveal a novel role of EVI and/or MDS/EVI in regulating the formation and/or proliferation of adult intestinal adult stem cells during postembryonic development in vertebrates.—Okada, M., Shi, Y.-B. EVI and MDS/EVI are required for adult intestinal stem cell formation during postembryonic vertebrate development. FASEB J. 32,431-439 (2018). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W2755329878,"With the high accident rate of civil aviation, medical resource inventory becomes more important for emergency management at the airport. Meanwhile, medical products usually are time-sensitive and short lifetime. Moreover, we find that the optimal medical resource inventory depends on multiple factors such as different risk preferences, the material shelf life and so on. Thus, it becomes very complex in a real-life environment. According to this situation, we construct medical resource inventory decision model for emergency preparation at the airport. Our model is formulated in such a way as to simultaneously consider uncertain demand, stochastic occurrence time and different risk preferences. For solving this problem, a new programming is developed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed method. The results show that it is effective for determining the optimal medical resource inventory for emergency preparation with uncertain demand and stochastic occurrence time under considering different risk preferences at the airport."
https://openalex.org/W2754980845,"Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is not always performed clinically if the diagnosis of ureteral calculi has been confirmed using other radiographic imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of successful extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) without assistance of NCCT.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with symptomatic solitary ureteral stones who underwent ESWL between November 2015 and January 2016. Abdominal plain radiography or intravenous urography were performed before ESWL for localization. The exclusion criteria were repeated sessions of ESWL for the target stone and congenital genitourinary tract anomalies. The demographic characteristics, clinical history, medical charges, or imaging features of the stones were recorded. Successful treatment was defined as no fragments detected on radiography or ultrasonography in 4 weeks. For radiolucent calculi, successful treatment was regarded as cases without hydronephrosis, symptoms, or hematuria. Patients experiencing intractable pain and undergoing subsequent auxiliary surgeries were regarded as having ESWL treatment failure.Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.042; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.007-1.078), history of ipsilateral renal or ureteral calculi episodes (OR, 2.669; 95% CI, 1.281-5.687), stone burden (OR, 3.499; 95% CI, 1.284-9.530), and radiopaque stone (OR, 2.351; 95% CI, 1.049-5.267) were significant predictors of ESWL failure in all patients.For treating symptomatic ureteral stones, those with smaller size, radiolucency, and without a history of ipsilateral renal or ureteral calculi could be considered for first-line therapy with ESWL."
