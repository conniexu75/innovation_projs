https://openalex.org/W1978259618,"WE have reported that the isolated perfused rat liver from a fasted animal produces urea in linear fashion1, at the expense of both liver and plasma proteins. Urea production occurs, and the blood amino-acid level is maintained in the absence of added extraneous amino-acids. When a free amino-acid supplement is added, urea production is greatly enhanced. The addition of glucose or fructose supplements is associated with a nitrogen-sparing effect manifest as a diminished production of urea. This nitrogen-sparing effect is seen in either the presence or absence of added amino-acids."

The significance of these phenomena is discussed in view of the phylogenetic distribution of hemerythrin and the function of respiratory pigments."

https://openalex.org/W2086710105,"IT has been shown by Gross and others1 that filtrates of leukæmic tissues are leukæmogenic following injection into new-born mice of a low-leukæmic strain, and that total thymectomy prevents the development of lymphocytic leukæmia in inoculated mice2. On the other hand, normal thymuses grafted to inoculated thymectomized hosts as late as 6 months after thymectomy develop lymphocytic neoplasms3. It follows, therefore, that a leukæmogenic agent might be recoverable from the tissues of inoculated mice up to 6 months or more after thymectomy."

https://openalex.org/W2023918295,"HUMAN, cow, and horse thrombins were quickly fractionated from citrate- or bio-activated prothrombin preparations by precipitation of residual prothrombin and inert protein(s) with the cationic dye 6,9-diamino-2-ethoxyacridine lactate (often referred to as rivanol, available under the trade name ‘Ethodin’ from the Winthrop Laboratories, New York, New York). This is a general procedure previously applied in purifying γ-globulin1, β1-metal-combining globulin2, and cæruloplasmin3. A more efficient yet rapid fractionation, however, was achieved by the adsorption of preparations containing thrombin on filter cakes or short columns of ‘IRC-50’ (‘XE-64-Rivanol’), this resin form being prepared by stirring ‘XE-64-Na+’ with an excess of rivanol. After the impurities, including other rivanol-soluble proteins, were washed off, the thrombins were eluted with 0.15 M calcium chloride. The thrombins were recovered from all eluates by acetone precipitation."

Divergence was as great as it is with complete isolation. Isolation, therefore, is not a prerequisite of divergence under divergent selection pressures."

https://openalex.org/W1972854306,A method for the quantitative assay of the antigenicity of homologous mouse whole spleen cells in the system of A/Heston (donor) to C57BL/6 (recipient) is described. The assay is based upon the graded response of skin homografts to the numbers of donor cells injected intraperitoneally into the recipient prior to the skin graft. The response is linear with respect to the logarithm (base 10) of the number of cells injected.
https://openalex.org/W1972994355,"IT has been found that the sodium salts of polyadenylic and polyuridylic acids interact1–4 with formation of a two-stranded helix1 with a structure very similar to deoxyribonucleic acid. More recently it was observed that the infra-red spectrum5 of the mixture of these two acids showed the following marked changes from the summation of the curves of the components : a 39 per cent reduction in intensity of the 1,627 cm.−1 band and a 7 cm.−1 shift to higher frequency ; a decrease in peak height (because of strong overlap the band was not integrated) and an 11 cm.−1 shift to higher frequency of the 1,661 cm.−1 band. The interaction of the sodium salts of polycytidylic and polyinosinic acids6 has now been observed in the infra-red7 with the following result : a marked decrease in intensity of the 1,651 cm.−1 peak of the sodium salt of polycytidylic acid (the intensities have not yet been put on a quantitative basis) and a 19 cm.−1 shift to higher frequency of the 1,678 cm.−1 peak of the sodium salt of polyinosinic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2073663830,"Large peripheral chromocenters occurred in about 10 percent of the nuclei of female rat cells grown in vitro but occurred on the average in less than 1 percent of the nuclei of male cells. Similar chromocenters occurred in hamster and mouse nuclei in vitro, but no clear-cut sexual difference was demonstrable."
https://openalex.org/W1980244032,The Rh0(D) content of red cells obtained from different individuals as determined with I181 anti-Rh0(D) showed a bimodal distribution. Family studies indicate that the cells with the lower antigen content represent the heterozygous Rh0(D) state and that the cells with 1.6 times more Rh0(D) correspond to the homozygous state.
https://openalex.org/W1988703812,"SALICYLATE uncouples oxidative phosphorylation reactions1, and the possible relation of this major action on cellular metabolism, to other effects of the drugs is of great interest2. One of the most important properties of salicylate is its anti-inflammatory actions, both in rheumatic disease and in experimental inflammatory states3. Adams and Cobb4 observed a general parallelism between uncoupling activity and the inhibition of erythema in the guinea pig by a series of non-hormonal anti-rheumatic drugs, including salicylate. They suggested a possible connexion between uncoupling ability and therapeutic activity but found that 2 : 4-dinitrophenol, which is a more powerful uncoupling agent than salicylate, failed to affect the erythema test. We have observed that salicylate, but not 2 : 4-dinitrophenol, also modifies the response to the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test in the guinea pig."

https://openalex.org/W2024627659,"THE sex chromatin clump of Barr has been reported as occurring in human female tissues cultured in vitro for short periods, and as not occurring in long-established cultures1,2. The purpose of this communication is to provide a quantitative summary of the available knowledge in this respect, and to indicate that sex chromatin apparently occurs routinely in suitably stained primary explants, but not in long cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033901140,"THE changes produced in potato starch by the action of ionizing radiation is of considerable importance and have been the subject of many investigations in recent years1–4. Physical changes induced in air-dried starch granules by γ-irradiation indicated that hydrolytic degradation had been occurring. Therefore, small molecular fission products of an irradiated specimen of potato starch were analysed by several chromatographical methods."

Examination of 472 skulls of Lynx canadensis disclosed only one possessing bregmatic bones."

https://openalex.org/W2037692964,A communication situation is described in which the rewards of both members of a pair of monkeys cannot exceed chance levels unless the operator monkey responds to cues provided by the informant monkey which indicate the location of food. Performance under these test conditions improved progressively to levels consistently above chance.
https://openalex.org/W2069493141,"Eleven of 21 wild pairs of Drosophlila niielaniogaster tested gave rise to at least 1 fly with crossvein defects out of 1000 F(2) progeny. Considered in the light of additional information, the results support the idea that an individual lpossesses to a large degree the potential variability of the population of which he is a member."

https://openalex.org/W2034611686,"IT was suggested in a previous communication1 that the fall in coenzyme A liver concentrations in animals treated with vanadium might be due, at least partially, to a reduction in the number of —SH groups available. This hypothesis was based on the following facts: (1) The toxic effects of vanadium may, to a great extent, be attributed to modifications in reactions connected with sulphur compounds, especially those of the thiolic type2. (2) The lack of —SH groups, and particularly of sulphurated amino-acids, lowers the coenzyme A content in the liver3; in this case, a fall in thioctic acid, the connexion of which with coenzyme A is well-known, also occurs in the tissues4."
