The importance of 11β-HSD-1 in glucose homeostasis is suggested by the resistance of 11β-HSD-1−/− mice to hyperglycemia upon stress or obesity, due to attenuated gluconeogenic responses. The present study further investigates the metabolic consequences of 11β-HSD-1 deficiency, focusing on the lipid and lipoprotein profile. Ad lib fed 11β-HSD-1−/− mice have markedly lower plasma triglyceride levels. This appears to be driven by increased hepatic expression of enzymes of fat catabolism (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, acyl-CoA oxidase, and uncoupling protein-2) and their coordinating transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα). 11β-HSD-1−/− mice also have increased HDL cholesterol, with elevated liver mRNA and serum levels of apolipoprotein AI. Conversely, liver Aα-fibrinogen mRNA levels are decreased. Upon fasting, the normal elevation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α mRNA is lost in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice, consistent with attenuated glucocorticoid induction. Despite this, crucial oxidative responses to fasting are maintained; carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I induction and glucose levels are similar to wild type. Refeeding shows exaggerated induction of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes and a more marked suppression of genes for fat catabolism in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice, implying increased liver insulin sensitivity. Concordant with this, 24-h refed 11β-HSD-1−/− mice have higher triglyceride but lower glucose levels. Further, 11β-HSD-1−/− mice have improved glucose tolerance. These data suggest that 11β-HSD-1 deficiency produces an improved lipid profile, hepatic insulin sensitization, and a potentially atheroprotective phenotype.

Glucocorticoid excess, epitomized by Cushing's syndrome in humans, leads to insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and a redistribution of fat to visceral depots associated with increased cardiovascular risk (1Peeke P.M. Chrousos G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 771: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) resembles Cushing's syndrome, although plasma glucocorticoid levels are typically normal. It has therefore been suggested that increased glucocorticoid action within specific cells may occur in the metabolic syndrome (2Andrew R. Phillips D.I.W. Walker B.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Stewart P.M. Boulton A. Kumar S. Clark P.M.S. Shackleton C.H.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Indeed, there is now evidence for a novel and important level of control of glucocorticoid action, prereceptor metabolism by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs).111β-HSDs catalyze the interconversion of active 11-hydroxyglucocorticoids (cortisol in most mammals, corticosterone in rats and mice) and their inert 11-keto forms (cortisone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone). There are two isozymes of 11β-HSD, the products of distinct genes (5Brown R.W. Chapman K.E. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R.

Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). 11β-HSD type 2 is a high affinity dehydrogenase that rapidly inactivates corticosterone in kidney and colon, thus excluding glucocorticoids from inherently nonselective mineralocorticoid receptors in vivo (7Edwards C.R.W.

Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for targeted disruption of the 11β-HSD-1 gene cannot regenerate corticosterone from inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone, indicating that this isozyme is the unique 11β-reductase in vivo (16Kotelevtsev, Y., Holmes, M. C., Burchell, A., Houston, P. M., Schmoll, D., Jamieson, P., Best, R., Brown, R., Edwards, C. R. W., Seckl, J. R., and Mullins, J. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 14924–14929.Google Scholar). Strikingly, 11β-HSD-1 null animals exhibit attenuated gluconeogenic responses upon stress and resist hyperglycemia induced by chronic high fat feeding (16Kotelevtsev, Y., Holmes, M. C., Burchell, A., Houston, P. M., Schmoll, D., Jamieson, P., Best, R., Brown, R., Edwards, C. R. W., Seckl, J. R., and Mullins, J. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 14924–14929.Google Scholar), suggesting that 11β-HSD-1 reductase activity is an important amplifier of intrahepatic glucocorticoid action in vivo. Intriguingly, tissue-specific alterations in 11β-HSD-1 activity have been implicated in the development of obesity and insulin resistance in obese Zucker rats (4Livingstone D.E. Jones G.C. Smith K. Jamieson P.M. Andrew R Kenyon C.J. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and in humans (2Andrew R. Phillips D.I.W. Walker B.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Am. J. Cardiol. 1998; 81: 18B-25BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The lipid profile is determined to a large extent by expression of liver genes involved in lipid metabolism, synthesis, packaging, and export, many of which are glucocorticoid-sensitive.

Chan L. Verhoeven G. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or elevated endogenous glucocorticoid levels promotes hyperlipidemia and induces insulin resistance (1Peeke P.M. Chrousos G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 771: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consequently, in liver, there is elevated VLDL secretion (20Zammit V.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as well as increased glucose output. Adrenalectomy corrects the aberrant lipid and insulin sensitivity profile of rodent obesity models (21Dallman M.F. Strack A.M. Akana S.F. Bradbury M.J. Hanson E.S. Scribner K.A. Smith M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 14: 303-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), an effect reversed by glucocorticoid replacement (22Freedman M.R. Horwitz B.A. Stern J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: R595-R607PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also have important indirect effects on hepatic lipid metabolism through regulation of key transcription factors. Notably, glucocorticoids induce the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) (23Lemberger T Staels B Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lemberger T. Saladin R. Vasquez M. Assimacopoulos F. Staels B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) and serves as the molecular target for the hypolipidemic fibrate drugs (27Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 28Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.-C. Fiévet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

However, the precise contribution of glucocorticoids to altered hepatic lipid metabolism during pathogenic states such as the metabolic syndrome is unclear. Indeed, modulation of intrahepatic glucocorticoid actions by 11β-HSD-1, and its physiological impact in regulating lipid metabolism is unexplored.Here we investigate liver-dependent changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice. To address this, we have analyzed circulating lipids and lipoproteins and assessed expression of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism. Aα-fibrinogen expression levels have also been measured as an independent cardiovascular risk marker. Since elevated glucocorticoids play a crucial role in the metabolic adaptation to fasting, we have also investigated the effects of 11β-HSD-1 deficiency on this process. Furthermore, we have assessed glucose tolerance and the relative hepatic insulin sensitivity of 11β-HSD-1−/−mice through their transcriptional response to refeeding after a fast.DISCUSSIONHere we show that 11β-HSD-1 deficiency in mice opposes the pathogenic lipid and lipoprotein profile found in disease states such as the metabolic syndrome. The distinctive phenotype of 11β-HSD1−/− mice during different feeding states (summarized in Table I) indicates at least three, potentially interrelated hepatic mechanisms contributing to their “favorable” metabolic profile: increased lipid catabolism (ad lib fed), reduced intracellular glucocorticoid concentrations (fasting), and increased hepatic insulin sensitivity (refeeding).Table ISummary of the effects of 11β-HSD-1 deficiency on metabolismTGLipid synthesisLipid catabolismHDL cholesterolApoAIGlucoseFibrinogen mRNAAd lib fed11β-HSD-1−/−↓↔↑↑↑↔↓FastedWild type↓⇊⇈↔↓11β-HSD-1−/−↓↓↑↑↓RefedWild type↑↑↓↔⇈11β-HSD-1−/−⇈⇈⇊↑↑Arrows depict the direction of change (up or down) in the parameter shown. In the ad lib fed state, this indicates relative to wild type. In fasted or refed animals, the arrows indicate both the direction of change and the relative degree of change compared to the wild type response. Note, in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice, first, the reduced ad lib fed triglyceride (TG) and increased HDL cholesterol/ApoAI, the former driven by increased lipid oxidation and PPARα; second, the attenuated fasting responses, suggesting reduced glucocorticoid action; and third, the exaggerated refeeding responses compatible with increased insulin sensitivity. Open table in a new tab In the ad lib fed state, 11β-HSD-1−/− mice show reduced circulating triglyceride. This may be in part due to reduction of non-HDL-associated (triglyceride-rich) apoCIII in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice. ApoCIII increases triglyceride levels by inhibiting the binding and intravascular lipolysis of triglyceride-rich particles at the endothelium and by interfering with apoE-directed clearance of these particles (31Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 42Aalto-Setala K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We also find evidence that altered hepatic lipid metabolism is likely to play a key role in the plasma triglyceride profile. Thus, while mRNAs encoding key rate-limiting lipogenic enzymes and the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1c were maintained at wild type levels, mRNAs encoding key enzymes of hepatic fat oxidation were elevated in the 11β-HSD-1−/− liver. This is compatible with increased triglyceride catabolism and/or diminished VLDL triglyceride secretion as a mechanism driving reduced plasma triglycerides in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice.Glucocorticoids mediate the physiological adaptation of an animal to starvation by driving hepatic glucose production and fatty acid oxidation. In the fasted state, 11β-HSD-1−/− mice show attenuated induction of genes that are directly (PPARα, apoAI) or indirectly (ACO, UCP-2) glucocorticoid-sensitive. These results agree with previous findings of attenuated induction of gluconeogenic enzymes on fasting in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice (16Kotelevtsev, Y., Holmes, M. C., Burchell, A., Houston, P. M., Schmoll, D., Jamieson, P., Best, R., Brown, R., Edwards, C. R. W., Seckl, J. R., and Mullins, J. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 14924–14929.Google Scholar). The data support the idea that 11β-HSD-1−/− mice are relatively deficient in intracellular glucocorticoids, particularly when glucocorticoid levels are rising (fasting or stress). Despite abolished PPARα induction, 11β-HSD-1−/− mice appear to maintain hepatic fatty acid oxidation, perhaps due to the already elevatedad lib fed PPARα levels. Thus, mCPT-I mRNA is fully induced, and fasting plasma glucose levels are similar to wild type animals. Up-regulation of mCPT-I therefore appears independent of PPARα under fasting conditions, in agreement with studies in PPARα null mice (44Le May C. Pineau T. Bigot K. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J.-P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, the abolished ACO and attenuated UCP-2 induction may reflect the relatively greater sensitivity of these promoters to PPARα regulation on fasting. Alternatively, PPARα target gene induction (mCPT-I, UCP-2), despite unchanged PPARα expression, may also be due to increased provision of endogenous fatty acid activators of the transcription factor (27Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) with fasting.We find pronounced lipid accumulation in 11β-HSD-1−/−liver on fasting, reminiscent of the fatty liver observed in fasted PPARα null mice (25Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 26Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). However, hepatic lipid accumulation readily resolves in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice upon refeeding. Lower PPARα-mediated fat catabolism may contribute to liver lipid accumulation, as supported by the attenuated fasting ACO and UCP-2 responses. In addition, failure to suppress GPAT through attenuated glucocorticoid action and/or inappropriate insulin-mediated GPAT induction could contribute to excessive lipid esterification on fasting. Despite the relatively small changes in mRNA level observed here, it is likely that insulin will have post-transcriptional effects on enzyme expression and activity that could account for the marked morphological changes observed in liver.Refeeding after a fast is characterized by an insulin-mediated overshoot of lipogenic gene expression (45Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and repression of oxidative processes (46Chien D. Dean D. Saha A.K. Flatt J.P. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used this as a measure of relative hepatic insulin sensitivity. 11β-HSD-1−/− mice manifest increased hepatic insulin sensitivity, since upon refeeding there is an exaggerated induction of lipogenic genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, GPAT, and HMG-CoAR) and suppression of oxidative genes (mCPT-I, UCP-2, and ACO). This provides an explanation for the more rapid recovery of triglycerides to ad lib fed levels, as well as the 24-h triglyceride “overshoot” upon refeeding 11β-HSD-1−/− mice. The contention that 11β-HSD-1−/− mice have increased hepatic insulin sensitivity is supported by their enhanced glucose disposal despite similar fasted insulin levels. Recent evidence supports the idea that insulin sensitivity in the liver (where 11β-HSD-1 is most highly expressed) is a major determinant of glucose homeostasis; knockout of the insulin receptor in the liver results in profound glucose intolerance in mice (47Michael M.M. Kulkarni R.H. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) in contrast to analogous studies in muscle (48Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of muscle and adipose tissues to the improved glucose tolerance of the 11β-HSD-1−/− mice has yet to be determined.Increased hepatic PPARα may play a key role in the 11β-HSD-1−/− metabolic phenotype. PPARα activation by fibrates lowers plasma triglyceride (28Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.-C. Fiévet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Princen H.M. Kooistra T. Staels B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed increased expression of the PPARα target genes mCPT-I (50Yu G.S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), ACO (51Lee S.-S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L.

Takahashi M. Kim H. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in liver of the 11β-HSD-1−/− mice. Moreover, the 25% reduction in Aα-fibrinogen mRNA levels in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice is similar to the effect produced by fibrates (49Kockx M. Gervois P.P. Poulain P. Derudas B. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Princen H.M. Kooistra T. Staels B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 11β-HSD-1−/− mice thus mimic, in part, the phenotype of a fibrate-treated animal. It is intriguing that a recent report suggests that fibrates reduce hepatic 11β-HSD-1 expression (53Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Gerhold D. Mundt S.S. Loving V.A. Lu M. Chen Y. Elbrecht A. Wu M. Doebber T. Kelly L. Milot D. Guo Q. Wang P-R. Ipollito M. Chao Y-S. Wright S.D. Thieringer R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which may mediate part of their metabolic actions. This could also indicate a negative feedback loop in wild type animals whereby amplification of glucocorticoid levels through 11β-HSD-1 increases PPARα expression, which in turn down-regulates expression of 11β-HSD-1.While elevated PPARα levels may be a mechanism driving the ad lib fed lipid phenotype of 11β-HSD-1−/− mice, its increased expression in this model of intracellular glucocorticoid deficiency presents an apparent paradox. PPARα is induced by glucocorticoids within the physiological range (24Lemberger T. Saladin R. Vasquez M. Assimacopoulos F. Staels B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for increased PPARα expression, therefore, could be the subtly elevated circulating corticosterone levels in 11β-HSD-1−/− mice caused by impaired (11β-HSD-1-mediated) negative feedback upon the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (16Kotelevtsev, Y., Holmes, M. C., Burchell, A., Houston, P. M., Schmoll, D., Jamieson, P., Best, R., Brown, R., Edwards, C. R. W., Seckl, J. R., and Mullins, J. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nevertheless, 11β-HSD-1−/− mice have reduced intracellular glucocorticoid levels and responses in the brain in the face of such increased plasma corticosterone (54Yau J.L.W. Noble J. Kenyon C.J.

The lack of PPARα induction with fasting is compatible with reduced intrahepatic glucocorticoid levels. Furthermore, hepatic glucocorticoid-sensitive genes such as corticosterone-binding globulin (55Cole T.J. Harris H.J. Hoong I. Solomon N. Smith R. Krozowski Z. Fullerton M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and glucocorticoid receptor (56Dong Y. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Mol.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), despite the modestly higher corticosterone. This suggests that factors other than plasma corticosterone may be responsible for the elevated PPARα expression. Indeed, PPARα is regulated by many factors including other steroids (57Collett G.P.

The precise determinants of elevated basal PPARα in this model of chronic subtle glucocorticoid depletion in the liver remain to be determined.The complex relationship between glucocorticoid and PPARα signaling is also reflected by the expression profile of genes regulated by both transcription factors. For example, fibrinogen levels are positively regulated by glucocorticoids (40Bhattacharya A. Holland L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 61Ambrosi B. Sartorio A. Pizzocaro A. Passini E. Bottasso B. Federici A. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol.

In ad lib fed 11β-HSD-1−/−mice, lower Aα-fibrinogen expression suggests that PPARα-mediated repression appears to dominate at the fibrinogen promoter. In addition, apolipoprotein AI is induced by glucocorticoids (33Hargrove G.M. Junco A. Wong N.C.W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and insulin (62Murao K. Wada Y. Nakamura T. Taylor A.H. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol.

Our observation of elevated apoAI transcript levels in ad lib fed 11β-HSD-1−/− mice implies that PPARα does not dominate on the apoAI promoter. Increased apoAI expression upon fasting in wild type mice is consistent with the glucocorticoid induction observed in rats and humans (33Hargrove G.M. Junco A. Wong N.C.W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The attenuated induction of ApoAI on fasting in 11β-HSD1−/− mice perhaps reflects their reduced intrahepatic glucocorticoid action. These findings illustrate the interdependence of the three principle mechanisms that govern the overall metabolic phenotype of 11β-HSD-1−/− mice, each emphasized during a different feeding state: increased ad lib fed PPARα expression, intrahepatic glucocorticoid deficiency with fasting, and hepatic insulin sensitization upon refeeding.Mice with a targeted disruption in the gene encoding the 11β-HSD-1 enzyme represent a model that"

Exocytosis requires the assembly of SNARE complexes formed by the vesicle protein Synaptobrevin and the membrane proteins Syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25. We analyzed the role of Munc18-1, a cytosolic binding partner of Syntaxin-1, in large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) secretion. Calcium-dependent LDCV exocytosis was reduced 10-fold in mouse chromaffin cells lacking Munc18-1, but the kinetic properties of the remaining release, including single fusion events, were not different from controls. Concomitantly, mutant cells displayed a 10-fold reduction in morphologically docked LDCVs. Moreover, acute overexpression of Munc18-1 in bovine chromaffin cells increased the amount of releasable vesicles and accelerated vesicle supply. We conclude that Munc18-1 functions upstream of SNARE complex formation and promotes LDCV docking."

The molecular basis of the transition from proliferating precursors to immature differentiating neurons remains unknown. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating the differentiation of precursor cells of many lineages. Notch2 is specifically expressed in proliferating GNPs in the EGL. Treatment of GNPs with soluble Notch ligand Jagged1, or overexpression of activated Notch2 or its downstream target HES1, maintains precursor proliferation. The addition of GNP mitogens Jagged1 or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) upregulates the expression of HES1, suggesting a role for HES1 in maintaining precursor proliferation."

Studies have also documented local deviations from this first-order pattern of anisotropy on length scales ranging from 1 to 1,000 km (refs 3, 4). These observations, together with reports of the differential rotation of the inner core, have generated considerable interest in the physical state and dynamics of the inner core, and in the structure and elasticity of its main constituent, iron, at appropriate conditions of pressure and temperature. Here we report first-principles calculations of the structure and elasticity of dense hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) iron at high temperatures. We find that the axial ratio c/a of h.c.p. iron increases substantially with increasing temperature, reaching a value of nearly 1.7 at a temperature of 5,700 K, where aggregate bulk and shear moduli match those of the inner core. As a consequence of the increasing c/a ratio, we have found that the single-crystal longitudinal anisotropy of h.c.p. iron at high temperature has the opposite sense from that at low temperature. By combining our results with a simple model of polycrystalline texture in the inner core, in which basal planes are partially aligned with the rotation axis, we can account for seismological observations of inner-core anisotropy."

However, the mechanisms by which this spatial map is transformed into an odor code remain unclear. We examined this question in rat olfactory bulb slices in recordings from output mitral cells. Electrical stimulation of incoming afferents elicited slow ( approximately 2 Hz) oscillations that originated in glomeruli and were highly synchronized for mitral cells projecting to the same glomerulus. Cyclical depolarizations were generated by glutamate activation of dendritic autoreceptors, while the slow frequency was determined primarily by the duration of regenerative glutamate release. Patterned stimuli elicited stimulus-entrained oscillations that amplified weak and variable inputs. We suggest that these oscillations maintain the fidelity of the spatial map by ensuring that all mitral cells within a glomerulus-specific network respond to odor as a functional unit."
https://openalex.org/W2091697313,"In agreement with theories of sequence learning, hippocampal place representations expand asymmetrically during repeated route following. This behaviorally induced, experience-dependent expression of neuronal plasticity was blocked by the NMDAR antagonist CPP, suggesting that it may result from the temporal asymmetry and associative properties of LTP. NMDAR antagonism, however, had no effect on the range of the progressive shift of firing phase of hippocampal cells, relative to the theta rhythm, as the rat traverses the cell's “place field.” Thus, when place fields normally expand with experience, the relationship between firing phase and position is altered, as predicted by models that account for “phase precession” on the basis of asymmetry of synaptic connection strengths. These effects of CPP mimic changes that occur during normal aging, suggesting mechanisms by which sequence learning deficits may arise in aged animals."

We have used genetic and electrophysiological methods to demonstrate that NMR-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit, plays a role in the control of movement and foraging behavior. nmr-1 mutants show a lower probability of switching from forward to backward movement and a reduced ability to navigate a complex environment. Electrical recordings from the interneuron AVA show that NMDA-dependent currents are selectively disrupted in nmr-1 mutants. We also show that a slowly desensitizing variant of a non-NMDA receptor can rescue the nmr-1 mutant phenotype. We propose that NMDA receptors in C. elegans provide long-lived currents that modulate the frequency of movement reversals during foraging behavior."

At parallel fiber (PF) synapses in cerebellum, neuronal glutamate transporters and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have overlapping postsynaptic distributions suggesting that postsynaptic transporters selectively regulate mGluR activation. We examined interactions between transporters and mGluRs by evoking mGluR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (mGluR EPSCs) in slices of rat cerebellum. Selective inhibition of postsynaptic transporters enhanced mGluR EPSCs greater than 3-fold. Moreover, impairing glutamate uptake facilitated mGluR-dependent long-term depression at PF synapses. Our results demonstrate that uniquely positioned glutamate transporters strongly influence mGluR activation at cerebellar PF synapses. Postsynaptic glutamate uptake may serve as a general mechanism for regulating mGluR-initiated synaptic depression."

The cDNA probes for mouse SREBP-1, human SREBP-2, mouse spot 14, mouse fatty acid synthase, rat ATP citrate-lyase, mouse malic enzyme, and glucokinase were prepared by cloning reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products from mouse liver RNA into TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The corresponding bands were quantified by exposure of BAS 2000 to the filters to with BAStation software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Wild-type and IRS-2−/−mice were injected intraperitoneally once a day at 2100 h with control saline or leptin (10 mg/kg/injection) (PeproTech EC Ltd., London, United Kingdom), and daily body mass and food intake were monitored at 0900 and 2100 h (27Kubota N.

The statistical significance of differences in body mass and food intake between groups was determined using Student's t test (two-tailed). Leptin (50 mg/kg/injection) or control saline was administered to 6-week-old IRS-2−/− mice at 0900, 1700, and 0100 h. Body weight and food intake were monitored at 0900 and 2100 h. For the experiments of regulation of SREBP-1 gene by leptin, leptin (50 mg/kg/injection) or control saline was administered to IRS-2−/− mice at 0900 h, when fasting began, at 1700, and at 0100 h. Animals were sacrificed at 0900 h the next day by cervical dislocation. The liver was excised, frozen on liquid nitrogen, and maintained at −80 °C until it was processed further. During the course of experiment, we found that the amount of body fat per body weight was increased in IRS-2−/− mice (Fig.1A). The whole growth curve of wild-type and IRS-2−/− mice from 6 to 16 weeks old revealed that IRS-2−/− mice had gained more body weight after 8 weeks of age before the development of diabetes (Fig.1B). The proportion of the weight of epididymal fat to total body weight was significantly increased in IRS-2−/− mice at the age of 6 weeks before IRS-2−/− mice had more body weight gain than wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the serum leptin level was increased in IRS-2−/− mice (Fig.1C), suggesting that these mice were leptin-resistant. By contrast, epididymal fat weight as a proportion of body weight and the serum leptin level of IRS-1−/− mice did not differ significantly from the values in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, Aand C). To understand the molecular mechanism of the development of diabetes in IRS-2−/− mice, we performed an integrated gene expression study using liver samples. Total RNA was isolated from 16-week-old wild-type, IRS-1−/−, and IRS-2−/− mice and analyzed by murine 11K oligonucleotide microarray (Affymetrix). Among the ∼11K genes and expressed sequence tags analyzed, there was detected an increased expression of the two copies of the SREBP-1 gene in the liver from 16-week-old IRS-2−/− mice in the fasted states (Fig.2A). This result was surprising, because insulin reportedly up-regulates SREBP-1 gene expression whereas insulin-mediated intracellular signaling events, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, are decreased substantially in IRS-2−/− mice (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchim T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Takazawa K. Isogawa A. Suzuki R. Nakano R. Waki K. Hara K. Aizawa S. Noda M. Akanuma Y. Nagai R. Accili D. Kimura S. Taylor S. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and because euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study demonstrated insulin resistance in the liver in IRS-2−/− mice (33Previs S.F.

We also found up-regulated expression of several SREBP-1c target genes, including the spot 14, ATP citrate-lyase, fatty acid synthase, and malic enzyme, all of which are involved in fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 2B). All these findings were confirmed by Northern blot analysis. An enhanced expression of SREBP-1 with an unaltered expression of SREBP-2 in the fasted state (Fig. 2C), and the enhanced expression of its target genes, including the spot 14, ATP citrate-lyase, fatty acid synthase, and malic enzyme gene, in the fasted state was observed in IRS-2−/− mice (Fig. 2D). In addition, RNase protection assay revealed that SREBP-1c expression was up-regulated specifically in IRS-2−/− mice (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, the triglyceride content of IRS-2−/− mouse liver was elevated significantly (Fig.2E), confirming the physiological significance of an enhanced SREBP-1c expression in IRS-2−/− mice. By contrast, the cholesterol content of IRS-2−/− mouse liver was slightly reduced, consistent with unaltered SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 expression (21Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). Because SREBP-1 expression is reportedly induced by glucose itself (25Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. LeLiepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 26Shimano H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), we assessed the involvement of hyperglycemia in SREBP-1 gene induction in IRS-2−/− mice. First, we examined the expression of SREBP-1 in the liver of 6-week-old IRS-2−/− mice having normal glucose tolerance and found an elevated expression of SREBP-1 gene (Fig.3A). Moreover, a comparable increment in SREBP-1 expression was detected in female IRS-2−/− mice, which have better glucose tolerance than male mice (Fig. 3B). Thus, hyperglycemia may not be the cause of the SREBP-1 gene induction. Leptin resistance is known to be associated with an increased SREBP-1 gene expression (34Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To assess the leptin action in IRS-2−/− mice, we administered the low dose leptin to euglycemic 6-week-old IRS-2−/− mice with increased adiposity and hyperleptinemia (see Fig. 1). The daily intraperitoneal administration of leptin (10 mg/kg body weight per day) was sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight in the wild-type but failed to do so in IRS-2−/− mice (Fig.4A). Thus, IRS-2−/− mice were leptin-resistant even in the euglycemic stage. Next we examined the effects of higher dose leptin administration. We found that administration of a 50 mg/kg body weight dose to 6-week-old IRS-2−/− mice three times a day resulted in a significant decrease in food intake and body weight gain (Fig. 4B). Moreover, administration of the same amount of leptin into the fasted IRS-2−/− mice resulted in the amelioration of SREBP-1 overexpression (Fig. 4C). Thus, a high dose of leptin administration into leptin-resistant IRS-2−/− mice lowered the increased SREBP-1 expression in the liver. We have demonstrated an induction of SREBP-1c gene expression in the liver of diabetic insulin-resistant IRS-2−/− mice. This paradoxical finding prompted us to explore factors other than insulin that induced SREBP-1 gene expression in IRS-2−/−mice. We showed that leptin resistance contributes, at least in part, to the up-regulation of the SREBP-1 gene by demonstrating that high dose leptin administration not only reduced food intake and body weight but also ameliorated SREBP-1 overexpression in IRS-2−/−mice. Analogous situations were reported in ob/ob mice, lipoatrophic mice (35Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 36Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol.

Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), suggesting that leptin resistance is linked causally to SREBP-1 gene induction in liver. We observed further an up-regulated expression of SREBP-1 gene in goldthioglucose-treated leptin-resistant mice, 2M. Aoyama, K. Tobe, R. Suzuki, and T. Kadowaki, unpublished observation. indicating that leptin resistance in hypothalamus is involved directly in SREBP-1 gene induction in liver. How does leptin resistance contribute to increased SREBP-1c gene expression? As leptin reportedly increases glucose uptake and glucose turnover in peripheral tissues, thus decreasing glucose influx into the liver (37Kamohara S. Burcelin R. Halaas J.L. Friedman J.M. Charron M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), leptin resistance may provoke an increased glucose influx into liver. Because glucose influx into hepatocytes is one of the most important up-regulators of SREBP-1 gene (25Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. LeLiepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 26Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), an enhanced liver glucose uptake in leptin-resistant IRS-2−/− mice causes up-regulation of SREBP-1 gene expression, thus causing fatty liver. Our hypothesis that leptin resistance is the cause of SREBP-1 gene induction may explain why fatty liver is commonly observed among insulin-resistant over-nourished obese type 2 diabetes patients with relatively preserved insulin secretory function. SREBP-1 gene up-regulation may possibly contribute to ameliorating insulin resistance through bypassing the insulin requirement for energy storage by inducing lipogenic and glucokinase genes (22Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 23Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S.

Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Increased triglyceride content in the target tissue of insulin, which is the result of SREBP-1 gene up-regulation, was reported to be associated with insulin resistance. We speculate that SREBP-1 gene up-regulation with fatty liver development may be a kind of adaptive response in leptin-resistant over-nourished state, with liver taking up excess energy from blood flow instead of peripheral tissues. How does leptin resistance in IRS-2−/− mice develop? Ourin vitro study showed that lack of IRS-2 had little effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the isolated adipocytes of IRS-2−/− mice. 3S. Satoh, K. Tobe, R. Suzuki, and T. Kadowaki, unpublished observation. The almost normal insulin function in IRS-2−/− mice adipocytes may cause an increased glucose and lipid uptake by these cells in the presence of hyperinsulinemia, which was provoked by liver-insulin resistance in IRS-2−/− mice, and thus result in the enlargement of adipocytes. In accordance with the observation that adipocyte hypertrophy is associated with leptin resistance in the hypothalamus (38Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 39Marsh D.J. Hollopeter G. Huszar D. Laufer R. Yagaloff K.A. Fish S.I. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), the obese 6-week-old IRS-2−/− mice showed leptin resistance before developing diabetes (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). Alternatively, lack of IRS-2 may influence directly leptin signaling pathways in the hypothalamus, because leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 in the hypothalamus is attenuated in IRS-2−/− mice (40Burks D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2070163775,"We have investigated mechanisms in postendocytic processing of synaptic vesicles at hippocampal synapses, using synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) tagged with variants of the green fluorescent protein. Following exocytosis, VAMP is retrieved at synaptic and adjoining axonal regions. Retrieved VAMP-containing vesicles return to synaptic vesicle clusters at a rate slower than endocytosis. Vesicles containing a different protein, synaptophysin, recluster at a similar rate, suggesting common vesicular intermediates for the two proteins. Activity prolongs the time taken by endocytosed vesicles to return to synapses. Exogenous calcium buffers slow endocytosis but have no additional effect on the time course of reclustering. In contrast, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine does not affect endocytosis but slows reclustering. Finally, since VAMP can move freely on surface membranes, sustained synaptic activity leads to mixing of this vesicular component between adjacent synapses."

Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 20Vincent K.A. Shyu K.G. Luo Y. Magner M. Tio R.A. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Akita G.Y. Gregory R.J. Isner J.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2255-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), it is important to define the role of HIF-2α. In the present study, the endogenous role of HIF-2α in cellular survival was examined by targeted gene inactivation in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells deficient in HIF-1α (HIF-1α−/−) were generated previously (5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). TheHIF-2α targeting vector pPNT.HIF-2α (Fig. 1A) contained a 5′-flanking 3.5-kb HindIII/StuI fragment upstream of exon 2 and a 3′-flanking 7.0-kb fragment (a 2-kbNheI/BamHI fragment and an immediately downstream 5-kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment) downstream of exon 2. Culture and targeting of undifferentiated ES cells, including selection in high G418 and Southern blot analysis, were done as described (5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the HIF-2α gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Forward primer 5′-ACGGAACTCCAGGTCCCTTGTCGCTGC-3′ (exon 1) and reverse primer 5′-ACAGGAGCTTATGTGTCCGAAGGAAGC-3′ (exon 2) were used for RT-PCR to amplify a 531-bp HIF-2α-specific fragment. A 374-bpHPRT-specific fragment (internal control) was amplified by RT-PCR using forward primer 5′-GTCGCCCTCTGTGTGCTCAAGGGGGGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAACTTGTCTGGAATTTCAAATCCAAC-3′. Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (14Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monospecific polyclonal antibodies (PM 8) against murine HIF-2α were generated and purified previously using affinity columns (21Talks K.L. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

ES cells were seeded at low cell density (10,000 cells/35-mm culture dish) and cultured in medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 24 h. Afterward, ES cells were stressed in the same medium without leukemia inhibitory factor under normoxia (20% O2), hypoxia (0.5% O2), hypoglycemia (0% glucose or 6 mm 2-deoxyglucose), or after the addition of a mixture of cytokines (TNF-α (30 ng/ml), IFN-γ (5 ng/ml), and interleukin-1β (3 ng/ml)). Incubations were done at 37 °C under normoxia by maintaining the cells in 95% air and 5% CO2 or under hypoxia by incubating cells in a humidified sealed chamber gassed with 0.5% O2, 5% CO2, and 94.5% N2(AGA, Lille, France) at a flow rate of 30 liters/h. After incubation in normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h, ES cells were analyzed for apoptosis or used for immunoblotting. Apoptosis was measured by quantitative detection of cytoplasmic histone-associated oligonucleosomes or by counting TUNEL-positive cells as described (5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and p53 levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Stress cycle experiments were performed in a manner similar to that described by Graeberet al. (22Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). HIF-2α−/− ES cells were stably transfected by electroporation with a plasmid bearing the β-galactosidase gene (under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter) and the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (selection marker). Wild type (WT) ES cells were transfected with a control plasmid bearing only the selection marker. Transfected HIF-2α−/− and WT ES cells were cultured as single populations or mixed at different ratios (20:1, 1:1, and 1:20) in 10-cm culture dishes until 30% confluency was reached. Subsequently, culture medium containing 15% FCS was replaced, and ES cells were cultured in normoxia, hypoxia, or hypoglycemia (described above) for 20 h in medium containing 5% FCS. At the end of every cycle, stressed ES cells were allowed to recover for 4 h in normoxia/normoglycemia (medium with 15% FCS). Thereafter, ES cells were split, cultured until they reached 30% confluency, and challenged with another cycle of 20 h of stress. At every split, 300,000 ES cells were replated in a 24-well plate, subcultured for 24 h, and subsequently fixed with 2% formaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde. After staining for β-galactosidase as described (15Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), the percentage of HIF-2α−/− and WT ES cells in the mixed populations was quantified using the Scion Image 1.60c system (Meyer Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX). Gene expression of Glut-1, PGK-1, VEGF, Flk-1, Flt-4, and Tie-2 was quantified by Real Time RT-PCR, relative to the expression level of HPRT, using the following forward (F) and reverse primers (R) and probes (P), labeled with fluorescent dye (FAM or JOE) and quencher (TAMRA) as previously described (23Carmeliet P.

Targeted inactivation of a single HIF-2α allele (HIF-2α+/−) in ES cells was accomplished by homologous deletion of the second exon, encoding the basic helix-loop-helix domain, essential for DNA binding and dimerization of HIF-2α with HIF-1β to form a functional HIF2 complex (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 3Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B). HIF-2α−/− ES cells were obtained by selection of HIF-2α+/− ES cells in high G418. Functional inactivation of the HIF-2α gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, using monospecific antibodies against murine HIF-2α (Fig.1, C and D). Control immunoblots using antibodies against HIF-1α protein confirmed the residual expression of HIF-1α in HIF-2α−/− ES cells (data not shown). ES cell clones with a randomly integrated HIF-2α gene targeting vector and with two functional HIF-2α alleles (HIF-2α+/+) were used as controls (further referred to as WT). We have previously demonstrated that apoptosis of ES cells in response to hypoxia and hypoglycemia is mediated by HIF-1α via a mechanism involving up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 (5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). The role of HIF-2α in cellular apoptosis during hypoxia was compared with that of HIF-1α by measuring the number of oligonucleosomes (or TUNEL-positive cells; similar results; not shown), which are liberated during apoptosis. WT, HIF-1α−/−, and HIF-2α−/− ES cells did not undergo apoptosis under normal conditions (25 mm glucose and 20% oxygen; TableI). During hypoxia (0.5% O2) or hypoglycemia (0 mm glucose), apoptosis significantly increased in WT ES cells but, as previously reported (5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar), not in HIF-1α−/− ES cells (Table I). In contrast, HIF-2α−/− ES cells were refractory to hypoglycemia but, surprisingly, not to hypoxic stress (Table I). The role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in hypoxia and hypoglycemia was specific, because serum deprivation (not shown) and stimulation with Fas ligand (not shown) or a cytokine-mixture (IL-1β/IFN-γ/TNF-α) comparably stimulated apoptosis in WT, HIF-1α−/−, and HIF-2α−/− ES cells (Table I). When apoptosis occurred, protein levels of p53 (a mediator of genotoxic apoptosis, up-regulated during hypoxia) were up-regulated, whereas those of Bcl-2 (an apoptosis inhibitor) were reduced (Table I). These data indicate that, in contrast with HIF-1α, HIF-2α specifically induces up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 in ES cells under hypoglycemia but not under hypoxia.Table IApoptosis in WT, HIF-1α−/−, and HIF-2α−/− ES cellsNormoxia/normoglycemiaHypoxiaHypoglycemiaInterleukin-1β/IFN-γ/TNF-αOligonucleosomesWT45 ± 4320 ± 261-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).350 ± 321-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).370 ± 321-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).HIF-1α−/−37 ± 339 ± 541 ± 2370 ± 221-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).HIF-2α−/−44 ± 4331 ± 321-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).51 ± 8400 ± 511-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).p53WT0.14 ± 0.053.3 ± 0.11-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).2.9 ± 0.31-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).3.5 ± 0.51-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).HIF-1α−/−0.12 ± 0.070.13 ± 0.070.16 ± 0.033.6 ± 0.71-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).HIF-2α−/−0.18 ± 0.063.1 ± 0.31-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).0.18 ± 0.073.9 ± 0.91-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).Bcl-2WT120 ± 1521 ± 41-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).17 ± 11-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).37 ± 21-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).HIF-1α−/−120 ± 5120 ± 4130 ± 1331 ± 51-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).HIF-2α−/−130 ± 2738 ± 111-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).140 ± 1639 ± 51-aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) versus control (WT/normoxia).Data represent means ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Data represent means ± S.D. (n is 9–12) of the number of oligonucleosomes, the picogram amounts of p53 antigen, or the units of Bcl-2, all per 105 cells. To confirm the role of HIF-2α in the control of ES cell survival during hypoglycemia, we studied whether HIF-2α−/− ES cells would exhibit a survival advantage and become enriched over WT ES cells when both cell types were co-cultured in hypoglycemia. Therefore, HIF-2α−/− and WT ES cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:20 (5% HIF-2α−/− and 95% WT ES cells) (Fig.2A) and cultured for repetitive cycles of 20-h hypoglycemia or hypoxia alternating with 28-h normoxia/normoglycemia. To distinguish HIF-2α−/− from WT ES cells, the former were stably transfected with aβ-galactosidase gene (allowing easy detection after LacZ staining), whereas the latter were mock-transfected. Pools of HIF-2α−/− and WT ES cells were used to avoid clonal selection. When each of these cell types was grown separately in normoxia/normoglycemia, HIF-2α−/− ES cells grew slightly faster than WT cells (doubling time: ∼15 h for HIF-2α−/− cells versus 16 h for WT cells). However, when the mixture of both cell types was intermittently and repetitively challenged by hypoglycemia (20-h hypoglycemia followed by 28-h normoxia/normoglycemia), HIF-2α−/− ES cells became progressively enriched over WT cells, and after 13 cycles of hypoglycemic stress, WT cells were overgrown and absent from the culture dish as revealed by LacZ staining (Fig. 2, B, G, andJ). In contrast, intermittent hypoxia or normoxia failed to enrich LacZ-positive HIF-2α−/− ES cells within 13 cycles (Fig. 2, C, D, G, H, and I). Because of their slightly faster growth potential (see doubling times above), HIF-2α−/− ES cells ultimately also became enriched in hypoxia or normoxia/normoglycemia but only after many more cycles of hypoxia (n = 33) than of hypoglycemia (n = 13) (Fig. 2, G–J). This is not surprising considering the slightly faster intrinsic growth rate of HIF-2α−/− cells in normoxia/normoglycemia,e.g. any cell type with a slightly shorter doubling time will overgrow another more slowly growing cell population, even if the difference in doubling time is minimal. Importantly, however, enrichment of HIF-2α−/− cells required a comparable number of passages in normoxia and hypoxia, indicating that these cells had no survival advantage over WT cells under hypoxia. In contrast, under hypoglycemia, the enrichment of HIF-2α−/− cells occurred much faster than in normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig.2G), indicating that these cells indeed had a survival advantage over WT cells in hypoglycemic conditions. Similar results were obtained when different ratios of HIF-2α−/− and WT ES cells were mixed and challenged (not shown). Thus, the fast and progressive enrichment of HIF-2α−/− ES cells in hypoglycemia but not in hypoxia is consistent with their refractoriness to hypoglycemia-induced apoptosis and with the minimal involvement of HIF-2α in hypoxia-induced apoptosis. To examine whether HIF-1α and HIF-2α always had a distinct role in mediating the response to hypoxia and hypoglycemia, we determined by quantitative Real Time RT-PCR the expression levels of known HIF-1α target genes in ES cells under normoxia, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia. The role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in controlling gene expression was found to be dependent on the specific target gene (Fig.3). Similar to its role in regulating cell survival, HIF-2α controlled expression of the glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) in hypoglycemia but not in hypoxia, whereas HIF-1α up-regulated its expression in both conditions, consistent with previous findings (1Semenza G.L.

In contrast, expression of phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK-1) in hypoxia and hypoglycemia was only dependent on HIF-1α but not on HIF-2α, whereas induction of VEGF and Flk-1 transcripts was dependent on both HIF-1α and HIF-2α (Fig.3, A–D). The role of HIF-2α in hypoxic gene expression of VEGF (10Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1999; 93: 4284-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) confirms previous findings. HIF-2α induced expression of Flt-4/VEGFR-3 in hypoglycemia and hypoxia, whereas HIF-1α only up-regulated its expression in hypoglycemia. Expression of the endothelial receptor Tie-2 was not induced by hypoxia, but its up-regulation under hypoglycemia was more dependent on HIF-2α than HIF-1α (Fig. 3, E–F). Previous studies also observed that reporter gene expression under control of the Tie-2 promoter was only induced by HIF-2α but not by HIF-1α (9Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that HIF-1α and HIF-2α have differential and distinct roles in biological processes such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and glycolysis dependent on the particular target gene and stress condition. In conclusion, these genetic data indicate that HIF-1α and HIF-2α have distinct roles in the adaptation of the cellular response to deprivation of oxygen or nutrients. Whereas HIF-1α is involved in regulating the expression of both angiogenic factors (VEGF, Flk-1) and glycolytic enzymes (Glut-1, PGK-1), HIF-2α is more restricted to the regulation of angiogenic processes but is only minimally involved in glycolysis. In addition, this study provides evidence that HIF-2α may act more as a hypoglycemia than a hypoxia response factor in apoptotic processes. How HIF-2α is involved in the cellular response to hypoglycemia remains to be unraveled because HIF-2α protein does not accumulate during hypoglycemia, 2K. Brusselmans, F. Bono, P. Maxwell, Y. Dor, M. Dewerchin, D. Collen, J.-M. Herbert, and P. Carmeliet, unpublished data. suggesting that the latter condition activates HIF-2α via mechanisms distinct from those whereby hypoxia activates HIF-2α and HIF-1α (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Our data indicate that gene induction by either HIF-1α and/or HIF-2α may not only depend on the particular target gene but also on the type of stress. Because the expression pattern of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in vivo is distinct (9Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 10Ema M. Taya S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), gene induction by a particular HIF is likely to depend on the cell type. The role of HIF-2α in the cellular response to hypoglycemia might be significant for a number of biological processes and pathological disorders. For instance, hypoglycemia may cause congenital cardiac (26Smoak I.W. Reprod. Toxicol. 1997; 11: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and neural malformations (27Akazawa S. Akazawa M.

In preterm or small for gestational age infants, hypoglycemia causes cerebral damage and edema (28Traill Z. Squier M. Anslow P. Arch. Dis. Child Fetal Neonatal.

Non-coma hypoglycemia or stroke may also induce neuronal apoptosis (33Tkacs N.C. Dunn-Meynell A.A. Levin B.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because all these processes are characterized by glucose deprivation in tissues, known to express HIF-2α (10Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

https://openalex.org/W2104625557,"The mitochondrial isoform of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), the first step in glycerolipid synthesis, is up-regulated by insulin and by high carbohydrate feeding via SREBP-1c, suggesting that it plays a role in triacylglycerol synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed mitochondrial GPAT in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. When GPAT was overexpressed 3.8-fold, triacylglycerol mass was 2.7-fold higher than in control cells. After incubation with trace [14C]oleate (∼3 μm), control cells incorporated 4.7-fold more label into phospholipid than triacylglycerol, but GPAT-overexpressing cells incorporated equal amounts of label into phospholipid and triacylglycerol. In GPAT-overexpressing cells, the incorporation of label into phospholipid, particularly phosphatidylcholine, decreased 30%, despite normal growth rate and phospholipid content, suggesting that exogenous oleate was directed primarily toward triacylglycerol synthesis. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells that expressed a 4.4-fold increase in GPAT activity incorporated 9.7-fold more [14C]oleate into triacylglycerol compared with control cells, showing that the effect of GPAT overexpression was similar in two different cell types that had been transfected by different methods. When the stable, GPAT-overexpressing CHO cells were incubated with 100 μm oleate to stimulate triacylglycerol synthesis, they incorporated 1.9-fold more fatty acid into triacylglycerol than did the control cells. Confocal microscopy of CHO and HEK293 cells transfected with the GPAT-FLAG construct showed that GPAT was located correctly in mitochondria and was not present elsewhere in the cell. These studies indicate that overexpressed mitochondrial GPAT directs incorporation of exogenous fatty acid into triacylglycerol rather than phospholipid and imply that (a) mitochondrial GPAT and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase produce a separate pool of lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid that must be transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where the terminal enzymes of triacylglycerol synthesis are located, and (b) this pool remains relatively separate from the pool of lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid that contributes to the synthesis of the major phospholipid species. The mitochondrial isoform of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), the first step in glycerolipid synthesis, is up-regulated by insulin and by high carbohydrate feeding via SREBP-1c, suggesting that it plays a role in triacylglycerol synthesis.

Zhou Y.T. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Zhou Y.-T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Although obesity research has focused on the storage of calories that are ingested in excess of energy needs, the observation that mice null for diacylglycerol acyltransferase are resistant to diet-induced obesity suggests the possibility that, independent of energy intake or expenditure, the amount of triacylglycerol stored can be regulated biochemically (3Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese R.V.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). This remarkable observation further suggests that the synthesis of triacylglycerol can be specifically regulated and that regulation of the synthetic pathway could determine how much triacylglycerol is stored in cells. If this were true, enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis could provide targets for therapy. The pathway for triacylglycerol synthesis begins with the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate at the sn-1 position by glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)1 (EC 2.3.1.15), the committed step for the synthesis of all glycerolipids. After acylation by GPAT to form lysophosphatidic acid, LPA acyltransferase acylates the sn-2 position to form phosphatidic acid, which is then hydrolyzed to form diacylglycerol. Phosphatidic acid is the precursor for the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin, whereas diacylglycerol is the precursor for the quantitatively most prominent phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine, as well as for triacylglycerol. Most of the enzymes required for these synthetic steps are located in the endoplasmic reticulum, but LPA acyltransferase activity and a specific GPAT isoform are also located on the mitochondrial outer membrane (4Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, undergoes complex post-translational regulation by membrane lipid composition, subcellular location, and phosphorylation state (5Cornell R.B. Gross R.W. Advances in Lipobiology. 1. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1996: 1-38Google Scholar). It has been generally assumed that phospholipid synthesis is tightly regulated in accordance with requirements for membrane turnover and cell proliferation (6Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), but that the synthesis of triacylglycerol is controlled primarily by the amount of fatty acid available. Thus, triacylglycerol synthesis is enhanced only when fatty acid synthesis or uptake exceeds the cellular need for phospholipid synthesis. This view is supported by cell culture studies showing that when the concentration of media fatty acid is low, it is primarily incorporated into phospholipid, and when fatty acid concentration is high, the formation of triacylglycerol is greatly favored (7Rosenthal M.D. Lipids. 1980; 15: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Rosenthal M.D. Lipids. 1981; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of putative fatty acid transporters can increase triacylglycerol stores (9Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the view that triacylglycerol storage is unregulated is inconsistent with the observation that DGAT knockout mice remain slim on a high fat diet even though they are able to synthesize triacylglycerol by a DGAT-independent mechanism (3Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese R.V.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence that triacylglycerol synthesis is regulated also comes from studies of the mitochondrial isoform of GPAT, which is transcriptionally controlled by diet changes that promote or depress the synthesis of triacylglycerol. For example, carbohydrate feeding or high insulin concentrations increase liver GPAT mRNA, whereas fasting or lack of insulin down-regulates GPAT mRNA (10Shin D.-H. Paulauskis J.D. Moustaid N. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23834-23839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably via insulin-mediated regulation of SREBP-1c (11Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial GPAT mRNA is also elevated 12-fold in pancreatic β-cells from obese diabetic Zucker fa/fa rats, implying a role for triacylglycerol synthesis in the observed β-cell steatosis (13Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Acute GPAT regulation has also been reported in mitochondria; consistent with the need to decrease triacylglycerol synthesis and increase energy-producing oxidation in the face of limited nutrients, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside, a synthetic activator of AMP-activated kinase, the proposed sensor of cellular fuel deprivation, acutely decreases GPAT activity (14Muoio D.M. Seefield K. Witters L. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Despite these data suggesting that mitochondrial GPAT regulates triacylglycerol synthesis in cells, this hypothesis has not been examined directly. To determine whether mitochondrial GPAT plays a specific role in triacylglycerol synthesis, we created a stable cell line in which the expression of mitochondrial GPAT could be regulated. Silica gel G plates were from Whatman. [2-3H]Glycerol and [1-14C]oleic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Essentially fatty acid-free BSA, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and digitonin were from Sigma. Lipid standards were from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories. Tissue culture supplies were from Corning, and culture medium and ultrafiltered FBS were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. GPAT with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the C terminus was constructed by adding the FLAG coding sequence by polymerase chain reaction amplification in a two-step procedure. The plasmid pcDNA3.1 containing the entire GPAT open reading frame flanked by BamHI and XhoI sites was used as a template for the amplification. In the first step, the oligonucleotide (5′BamGPAT) ATCGCGGATCCACCATGGAGGAGT was used as the 5′ primer, and the oligonucleotideCATCATCATCCTTGTAGTCGAGCACGACGAAGCTGAGAATGTA (3′GPAT-F1), which adds 19 nucleotides encoding the FLAG epitope (shown in bold), was used as the 3′primer. The amplification product was used as a template for the second polymerase chain reaction step, using the same 5′ primer and the 3′ primer oligonucleotide CGCCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCATCATCCTTGTAGTCGAGCA (3′Xba FL2), designed to add the last 5 nucleotides corresponding to the FLAG epitope, a stop codon, and a XbaI restriction site. The resulting second amplification product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and inserted in the multicloning site of the plasmid pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1-GPAT-FLAG. Mlu1 and NheI sites flanking GPAT-FLAG were added by polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified GPAT-FLAG product was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pBI-EGFP-tet (CLONTECH), a bidirectional response plasmid that allows simultaneous expression of both green fluorescent protein and GPAT-FLAG under the control of a single tetracycline (doxycycline)-responsive element. CHO cells were cotransfected with the pBI-EGFP/GPAT-FLAG construct and a pTet-Off plasmid (CLONTECH), which expresses a hybrid protein and activates transcription in the absence of doxycycline. When doxycycline is present, neither GPAT nor EGFP are expressed. To establish the double-stable transfected cell line, CHO cells in 35-mm dishes were cotransfected with pBI-EGFP/GPAT-FLAG (1 μg) and pTet-Off (2 μg) using Transfast transfection reagent (Promega). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Positive GFP clones were identified under UV light microscopy and diluted into a 96-well plate. After continued selection with G418 for 6–8 weeks, lines were selected that expressed green fluorescent protein in 100% of the cells. Cells were routinely cultured in MEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (normal medium) at 34 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity, in the presence or absence of doxycycline (2 μg/ml) to repress or induce, respectively, GPAT overexpression. The medium was changed every other day. Transient transfection and immunocytochemical analysis of GPAT expression were performed as described previously (15Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with modifications. CHO K1 cells were trypsinized and seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes containing six to eight glass coverslips. The cells were incubated at 37 °C until 70% confluence and then transfected with cationic liposomes (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.) with pcDNA 3.1 vector alone or with pcDNA3.1-GPAT-FLAG. After 27 h cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 15 min with 0.1 μm Texas Red, a mitochondrial marker (Mito-tracker, Molecular Probes) in culture medium, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 2% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 5 μg/ml digitonin in buffer A (0.3 m sucrose, 25 mmMgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.8) for 5 min on ice, incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 60 min, washed with PBS, and incubated for 45 min with a 1/200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody: goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were then washed in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSH 210 fluorescence microscope equipped with excitation argon laser 488/514 to visualize cells stained with the Texas Red and FITC antibodies. Images were saved and analyzed using Photoshop v.5.5 and Image Processing Tool Kit to overlay multiband fluorescence images. CHO cells that had been grown continuously in either the presence or absence of doxycycline were washed with PBS, scraped into Medium 1 (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), homogenized with 10 up and down strokes in a Teflon-glass homogenizing vessel, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain total particulate (membrane) fractions. GPAT activity was measured with 10–40 μg of protein after incubation for 15 min on ice in the absence (total GPAT) or presence (mitochondrial GPAT) of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The 10-min assay at room temperature contained 2 mm [3H]glycerol 3-phosphate and 0.75 mm palmitoyl-CoA (16Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7681-7687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal GPAT activity was calculated as total activity minus N-ethylmaleimide-resistant activity. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was assayed using 1–5 μg of protein, 50 μmol of [14C]palmitic acid, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm CoA for 10 min at 37 °C (17Banis R.J. Roberts C.S. Stokes G.B. Tove S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DGAT activity was assayed using 5–20 μg of protein, 0.2 mm sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol, and 30 μm [3H]palmitoyl-CoA for 10 min at room temperature (18Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), washed extensively, and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). GPAT-FLAG protein was visualized by a reaction with Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. CHO cells (stably overexpressing GPAT) were seeded in 60-mm dishes, grown to near confluence in the continuous presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline, and incubated with either trace (∼3 μm) or 100 μm [14C]oleic acid (0.25 μCi/dish) in medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3.1-GPAT-FLAG or pcDNA3.1 (control) for 18 h, then incubated with trace (∼3 μm) [14C]oleic acid (0.25 μCi/dish) in medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA. At various time points, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 0.1% BSA in ice-cold PBS scraped in ice-cold methanol and H2O. Total lipids were extracted (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and concentrated in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator. Neutral lipids were resolved by TLC using a solvent system consisting of hexane:ethylether:acetic acid (80:20:1; v/v). Phospholipid species were separated by TLC in a one-dimensional solvent system of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:37.5:3.5:1.5; v/v). All samples were chromatographed in parallel with pure lipid standards. The 14C-labeled lipids were detected using a Bioscan Image System. Cell monolayers at 80% confluence were scraped from the dishes, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and disrupted by several passages through a 22-gauge syringe needle. Proteins from total membranes from GPAT overexpressing CHO cells and controls were separated in SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were performed using the corresponding polyclonal antibody against full-length (128 kDa) and mature (68 kDa) SREBP-1 and PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was used as secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Protein was measured using serum bovine albumin as the standard (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triacylglycerol was measured using a TGO-Trinder kit (Sigma), and phospholipid was measured by phosphate analysis (21Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distribution of [14C]oleate in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of phospholipids was examined by phospholipase A2 (Naja naja) (Sigma) hydrolysis of phospholipids labeled for 48 h with [14C]oleate as described previously (22Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Lipids extracts were chromatographed with hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1; v/v) to separate unesterified fatty acids from total polar lipids and counted in the Bioscan Image System. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Differences between the transfected cell lines and the controls were analyzed by Student’s t test. A stable Tet-Off CHO cell line was constructed that expressed both EGFP and mitochondrial GPAT with a FLAG-epitope at the C terminus. EGFP was used to ensure that every cell expressed the construct. When cells were grown in the absence of doxycycline, fluorescence microscopy showed expression of both EGFP and the GPAT-FLAG epitope in every cell; no fluorescence was observed when 2 μg/ml doxycycline was present (data not shown). Withdrawing doxycycline from the medium resulted in expression of GPAT protein at 6 days and a 3.3-fold increase in GPAT specific activity over the endogenous basal activity (Fig. 1). Adding doxycycline to the medium repressed GPAT activity and protein expression within 24 h, suggesting that GPAT protein is rapidly degraded (data not shown). A dose response showed that plasmid-mediated GPAT expression (ascertained by Western blot analysis of the FLAG epitope) was nearly completely blocked when as little as 0.05 μg/ml doxycycline was present in the medium for 24 h. To determine whether increased mitochondrial GPAT expression resulted in secondary effects on related enzymes of glycerolipid synthesis, we measured activities of microsomal GPAT, acyl-CoA synthetase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase in total particulate preparations from the Tet-Off CHO cells grown with (control) or without (GPAT overexpressing) doxycycline (Table I). Mitochondrial GPAT specific activity was 3.8-fold higher in the overexpressing cells compared with controls, but no changes were observed in the specific activities of the other enzymes.Table IGlycerolipid synthetic activities in control cells and cells that over-express mitochondrial GPATMitochondrial GPATMicrosomal GPATAcyl-CoA synthetaseDiacylglycerol acyltransferasenmol/min/mg proteinControl0.11 ± 0.010.85 ± 0.2211.0 ± 2.50.37 ± 0.03(+doxycycline)11%(89%)GPAT0.42 ± 0.09ap < 0.01 compared to control.0.62 ± 0.2610.7 ± 3.10.36 ± 0.01(−doxycycline)(40%)(60%)Mitochondrial GPAT, microsomal GPAT, acyl-CoA synthetase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in three independent total particulate preparations from cells that were grown continuously with (control) or without (GPAT) doxycycline.

Open table in a new tab Mitochondrial GPAT, microsomal GPAT, acyl-CoA synthetase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in three independent total particulate preparations from cells that were grown continuously with (control) or without (GPAT) doxycycline. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Numbers in parentheses represent the percent of total GPAT specific activity. GPAT-overexpressing CHO cells in medium without added fatty acid contained 2.7-fold more triacylglycerol mass than control cells (Fig. 2). When the cells were incubated with 100 μm oleate to stimulate triacylglycerol accumulation, both groups of cells increased their neutral lipid content at similar rates throughout the 24-h incubation time, but the mass of triacylglycerol was always greater in the GPAT overexpressing cells (3.1-, 2.2-, and 1.6-fold higher at 3, 6, and 24 h, respectively). Because the final steps in the enzyme pathway that synthesizes triacylglycerol are located in the endoplasmic reticulum, it was surprising to find that overexpression of a mitochondrial enzyme resulted in excess triacylglycerol content. Thus, we wondered whether GPAT might be overexpressed in an aberrant location that could provide LPA directly for triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Because the EGFP expressed by GPAT overexpressing CHO cells would interfere with FITC excitation at 488 nm, we studied CHO cells that had been transiently transfected with an identical GPAT-FLAG construct. Mitochondrial GPAT activity at 28 h after transfection increased from 0.14 to 0.86 nmol/min/mg of protein. Anti-FLAG indirect antibody staining recognized the expressed GPAT (Fig. 3 b) and matched the specific mitochondrial marker signal (Fig. 3, c and d). Both the cells transfected with the empty vector and those that had not been exposed to the first antibody emitted fluorescence in the FITC band only at background levels. Thus, FITC staining was not due to nonspecific binding of the anti-FLAG antibody to mitochondria. When the overlapping image (Fig. 3 d) was subtracted from the GPAT localization image (Fig. 3 b) using Boolean operator transformation, the resulting image was completely dark, indicating that GPAT was present only in mitochondria and not in other locations. Because GPAT-overexpressing CHO cells accumulated more triacylglycerol mass, we measured the ongoing rate of triacylglycerol formation in the absence of added medium fatty acid. Cells were incubated with tracer amounts (∼3 μm) of [14C]oleic acid for up to 24 h. Cells that overexpressed GPAT showed a significantly higher incorporation of [14C]oleate into triacylglycerol (2.7-, 2.5-, and 3.4-fold higher at 3, 6, and 24 h, respectively) compared with control cells (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of GPAT did not affect [14C]oleic acid incorporation into cholesterol esters (Fig. 4 B). Not only is GPAT the committed step for triacylglycerol synthesis, but it is also required for the synthesis of all the glycerophospholipids. Therefore we examined ongoing incorporation of low amounts of [14C]oleate (∼3 μm) into the different phospholipid species in the GPAT-overexpressing CHO cells and in controls (Fig. 5). At each time point up to 24 h, GPAT overexpressing cells showed 30% decreased incorporation of [14C]oleate into total phospholipids. [14C]Oleate-labeled phosphatidylcholine decreased 30–35% and [14C]PI plus [14C]phosphatidylserine decreased 40–50%, but [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine decreased relatively little (15%). Viewed as a whole, the control cells incorporated 4.7 times more label into phospholipid than triacylglycerol, but the GPAT overexpressing cells incorporated the 14C label equally into the two lipid species. With trace [14C]oleate plus 10% FBS (which contains 21–28 μm fatty acid (7Rosenthal M.D. Lipids. 1980; 15: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), the cells are exposed to medium that contains ∼30 μmfatty acid. Thus, the incorporation data are surprising, because normally with concentrations of media oleate of less than 30 μm, four to five times more label is incorporated into phospholipid than triacylglycerol, as occurred in the control cells. To enable radiolabel to be distributed equally in the two lipid fractions in fibroblasts, total media oleate concentrations must be greater than 60 μm (8Rosenthal M.D. Lipids. 1981; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Diminished incorporation of [14C]oleate into phospholipid could result from a decrease in the rate of phospholipid synthesis or because exogenously added fatty acids are incorporated preferentially into triacylglycerol rather than phospholipid. We examined these possibilities by comparing the rate of cell division of control CHO cells and CHO cells that overexpressed GPAT. The rate of growth was identical for the two cell types (Fig. 6), phospholipid content was 0.42, 0.34, and 0.28 μg/μg of protein in GPAT, control, and vector-transfected cells, respectively, and these differences were not statistically significant. Thus, phospholipid synthesis and accretion appeared to be unaffected despite the diminished incorporation of [14C]oleate. Because mitochondrial GPAT prefers saturated over unsaturated fatty acids, it has been hypothesized that one of the enzyme’s functions might be to direct the incorporation of saturated fatty acids into the sn-1 position of phospholipids (4Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To test this idea, GPAT overexpressing and control cells were incubated with [14C]oleate (∼3 μm). After 48 h total lipids were extracted and treated with phospholipase A2, which hydrolyzes the fatty acid at the sn-2 position of phospholipids. The [14C]oleate content of hydrolyzed (sn-2 fatty acids) and nonhydrolyzed (sn-1 acyl-lysophospholipid) was quantified. In both GPAT-overexpressing and control cells, 70% of the label was released, showing that there had been equivalent incorporation of oleate (30%) at the sn-1 position in control and GPAT overexpressing cells. This study indicates that a 3.8-fold increase in GPAT specific activity did not affect the positional distribution of a monounsaturated fatty acid.

https://openalex.org/W1976817149,"Differential targeting of neuronal proteins to axons and dendrites is essential for directional information flow within the brain, however, little is known about this protein-sorting process. Here, we investigate polarized targeting of lipid-anchored peripheral membrane proteins, postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43). Whereas the N-terminal palmitoylated motif of PSD-95 is necessary but not sufficient for sorting to dendrites, the palmitoylation motif of GAP-43 is sufficient for axonal targeting and can redirect a PSD-95 chimera to axons. Systematic mutagenesis of the GAP-43 and PSD-95 palmitoylation motifs indicates that the spacing of the palmitoylated cysteines and the presence of nearby basic amino acids determine polarized targeting by these two motifs. Similarly, the axonal protein paralemmin contains a C-terminal palmitoylated domain, which resembles that of GAP-43 and also mediates axonal targeting. These axonally targeted palmitoylation motifs also mediate targeting to detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes in heterologous cells, suggesting a possible role for specialized lipid domains in axonal sorting of peripheral membrane proteins.

An early step in this targeting decision tree involves a polarized sorting of proteins to either dendritic (postsynaptic) or axonal (presynaptic) domains. However, the mechanisms by which neurons target specific proteins to dendrites versus axons are poorly understood. Better characterized is protein sorting to apical versusbasolateral plasma membranes in polarized epithelial cells, which share certain features with axonal versus dendritic targeting in neurons (1Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 2Jareb M. Banker G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). That is, short cytosolic C-terminal protein-sorting motifs are one route for both dendritic and basolateral targeting (2Jareb M. Banker G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas specialized lipid rafts can mediate both axonal and apical sorting of certain transmembrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins (3Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The concept of specialized lipid rafts mediating polarized protein targeting emerged from observations that apical and basolateral cell membranes have different lipid compositions. Apical membranes are enriched in sphingolipids that aggregate with cholesterol to form packed raft-like domains within the fluid membrane bilayer. These rafts are insoluble in non-ionic detergents and, hence, are termed detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes (DIGs).1 These complexes form in the trans-Golgi network and incorporate certain transmembrane, GPI-anchored, and dually acylated proteins, which are then targeted to the apical plasma membrane (4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 5Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

The inhibition of DIG formation by sphingolipid or cholesterol depletion disrupts this apical/axonal sorting pathway (3Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) is a peripheral membrane protein that localizes exclusively to the PSD in hippocampal neurons and is believed to mediate the targeting and assembly of other synaptic proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors and signaling enzymes (8Hsueh Y.P.

Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), a 16-carbon-saturated fatty acid linked via thioester bonds to specific cysteine residues (13Dunphy J.T.

Dual palmitoylation of PSD-95 is necessary for appropriate postsynaptic localization (16Craven S.E. Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, not all dually acylated proteins are found at postsynaptic membranes; GAP-43 is a dually palmitoylated protein that occurs predominantly at axonal membranes (18Goslin K. Schreyer D.J. Skene J.H. Banker G. Nature. 1988; 336: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Both PSD-95 and GAP-43 accumulate in the secretory pathway in a palmitoylation-dependent manner (17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,19Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unclear how they sort to separate vesicles destined for dendritic versus axonal membranes. To elucidate mechanisms for axonal versus dendritic sorting of peripheral membrane proteins, we analyzed the polarized targeting of PSD-95 and GAP-43 in hippocampal neurons. We find that the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 is necessary but not sufficient for dendritic targeting, whereas the palmitoylation motif of GAP-43 is sufficient for axonal targeting. Systematic mutagenesis of these two palmitoylation motifs reveals that axonal targeting by the GAP-43 motif requires two adjacent cysteines as well as nearby basic residues, features that are conserved in other palmitoylated axonal proteins. Palmitoylation motifs that mediate axonal targeting also localize to DIGs in heterologous cells, indicating that lipid rafts probably mediate axonal targeting of certain cytosolic proteins. GW1 PSD-95, PSD-95(C3,5S), and PSD-95(1–26) fused to GFP were described previously (16Craven S.E. Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The mutations of the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95, the addition of the GAP-43 N-terminal palmitoylation motif to PSD-95, and the mutations within the GAP-43 palmitoylation motifs of the 43-PSD-95 chimera were constructed with oligos encoding the appropriate wild-type or mutated motif and restriction sites that were annealed and subcloned into GW1 PSD-95 GFP at a HindIII site upstream of the starter methionine and a silent KpnI site at amino acid 13 of PSD-95. The addition of the C-terminal prenyl-palmitoylation motif of paralemmin was added to the extreme C terminus of PSD-95(C3,5S) GFP with primers encoding the appropriate wild-type or mutated motif and restrictions sites, which were used to amplify the C-terminal GFP. Dr. David Sretavan (University of California, San Francisco) kindly provided wild-type GAP-43. Paralemmin was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from mouse brain RNA and subcloned into pEGFP (CLONTECH) at theBglII and HindIII sites. Neuronal cultures were prepared from the hippocampi of E18/E19 rats. Hippocampi were dissociated by enzyme digestion with papain followed by brief mechanical trituration. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-treated glass coverslips (12 mm in diameter) and maintained in neurobasal media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with B27, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine as described in Brewer et al. (39Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Hippocampal cultures were transfected by lipid-mediated gene transfer just before plating as described previously (20Kaech S. Kim J.B. Cariola M. Ralston E. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 2 μg of DNA and 10 μl of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-trimethylammonium-propane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were mixed in 25 μl of HBS and added to the cells (1 million cells/0.25 ml) with immediate and gentle mixing. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then plated at a density of 600/mm2 on glass coverslips (Fisher) in 24-well plates (Falcon). To visualize transfected cells, coverslips were removed from the wells and mounted live onto slides (Frost Plus slides, Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Transfection efficiency was never >0.01%, and on average, 15–30 transfected cells were obtained for each independent transfection. Coverslips were removed from culture wells and fixed in 4 °C paraformaldehyde for 15–20 min. The cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 Tris-buffered saline and blocked in Triton X-100 Tris-buffered saline with 3% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies against MAP-2 (monoclonal) (Pharmingen) or Thy-1 (MRC OX-7, Serotec) to stain dendrites or axons, respectively, were added to blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature followed by donkey anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Cy3 or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid fluorophores (diluted 1:200 in blocking solution) for 1 h. at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on slides (Frost Plus) with Fluoromount-G, and images were taken under fluorescence microscopy with a × 60 objective affixed to a Zeiss-inverted microscope. Quantification of polarized protein expression in dendrites versus axons was performed on 15–50 neurons from 2–3 independent transfections. Images of neurons were acquired with a charge-coupled device camera and quantitated using Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging). The exposure time of the camera was adjusted to limit photobleaching, so that the maximum pixel intensity was approximately one-half to three-fourths saturating for cells with low to moderate expression levels as determined by total pixel counts. Because high protein expression can saturate targeting mechanisms, cells expressing to pixel saturation were not included in the analysis. The degree of polarized expression was determined by calculating the average pixel intensity in the axon versus that in the dendrites. The axon was identified as the thin process extending farthest from the cell body and not immunoreactive for MAP-2. The average pixel intensity was calculated by drawing a line through three dendrites and three sections of the axon at defined distances from the cell body. These averages were then converted into a ratio of axonalversus dendritic expression (A/D ratio) and compared with that for diffusely expressed GFP. The A/D ratio represents the percentage of protein in the axon as compared with that in the dendrites, and because the volume of the axon is considerably smaller than that of the dendrites, the ratio is always <1. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons with Prism software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). For studies of palmitoylation, transfected COS-7 cells were labeled in media containing 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer containing TEE, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% SDS. After extracting for 20 min at 4 °C, Triton X-100 was added to 1% to neutralize the SDS, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the samples were then incubated with GFP antibodies (1:150 dilution, CLONTECH) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing TEE, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 1 mmdithiothreitol for 2 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For fluorography, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C for 3–5 days. Detergent-insoluble fractions were prepared as described previously with modifications (21Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (50 × 106) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. After extracting for 10 min at 4 °C, the homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) was overlaid on top, and samples were centrifuged for 18 h at 200,000 ×g in a SwTi 50 rotor (46,245 rpm) at 4 °C. Sequential fractions across the gradient were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using antibodies to caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and GFP (1:150 dilution,CLONTECH). PSD-95 and SAP-97 are highly homologous membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins, however, PSD-95 is restricted to postsynaptic sites in forebrain neurons, whereas SAP-97 occurs both pre- and postsynaptically (11Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To test whether this polarized sorting can be reproduced in cell transfections, we expressed GFP fusions of PSD-95 or SAP-97 in hippocampal neurons (Table 1). As shown in Fig.1, we find that PSD-95 is restricted to postsynaptic clusters in the dendrites, whereas SAP-97 occurs both in dendrites and axon. As PSD-95 is palmitoylated and SAP-97 is not, we asked whether differential lipid modifications of these proteins account for their differential sorting to axons versusdendrites. Indeed, we found that mutating the palmitoylated cysteines of PSD-95 to serine (PSD-95(C3,5S)) disrupts axon exclusion and causes the mutant to enter the axon. Conversely, appending the palmitoylated N terminus of PSD-95 to SAP-97 yields a chimera that is excluded from the axon (Fig. 1).Table ISummary of the chimeric constructs used in this studyPSD-95, full-length PSD-95 fused to GFP;PSD-95(C3,5S), the palmitoylation-deficient mutant of full-length PSD-95 fused to GFP;PSD-95(CC), full-length PSD-95(D2L,ΔL4) fused to GFP; PSD-95(T8R), full-length PSD-95(T8R) fused to GFP; PSD-95(CC-T8R), full-length PSD-95(D2L) deletion of L4-T8R fused to GFP; 43-PSD-95, N-terminal 11 residues of GAP-43 fused to Δ1–12PSD-95-GFP;43-PSD-95(CXC), N-terminal 11 residues of GAP-43 fused to Δ1–12PSD-95-GFP with an insertion of a leucine between Cys-3 and -4; 43-PSD-95(R6I,R7I), N-terminal 11 residues of GAP-43 with R6,7I fused to Δ1–12PSD-95-GFP;43-PSD-95(CXC-R6I,R7I), N-terminal 11 residues of GAP-43 with R6,7I fused to Δ1–12PSD-95-GFP with an insertion of a leucine between Cys-3 and -4; Par, full-length paralemmin fused to GFP; GFP-par, C-terminal 14 amino acids of paralemmin fused to GFP; PSD-95(C3,5S-par), C-terminal 14 amino acids of paralemmin fused to PSD-95(C3,5S)-GFP;C3,5S-par-palmitoyl, C-terminal 14 amino acids of paralemmin (C334,3366S) fused to PSD-95(C3,5S)-GFP; C3,5S-par-B, C-terminal 14 amino acids of paralemmin (amino acids 330, 331, 333, 335L) fused to PSD-95(C3,5S).

Open table in a new tab Figure 1Membrane-associated guanylate kinase palmitoylation is required for axonal exclusion. PSD-95 GFP in cultured hippocampal neurons clusters at synapses in the dendrites (PSD-95, green) and is excluded from the axon (arrow). Hence, all neurites that contain PSD-95 GFP are immunoreactive for MAP-2 (MAP-2, red). By contrast, SAP-97 GFP occurs both in dendrites and in the axon. A palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 construct (PSD-95(C3,5S)) occurs both in dendrites and axon, whereas a SAP-97 chimera containing the palmitoylated N terminus of PSD-95 (95-SAP-97) is excluded from the axon.

In schematic, the palmitoylation motif (P) is indicated by a striped box. Palmitoylated cysteines are in italics, and prenylated cysteines are in bold. Axons were unambiguously identified both by their morphology and by the absence of MAP-2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1). To quantitate the extent of axonal targeting, the average fluorescent pixel intensity of GFP fusions in the axon versus the dendrites were determined (A/D ratio) (see under “Experimental Procedures”) and compared with the A/D ratio of GFP alone. This analysis revealed that wild-type PSD-95 protein and 95-SAP-97 are excluded from the axon, whereas SAP-97 and PSD-95(C3,5S) are present in the axon to a similar extent as is GFP alone (Fig. 2 C). Whereas palmitoylation of PSD-95 is required for axon exclusion, not all palmitoylated neuronal proteins are restricted to dendrites. For example, dually palmitoylated GAP-43 predominantly localizes to axonal membranes (18Goslin K. Schreyer D.J. Skene J.H. Banker G. Nature. 1988; 336: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Given these different localizations, we asked whether the palmitoylation motifs play opposing roles in protein trafficking. To accomplish this task, we first replaced the dually palmitoylated N-terminal 13 amino acids of PSD-95 with those of GAP-43. The GAP-43 palmitoylation motif on PSD-95 (43-PSD-95) maintains palmitoylation and partially maintains postsynaptic targeting (17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the 43-PSD-95 chimera also dramatically targets to the axon, a localization not observed with wild-type PSD-95 (Fig. 2). Given the relocation of PSD-95 by the GAP-43 palmitoylation motif, we next assessed differential targeting mediated by these motifs. When the PSD-95 palmitoylation motif alone is fused to GFP, the A/D ratio of PSD-95(1–26) is not statistically different from GFP (Fig. 2). In contrast, the GAP-43 palmitoylation motif, fused to GFP (GAP-43(1–14)) though not exclusively axonal, is enriched in the axon compared with GFP alone (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 is necessary but not sufficient for axon exclusion, whereas the palmitoylation motif of GAP-43 is sufficient for axonal targeting. We considered the possibility that axon exclusion of PSD-95 may simply result from its clustering at postsynaptic sites. However, we find that the 43-PSD-95 chimera is both more postsynaptically clustered and more axonally localized than PSD-95(C3,5S), indicating that postsynaptic clustering and axonal exclusion are separable processes. To help to understand the constituents of the GAP-43 palmitoylation motif necessary for axonal targeting, we compared the sequences of the PSD-95 and GAP-43 palmitoylation motifs. The palmitoylated cysteines of the GAP-43 motif are adjacent, whereas those in PSD-95 are separated by a leucine. Strikingly, a PSD-95 mutant containing adjacent cysteines (PSD-95(CC)) is not exclusively dendritic; the protein also localizes to the axon though not to the degree of 43-PSD-95 (Fig.3). On the other hand, the addition of a single amino acid between the contiguous cysteines of the GAP-43 palmitoylation motif (43-PSD-95(CXC)) does not affect axonal targeting of 43-PSD-95, and the A/D ratio is unchanged (Fig. 3). These mutated constructs are all efficiently palmitoylated (Fig. 5), so changes in protein targeting are not attributed to alterations in protein palmitoylation. These results suggest that the spacing of the cysteines is important but is not the only feature of these motifs that determines targeting.Figure 5Palmitoylation of PSD-95 GFP fusion constructs. COS cells were transiently transfected with various PSD-95 constructs described in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the solubilized material was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to GFP. Immunoprecipitates were loaded onto duplicate gels that were analyzed for [3H]palmitate by fluorography (upper gel) or were immunoblotted for GFP (lower gel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additionally, the GAP-43 motif contains two basic amino acids that is one residue away from the palmitoylated cysteines, whereas the PSD-95 motif does not have basic residues near the cysteines. Remarkably, adding a single basic amino acid to PSD-95 two amino acids away from the cysteines (PSD-95(T8R)) redistributes the mutant to the axon with almost half the efficiency of 43-PSD-95 (Fig.3). Conversely, mutating the basic amino acids of the GAP-43 palmitoylation motif to isoleucines (43-PSD-95(R6I,R7I)) does not alter protein palmitoylation but reduces axonal targeting of 43-PSD-95 by approximately half (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the basic amino acids are critically involved but do not entirely explain the targeting differences between these motifs. Finally, we combined alternations in spacing between the cysteines and mutations in the basic amino acids. A PSD-95 palmitoylation motif with juxtaposed cysteines and the T8R mutation (PSD-95(CC-T8R) targets PSD-95 to the axon similar to 43-PSD-95 (Fig. 3). In addition, a GAP-43 palmitoylation motif both with cysteines separated and with mutations in the basics (43-PSD-95(CXC-R6I,R7I)) no longer targets 43-PSD-95 to the axon, but rather the protein localizes solely to the postsynaptic membrane similar to wild-type PSD-95 (Fig. 3). These results suggest that these two features account entirely for differential targeting by these domains. We next asked whether the adjacent cysteine/basic amino acid motif might play a general role in the axonal sorting of palmitoylated proteins. Paralemmin is a neuronal prenyl-palmitoyl-anchored protein that is found at axonal membranes (22Kutzleb C. Sanders G. Yamamoto R. Wang X. Lichte B. Petrasch-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J.

The C-terminal palmitoylation motif of paralemmin contains adjacent prenylated/palmitoylated cysteines and nearby basic amino acids and thereby resembles the lipidated domain of GAP-43 (Fig.4). GFP-tagged paralemmin is significantly targeted to the axon, similar to GAP-43. Furthermore, the isolated prenyl-palmitoylation motif of paralemmin fused to GFP (GFP-par) is sufficient for axonal targeting (Fig. 4), and the addition of this motif to the C terminus of palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 targets the chimera (PSD-95(C3,5S-par)) to the axon (Fig. 4). We next determined whether axonal targeting by the paralemmin motif requires similar features as the GAP-43 motif. Adjusting the spacing of the cysteines interferes with prenylation and subsequent palmitoylation (data not shown), so we were unable to assess the importance of cysteine residue spacing in protein trafficking. However, mutating the palmitoylated cysteines to serines (PSD-95(C3,5S-par-palmitoyl)) retains prenylation but blocks palmitoylation (Fig.5) and disrupts axon targeting (Fig. 4). In addition, mutations in the basic amino acids maintain lipidation but reduce axonal targeting, consistent with a requirement for nearby basic amino acids in axonal targeting (Fig. 4). Dually acylated proteins can be incorporated into DIGs, and these complexes have been implicated in targeting to axonal membranes (4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 7Ledesma M.D. Brügger B. Bünning C. Wieland F.T. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1761-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Winckler B. Mellman I. Neuron. 1999; 23: 637-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We, therefore, asked whether the palmitoylation motifs of GAP-43 and PSD-95 might differentially associate with DIGs. Resident proteins of DIGs float in sucrose gradients and are found in light membrane fractions together with α-caveolin (24Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). As previously published, only a small amount of PSD-95 associates with DIGs, and this is independent of palmitoylation (Fig. 6) (25Perez A.S. Bredt D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, the palmitoylation motif of GAP-43 efficiently targets a GFP reporter to DIGs (Fig. 6) (40Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28478-28485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as does the axonally targeted prenyl-palmitoylation motif of paralemmin (Fig. 6). Furthermore, when the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 is replaced with that of GAP-43 or paralemmin, these chimeras also associate with DIGs, whereas the 43-PSD-95(R6I,R7I) shows an intermediate degree of DIG partitioning (Fig. 6, and data not shown). Thus, there is a strong correlation between the ability of palmitoylation motifs to target proteins to DIGs and to axonal membranes. This analysis of polarized sorting of peripheral membrane proteins demonstrates that palmitoylation motifs can mediate either dendritic/postsynaptic or axonal targeting. Previous work shows that dual palmitoylation is necessary for targeting PSD-95 to postsynaptic membranes (16Craven S.E. Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We now find that palmitoylation is also necessary to exclude PSD-95 from axons, although the isolated palmitoylation motif is not sufficient for axonal exclusion. In contrast, the dually palmitoylated motifs of the axonal proteins GAP-43 and paralemmin are sufficient to mediate protein targeting to axonal membranes and, therefore, are the first identified axonal targeting motifs for peripheral membrane proteins. Differential sorting of the PSD-95 and GAP-43 palmitoylation motifs depend on two features, the spacing of the cysteine residues and the presence of nearby basic amino acids. The PSD-95 and GAP-43 palmitoylation motifs also differ in their capacity to associate with DIGs; PSD-95 is only faintly incorporated into DIGs, whereas the isolated palmitoylation motif of GAP-43 is sufficient for association with these complexes. These data suggest that the incorporation of peripheral membrane proteins into lipid rafts may mediate axonal trafficking. Whether dendritic sorting of PSD-95 results from active dendritic targeting or axonal exclusion is unclear. Interestingly, when axonally targeted palmitoylation motifs from GAP-43 and paralemmin are added to PSD-95, the resulting chimeras are not as polarized as their isolated palmitoylation motifs, nor are they as well associated with DIGs. These results suggest that additional dendritic targeting or axonal exclusion signals reside within PSD-95. Consistent with this finding, the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 is insufficient for dendritic targeting. Yet because unpalmitoylated PSD-95(C3,5S) is distributed similar to GFP, the expression of the dendritic targeting signal within the body of PSD-95 probably requires an association with membranes via palmitoylation. The identity of the additional region(s) of PSD-95 involved in dendritic targeting/axonal exclusion remains to be uncovered. In contrast to the absolute polarization of dendritically targeted PSD-95, axonally targeted constructs, such as GAP-43 and paralemmin, are also expressed in dendrites. These proteins are considered axonal because of their enhanced density in the axon compared with diffusely expressed GFP. Previous studies have also found that exogenous expression of axonal proteins often yields some protein in dendrites (30Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This dendritic expression may occur for a number of reasons, including inadequate axonal retention or missorting due to saturation of targeting mechanisms. Alternatively, dendritic localization may be explained by the presence of dendritic targeting signals and/or the absence of dendritic exclusion signals, as axonal proteins can also occur in dendritic/postsynaptic localizations (22Kutzleb C. Sanders G. Yamamoto R. Wang X. Lichte B. Petrasch-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 795-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that PSD-95 constructs containing GAP-43 or paralemmin palmitoylation motifs concentrate in the axon but also occur at the PSD. PSD-95 and related membrane-associated guanylate kinases display complex expression patterns that depend on the specific protein isoform and neuronal cell type. In hippocampal neurons, PSD-95 and PSD-93 are excluded from axons, whereas SAP-97 and SAP-102 occur both in axons and dendrites (17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As PSD-95 and PSD-93 are palmitoylated and SAP-97, and SAP-102 are not (16Craven S.E. Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), this differential targeting in vivomay reflect the lipid-dependent mechanisms as described here. Unlike its dendritic localization in hippocampal and other forebrain neurons, PSD-95 occurs prominently in axons of cerebellar basket cells (27Kistner U. Wenzel B.M. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4580-4583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, basket cells are unusual in that their axons are devoid of microtubules (28Matus A.I. Ng M. Jones D.H. J. Neurocytol. 1979; 8: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Axons of hippocampal and most other neurons contain plus end distal microtubules, and dendrites contain both plus and minus end-directed microtubules (29Baas P.W. Neuron. 1999; 22: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, dendritic localization of PSD-95 may reflect a selective association with minus end-directed microtubule motors that cooperate with palmitoylation to target PSD-95 into dendrites and to exclude PSD-95 from axons. Thus, the presence of PSD-95 in basket cell axons is potentially explained by the loss of microtubule-dependent axon exclusion. A recent study (30Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) has determined the axonal exclusion signal for a metabotropic glutamate receptor. This work shows that dendritic/axonal targeting of these transmembrane proteins relies on signals within their cytoplasmic C termini. By contrast, our analysis of palmitoylation-dependent sorting of peripheral membrane proteins implicates a role for DIGs. These complexes are rich in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol, and their formation in the secretory pathway is thought to serve as a sorting platform to direct proteins to the apical membrane of epithelial cells (4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Polarized sorting of proteins to axonal membranes has been compared with this apical sorting (23Winckler B. Mellman I. Neuron. 1999; 23: 637-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, an incorporation into sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts appears to mediate axonal targeting of the GPI-anchored protein, Thy-1 (3Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Ledesma M.D. Brügger B. Bünning C. Wieland F.T. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1761-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We find that dual palmitoylation motifs that associate with these rafts can also target proteins to axonal membranes. In contrast, the dual palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 is not incorporated into DIGs, and rather than mediating axonal targeting, it plays a role in dendritic targeting/axonal exclusion. To uncover a more direct relationship between DIG association and axonal targeting, we attempted to disrupt DIG formation using lovastatin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin to deplete cholesterol. However, this treatment did not affect axonal targeting of endogenous Thy-1, 2A. E. El-Husseini, S. E. Craven, S. C. Brock, and D. S. Bredt, unpublished results. suggesting that cholesterol depletion was not successful in our cultures. Both GAP-43 and PSD-95 are found in the secretory pathway (17El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where lipid rafts are first formed. And it is here that these two proteins may be segregated to separate secretory vesicles for transport to dendritic versus axonal membranes. The palmitoylation motif of GAP-43 can mediate lipid raft association for protein trafficking to the axonal membrane. Indeed, previous studies have found that GAP-43 is enriched in DIGs from brain homogenates (31Maekawa S. Kumanogoh H. Funatsu N. Takei N. Inoue K. Endo Y. Hamada K. Sokawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and is transported to axons on vesicles derived from the secretory pathway (32Ferreira A. Niclas J. Vale R.D. Banker G. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). On the other hand, signals within the body of PSD-95 working together with palmitoylation may mediate its association with dendritic targeting vesicles and its exclusion from rafts. Near its C terminus, PSD-95 possesses a tyrosine-based protein-trafficking motif that is sufficient to mediate protein endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and that is required for postsynaptic targeting (33Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20045-20051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As an exogenous axonally targeted lipid raft protein, influenza virus hemagglutinin is efficiently excluded from clathrin-coated endocytotic vesicles (34Bretscher M.S. Thomson J.N. Pearse B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4156-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,35Roth M.G. Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Adding an internalization motif to hemagglutinin induces endocytosis (35Roth M.G. Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Lazarovits J. Roth M. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and potentially blocks association with DIGs (37Lazarovits J. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Wang R.H. Fire E. Bird C. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,38Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBP J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Thus, the inclusion of PSD-95 in clathrin-coated pits may aid in its exclusion from lipid rafts. Alternatively, PSD-95 and GAP-43 may differentially associate with DIGs because different palmitoyl-transferase enzymes recognize their distinct palmitoylation motifs. Although such transferase enzymes have not yet been isolated, the sequence specificity for palmitoylation identified here suggests that this is indeed an enzymatic process. For instance, palmitoylation motifs similar to GAP-43 and paralemmin that contain adjacent cysteines with nearby basic amino acids may be recognized by a palmitoyl-transferase enzyme in thetrans-Golgi network followed by the incorporation into lipid rafts for axonal trafficking. In contrast, the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 may be recognized by a separate enzyme that is cytosolic or associated with membranes other than the trans-Golgi network, and thus PSD-95 is not incorporated into DIGs. Identification of the putative palmitoyl-transferase enzyme(s) that mediate palmitoylation of neuronal proteins will help to clarify these issues. Furthermore, elucidating how protein palmitoylation contributes to polarized trafficking may provide fundamental insights for understanding many different sorting decisions in the cell."

Early in development, long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) at one retinal input spreads to other unstimulated converging inputs on the same tectal neuron. As the animal develops, LTP induced by the same TBS becomes input specific, a change that correlates with the increased complexity of tectal dendrites and more restricted distribution of dendritic Ca(2+) evoked by each retinal input. In contrast, LTP induced by 1 Hz correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking is input specific throughout the same developmental period. Thus, input specificity of LTP emerges with neural development and depends on the pattern of synaptic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2024120786,"Mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL), a novel extracellular glycolipid from yeast, was found to inhibit the proliferation of mouse melanoma B16 cells in a dose-dependent manner and to induce the apoptosis of B16 cells at concentrations higher than 10 µm (Zhao, X., Wakamatsu, Y., Shibahara, M., Nomura, N., Geltinger, C., Nakahara, T., Murata, T., and Yokoyama, K. K. (1999) Cancer Res.59, 482–486). We show here that exposure of B16 cells to MEL (5 µm) for 2 days resulted in an increase of the levels of differentiation-associated markers of melanoma cells such as melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity, which were accompanied by morphological changes. The MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells at this concentration was closely associated with arrest of the cell cycle at G1 phase, but no significant population of apoptotic cells was identified. Expression of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) was enhanced after exposure of B16 cells to MEL for 48 h. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against the mouse gene for PKCα prevented MEL-induced melanogenesis in B16 cells. Conversely, the effects of the expression of a constitutively active form of PKCα mimicked the effects of MEL on B16 cells. These data suggest that MEL, a yeast-derived glycolipid, triggers the differentiation of B16 melanoma cells through a signaling pathway that involves PKCα.

A promising approach to the treatment of cancer involves the induction of the terminal differentiation and growth arrest of cancer cells. Because the discovery that polar organic compounds can induce the specific differentiation of erythroleukemia cells (1Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), a variety of reagents, including polar organic compounds, short-chain fatty acids, and retinoids, have been shown to induce features of differentiation in many lines of cancer cells, including melanoma cells (2Scher W.

Our ability to manipulate the phenotypes of neoplastic cells with these reagents provides us with ways to unravel the mechanisms that underlie cellular differentiation, as well as to develop potentially useful therapeutic reagents (7Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Cancer. 1984; 11: 2766-2769Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Melanoma is well known as a chemotherapy-resistant cancer (8Koh H.K. New Eng. J. Med. 1991; 325: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that melanoma might be a suitable target for therapy with differentiation-inducing agents (9Spremulli E.N. Dexter D.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1984; 2: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL),1 a novel extracellular glycolipid produced by yeast, induces the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and alters the composition of cell surface glycosphingolipids (GSLs) (10Isoda H. Shinmoto H. Kitamoto D. Matsumura M. Nakahara T. Lipids. 1997; 32: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Gangliosides and GSLs, which are ubiquitous constituents of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, play an important role in the modulation of cellular proliferation, oncogenesis and differentiation (11Hannum Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 12Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Cellular differentiation and oncogenic transformation are accompanied by dramatic changes in both absolute and relative levels of GSLs (13Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Adv. Lipid Res. 1992; 25: 147-162Google Scholar). Yeast-derived glycolipids differ from those derived from mammalian cells in terms of specific substituents, but their backbones are similar. We postulated that MEL might affect other tumor cells, in addition to inducing the cellular differentiation of HL-60 cells. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the induction of the differentiation of melanoma cells are poorly understood. However, there is evidence that protein kinase C (PKC) might be associated with such differentiation. PKCs form a multigene family of serine- and threonine-specific kinases. They appear to play roles in a wide variety of cellular processes that include the functions of some membrane receptors, and the proliferation and differentiation of cells (14Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar, 15Blumberg P.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parkers P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). PKCα is expressed ubiquitously, while PKCβ is found only in some tissues, and PKCγ appears to be restricted almost exclusively to brain tissue (14Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). Such distribution suggests possible functional differences among these enzymes. PKC is associated with the differentiation that is induced by retinoic acid (RA), by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and by dehydroepiandrosterone in cell lines such as F9 teratocarcinoma cells and melanoma cells (17Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ao Y. Fernandez E. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Kindregan H.C. Rosenbaum S.E. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol.

For example, increased expression of PKCα plays a key role in the RA-triggered differentiation of melanoma cells (20Niles R. Loewy B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4483-4487PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gruber J. Ohno S. Niles R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while PKCβ appears to be critical for the regulation of melanogenesis in both human melanocytes and S91 mouse melanoma cells (17Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ao Y. Fernandez E. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the roles of the isoforms of PKC appear to depend on the cell type. Specific activators and inhibitors of PKC have proved useful in attempts to analyze the effects of PKC on various transformation processes. However, such compounds do not discriminate between isozymes. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) and ribozymes are more suitable for studies of the roles of individual isoforms. In this study, we evaluated the physiological effects of MEL on B16 melanoma cells and found that MEL induced cell cycle arrest and the differentiation of the cells in culture. We showed that PKCα was involved in this induced differentiation by using an AS-ODN that was specific to mouse PKCα, as well as by inducing the expression of a constitutively active form of PKCα in B16 cells. Mouse melanoma B16 4A5 cells (referred to hereafter as B16 cells) were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or in serum-free DMEM-ITES (DMEM plus insulin, transferrin, ethanolamine, and selenite) medium, as described elsewhere (23Zhao X. Wakanatsu Y. Shibahara M. Nomura N. Geltinger C. Nakahara T. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 482-486PubMed Google Scholar), at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. MEL was prepared and purified essentially as described by Kitamotoet al. (24Kitamoto D. Akiba S. Hioki T. Tabuchi T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 31-36Google Scholar), and administered to cells at the indicated concentrations. A WST-1 cell counting kit (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used to monitor the number of viable cells. RA, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and dexamethasone were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The methods used for measurements of melanin content and tyrosinase activity and the flow cytometric analysis of cultures of B16 cells have been described elsewhere (23Zhao X. Wakanatsu Y. Shibahara M. Nomura N. Geltinger C. Nakahara T. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 482-486PubMed Google Scholar, 25Johnston D. Orlow S. Levy E. Bystryn J.C. Exp. Cell.

Melanin content was measured at an absorbance of 490 nm, and the concentration of melanin was calibrated with synthetic melanin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Untreated and MEL-treated B16 cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Chemical Co.; 25 µg/ml), aprotinin (Sigma Chemical Co.; 30 µl/ml) and sodium orthovanadate (Sigma Chemical Co.; 1 mm) at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates were collected and crude samples of protein were purified as described by Wessel et al. (26Wessel D. Flugge U. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of samples were determined by the Bradford method using delipidated albumin (Sigma Chemical Co.) as the standard (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For Western blotting analysis of PKCs, equal amounts of samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal antibodies specific to PKCα, PKCβ1, PKCβ2, PKCγ, PKCδ, PKCε, PKCζ and PKCη (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or polyclonal antibodies against PKCα (Promega Co., Madison, WI). The products of immunoreactions were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After collection of cell lysates in RIPA buffer, samples were precleared with Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) at 4 °C for 15 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and samples were then incubated with polyclonal antibodies specific for PKCα (Promega Co.) at 4 °C for 1 h. After addition of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads, mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were then washed three times with RIPA buffer and suspended in kinase assay buffer for measurment of PKC activity in vitro, using a PKC assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). In brief, 10 µl of substrate mixture (500 µm PKC substrate peptide) were mixed with 10 µl of a solution of protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, 10 µl of a solution of PKC lipid activator (phosphatidylserine and diglyceride) and 10 µl of the prepared enzyme in a microcentrifuge tube. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 µl of a solution of ATP that contained [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol). The mixture was agitated gently and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by removal of 25 µl of the reaction mixture and placing it in the center of a piece of P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). After 30 s, the paper was immersed in 0.75% phosphoric acid. After washing, the paper was soaked in acetone for 2 min and then transferred to a 5-ml scintillation vial. A scintillation mixture was added and the radioactivity on the paper was measured in a scintillation counter. B16 cells were cultured under normal conditions until they reached a 70–80% confluence. Then cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and incubated in a mixture of AS-ODN or S-ODN or control oligodeoxynucleotides (Tsukuba Research Laboratory, Toagosei Co., Tsukuba, Japan) and the LipofectAMINETMreagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in OPTI-MEMI reduced-serum medium reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4–5 h. The AS-ODN and the LipofectAMINETM reagent were then removed, and cells were cultured in normal medium for the indicated times. Cells were used for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting of PKC, and Northern blotting analysis. Total RNA was isolated from target cells using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then 25 µg of total RNA from each sample was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel that contained 2.2 m formaldehyde and bands of RNA were transferred to a Hybond-NTM filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Northern blotting analysis, filters were incubated in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 65 °C for 30 min before hybridization with a 32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes for mouse PKC isoforms or rat β-actin at 65 °C for 18 h. Filters were washed with 0.2× SSC plus 0.5% SDS for 10 min and then exposed to RX-film (Fuji Film; Tokyo, Japan) with an intensifying screen. Before rehybridization, filters were treated with a solution of boiling 0.5% SDS for 10 min. B16 cells were cultured under normal conditions to 70–80% confluence. Then cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands), which harbored a gene for neomycin resistance, and the pEFHisB expression vector (Invitrogen BV) that encoded a His tag-fused constitutively active form of PKCα (28Ueda Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) by calcium precipitation, as described elsewhere (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with pcDNA3 only. After transfection, cells were plated on medium that contained 500 µg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones of resistant cells were selected and stable colonies were examined with monoclonal antibodies against the His tag (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) for immunoprecipitation and polyclonal antibodies specific for PKCα for Western blotting. Selected cells were routinely grown in the presence of selective pressure from G418. We investigated the effects of MEL on the differentiation induction of B16 cells by examining the effects of MEL on the production of melanin and tyrosinase activity, which are markers of the differentiation of melanoma cells (30Niles R.M. Makarski J.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1978; 61: 523-526PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lotan R. Stolarsky T. Lotan D. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2868-2875PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1A shows the melanin content of B16 cells after culture for 2 days. The amount of melanin in untreated cells was 0.10 ± 0.02 µg/µg of protein, while that in 5 µm MEL-treated cells was 0.18 ± 0.02 µg/µg of protein. RA, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and dexamethasone were used as positive controls because each has been reported to induce the differentiation of melanoma cells (32Nordenberg J. Wasserman L. Beery E. Aloni D. Malik H. Stenzel K.H. Novogrodsky A. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 162: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Niles R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1987; 23: 803-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Kim D.G. Kim H.Y. Kim M.Y. Lee M.Y. You K.R. Pigment Cell Res. 1998; 11: 142-150Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with Me2SO and with dexamethasone resulted in the enhanced production of melanin. However, RA did not induce significantly enhanced melanogenesis. The tyrosinase activity of B16 cells that had been treated with 5 µm MEL for 2 days was 6-fold greater than that of untreated cells (Fig.1 B). These results indicate that MEL enhanced tyrosinase activity, with resultant increased melanogenesis, and suggest that B16 cells undergo differentiation upon treatment with MEL. When added to the reaction mixture directly, MEL had no detectable effect on tyrosinase activity (data not shown). The morphology of untreated B16 cells (Fig. 1 C) was typical of that of mouse melanoma cells in culture. The cells resembled fibroblasts and were often clumped together. On the second day of cultivation, B16 cells exposed to 5 µm MEL extended dendrites and arranged themselves alongside one another (Fig.1 D), suggesting that cellular differentiation had occurred also at a morphological level. We next examined whether the MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells might be accompanied by effects on the cell cycle. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, flow cytometry revealed that populations of cells exposed to 5 µm MEL for 2 days showed a significant decrease in the relative number of cells in the S phase as compared with untreated cells (from 33.6 to 11.1%) and a marked increase in the relative number of cells in the G1 phase (from 57.0 to 80.8%), while there was little change in the cell population in the G2/M phase (from 6.2 to 5.9%). Thus, the effects of MEL on the differentiation-induction of B16 cells can be attributed, at least in part, to the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1phase. Cultures of B16 cells exposed to 5 µm MEL showed no significant increase in the relative number of apoptotic cells, as compared with untreated cells (see Fig. 2, C andD). As an intracellular calcium-dependent and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, PKC has been implicated as a key messenger in the cellular signaling associated with the proliferation and differentiation of cells (14Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar, 15Blumberg P.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parkers P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In an attempt to obtain insight into the molecular pathways that lead to cellular differentiation in response to MEL, we examined whether MEL might influence the expression of PKC. We cultured cells in the presence and in the absence of MEL for the indicated periods of time and harvested them. Then we performed Western blotting analysis to compare relative levels of expression of PKCα. PKCα protein was almost undetectable in MEL-treated and in untreated B16 cells after cultivation for 3 h. After further cultivation, for up to 24 h, there was an increase in the expression of PKCα in both MEL-treated and untreated B16 cells and the increases were time-dependent. There was, moreover, no obvious difference between the levels of PKCα in the two types of culture. However, the expression of PKCα in untreated cells decreased markedly at 48 h, while MEL-treated cells continued to display high-level expression of PKCα (Fig.3A). The level was ∼2.3-fold higher than that in untreated cells, as determined by densitometric scanning. The enzymatic activities of PKCα during the incubation of cells with MEL were also measured and have a good correlation with the expression levels of PKCα protein (Fig. 3 B). Neither PKCβ, PKCγ, nor PKCη were detected in MEL-treated or in untreated cells and the levels of PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ were not significantly altered (see Fig. 5D). These results suggest that PKCα-related pathways might possibly be involved in a MEL-triggered signal pathway in B16 cells.Figure 5An AS-ODN perturbed the expression of PKC α and prevented MEL-induced melanogenesis. A, Western blotting analysis of PKCα. B16 cells were transfected with the indicated AS-ODN or with ODN N23 (200 nm each). After 48 h, cell lysates (20 µg) were separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal antibodies against PKCα. Cells exposed only to the LipofectAMINETM reagent were used as controls. Results from one of three similar expriments were shown. Lane 1, control;lane 2, random ODN N23; lane 3, AS-ODN no. 3642;lane 4, AS-ODN no. 3643; lane 5, AS-ODN no. 3644; and lane 6, AS-ODN no. 3645. B, Western blotting analysis of the effect of S-ODN (200 nm) on the expression of PKCα as described in A. Lane 1, control;lane 2, S-ODN no.3846; lane 3, AS-ODN no. 3642; and lane 4, S-ODN no. 3449. C, Northern blotting analysis of mRNA for PKCα. B16 cells were cultured with 200 nm AS-ODN no. 3642 or S-ODN no. 3846 and total RNA was isolated on day 1 or day 2. Approximately 25 µg of total RNA was loaded per lane and allowed to hybridize with a labeled cDNA probe for mouse PKCα. Probing for the mRNA for mouse β-actin ensured equal loading of the respective RNAs. The upper film was developed for 26 h and the lower film was developed for 5 h. D, The AS-ODN did not change the levels of expression of other isoforms of PKCs. Western blotting analysis of isoforms of PKC was indicated. Parent B16 cells were incubated in the presence (lane 2) or absence (lane 1) of MEL as well as 200 nm of AS-ODN for 48 h (lane 3), and the expression level of proteins encoding PKCβ1, PKCβ2, PKCγ, PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, and PKCζ were measured. E, assay of PKC activity in vitro. After incubation of cells under the indicated conditions for 2 days, 20 µg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against PKCα. An assay of the kinase activity of immunocomplexes was performed with a specific peptide as the substrate (see text). F, cells treated under the same conditions as in E were analyzed for the production of melanin. Data in E and F are mean results of three independent experiments. Bar shows S.D.

Original magnification: × 250.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the possible relationship between the MEL-triggered differentiation of B16 cells and enhancement of the expression of PKCα, we introduced phosphorothioate AS-ODNs targeted to the mouse gene for PKCα into B16 cells to suppress the expression of PKCα. We used AS-ODNs with sequences that should be specific to the mRNA for PKCα. As shown in Fig. 4, we selected four AS-ODNs directed toward the mRNA for PKCα. To examine the effects of nonspecific suppression by AS-ODNs, we also used a random 23-mer ODN (N23) as a control. B16 cells were exposed to the various AS-ODNs (200 nm) during cultivation. In the case of the four AS-ODNs specific for PKCα, no. 3642 was the most effective in reducing the level of PKCα protein, and it reduced the level to at least 10-fold lower than that in B16 cells treated with N23 (200 nm) and that in untreated cells (Fig.5 A). The AS-ODNs against other target sequences in the mRNA for PKCα did not cause such a significant decrease in the level of PKCα itself. We also examined the effects of sense (S)-ODNs corresponding to nt 960–981 and nt 2636–2659 of PKCα mRNA and found no decrease in the levels of PKCα (Fig. 5 B). We next examined the effects of AS-ODN on the level of PKCα mRNA in B16 cells by Northern blotting. Two transcripts of the gene for PKCα were identified with sizes of 10.8 and 3.8 kilobase. The level of PKCα mRNA was dramatically reduced in B16 cells that had been treated with AS-ODN no. 3642 (Fig.5 C). Incubation of B16 cells with S-ODN (no. 3846, 200 nm) had no detectable effect on the level of mRNAs for PKCα (Fig. 5 C). The introduction of AS-ODNs or S-ODNs did not change the levels of the expression of other PKCs (Fig.5 D). No expression of PKCβ1, PKCβ2, PKCγ, and PKCη was detected in B16 cells. The relative levels of other PKC families such as PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ were not changed. Thus, an AS-ODN specific for a target site in PKCα transcripts suppressed the expression of PKCα in a sequence-specific manner. We next performed an assay of PKCα activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5 E, treatment with 5 µm MEL for 2 days stimulated the phosphorylation activity of PKCα, which reached a level that was 2.5-fold higher than the level in untreated control cells. This result was consistent with the MEL-induced enhancement of the expression of PKCα (Fig. 3). Exposure of B16 cells to AS-ODN no. 3642 resulted in a clear decrease in PKC activity, while S-ODN no. 3846 had only a minimal effect (Fig. 5 E). We then tested whether B16 cells that lacked PKCα could still respond to MEL. As shown in Fig. 5 F, B16 cells treated with 5 µm MEL for 2 days produced more than double the amount of melanin, as compared with the control cells. However, cells exposed to both MEL and AS-ODN no. 3642 exhibited no increase in melanogenesis. B16 cells treated with S-ODN resembled control B16 cells, in terms of the response to MEL (Fig. 5, F and G). These results indicated that PKCα plays a critical role in the MEL-induced differentiation of B16 melanoma cells. We noticed that the morphology of B16 cells incubated with AS-ODN or S-ODN changed slightly. We observed more round-shaped cells in both cases, as compared with the untreated B16 cells (Fig. 5 G, panels a–c); however, the number of the melanin- stained cells (see black cells inpanels d–f) was significantly reduced after treatment with AS-ODN as compared to S-ODN (panel C). Although we do not know the exact reason for more round-phenotyped cells appearing in the case of AS-ODN or S-ODN as compared with the control cells, this might be caused by the nonspecific effect of oligodeoxynucleotides, because AS-ODN, S-ODN, and N23 resulted in similar changes in the morphology of the cells. However, in terms of the production of melanin, both cases exhibited similar levels to untreated B16 cells (Fig. 5 F). We introduced the pEFHisB expression vector that included a His tag-fused and constitutively active form of PKCα (28Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), which had point mutations at amino acid residues 22 and 25, into B16 cells. We selected positive stable clones of B16 cells and evaluated two representative clones, Aα13–1 and Aα13–4, for the expression of the exogenous gene for PKCα (Fig. 6A). B16 cells that expressed the constitutively active form of PKCα (Aα13-4) had a constitutively high level of melanin (Fig.6 B), which resembled the MEL-triggered melanogenesis in B16 cells. It has also been found that exogenous expression of the constitutively active form of PKCα has no detectable effect on the expression of PKCβ1, PKCβ2, PKCγ, and PKCη (no expression) and the expression of PKCδ and PKCε was not significantly changed (Fig.6 C). The results indicate that PKCα is closely associated with the differentiation of B16 melanoma cells. Taken together with the results in Fig. 6, these data indicate that PKCα plays a key role in the MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells. Aα13-4 cells also proliferated at a lower rate than the parent B16 cells (Fig.6 D). This result was consistent with the results in Fig.6 B, which showed that Aα13-4 cells had a greater potential for spontaneous differentiation than the parent cells. However, Aα13-4 cells were less susceptible to MEL in terms of the induction of melanogenesis than the parent B16 cells (data not shown). The reason for this phenomenon remains to be determined. It is possible that, once PKCα has reached a threshold level for commitment to cellular differentiation, further expression of PKCα has no additional effect on the induction of the differentiation of B16 cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of MEL on B16 melanoma cells. MEL at 5 µm inhibited the proliferation of B16 cells and stimulated both tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis, with accompanying arrest of the cell cycle at the G1 phase and morphological alterations (Figs. 1 and 2). All of these results suggest that MEL induced arrest of the cell cycle and the differentiation of cells. To our knowledge, there have been no other reports of the induction of the differentiation of melanoma cells by an extracellular microbial glycolipid. We examined the MEL-triggered signaling pathway in B16 cells, focusing on protein kinase C, which has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation (35Hirai S.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis demonstrated that PKCα, PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ were the isoforms of PKC expressed in B16 cells (Fig. 5, A, B, and D). We did not detect the expression of PKCβ1, PKCβ2, PKCγ, and PKCη (Fig.5 D). Other groups have reported that only the mRNAs for PKCε and PKCζ can be detected in B16 cells, with the level of each transcript being extremely low (38Mahalingam H. Vaughn J. Novotny J. Gruber J. Niles R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Exposure of B16 cells for 48 h to 5 µm MEL, which was the optimal concentration for induction of differentiation, resulted in enhanced expression of PKCα, at a level that was ∼2.3-fold higher than the level in untreated cells (Fig. 3 A). In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism of the MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells, we introduced AS-ODNs specific for PKCα mRNA into B16 cells. Several AS-ODNs inhibited the expression of PKCα to a varying degree and counteracted MEL-induced melanogenesis (Figs. 4 and 5). Furthermore, the results of the expression of a constitutively active form of PKCα mimicked the results of the stimulation of B16 cells by MEL (Fig. 6). These results strongly suggest that PKCα plays a critical role in the MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells. Several studies have demonstrated that PKC plays an important role in the growth and progression of certain tumors. For example, in the case of B16-F1 melanoma cells, clones that overexpressed PKCα have prolonged doubling times and increased melanin production. These phenotypic characteristics are also observed during the RA-induced differentiation of melanoma cells (21Gruber J. Ohno S. Niles R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been also reported that PKCα is necessary and sufficient to increase progression through the up-regulation of p21Cip1 in glioma cells (39Ways D.K. Kukoly C.A. deVente J. Hooker J.L. Bryant W.O. Posekany K.J. Fletcher D.J. Cook P.P. Parker P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). By contrast, the exogenously expressed PKCα in MCF-7 breast cancer cells leads to a more aggressive neoplastic phenotype, and cells exhibit an enhanced rate of proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and increased tumorigenicity in nude mice (40Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Expression after transfection of PKCβ1 and PKCγ in fibroblasts results in a phenotype typical of cellular transformation (41Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L.W., O Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirshmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of PKCβ1 in colon cells results in growth inhibition (42Choi P.L. Tchou-wong K.W. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4650-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, modified levels of PKC, either elevated or decreased, appear to be closely linked to abnormal proliferation, with the specific effect depending on the type of tumors or isoform in question. Our data imply that increased expression of PKCα plays a critical role in the MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells. It is unclear how MEL triggers the expression of PKCα. MEL was reported previously to perturb the composition of cell-surface glycolipids, such as GM3 and lactosylceramide, in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (10Isoda H. Shinmoto H. Kitamoto D. Matsumura M. Nakahara T. Lipids. 1997; 32: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that GM3, a kind of GSL, is closely associated with c-Src and Rho in the GM3-enriched microdomain of the surface membrane of B16 melanoma cells. Such organizational units might be directly involved in signal transduction (43Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 236: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Some glycolipids are known to undergo marked cancer-associated changes (44Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2405-2414PubMed Google Scholar), and PKC has been reported to be involved in the regulation of glycolipid sulfotransferase activity in renal carcinoma cells (45Kobayashi T. Honke K. Gasa S. Sugiura M. Miyazaki T. Ishizuka I. Makita A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2484-3489PubMed Google Scholar). The possible link between PKC and cell surface glycolipids remains to be determined and might be the key to an understanding of how signals for differentiation are transmitted to the nucleus to activate target genes. At a differentiation-inducing concentration (5 µm), MEL had no significant apoptosis-inducing effect on B16 cells (Fig.2 D). We reported previously that, at concentrations above 10 µm, MEL is a potent inducer of apoptosis in B16 melanoma cells in vitro (23Zhao X. Wakanatsu Y. Shibahara M. Nomura N. Geltinger C. Nakahara T. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 482-486PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of MEL on B16 cells are concentration-dependent. Because G1arrest has been observed in MEL-induced differentiation and apoptosis (Fig. 2, A and B; Ref. 23Zhao X. Wakanatsu Y. Shibahara M. Nomura N. Geltinger C. Nakahara T. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 482-486PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that after stimulation of G1 arrest by MEL, B16 cells might respond to different doses of MEL via different, but related signal cascades. The detailed correlations and differences between pathways that lead to MEL-induced differentiation and apoptosis remain to be resolved. In this study, we selected four AS-ODNs specific for mouse PKCα mRNA in an attempt to suppress the expression of PKCα during MEL-induced differentiation of B16 cells. AS-ODN no. 3642 was the most effective in perturbing the expression of PKCα, while S-ODN no. 3846 had no detectable effect on the expression of PKCα. Thus, the AS-ODNs appeared to act in a sequence-specific manner. AS-ODN no. 3642 at 200 nm significantly decreased expression of PKCα in B16 cells on day 2. However, at above 300 nm no. 3642 was toxic to the cells. This result supports our previous conclusion that MEL (above 10 µm) induces apoptosis of B16 cells together with the suppressed expression of PKC activity (46Zhao X. Geltinger C. Kishikawa S. Ohshima K. Murata T. Nomura N. Nakahara T. Yokoyama K.K. Cytotechnology. 2000; 33: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEL induces the differentiation of several different lines of carcinoma cells (10Isoda H. Shinmoto H. Kitamoto D. Matsumura M. Nakahara T. Lipids. 1997; 32: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 46Zhao X. Geltinger C. Kishikawa S. Ohshima K. Murata T. Nomura N. Nakahara T. Yokoyama K.K.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The details of the molecular mechanisms of MEL-induced differentiation are now being investigated. The data presented here provide evidence that MEL, a yeast-derived glycolipid, triggers the differentiation of malignant B16 melanoma cells in culture and that PKCα plays a key role in the MEL-induced signaling pathway to cellular differentiation.

Here we report that the low molecular weight protein encoded by the psbJ gene is an intrinsic component of the PSII complex. Fluorescence kinetics, oxygen flash yield, and thermoluminescence measurements indicate that inactivation of the psbJ gene in Synechocystis6803 cells and tobacco chloroplasts lowers PSII-mediated oxygen evolution activity and increases the lifetime of the reduced primary acceptor Q A− (more than a 100-fold in the tobacco ΔpsbJ mutant). The decay of the oxidized S2,3 states of the oxygen-evolving complex is considerably accelerated, and the oscillations of the Q B−/S2,3 recombination with the number of exciting flashes are damped. Thus, PSII can be assembled in the absence of PsbJ. However, the forward electron flow from Q A− to plastoquinone and back electron flow to the oxidized Mn cluster of the donor side are deregulated in the absence of PsbJ, thereby affecting the efficiency of PSII electron flow following the charge separation process.

PSII comprises a core complex formed by a few proteins binding the ligands required for primary photochemistry and electron transfer and the chlorophyll-binding antennae as well as a number of low molecular weight proteins whose functions have not yet been identified (1Debus R.J. Met. Ions. Biol. Syst. 2000; 37: 657-711PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The process of light-induced charge separation and reduction of a quinone acceptor, similar to that performed by PSII, is also carried out by photosynthetic bacteria that do not evolve oxygen and perform cyclic electron flow around the bacterial photochemical reaction center (RC) (3Okamura M.Y. Paddock M.L. Graige M.S. Feher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 148-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). While in both cases a small number of proteins binding the appropriate ligands are capable of light-driven charge separation and electron transfer, the linear electron flow performed by PSII using water as a source of electrons is more complex and may require regulatory steps that are not demanded by the cyclic electron flow of the bacterial RC. Thus it is plausible that proteins of PSII, besides those acting as energy-transferring antennae (4Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), may play some role in the regulation of the forward and backward electron flow within the PSII core complex. Recombination of the primary charge-separated pair due to back electron flow may lead to the generation of singlet oxygen considered to be the cause of PSII oxidative stress and turnover of its core proteins (5Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. Pascal A. Faller P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8189-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Indeed cytochrome b559, an essential component of the PSII core complex is considered to play such a regulatory role by diverting electrons from the reducing side of PSII and channeling them to the oxidized donor side of the complex (7Whitmarsh J. Pakrasi H.B. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 249-264Google Scholar). This protein is missing from the RC complex of purple anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. The psbE and psbF genes encoding the α and β subunits of cytochromeb559, respectively, are with a few exceptions members of the psbEFLJ operon (8Mor T.S. Ohad I. Hirschberg J. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that the products of the remaining genes of this operon, psbL andpsbJ, may be involved in regulatory processes as well.Synechocystis 6803 cells in which psbL has been inactivated do not have a functional PSII despite the fact that components of the complex are present (9Anbudurai P.R. Pakrasi H.B. Z Naturforsch. [C]. 1993; 48: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, inactivation of each of the genes in the psbEFLJ gene cluster in tobacco plastids was successfully performed. 2R. E. Regel, N. B. Ivleva, H. Zer, J. Meurer, S. V. Shestakov, R. G. Herrmann, H. B. Pakrasi, and I. Ohad, manuscript in preparation. The ΔpsbL tobacco mutant lacked functional PSII, while the ΔpsbJ mutant had impaired but detectable PSII activity. In the present study, functional analysis of both the cyanobacterial and tobacco ΔpsbJ-less mutants demonstrate that thepsbJ-encoded protein plays a regulatory role in the electron flow within the PSII complex. A 3,675-base pair SalI/Eco47III fragment of the plastid chromosome of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havanna, nucleotide positions 65,310–68,985 (GenBankTM/EBI data bank accession number Z00044), containing the entirepsbEFLJ operon was inserted intoSmaI/SalI double-digested Bluescript SK-vector and cloned in E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). A terminator-less, chimeric aadA gene conferring spectinomycin resistance to chloroplast mutants (10Koop H.U. Steinmuller K. Wagner H. Rossler C. Eibl C. Sacher L. Planta. 1996; 199: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was fused to the homologous psbA promoter. This construct was integrated intopsbJ modified by site-specific mutagenesis to generate an artificial PstI restriction site at the 5′-end of the structural gene using the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGTAAATGGCCGATACTGCAGGAAGGATTCCTC-3′. This operon-conform insertion interrupts the gene N-terminally between the two threonine residues at positions 4 and 5. The aadAcassette with terminator was also placed into an EcoRV site located 3′ in the untranslated region of the operon (nucleotide position 66,053). This site turned out to be insertion neutral. These plants are referred to throughout this article as RV5 control plants. Transformation of N. tabacum chloroplasts, selection, and culture of transformed material and assessment of the homoplastomic state were performed essentially as described in De Santis-Maciossek et al. (11De Santis-MacIossek G. Kofer W. Bock A. Schoch S. Maier R.M. Wanner G. Rudiger W. Koop H.U. Herrmann R.G. Plant J. 1999; 18: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The material was grown for 4–5 weeks in 12 h dark/12 h light cycles at 10 µmol of photons m−2 s−1 and 25 °C on agar-solidified medium (12Murashige T. Skoog F.A. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-479Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) containing 2% sucrose and 500 µg/ml spectinomycin under selective conditions. As opposed to the leaves of the wild type control plants that continued to grow and maintained PSII activity most of the ΔpsbJ leaves gradually lost photosynthetic activity and senesced within several weeks. The material chosen for analysis was homoplastomic and fairly green when grown in dim light. A detailed description of thepsbE operon mutants will be presented elsewhere.2 Synechocystis 6803 wild type, the strain in which psbJ was inactivated (13Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (T203 mutant; referred to throughout this article as the psbJ-stop mutant) and the CP47 histidine-tagged HT-3 cells (14Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were grown at 30 °C in BG11 medium (15Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). For the growth of psbJ-stop cells, the medium was supplemented with 5 µg ml−1chloramphenicol. The liquid cultures were grown under continuous fluorescent white light (50 µmol of photons m−2s−1) with vigorous bubbling with filtrated room air. PSII activity of cyanobacterial cells or isolated tobacco thylakoids using DCBQ and potassium ferricyanide as artificial electron acceptors were measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode as described (16Mannan R.M. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Tal S. Keren N. Hirschberg J. Ohad I. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 48: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Flash-induced oxygen yield of cyanobacterial cells was measured after dark adaptation for 7 min using a home-built, bare-platinum, Joliot-type electrode as described (18Meetam M. Keren N. Ohad I. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the estimation of the rates of decay of the S2 or S3 states, the cells were exposed to 1 or 2 single turnover exciting flashes (EG&G, LS-11340–4, 6 µs duration), respectively, followed by additional flashes after increasing time intervals, and the oxygen yield at the third flash was measured. Chlorophylla fluorescence induction kinetics of the tobacco wild type and mutant plant leaves was measured using a Pulse Modulated Fluorometer (PAM-101, Waltz, Germany) (19Schreiber U. Krieger A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Leaves were dark-adapted for 15–30 min prior to the measurements. The light intensity of the modulated measuring beam (1, 6 kHz) was 0.5 µmol of photons m− s−1. The intensity of the saturating light pulse (1 s) used for the measurement of the Fm level at the leaf surface was 3,000 µmol of photons m−2 s−1. Red actinic light (650 nm, 60 µmol of photons m−2s−1) was used for the measurements of fluorescence quenching. Variable fluorescence of tobacco leaves (FV/FM), was calculated as (FM-F0)/FM. Fluorescence quenching was measured as FV′/FV in which FV′ is defined as the variable fluorescence emitted by the leaves after exposure to actinic light (650 nm, 30–50 µmol of photons m−2 s−1). Fluorescence emission from cyanobacterial cells was measured as described by Meetam et al. (18Meetam M. Keren N. Ohad I. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with a FL-100 dual-modulation kinetic fluorometer (Photo Systems International, Brno, Czech Republic) (20Trtilek M. Kramer D.M. Koblizek M. Nedbal L. J. Luminescence. 1997; 72: 597-599Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using 3 µs exciting flashes, thus permitting a better resolution of the cyanobacterial fluorescence kinetics. Cells suspensions in BG-11 medium (2 µg Chl ml−1) were dark-adapted for 2 min prior to the fluorescence measurements. Thylakoid membranes were obtained by centrifugation of tobacco leaf homogenates according to Zer et al. (21Zer H. Vink M. Keren N. Dilly-Hartwig H.G. Paulsen H. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8277-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For preparation of thylakoids, 8–12 leaves that exhibited variable fluorescence in the range of 0.3–0.4 for theΔpsbJ mutant and >0.60 for the wild type plants were collected from four to six individual plants. PSII preparations exhibiting high rates of oxygen evolution were obtained from the CP47 histidine-tagged HT-3Synechocystis 6803 mutant cells as described by Brickeret al., (14Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Charge recombination of Q B−/S2,3 states of the manganese electron donor cluster or of the Q A−/S2 state in presence of DCMU (10 µm) were measured as described (5Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Zer H. Prasil O. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17670-17676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The emission due to the recombination of a mixed population of Q B−/S2 or Q B−/S3 states generated by a single flash in the absence of DCMU is not resolved into two distinct TL signals (23Rutherford A.W. Crofts A.R. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 457-465Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For TL signal measurements, tobacco thylakoids (5–10 µg Chl ml−1) were suspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 200 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 mmsorbitol. For TL measurements of cyanobacteria, cells were suspended in fresh BG11 medium (200 µg Chl ml−1) and dark-adapted at room temperature for 2 h followed by storage on ice until use (24Carpenter S.D. Ohad I. Vermaas W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Samples (10–15 µg of Chl) were dark adapted on the thermoluminescence apparatus stage at 20 °C for 3 min and then cooled to −10 °C and excited by one or multiple single-turnover light flashes (Xenon arc discharge lamp, EG&G, 0.05 microfarads capacitor, charged at 1000 v) as indicated followed by rapid cooling to −30 °C. The samples were then heated at a constant rate (0.5 °C s−1), and light emission versustemperature was measured by photon counting. The decay time course of the Q B−/S2,3 charge separated state was measured at 20 °C. The samples were exposed to two consecutive exciting flashes (0.3 Hz) and further incubated in darkness for times as indicated before rapid freezing to −30 °C and activating the heating and photon counting process. Freezing time from 20 °C to 0 °C was < 3 s, and the data were corrected for this value. Redox-dependent LHCII phosphorylation of wild type and ΔpsbJ tobacco thylakoids was carried out as described (21Zer H. Vink M. Keren N. Dilly-Hartwig H.G. Paulsen H. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8277-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation mixture (100 µl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP (25 µCi [γ-32P]ATP), 10 mm NaF and thylakoid membranes equivalent to 20 µg of chlorophyll. All incubations were carried out in Eppendorf tubes at 25 °C and in darkness or under room light as indicated. Activation of the protein kinase in darkness by duroquinol (1 mm) was as described (21Zer H. Vink M. Keren N. Dilly-Hartwig H.G. Paulsen H. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8277-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was terminated by addition of denaturing SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the membrane polypeptides were resolved as described (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The extent of phosphorylation was assayed by autoradiography. Chlorophyll concentration was measured in methanolic extracts of cyanobacterial cells (26Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-383Crossref Scopus (9424) Google Scholar) and in 80% acetone extracts for tobacco thylakoids. Photosystem I activity in intact leaves was estimated by measuring absorption changes related to P700oxidoreduction using the PAM-101-dedicated PSI attachment. Immunodetection of PsbJ on Western blots was carried out as described using monospecific polyclonal α-PsbJ antibodies (13Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PsbJ is a membrane-associated protein in Synechocystis 6803 (13Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain that the changes in PSII activity described in this work are due to the loss of a PSII-intrinsic component, we have tested the presence of the PsbJ protein in oxygen evolving PSII preparations. The data presented in Fig. 1demonstrate that PsbJ is a component of the PSII complex inSynechocystis 6803 and is absent in the psbJ-stop cyanobacterial mutant cells. PsbJ was also detected in the PSII crystals of Synechococcus elongatus (2Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Since this gene is present in the chloroplast genome of higher plants, and its inactivation drastically affects PSII electron flow in tobacco thylakoids (see below), we infer that PsbJ is also a component of the higher plant PSII. Oxygen evolution was impaired in both the ΔpsbJ and psbJ-stop mutants. TheΔpsbJ thylakoids evolved 20–40 µmol of oxygen Chl−1 h−1 (mg) when measured with DCBQ as an electron acceptor as compared with 120 µmol of oxygen (mg) Chl−1 h−1 for the control thylakoids. However, the impairment of oxygen evolution activity on a chlorophyll basis in the cyanobacterial psbJ-stop mutant was less pronounced allowing slow autotrophic growth and compatible at least partially with a lower PSII/PSI ratio in these cells (13Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FV/FM values were in the range of 0.74–0.76 for the control RV5 tobacco leaves and 0.37 (± 0.1) for theΔpsbJ mutant. The variations in the oxygen evolution activity and of the FV/FM fluorescence parameter of the tobacco mutant were due to increasing senescence with the time of growth of the plants in the plastic containers. TheΔpsbJ mutant of tobacco exhibited P700oxidoreduction activity as measured by the PAM-101 attachment. However, the rate of P700 reduction in the mutant was considerably slower as compared with that of the control plants indicating that the reduction of the PQ pool is impaired in the mutant plants (not shown). Fluorescence quenching (FV′/FV) in the control tobacco leaves after 2–3 min exposure to red actinic light was about 0.3. LHCII phosphorylation in the RV5 thylakoids was light activated and inhibited by DCMU. The ΔpsbJ mutant did not exhibit fluorescence quenching activity and the redox-dependent LHCII phosphorylation in isolated thylakoids (21Zer H. Vink M. Keren N. Dilly-Hartwig H.G. Paulsen H. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8277-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was not activated by light (Fig.2). However, redox-dependent protein kinase activity could be elicited in the ΔpsbJthylakoids by addition of duroquinol. These results can be explained by a low rate of PQ reduction in the mutant. The ratio PQH2/PQ induced by white light illumination used in the phosphorylation assay could be low due to the activation of PSI and plastoquinol oxidation by ambient oxygen and thus may not be sufficient to activate the redox-dependent LHCII kinase. Addition of far red light (710 nm, 20 µmol m−2 s−) slightly accelerated the oxidation of Q A− in the wild type (Fig. 2) as well as in the ΔpsbJ leaves (not shown) indicating that quinone/quinol exchange at the QB site occurs also in the mutant. In both the tobacco and cyanobacterial mutants, the oxidation of Q A− as measured by fluorescence kinetics was slower as compared with that of the wild type (Figs. 2 and3). The oxidation of Q A− in the tobacco ΔpsbJplants exhibits an initial relatively fast phase accounting in various leaves from 10–40% of the signal followed by an extremely slow phase (t1/2 ranging between 20–60 s) (Figs. 2 and3A). The fluorescence decay in the absence of DCMU is due mostly to forward electron flow from of Q A− to QB. The above results indicate that this path of electron flow is significantly hindered in the mutant. Inhibition of electron flow to QBby DCMU and acceptance of electrons from Q A− by DCBQ indicates that binding of ligands at the QB site and thus, PQ/PQH2exchange is not affected and can not explain the above observed changes in the fluorescence decay. One should note that DCBQ bound at the QB site accepts electrons from Q A−. Since the rate of electron flow to DCBQ in the tobacco mutant thylakoids was significantly slower than that in the wild type thylakoids, it is reasonable to conclude that the mutation affects the donation of electrons from Q A− to the natural QBquinone acceptor as it does to the artificial electron acceptor, DCBQ. Measurements of the decay time of Q A−in the cyanobacterial psbJ-stop cells showed a slower rate as compared with that of the wild type cells. However, the difference between the mutant and the wild type cells was significantly smaller than that in the tobacco plants and could not be accurately resolved by the PAM 101 fluorometer. This difference was, however, clearly resolved when the oxidation of Q A− was measured using a dual modulation kinetic fluorometer that has a time resolution in the range of 10 µs. The oxidation of Q A− was about 40% slower in the cyanobacterial mutant cells as compared with that of the wild type cells (Fig. 3B). Back electron flow from the acceptor to the donor side of PSII was measured by several methods. The decay of Q A− by back electron flow in the presence of DCMU as estimated by fluorescence kinetics showed a doubling of the oxidation time in the psbJ-stop cyanobacterial cells (t1/2 1.2 s as compared with 0.5 s for the wild type cells) (Fig. 3B). The most striking difference between the psbJ-stop and wild type strains of Synechocystis 6803 cells was found in the decay of the S3 state via back electron flow from the acceptor side as evidenced by measurements of oxygen flash-yield (t1/2 about 3 s and 60 s, respectively) (Fig. 4A). The decay of the TL signal resulting from the charge recombination of the Q B−/S2,3 state was also significantly faster in the psbJ-stop mutant as compared with the wild type cells (5.6 s and 22 s, respectively) (Fig.4B). The maximal photon emission due to charge recombination of Q B−/S2,3 was shifted to a slightly lower temperature for the cyanobacterial mutant as compared with the wild type cells (26 °C and 30 °C, respectively), while the temperature of the maximal emission resulting from the recombination of Q A−/S2 in the presence of DCMU was slightly increased in the mutant relative to the wild type cells (11 °C and 9 °C, respectively). This is in agreement with the increase in the Q A−oxidation time in the presence of DCMU by the same route as measured by fluorescence kinetics (Fig. 3B). The intensity of both the QA and QB thermoluminescence emission bands of the psbJ-stop cells on a Chl basis was significantly lower as compared with that of the wild type cells (Fig.5A) and amounts to about 11 and 25% of the intensity of wild type TL signals for the Q B−/S2,3 and the Q A−/S2 recombination, respectively. The oscillations of the TL signals intensity with the number of exciting flashes showed a pattern of maximal emission following excitation by two and six consecutive flashes for the mutant and wild type cyanobacterial cells. However, the signal from the mutant was slightly damped (Fig. 5C).Figure 5Thermoluminescence signals fromSynechocystis 6803 cells and tobacco thylakoids.A, thermoluminescence signals due to recombination of Q A−/S2 and Q B−/S2,3 states (QA and QB traces, respectively) inSynechocystis 6803. B, thermoluminescence signal due to recombination of Q A−/S2 (QAtrace) and oscillation of the Q B−/S2,3 signal with flash number (QB traces) in tobacco thylakoids.

The TL signals intensity of the tobacco ΔpsbJ mutant did not oscillate with the number of exciting flashes (Fig. 5D). The decay of the Q B−/S2,3states at 20 °C as estimated by TL measurements in the thylakoids ofΔpsbJ tobacco mutant was basically similar to that of thepsbJ-stop cyanobacterial mutant. However, the shape of the curve clearly indicates presence of two major phases, an initial fast phase accounting for about 60% of the signal with at1/2 roughly estimated to be less than 2 s and a second slow phase extending up to 33 s with an estimatedt1/2 of about 18 s (Fig. 4B). The decay of the above TL signal in thylakoids of the RV5 tobacco thylakoids exhibited a t1/2 of about 25 s (not shown) as also reported for higher plant thylakoids (27Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The slow phase of the TL signal decay in the ΔpsbJ tobacco mutant could explain the slow phase of fluorescence decay due to the oxidation of Q A− in the absence of DCMU observed in intact leaves (Figs. 2 and 3). The findings presented in this work demonstrate that functional PSII can be assembled in absence of PsbJ. However, the electron flow within the PsbJ-less PSII complex is deregulated and characterized by a slower oxidation of the primary electron acceptor quinone Q A−via forward electron flow and a faster reduction of the oxidized S states. While the changes of fluorescence decay, oxygen flash yield and charge recombination detected by TL, are common to both, the cyanobacterial and tobacco mutants, the extents of these changes are more accentuated in the tobacco mutant as compared with the cyanobacterial mutant. The major difference between thepsbJ-stop cyanobacterial and ΔpsbJ tobacco mutants appears in the oxidation of Q A−via forward electron flow to QB. This process is slower by about 40% in the psbJ-stop cells as compared with a slowing by almost 2 orders of magnitude in the tobaccoΔpsbJ mutant. This large increase in the life time of Q A− explains the suppression of the TL signal oscillations with the number of exciting flashes in the tobacco thylakoids as compared with the small TL oscillation damping effect observed in the cyanobacterial cells (Fig. 5). Thus the Q A−/QB electron flow and the two-electron gating at the QB site that is responsible for the oscillation of the back reaction are hindered. This interpretation is in agreement with the high F0 level of the ΔpsbJ mutant as measured with the PAM-101 fluorometer and the temperature downshift of about 10–12 °C in the TL emission peak resulting from Q B−/S2,3 charge recombination. The TL signal measured in the absence of DCMU in the mutants is actually a result of the recombination of Q A−, Q B−/S2, S3mixed populations in which the ratio Q A−/ Q B− is higher than in the wild type thylakoids. Back electron flow from Q A−occurs at a temperature lower than that of the Q B−/S2,3 recombination (5Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since the TL signal due to charge recombination in the absence of DCMU does not resolve the contributions of back electron flow from Q A− from that from Q B−, the photon emission peak is broader and is shifted to a temperature lower than that of the wild type thylakoids. Accordingly, the decay of the TL signal resulting from this recombination is also considerably faster (Fig. 5). The back electron flow due to the Q B−/S2,3 charge recombination in the cyanobacterial psbJ-stop cells as measured by thermoluminescence shows a small downshift of the TL signal emission temperature (∼4–5 °C) and a marginal upshift of the TL signal (<2 °C) for the recombination of the Q A−/S2 state in presence of DCMU. This is in agreement with the small degree of damping of the TL signal oscillation with the number of exciting flashes that maintains a normal 2/6 pattern (5Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) in the wild type cells. However, the extent of the TL signal on a chlorophyll basis as compared with that of the wild type cyanobacterial cells is extremely low. Considering that the PSII/PSI ratio in this mutant cells on a chlorophyll basis is about 0.4 (13Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one would expect a proportional loss of the TL signal intensity. The lower TL emission of the psbJ-stop cells as compared with the wild type strain observed in this work indicates that in a large fraction of the PSII population back electron flow and reduction of the S2,3 states occurs via a different route that may not involve the recombination of the primary charge-separated state and the related photon emission. Back electron flow measured by the oxygen flash yield technique in the psbJ-stop cells in the absence of DCMU indeed shows a very fast decay of the S3 and S2 states as compared with that in the wild type cells with a lifetime compatible with that measured by the TL method in the absence of DCMU. These results indicate that the electron donor for this process could be Q A−. However, the pathway of electron transfer possibly involves an intermediate electron transfer carrier reducing S2 and S3, yet avoiding the recombination of the primary charge-separated pair. The pathway for this route of back electron flow could include cytochrome b559directly (28Barber J. De Las Rivas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10942-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or in combination with Chlz (29Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and possibly via a carotenoid cation radical (6Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. Pascal A. Faller P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8189-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Vrettos J.S. Stewart D.H. dePaula J. Brudvig G.W. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 6403-6406Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the experimental results presented above is supported by the oxygen evolution measurements. The rate of electron flow in the thylakoids of the tobacco mutant using DCBQ as an electron acceptor that binds to the QB site and accepts electrons from Q A− was significantly lower than that of the wild type thylakoids. The reduction of PQ was even slower as indicated by the extremely slow oxidation of Q A− in the absence of artificial electron acceptors. These results possibly indicate that the loss of PsbJ induces a change in the redox potential of the Q A−/QA pair relative to DCBQ bound at the QB site that is more negative than that relative to PQ bound at this site. Binding of ligands at the QB site has been reported to affect the redox potential of QA (31Krieger A. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 91-98Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fact that the Q A−/QA potential can be significantly altered following interactions of ligands with the QB site of the D1 protein in proximity to the QA site points toward the possibility that the QA potential may be influenced by interactions between the D2 protein harboring the QA binding site and adjacent proteins. The possibility that the absence of PsbJ induces changes in the QB site affecting the rate of PQ/PQH2 turnover at the QB site could also explain the slow oxidation of Q A− in the absence of DCMU. However, changes in the PQ turnover at the QB site can not explain the observed changes in the lifetime of the S states, nor those of the shifts in the TL signal temperature for the recombination of both the Q B−/S2,3 and Q A−/S2 states. The question arises as to the difference in the extent of PSII activity induced by the loss of PsbJ between tobacco and cyanobacteria. A priori in view of the similarity of the activity of PSII between higher plants and cyanobacteria, one would not expect such a difference. However, one should consider that PSII in plants differs in terms of its polypeptide composition from that of cyanobacteria. The 17- and 23-kDa oxygen evolution-enhancing polypeptides as well as the tightly bound light-harvesting complexes encoded by thelhcb3,4 genes are present in plant PSII but are absent from the cyanobacterial PSII. It is possible that the PSII complexes differ in their plasticity at both structural and functional levels. The degree of PSII alteration by inactivation of PSII related genes between cyanobacteria and higher plants has been reported to differ, possibly indicating a less stringent control of PSII activity in the cyanobacterial cells as compared with the eukaryotic PSII (28Barber J. De Las Rivas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10942-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This may be related to the fact that in the cyanobacterial thylakoids the redox sate of the PQ pool, and thus back electron flow, is affected by both the light-driven as well as the respiratory pathways. The phenomena described in this work may be explained assuming that the QA potential of the mutants is more positive relative to that of the wild type PSII. The upshift of the TL peak emission temperature by about 4 °C for the recombination of Q A−/S2 state in the presence of DCMU and the shorter lifetime of the S states are in agreement with this suggestion. Changes observed in these parameters are considered as being related to changes in the redox potentials of the above electron donors/acceptors (29Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Vass I. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Vass I. Horwath G. Herczeg T. Demeter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 634: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Minagawa J. Narusaka Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The experimental evidence in support of the above-offered hypothesis is circumstantial. Additional experiments including measurements of the Q A−/QA potential of the mutants need to be performed to further elucidate the mechanism of the observed changes in the electron flow within PSII induced by the absence of PsbJ. The highly hydrophobic PsbJ protein with a single transmembrane helix is not known to participate in the binding of any electron carrier ligand. Recently it was proposed that the interaction between cytochrome b559 and QA is involved in the setting of the redox potential of both these PSII components (30Vrettos J.S. Stewart D.H. dePaula J. Brudvig G.W. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 6403-6406Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Mizusawa N. Yamashita T. Miyao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The absence of PsbJ may affect the interaction of additional proteins in the PSII complex that may be involved in this process. Alternatively, PsbJ may interact directly with and affect the proteins involved in the electron transfer process. A close interaction between cytochrome b559 and the D2 protein that forms the QA binding niche has been suggested (6Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. Pascal A. Faller P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8189-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Minagawa J. Narusaka Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and supported by the recently reported x-ray crystal structure of PSII at 3.8 Å resolution (2Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). It is possible that an association of PsbJ with the above-mentioned two proteins regulates the interaction between these electron carriers, thus affecting the electron flow path. Among the unidentified transmembrane α-helices resolved by x-ray analysis of the S. elongatus PSII (2Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), one is located in close vicinity to cytochrome b559 and may belong to PsbJ. Further work using cross-linking methods may provide support for this hypothesis. While it is established that cytochromeb559 may assume a high or low potential in response to factors affecting the protein environment (29Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 31Krieger A. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 91-98Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), no such change has been reported to occur for the QA site of functional PSII. Possibly, the H subunit of the bacterial RC may play a similar role in the regulation of electron flow via QA(38Debus R.J. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2276-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Based on the results presented in this work it is conceivable that PsbJ functions in conjunction with the other components encoded by the psbEFLJ operon in the regulation of the electron traffic within PSII and thus plays an important role in the efficiency of forward electron flow following the charge separation process. We thank Dr. Yasuhiro Kashino for the cyanobacterial PSII preparation, Dr. Terry Bricker for the HT-3 strain of Synechocystis 6803, and Martina Reymers for her skilful technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W2132729082,"hsp27 has been reported to participate in a wide variety of activities, including resistance to thermal and metabolic stress, regulation of growth and differentiation, and acting as a molecular chaperone or a regulator of actin polymerization. We hypothesized that these diverse functions are regulated in a cell- or tissue-specific manner via interaction with various binding proteins. To investigate this hypothesis, we used hsp27 as a “bait” to screen a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library from rat kidney glomeruli and identified a novel hsp27 binding protein, hic-5 (also known as ARA55), a focal adhesion protein and steroid receptor co-activator. Biochemical interaction between hsp27 and hic-5 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, and critical protein·protein interaction regions were mapped to the hic-5 LIM domains and the hsp27 C-terminal domain. Initial analysis of the functional role of hsp27·hic-5 interaction revealed that hic-5 significantly inhibited the protection against heat-induced cell death conferred by hsp27 overexpression in co-transfected 293T cells. In contrast, when a non-hsp27-interacting hic-5 truncation mutant (hic-5/ΔLIM4) was co-expressed with hsp27, the hic-5 inhibition of hsp27 protection was absent. We conclude that hic-5 is a true hsp27 binding protein and inhibits the ability of hsp27 to provide protection against heat shock in an interaction-dependent manner. hsp27 has been reported to participate in a wide variety of activities, including resistance to thermal and metabolic stress, regulation of growth and differentiation, and acting as a molecular chaperone or a regulator of actin polymerization.

It is constitutively expressed in many mammalian cell types, and its expression increases in response to sublethal stresses such as heat shock, exposure to toxicants, and oxidative stress (1Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol.

Hickey E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). hsp27 also becomes rapidly phosphorylated in response to similar stresses, as well as to exposure to cytokines and mitogens (5Landry J. Huot J. Biochem. Soc Symp. 1999; 64: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulation and phosphorylation of hsp27 have been correlated with increased cell survival and recovery from stress conditions (6Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Two predominant hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which hsp27 may protect cells from harmful stresses. One hypothesis is that hsp27 acts as a chaperone to facilitate folding/renaturation of proteins that have become denatured under stress conditions. In vitro, both hsp27 and the related small hsp, αB-crystallin, were shown to be able to rescue citrate synthase or alcohol dehydrogenase from temperature-induced aggregation (8Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In addition, cultured cells overexpressing hsp27 were reported to exhibit accelerated recovery from heat-induced nuclear protein aggregation (10Kampinga H.H. Brunsting J.F. Stege G.J. Konings A.W. Landry J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This chaperone activity has been correlated with the presence of large oligomers of hsp27 (11Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.-P. Buchner J. Gaestel M.

Upon phosphorylation, however, large hsp27 oligomers have been reported to dissociate into small oligomers or dimers (12Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction in the size of hsp27 oligomers has been correlated with elimination of in vitro chaperone activity (11Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G.

The other hypothesized mechanism of protection is that hsp27 stabilizes actin filaments in an as yet undefined manner resulting in increased resistance to stresses. This function has been correlated with small hsp27 oligomers or dimers (2Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to be regulated by the phosphorylation of hsp27 (15Lavoie J. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, hsp27 in its unphosphorylated form can inhibit actin polymerization in vitro whereas phosphorylated hsp27 lacks the ability to inhibit actin polymerization (16Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, microinjection of recombinant non-phosphorylated hsp27, but not phosphorylated hsp27, into ROC 17/2.8 cells inhibited the restoration of heat shock-disrupted actin stress fibers (17Schneider G.B. Hamano H. Cooper L.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of wild type hsp27, which can become phosphorylated under stress conditions, stabilized stress fibers during hyperthermia, prevented cytochalasin D-induced actin depolymerization, increased cortical polymerized actin (F-actin) content, and increased ruffling and pinocytotic activity (7Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 15Lavoie J. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable hsp27 mutant (S15G, S75G, and S82G) destabilized stress fibers, reduced cortical F-actin content, and decreased pinocytotic activity. Although hsp27 may regulate the dynamics of actin polymerization, the molecular basis for the interaction between hsp27 and actin is not yet clear. hsp27 co-localizes with actin filaments in several highly differentiated cell types, including Sertoli cells (18Welsh M.J. Wu W. Parvinen M. Gilmont R.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), striated muscle cells (19Hoch B. Lutsch G. Schlegel W.-P. Stahl J. Wallukat G. Bartel S.

Smoyer, unpublished results.but appears to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm in most other cell types. Importantly, however, although direct interaction between hsp27 and actin has been demonstrated in vitro (16Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Miron T. Wilchek M. Geiger B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Miron T. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), no direct interaction between hsp27 and actin in vivo has been reported. Together, these findings led us to hypothesize that hsp27 may regulate actin via a novel mechanism involving hsp27 binding proteins (hsp27-BP) that are expressed in a cell and/or tissue-specific manner. Several hsp27-BPs have previously been identified, including mammalian transglutaminase (platelet factor XIII) (23Zhu Y. Tassi L. Lane S.W. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (-???): 22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aDrosophila ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (24Joanisse D.R. Inaguma Y. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a novel protein, PASS1 (protein associated with small stress proteins 1) (25Liu C. Gilmontt R.R. Benndorf R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18724-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken in an attempt to identify hsp27-BP(s) that might play a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by hsp27. We present both in vitro and in vivoevidence demonstrating that hsp27 binds to a known focal adhesion/steroid receptor co-activator protein, hic-5/ARA55 (hydrogen peroxide-inducibleclone-5/androgen receptor co-activator, 55 kDa), and define the C termini of both hsp27 and hic-5 that are required for their interaction. We also demonstrate that the interaction of hic-5 with hsp27 abolishes the protection against heat stress-induced cell death conferred by hsp27 overexpression. Kidneys harvested from normal adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (175–200 g) were rinsed in cold PBS, and the renal capsules were removed. Glomeruli were isolated by mincing kidney cortical tissue with a razor blade, rinsing with PBS, pressing the tissue through a no. 140 stainless steel sieve (W. S. Tyler, Mentor, OH), and collecting the glomeruli on a no. 200 sieve, as previously described by Kreiserg et al. (26Kreisberg J.I. Hoover R.L. Karnovsky M.J. Kidney Int. 1978; 14: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Isolated glomeruli were assessed under the microscope, and the procedure was repeated until glomerular samples were >95% pure. Poly(A) mRNA was extracted from the isolated glomerular preparations and used to generate a HybriZap-2.1 two-hybrid cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In vivoexcision of the lambda vector was then performed to release the GAL4 activation domain vectors (pGAL4-AD) containing the cDNA inserts, and the cDNA library was amplified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Y190 yeast host strain carries three auxotrophic markers, leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, for transformation selection, and two reporter genes, lacZand HIS3, for the detection of in vivoprotein·protein interactions. The expression of the reporter genes are controlled by GAL4 elements positioned upstream of each of the two reporter genes. Y190 cells that had been previously transformed with the bait plasmid pGAL4-BD-hsp27 (GAL4-DNA binding domain fused with the full-length rat hsp27 cDNA) (27Liu C. Welsh M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were transformed with prey plasmids containing the GAL4 activation domain fused with cDNAs from the rat glomerular cDNA library. Yeast colonies containing plasmids encoding potential hsp27-BPs were selected on tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-deficient plates, and colonies were further selected by the reporter gene expression assay (β-galactosidase lift assay) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The total number of cDNA copies that were screened was calculated by counting the colonies from an aliquot of the above-transformed yeast cells grown on leucine/tryptophan-depleted plates. Plasmids containing potential hsp27-BP cDNA were isolated from the positive yeast colonies after eliminating the pGal4-BD-hsp27 plasmid according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli, re-isolated, and sequenced by the DNA Sequencing Core of the University of Michigan. cDNA fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). PCR was performed using a GeneAmp 2400 PAR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) with 30 cycles at different temperatures for denaturing (95 °C), annealing (50–60 °C), and extension (60 °C) for various times (30 s to 2 min). The mouse full-length hic-5 cDNA (GenBank™ accession numberL22482) was used in PCR reactions as the template to prepare FLAG-tagged hic-5 and its truncation mutant cDNA constructs. The oligonucleotide that encodes the FLAG epitope (N-AspTyrLysAspAspAspAspLys-) was fused to hic-5 and its truncation mutant sequences at the 5′-end of the following primer, AGGGGTACCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGAATTCATGTCACGGTTAGGGGCTCCAAAAGAGCGC (primer 1). Full-length hic-5 cDNA was produced by PCR with primer 1 and GCTCTAGATCAGCCGAAGAGCTTCAGGAAGCA (primer 2). The N-hic-5 truncation mutant cDNA was produced by PCR with primer 1 and GCTCTAGAGGCCTTTGGCCTGTGTGGGGAC, hic-5ΔLIM3/4 with primer 1 and GCTCTAGACTAGCGTGGGGCGAACAGCTGCAG, and hic-5ΔLIM4 with primer 1 and GCTCTAGACTACAGCGAACCACGCTGAGCATG. The C-hic-5 truncation mutant cDNA was produced by PCR with the 5′-end primer, AGGGGTACCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGTGTGGCTCCTGCAATAAACCTATAGCT, and primer 2. External restriction sites were introduced at the ends of the fragments for cloning purposes. The PCR reactions were digested withKpnI/XbaI for hic-5, N-hic-5, hic-5ΔLIM3/4, and hic-5ΔLIM4 and EcoRI/XbaI for C-hic-5 cDNAs (all restriction enzymes from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. PCR products were excised from the gel as determined by their calculated molecular weights and inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at the corresponding restriction sites. The monoclonal anti-hsp27 antibody (28Bitar K.N. Kaminski M.S. Hailat N. Cease K.B. Strahler J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) used in these studies was generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 123–137 of human hsp27. This monoclonal antibody does not react with the hsp27 truncation mutant proteins we prepared for the domain mapping studies. A pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) was used to construct a C-terminal Myc-tagged full-length rat hsp27 and its truncation mutant constructs, allowing detection of the Myc-tagged fusion proteins with a commercially available anti-Myc antibody. Rat hsp27 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number M86389) (18Welsh M.J. Wu W. Parvinen M. Gilmont R.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used as template in PCR reactions to generate a full-length hsp27 cDNA and its truncations. The full-length hsp27 cDNA was produced with a 5′-end primer of TTCGAATTCGCCACCATGACCGAGCGCCGCGTGCCCTTCTCGCTA (hsp primer 1) and a 3′-end primer of GCCGAATTCCTTGGCTCCAGACTGTTCCGACTC (hsp primer 2), and cloned into the vector at EcoRI sites. The N-hsp27 truncation mutant was produced using hsp primer 1 and GCTCTAGACCGAGAGATGTAGCCATG and cloned into the vector atEcoRI/XbaI sites. The C-hsp27 truncation mutant was generated with primers of CGGGGTACCACCATGCCCGCCTTCAGCCGG and hsp primer 2 and cloned into the vector at KpnI/EcoRI sites. To confirm the sequence accuracy of all constructs, DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing Core of the University of Michigan. Kidney epithelial (293T) cells of human embryonic origin were grown in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at 37 °C in a 100% relative humidity and 5% CO2atmosphere. Transient transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 24 h prior to transfection, cells were dispensed into 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well. After culture for 1 day, plasmid cDNA (1 µg/well) and FuGENE 6 (3 µl/well) were added to the cells. Forty-four hours after transfection, cells were either collected for immunoprecipitation studies or used in heat shock studies. Protein extracts from immortalized adult rat Sertoli (ASC-17D) cells were used in immunoprecipitation studies to detect an endogenous hsp27·hic-5 interaction. ASC-17D cells (29Roberts K. Banerjee P. Tindall J. Zirkin B. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:nutrient mixture F-12 with 4% fetal bovine serum at 33 °C and differentiated in the same medium at 40 °C for 3 days. Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed in immune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1× complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (800–1000 µl) was incubated with 4 µl of anti-hic-5 monoclonal antibody (H-82420, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or 2 µl of anti-rat hsp27 monoclonal antibody (8A7) (18Welsh M.J. Wu W. Parvinen M. Gilmont R.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Bitar K.N. Kaminski M.S. Hailat N. Cease K.B. Strahler J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were isolated from the lysates by addition of protein G-Sepharose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating platform, followed by collection of the beads by a brief centrifugation. Bound immunocomplexes were released from the beads after three washes with lysis buffer by resuspension and a 3-min, 100 °C incubation in SDS sample buffer. Controls consisted of samples with normal mouse sera substituted for anti-hic-5 or anti-hsp27 antibodies. To define the critical interaction regions between hsp27 and hic-5, immune precipitation buffer lysates of transfected 293T cells were prepared as described above and incubated with 1 µl of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), anti-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-paxillin antibody (P13520, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were isolated and solubilized as described above. Controls consisted of samples with normal mouse sera substituted for anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies. Tissues from various organs were collected from adult rats followed by immediate homogenization in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Homogenates were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration in the resulting supernatants was determined by BCA microassay, using albumin standards also prepared in solubilization buffer. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were brought to 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. For SDS-PAGE, 30 µg of total protein/sample in SDS buffer was resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels using a mini-PROTEAN II Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a submarine electrophoretic transfer unit in the same apparatus. For Western blotting, membranes were blocked for 1 h in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one of the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution: 1:2000 mouse anti-hic-5 (H82420), 1:5000 mouse anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, anti-rat hsp27 (8A7), or 1:10,000 mouse anti-paxillin antibodies (P13520, Transduction Laboratories). Following incubation with the primary antibody, membranes were washed three times in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with either goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab) or goat anti-mouse IgG Fc antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in blocking solution. The membranes were then washed three times in PSB-T and processed for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL reagent,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). 293T cells were detached from six-well cell culture plates with trypsin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and an equal number of cells (1 × 105 cells/well) was dispensed into 24-well culture plates. Cells were cultured for 6 h to allow them to attach to the plates and then heat-shocked at 45.0, 46.0, or 47.0 ± 0.1 °C for 30 min in a circulating water bath. After 14 h of recovery at 37 °C, neutral red uptake assays were performed as described previously (30Flick D. Gifford G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 68: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 200 µl of PBS containing 0.033% (w/v) neutral red (Sigma) was added to cell culture medium. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were collected and washed twice in PBS. The cells were then resuspended and lysed by addition of an equal volume of a 50% (v/v) mixture of ethanol and 0.1m monobasic sodium phosphate followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, an equal volume of each supernatant was transferred to 96-well plates. The absorbance of supernatants at 550 nm was determined by using an EAR 400AT microplate spectrophotometer (SLT-Lab Instruments, Austria). All experimental results were expressed as mean ± S.E. All statistical analyses were performed using unpaired two-tailed t tests. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. To identify hsp27 binding proteins, ∼1.3 × 106independent cDNA clones were screened from a normal rat kidney glomerular two-hybrid cDNA library, and a total of 32 positive yeast colonies were identified and sequenced. A homology search in GenBank™ using the BLAST program revealed that 24 out of 32 plasmids encoded hsp27. One of the remaining positive plasmids contained a cDNA with high sequence similarity to the C-terminal sequences of mouse and human hic-5 cDNA. On this basis, the isolated cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF314960) was assumed to code for rat hic-5. Fig. 1shows the nucleotide sequence of the plasmid isolated from the rat glomerular library, and the amino acid sequence match between this partial rat hic-5 sequence and the full-length sequence of mouse hic-5. To confirm the interaction between hsp27 and hic-5 in the two-hybrid system, full-length murine hic-5 cDNA and full-length rat hsp27 cDNA were co-transfected into Y190 yeast cells. All of the resulting yeast colonies grew on the tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-deficient plates, whereas yeast cells transfected with either cDNA alone failed to grow. All double-transfected yeast colonies also turned dark blue in the β-galactosidase lift assay. The full-length hic-5 was negative when tested for interaction with p53, pLamin C, and pBD-GAL4 Cam in the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, when mouse hic-5 was used as the bait to screen a yeast two-hybrid cDNA from C2C12 myoblasts, multiple positive colonies containing cDNA encoding hsp27 were identified. 3M. Shibanuma, unpublished data. Together these results confirmed a true interaction between rat/mouse hic-5 and rat hsp27 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Because false-positive colonies could arise from the yeast two-hybrid screening, the interaction between hsp27 and hic-5 was further examined by co-immunoprecipitation. Extracts from co-transfected 293T cells were immunoprecipitated, and the immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting probed with anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, or anti-paxillin antibodies. Because the molecular mass of hsp27 (about 25 kDa) is close to that of IgG light chain, and hic-5 (about 51 kDa) is close to that of IgG heavy chain, to avoid obscuring the visualization of these proteins on Western blots, the membranes were cut in half between the 45- and 30-kDa molecular mass markers and probed separately with secondary antibodies that recognized only the heavy or light chains of the immunoprecipitated antibody. Fig. 2shows the results of an immunoprecipitated analysis of extracts from 293T cells transfected with vector (pcDNA3.1) alone, the FLAG-hic-5 or hsp27-Myc constructs, or co-transfected with both constructs. This analysis clearly shows that FLAG-hic-5 and hsp27-Myc are immunoprecipitated by the respective anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies from extracts of cells transfected with the appropriate FLAG-hic-5 or hsp27-Myc constructs (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 8). No nonspecific immunoprecipitation of these proteins was observed using either the anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and7), or using normal mouse serum as control in cells co-transfected with both constructs (Fig. 2, lane 10). Furthermore, in 293T cells co-transfected with Lac-z-Myc and FLAG-hic-5, no Lac-z-Myc was detected by Western blotting in the immunocomplexes precipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). The anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies co-immunoprecipitated hsp27-Myc (Fig. 2, lane 3) and FLAG-hic-5 (Fig. 2,lane 4), respectively, from cells co-transfected with both constructs. Interestingly, anti-paxillin antibody failed to co-immunoprecipitate hsp27-Myc from cells transfected with this construct (Fig. 2, lane 9) despite the considerable sequence similarity between hic-5 and paxillin. Similarly, anti-Myc antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate paxillin from any transfected cell type (Fig.2, lanes 4 and 8). These findings clearly demonstrated a biochemical interaction in vivo between hsp27 and hic-5 but not between hsp27 and paxillin. To confirm that hsp27 and hic-5 interact in the absence of exogenous overexpression of these proteins, we chose a rat Sertoli cell line, ASC-17D, which has substantial endogenous expression of both hsp27 and hic-5, for a co-immunoprecipitation study. Extracts from ASC-17D cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-hsp27 antibody (8A7) or a recently developed anti-hic-5 antibody (H-82420, Transduction Labs), which does not recognize paxillin on Western blots, and the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Both the anti-hsp27 and anti-hic-5 antibodies were able to co-immunoprecipitate hsp27 and hic-5 from extracts of ASC-17D cells (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). No nonspecific immunoprecipitation of these proteins was observed when normal mouse serum was used in place of the specific mouse anti-hsp27 or hic-5 antibodies (Fig. 3, lane 3). To determine the expression of hic-5 in adult rat tissues, protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with a polyclonal hic-5 antibody (31Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (P13520, Transduction Labs). The distribution of hic-5 (Fig.4, lower panel) in adult rat tissues was similar to but not identical with the distribution of paxillin (Fig. 4, upper panel) in these tissues. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4, hic-5 was strong"
https://openalex.org/W2031918301,"Fatty acid synthesis in pea chloroplasts is regulated by light/dark. The regulatory enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase is modulated by light/dark, presumably under redox regulation. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a multienzyme complex composed of biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase (CT). To demonstrate the redox regulation of CT, composed of the nuclear-encoded α and the chloroplast-encoded β subunits, we identified the cysteine residues involved in such regulation. We expressed the recombinant CT inEscherichia coli and found that the partly deleted CT was, like the full-length CT, sensitive to a redox state. Site-directed mutagenesis of the deleted CT showed that replacement by alanine of the cysteine residue 267 in the α polypeptide or 442 in the β polypeptide resulted in redox-insensitive CT and broke the intermolecular disulfide bond between the α and β polypeptides. Similar results were confirmed in the full-length CT. These results indicate that the two cysteines in recombinant CT are involved in redox regulation by intermolecular disulfide-dithiol exchange between the α and β subunits. Immunoblots of extract from plants incubated in the light or dark supported that such a disulfide-dithiol exchange is relevant in vivo. A covalent bond between a nuclear-encoded polypeptide and a chloroplast-encoded polypeptide probably regulates the enzyme activity in response to light.

ACCase is the enzyme considered most responsible for the primary regulation of fatty acid synthesis. Most plants, with the exception of the grass family (Poaceae), have two types of ACCase: the heteromeric, prokaryotic form in plastids and the homodimeric, eukaryotic form in cytosol (1Sasaki Y. Konishi T. Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). The grass family has the homodimeric form in both plastids and cytosol (3Konishi T. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3598-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,4Konishi T. Shinohara K. Yamada K. Sasaki Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In plants, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts, and the heteromeric ACCase, except in the grass family, is the regulatory enzyme involved. The heteromeric ACCase is a multi-enzyme complex composed of four subunits, namely biotin carboxylase, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein, and the carboxyltransferase (CT) made up of the α and β subunits (1Sasaki Y. Konishi T. Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). In these subunits, the β subunit is encoded by the chloroplast genome, and the other three are encoded by the nuclear genome. In pea leaves, fatty acid synthesis is modulated by light/dark, presumably by regulation of the plastidic ACCase (5Sauer A. Heise K.-P. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biocsci. 1984; 39: 268-275Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that the redox cascade is involved in the light activation of pea plastidic ACCase (6Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Hatano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11096-11101Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and that CT, but not biotin carboxylase, is redox-regulated (7Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The activity of several chloroplast enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle is regulated by reversible disulfide-dithiol interchange (8Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar). During photosynthetic electron transport in the light, covalent redox modification mediated by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin signal transduction pathway leads to the reductive light activation of several stromal target enzymes. Thus, the ferredoxin-thioredoxin pathway links light and the Calvin cycle. We have proposed that this pathway also links light and fatty acid synthesis (6Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Hatano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11096-11101Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the proposition, it is necessary to identify the target cysteine residues responsive to redox. Previously we showed that pea recombinant CT expressed inEscherichia coli has properties similar to those of authentic CT and is redox-regulated (9Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Ohmori A. Iguchi H. Nagano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3937-3940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, using the recombinant enzyme, we designed experiments to determine the cysteine residues involved in redox regulation by site-directed mutagenesis and to determine the role of two subunits. There are 2 and 11 cysteines in the α and β polypeptides, respectively. We identified one cysteine in the α subunit and one cysteine in the β subunit involved in redox regulation and found an intermolecular disulfide bond between the nuclear-encoded subunit and the chloroplast-encoded subunit. These results observed in recombinant enzyme were consistent with the results of in vivo experiments. Probably such a disulfide bond is redox-regulated in response to light. RNA editing of the accD transcript encoding the β polypeptide is required for functional CT (9Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Ohmori A. Iguchi H. Nagano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3937-3940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The accD cDNA, but not the accD gene, was used for cloning. The cDNAs encoding the full-length α and β polypeptides in the pZErO-2 vector (Invitrogen) prepared previously (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were used as templates. The deleted accA (ΔaccA) cDNA encoding N-terminal 372 amino acid residues starting from the accurate N-terminal sequence lacking a transit peptide (Δα, Fig.1A) was amplified using forward primer PA01 (5′-TCATATGAAGTTGAGGAAGGTGAAGAGG-3′) and reverse primer PA03 (5′-CCGCTCGAG TTCTCC TTACCTCTTTTTCGTGTTGAC-3′). PA01 and PA03 have NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. PA03 has a ribosome binding site (italics) and a stop codon (bold). The deleted accD(ΔaccD) cDNA encoding C-terminal 371 amino acid residues (Δβ) starting from amino acid position 220 was amplified using forward primer PD03 (5′-CCGCTCGAGATGATGGAAAAATTAGCTCGTTTA-3′) and reverse primer PD02 (5′-CCGCTCAGC TTAAGTCAAAGGAACGAAACC-3′). PD03 and PD02 have XhoI and BlpI restriction sites, respectively, and a stop codon. The deleted accD cDNA encoding C-terminal 333 amino acid residues from 258 to 590, and lacking a domain CX 2CX 15CX 2C in the Δβ, was amplified using forward primer PD04 (5′-CCGCTCGAGATGAGCAGTTCAGATAGAATCGAC-3′) and reverse primer PD02. PCR was performed for 35 cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C) using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara) or for 35 cycles (15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 3 min at 65 °C) using KOD Plus (Toyobo). The final PCR products were purified and inserted into the EcoRV site of the pZErO-2 vector. The inserted sequences of the resultant plasmids were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using an automatic DNA sequencer (model LIC-400, Li-Cor, Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis of ΔaccA and ΔaccD cDNAs was introduced by PCR. The accAand accD cDNAs in the pZErO-2 vector (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were used as templates for the first and second PCRs, except for mutagenesis at Cys-230 or Cys-233. In the first PCR, the forward primer, PA01 for accA or PD01 (5′-CCGCTCGAGATGATAAATGAAGACCCATCTAG-3′) foraccD and reverse primers containing the desired mutation (“Reverse primer” in Table I) were used. In the second PCR, the forward primers (“Forward primer” in Table I), the compliment sequence of the reverse primer in Table I, and the reverse primer, PA02 (5′-CCGCTCGAG TTCTCC TTAAGAGAAGTTGCGATTTACACCAAC-3′) for accA and PD02 for accD were used. The first and second PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and subsequent extraction using the Sephaglas Band Prep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture containing the first and second PCR products was used as a template for the final PCR. The final PCR was performed using PA01 and PA03 for ΔaccA cDNA mutation and using PD03 and PD02 for ΔaccD cDNA mutation. To prepare a mutation at Cys-230 or Cys-233 in Δβ, the first PCR was done by forward primer containing parts of PD03 sequences (Table I) and by reverse primer PD02 using the accD cDNA in the pZErO-2 vector as a template. The second PCR was done by forward primer PD03 and reverse primer PD02 using the first PCR products as a template. For preparation of the mutants of full-length cDNA, the final PCR was performed using PA01 and PA02 for accA and using PD01 and PD02 foraccD. PCR, cloning, and sequence confirmation were performed as described for the deleted cDNAs.Table IPrimers for site-directed mutagenesiscDNAMutationForward primerReverse primerΔaccACys-247GCCATTGGAGCTGCTAATAAATTACGTAATTTATTAGCAGCTCCAATGGCCys-267CCAGAGGCAGCCGGTGCAATCTTGCAAGATTGCACCGGCTGCCTCTGGΔaccDCys-230ATGGAAAAATTAGCTCGTTTATGGGTTCAAGCCGCys-233ATGGAAAAATTAGCTCGTTTATGGGTTCAATGCGAAACTGCCTATGCys-249GAATATTGCCGAACACTGTGGCGCGCCACAGTGTTCGGCAATATTCCys-252GCGAACACGCTGGCGAGCATTTGCAAATGCTCGCCAGCGTGTTCGCCys-442CGGGTAGTATGGGAGCCGTAGTGGGTGAGCTCACCCACTACGGCTCCCATACTACCCGCys-466CCTCTTATTATAGTAGCTGCGTCCGGCCGGACGCAGCTACTATAATAAGAGGThe changes from the native sequence are given in bold letters.

The expression vector for the deletion mutant pHisΔAΔD (Fig. 2A) was constructed as described for the full-length CT (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For coexpression of the Δα and Δβ polypeptides to produce the CT complex in E. coli, ΔaccA and ΔaccD cDNAs were bicistronically inserted into the pET-19b vector containing a decahistidine tag (His tag), which allows a fused protein to be purified by a nickel column. First, the ΔaccD cDNA was ligated to the XhoI/BlpI site of pET-19b, and then the ΔaccA cDNA was ligated to theXhoI/NdeI sites of the pET-19b vector carrying the ΔaccD fragment. In the resultant pHisΔAΔD, the His tag was fused to the N terminus of the Δα polypeptide. The His tag was not removed from the recombinant Δα throughout the experiments. After transformation of the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Novagen) with the expression vectors, cells were grown in an LB medium, and the proteins were induced and purified according to the method described (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From the cell pellets of a 1-liter culture, about 3 mg of recombinant protein was obtained. The recombinant proteins of the full-length or the deleted wild-type CT were stable and stored at −80° C for characterization. The mutant proteins eluted from a nickel column with a solution containing 150 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) were unstable and were immediately used for the enzyme assay and SDS-PAGE. The deleted wild-type CT was dialyzed against the buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. Fifty µl of the dialysate (285 µg) was separated with a Superdex 200 column using a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (10Kozaki A.

The antibodies against the α polypeptide were also prepared using the method described (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The antibodies against the β polypeptide were prepared using an oligopeptide containing 15 amino acid residues from 399 to 413 of β polypeptide as described elsewhere (11Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CT activity was measured by the reverse reaction method as described elsewhere (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The carboxyl transfer from [2-14C]malonyl-CoA to biotin methyl ester was measured. The resultant [14C]acetyl-CoA was evaporated, and the residual [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was determined. A CT fraction in a total of 50 µl of reaction mixture (100 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8), 10 mm biotin methyl ester, 125 µm malonyl-CoA (0.64 kBq), 37.5 µg of bovine serum albumin) was incubated at 30 °C. After 0 and 20 min of incubation, 20 µl of the mixture was transferred to a tube containing 5 µl of 6 n HCl to terminate the reaction. The mixture was heated to dryness at 98 °C for 20 min in a draft chamber, dissolved in 25 µl of H2O, and applied to Whatman 3MM paper (1 × 1 cm). The difference between radioactivity at time zero and after 20 min of incubation was designated as CT activity. Specific activity is expressed as µmol/min/mg of protein. Proteins eluted from a nickel column (diluted to 1 mg/ml) were alkylated by incubating with 50 mm iodoacetic acid (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. The alkylated proteins were treated with an SDS sample loading buffer in the presence and absence of 720 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins (about 0.5 µg) were run on SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 10% gel for the deletion mutant and 5% gel for the full-length enzyme) and analyzed on immunoblots probed with either the anti-α polypeptide or the anti-β polypeptide IgG. Pea seedlings (Pisum sativum cv. Alaska) were grown in a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle at 23–25 °C. Plants (8 days old) were kept in darkness for 16 h (dark-adapted plants) and were then exposed to 2 h of white light at 60 µE/s/m2 (light-adapted plants). From the dark- or light-adapted plants, intact chloroplasts were isolated and ruptured as described previously (7Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All procedures for dark-adapted plants were performed in a dark room under a dim green safety light. The soluble proteins from the lysed extracts were precipitated by ammonium sulfate and stored at −80 °C until use. Pea CT and its recombinant enzyme were redox-regulated in vitro (6Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Hatano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11096-11101Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of redox-sensitive cysteines in the α and β polypeptides consisting of 825 and 590 amino acid residues, respectively. Fig.1 A shows schematically the position of cysteines deduced from pea accA andaccD cDNAs and the conserved domain in E. coli. N-terminal 310 amino acids of the pea α polypeptide were conserved in E. coli with 81% similarity (47% identity), and C-terminal 278 amino acids of the pea β polypeptide, excluding the reiterated sequence, were conserved in E. coli with 78% similarity (39% identity). The other domains absent from E. coli counterparts are not always conserved among plant proteins. There are two cysteines at positions 247 and 267 in the pea α polypeptide. Alignment shows that the sequences around these cysteines are highly conserved (Fig.2 B); Cys-247 is found in higher plants, and Cys-267 is found in all sequences available. In pea β polypeptides, there are 11 cysteines. Five of them in the N-terminal domain are not conserved among plant proteins (data not shown), but six cysteines in the C-terminal domain are considerably conserved. Four of them, at positions 230, 233, 249, and 252, are found in all the counterparts available and form a motif, CX 2CX 12–15CX 2C. Cysteine at position 442 is found only in pea, and cysteine at 466 is found in all photosynthetic organisms available. Taking into account the redox-insensitive properties of E. coli CT, such a sequence comparison does not directly predict the redox-sensitive cysteines in both the α and β polypeptides. There are 13 possible cysteines involved in redox regulation (Fig. 1 A), and we attempted to reduce them. To investigate whether the domains not conserved in E. coli, namely, the C-terminal half in the α subunit and the N-terminal half in the β subunit, are necessary for redox regulation, we prepared enzymes in which these sequences were deleted, using an expression plasmid, pHisΔAΔD (Fig. 2 A), and examined the redox sensitivity. The eluate partially purified by a nickel column showed redox-sensitive CT activity. The specific activity was 0.366 unit. The eluate exhibited three major bands of 52, 45, and 44 kDa by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 2 B). A band of 44 kDa reacted with antibodies against the α polypeptide, agreed with the calculated molecular mass, 44.3 kDa, and was identified as His tag Δα. Both 52- and 45-kDa bands reacted with antibodies against the β polypeptide. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the 52- and 45-kDa bands revealed that the 52-kDa band corresponded to the Δβ protein starting from the predicted first methionine at position 220 (Fig.1 B-b). The N-terminal sequence of the 45-kDa polypeptide started from serine at position 259, suggesting that the third methionine at position 258 was recognized as another starting point. The calculated molecular masses of the Δβ and a polypeptide starting from serine 259 (Δβ*) were 41.7 and 37 kDa, respectively, and the observed size was about 8–10 kDa larger than the calculated value. Such a shift in molecular mass on SDS-PAGE was observed for the full-length β subunit and was attributable to the intrinsic amino acid sequence (11Sasaki Y. Hakamada K. Suama Y. Nagano Y. Furusawa I. Matsuno R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25118-25123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Usually the 52-kDa band was denser than that of the 45 kDa, and Δβ was the major product. To estimate the molecular size of the deleted CT, the partially purified eluate was separated by gel filtration in the presence of DTT. The peak CT activity appeared in fraction 16. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblotting of separated fractions revealed a peak of His tag Δα, Δβ, and Δβ* polypeptides at fraction 16. A peak composed of only the His tag Δα polypeptide was not found, unlike the expression of full-length polypeptides (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that most of the expressed His tag Δα formed a complex with Δβ or Δβ*. The molecular size of the deletion mutant at fraction 16 estimated from the standard proteins was about 250 kDa and was approximately one-half the size of the full-length CT, 490 kDa. The calculated molecular mass of (His tag Δα)2Δβ2 was also approximately one-half that of the full-length CT, (His tag α)2β2, and the molecular composition of the deleted CT was probably (His tag Δα)2Δβ2 or (His tag Δα)2Δβ*2. Two forms of the deleted CT were obtained by expression of pHisΔAΔD. To determine the form(s) having CT activity, we constructed another plasmid to express Δα and Δβ* polypeptides starting from the methionine at position 258. The eluate obtained by expression of this plasmid showed no CT activity. This result indicates that the measurable activity by expression of pHisΔAΔD is the complex of His tag Δα with Δβ but not that of Δβ* polypeptides. The deleted sequences from 220 to 257, which contain a CX 2CX 12–15CX 2C motif conserved among all the β polypeptides, are required for catalytic activity but not for association with the Δα polypeptide. This is not a case in which a zinc finger motif is usually required for complex formation. It is likely that the CX 2CX 12–15CX 2C motif is important for catalytic activity. We examined the sensitivity of the deleted CT partially purified to the redox state and compared it with that of the full-length CT. In this experiment, the effect of a known reductant of S–S bonds, DTT, was tested. DTT activated the enzyme in a profile similar to that of the full-length enzyme (Fig. 2 D). The monothiol 2-mercaptoethanol did not activate the enzyme efficiently. These results indicate that the deletion mutant was sensitive to the redox state, like the full-length CT (9Sasaki Y. Kozaki A. Ohmori A. Iguchi H. Nagano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3937-3940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and that the redox-sensitive cysteines were located in the Δα and Δβ polypeptides. Thus, the deleted sequences, the C-terminal half of the α polypeptide, and the N-terminal half of the β polypeptide are not necessary for redox regulation and may have some other functions. The number of possible cysteines was reduced from 13 to 8. To identify the redox-sensitive cysteines in the deleted CT, a set of mutants, each with a single substitution of cysteine to alanine, was constructed, and the requirement of each mutant CT for DTT was tested. There were no significant differences in the efficiency of expression and purification of all mutants compared with the deleted wild-type enzyme. However, solubility differed with different mutant enzymes. Most mutant enzymes were precipitated under low ionic strength or by freezing. Therefore, each enzyme activity was determined using freshly eluted fraction from nickel column. The relative specific activity of mutants in either the presence or absence of 8 mm DTT was determined (TableII). The deleted CT is redox-sensitive, and if a cysteine involved in redox regulation is replaced, the resultant mutant enzyme is expected to be converted to a redox-insensitive form. We surveyed such an enzyme active in the absence of DTT. In the presence of DTT, the mutant proteins retained varying levels of activity. Substitutions of Cys-267 in Δα and Cys-466 in Δβ had modest effects, retaining more than 50% of the wild-type activity. Other mutant enzymes were more impaired, retaining only 0–30% of the wild-type activity, suggesting that alanine replacements of cysteine residues does not satisfy the structural requirements at these sites for enzyme folding and the substrate binding. In particular, Cys-233 or -252 in a CX 2CX 12–15CX 2C motif is probably required for catalytic activity. In the absence of DTT, only two mutants, the substitution of Cys-267 in the Δα and the substitution of Cys-442 in the Δβ polypeptides, were active and their activities were almost equal to those occurring in the presence of DTT. These results indicate that Cys-267 in Δα and Cys-442 in Δβ are required for redox regulation.Table IICT activity of cysteine to alanine mutantsPosition of cysteine replaced by alanineRelative activity−DTT+DTTDeleted CTNone (wild type)0100α 247032α 2676277β 23008β 23303.7β 249018β 25200β 44266β 466051Full-length CTNone (wild type)0100α 2672.45.7β 4421.22.4Specific activities of 100% of the deleted CT and the full-length CT in the presence of 8 mm DTT were 0.366 and 0.151 unit, respectively. Each value represents the average of three independent measurements at two enzyme concentrations (S.D. range 10%). Open table in a new tab Specific activities of 100% of the deleted CT and the full-length CT in the presence of 8 mm DTT were 0.366 and 0.151 unit, respectively. Each value represents the average of three independent measurements at two enzyme concentrations (S.D. range 10%). To confirm the role of the two cysteines at the same position in the full-length CT, we generated mutant enzymes with a substitution of cysteine by alanine and measured their activity (Table II). Although the CT activity was low, measurable activity was found in the absence of DTT, indicating that Cys-267 in the α subunit or Cys-442 in the β subunit is required for redox sensitivity and that the redox sensitivity of the full-length enzyme is probably mediated exclusively through these two cysteines. The molecular size of the deleted CT is about half that of the full-length CT, and the specific activity of the deleted CT corrected for the difference of molecular size was comparable with that of the full-length. The extra sequences, the C-terminal region of the α polypeptide and the N-terminal region of the β polypeptide (Fig. 1 A), do not play an important role for exhibition of the enzyme activity. The low activity of these mutants suggests that the replacement of the cysteine by alanine may bring about inappropriate conformation for catalytic activity, probably by interacting with the extra sequences of the full-length CT. The interaction, which does not occur in the wild-type full-length enzyme, is somehow harmful for the expression of the full activity by preventing efficient substrate binding or subunit-subunit interaction. Each subunit had only one cysteine responsive to redox, suggesting that an intermolecular but not an intramolecular disulfide bond is formed under nonreduced conditions. The molecular composition of CT is probably α2β2, and there are possible intermolecular disulfide bonds between homodimers or heterodimers. To determine which type of S–S bond was formed, SDS-PAGE analysis of several recombinant enzymes was performed in the presence or absence of the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. To prevent rearrangement of disulfide bonds during treatment with a sample loading buffer, SH groups were alkylated with iodoacetic acid. The modified proteins were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol and probed with antibodies against the α or β polypeptides (Fig. 3). When the deleted wild-type enzyme was analyzed, the band of His tag Δα (44 kDa) observed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol was partly shifted to about 125 kDa in its absence (Fig. 3 a). The bands of Δβ (52 kDa) and Δβ* (45 kDa) were also shifted to about 125 kDa. These results suggest that both the His tag Δα and Δβ polypeptides formed intermolecular S–S bonds, probably between His tag Δα and Δβ or Δβ*. The apparent molecular mass, about 125 kDa, was larger than the sum of the two bands, probably because of the slow migration of this alkylated and S-S-bonded polypeptide. To further confirm the S–S bond between the two molecules, a CT enzyme consisting of a full-length α and Δβ was expressed, and the intermolecular S–S bond was analyzed (Fig. 3 b). In this enzyme, the α polypeptide is twice as large as Δα, and we expected shifted bands larger than 125 kDa, which would react with both anti-α and anti-β polypeptide antibodies. The number of cysteine residues was the same as that of the deleted wild-type CT, and its redox sensitivity was similar to that of the wild type (data not shown). In the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, both anti-α and anti-β polypeptide IgG reacted with the two shifted bands at ∼200 kDa, supporting the idea that the α polypeptide formed an S–S bond with Δβ or Δβ* under nonreducing conditions, although the apparent molecular size of the shifted bands was again larger than the sum of the two polypeptides. These results support the idea that the shifted bands are heterodimers of His tags α and Δβ or Δβ* and suggest that the S–S bond is formed between Cys-267 in α and Cys-442 in Δβ or Δβ*. To confirm the presence of the S–S bond in full-length wild-type CT, we analyzed the CT under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3 c). The shifted bands of about 230 kDa were observed in both α and β polypeptides, supporting the idea that the S–S bond was formed in full-length CT as expected. The shifted minor bands probably resulted from the β polypeptide, starting from the second and third methionine of the β polypeptide. The remaining α polypeptide was the polypeptide expressed in excess not associated with the β polypeptide (10Kozaki A. Kamada K. Nagano Y. Iguchi H. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If the disulfide bond is formed between Cys-267 in the Δα and Cys-442 in the Δβ or Δβ*, mutation of these cysteines breaks the disulfide bond and results in the loss of the shifted band under nonreducing conditions. We analyzed the mutants and found that the molecular size of the polypeptides is the same in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. We lost the shifted heterodimer bands of His tags Δα and Δβ or Δβ* under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3, d and e). The results indicate that each cysteine is necessary for an intermolecular S–S bond and that a critical disulfide bond is formed between Cys-267 in the α subunit and Cys-442 in the β subunit. We have shown previously that ACCase from light-adapted plants is in a much more reduced form than that from dark-adapted plants and that light-dependent reduction of ACCase occurs in vivo (7Kozaki A. Sasaki Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To ensure that the results observed in the recombinant enzyme (Fig. 3) were applied in vivo, we examined disulfide bridge formation in the enzyme by immunoblots of extracts from plants in light or dark (Fig. 4). The shifted bands of about 230 kDa were observed in both α and β polypeptides in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that both the α and β polypeptides formed a S–S bond in vivo. The disulfide form of about 230 kDa was more abundant in the dark-adapted plants than in the light-adapted plants; the reverse was found for thiol forms of about 98 kDa for α polypeptide and 90 kDa for β polypeptide, suggesting that a light-dependent reduction of the disulfide bond indeed occurred in vivo. Probably the thiol-disulfide exchange observed in vitro is relevantin vivo, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that a different set of cysteine residues is involved in the S–S bond in vivo. The experiments reported here show that the two cysteines, Cys-267 in the Δα polypeptide and Cys-442 in the Δβ polypeptide, are required for redox regulation of the recombinant CT. The observation appears to be relevant in vivo, and the two cysteines are likely involved in the reductive activation of CT, and therefore in that of ACCase, by disulfide-dithiol interchange. In the light, electrons from photosystem I are shuttled through the electron transport chain to ferredoxin and are transferred to thioredoxins by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase and then to ACCase, reducing the disulfide bonds in the CT and resulting in the light activation of fatty acid synthesis. All of the polypeptides encoded by the chloroplast genome form a functional complex with polypeptides encoded by the nuclear genome. For example, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, RNA polymerase, Clp protease, and ATP synthase are composed of chloroplast-encoded and nuclear-encoded polypeptides (12Martin W. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, the catalytic or structural polypeptides are encoded by the chloroplast genome, and the regulatory polypeptides are encoded by the nuclear genome. The same may be true for pea CT, although further experiments are needed to characterize the precise function of the two subunits. The chloroplast-encoded β polypeptide has catalytic and regulatory functions, and the nuclear-encoded α polypeptide has a regulatory function. To date, we do not know the molecular interaction between catalytic and regulatory polypeptides. A new finding obtained in our experiments indicates that molecular interaction of the two polypeptides is characterized as follows: the nuclear-encoded polypeptide forms a covalent bond with the chloroplast-encoded polypeptide and thereby changes enzyme activity. There are several chloroplast enzymes activated by thioredoxin (13Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. Annu Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), including fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase, ATP synthase, NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase activase. The cysteine residues involved in redox regulation are identified by site-directed mutagenesis, and some consensus motifs among plants have been found for each enzyme. However, a consensus motif among enzymes has not yet been found. A comparison of the primary sequences of these enzymes with redox-insensitive cytosolic isoforms or with the redox-insensitive counterpart from different organisms reveals that the redox-sensitive cysteines are located on extra loops or extensions (14Rulland E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Light-regulated NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase possesses sequence extensions at both the N- and C-terminal ends compared with the constitutive active counterpart and two cysteines at the N terminus and two cysteines at the C terminus are involved in redox regulation (15Issakidis R. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.-P. Cretin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.-P. Cretin C. Gadal P. Migniac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroplast fructose bisphosphatase possesses an insertion containing three cysteines compared with the constitutive active cytosolic enzyme and two of them are involved in redox regulation (17Jacquot J.-P. Lopez-Jaramillo J. Chueca A. Cherfils J. Lemaire S. Chedozeau B. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Wolosiuk R. Lopez-George J. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to these enzymes, different features are found for pea ACCase. First, the molecular structure of pea chloroplast ACCase differs considerably from redox-insensitive cytosolic ACCase (1Sasaki Y. Konishi T. Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), and we cannot propose a possible origin of redox-sensitive cysteines, although there are some similarities in their CT domains. Second, the regulatory cysteine in the α polypeptide is not located in the plant-specific extra domains but in domains conserved among organisms, reflecting the differences from other chloroplast enzymes in terms of the evolutionary origin of redox sensitivity. Third, intermolecular disulfide bonds among different polypeptides are involved in redox regulation, whereas intramolecular disulfide bonds are involved in the other chloroplast enzymes. Available sequence data show that the Cys-267 in the α polypeptide is conserved among organisms but the Cys-442 in the β polypeptide is found only in pea. Other organisms have a serine at this position. Replacement of Cys-442 by serine resulted in CT with very low activity (data not shown) suggesting that Cys-442 is important for pea CT. At present, we cannot propose a possible consensus sequence of CT for redox regulation. There is a possibility that this type of redox regulation is unique to the pea, although spinach (19Hunter S.C. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and tobacco ACCases 2Y. Madoka, and Y. Sasaki, unpublished observation. are redox-regulated, and another set of cysteines may be responsible in other species. In the case of sedoheptulose bisphosphatase, the redox-sensitive cysteines of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were predicted to be different from those of plants (20Anderson L.E. Huppe H.C. Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Plant J. 1996; 10: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Replacement of Cys-247 or -267 in the α polypeptide by serine resulted in mutants of low activity, less than 3% of the deleted wild-type (data not shown), whereas the corresponding replacements by alanine residues allowed the more active CT, about 30–80% of the wild-type (Table II). Serine residues at these positions are not compatible with the formation of a functional complex of CT activity, but alanine replacement of Cys-247 or Cys-267 satisfies the structural requirement at these sites for CT folding and stability. Similar results were obtained for replacement of the cysteine by serine in the β polypeptide. Serine is a hydrophilic amino acid, and alanine, like cysteine, is hydrophobic. It is likely that the hydrophobicity of cysteine plays an important role in the functional folding of CT. Such results were reported for rhodopsin (21Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and small soluble proteins such as trypsin inhibitor (22Staley J.S. Kim P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and lysozyme (23Inaka K. Taniyama Y. Kikuchi M. Morikawa K. Matsushima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12599-12603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A conserved motif, CX 2CX 12–15CX 2C, forms a putative zinc finger motif. The deletion of this domain suggests that this motif is required for catalytic activity, probably binding metal ions. A preliminary experiment to identify the metal ion by flame reaction showed the presence of Zn but not of Fe. 3A. Kozaki, K. Mayumi, and Y. Sasaki, unpublished observation.

https://openalex.org/W2104162870,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are crucial for many aspects of development, growth, and metabolism yet control of their activity by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) remains controversial. The effect of IGFBP-1 depends on its phosphorylation status; phosphorylated IGFBP-1 inhibits IGF actions whereas the nonphosphorylated isoform is stimulatory. In order to understand this phenomenon, we purified phosphorylated IGFBP-1 from normal human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography. Unexpectedly, the resulting preparation enhanced IGF-stimulated 3T3-L1 fibroblast proliferation, due to the presence of a co-purified protein of ≈700 kDa. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry and Western immunoblotting analysis identified this co-purified protein as α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (α<sub>2</sub>M). Anti-α<sub>2</sub>M antibodies co-immunoprecipitated IGFBP-1 from human plasma and from<sup>125</sup>I-IGFBP-1·α<sub>2</sub>M complexes formed <i>in vitro</i>. The <sup>125</sup>I-IGFBP-1/α<sub>2</sub>M association could be inhibited with excess unlabeled IGFBP-1. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that α<sub>2</sub>M preferentially associates with the phosphorylated isoform of IGFBP-1 and that when complexed to α<sub>2</sub>M, IGFBP-1 can still bind IGF-I. These findings have functional significance since α<sub>2</sub>M protects IGFBP-1 from proteolysis and abrogates the inhibitory effect of phosphorylated IGFBP-1 on IGF-I stimulated 3T3-L1 cell proliferation. We conclude that α<sub>2</sub>M is a binding protein of IGFBP-1 which modifies IGF-I/IGFBP-1 actions resulting in enhanced IGF effects. In line with its role in regulating the clearance and activity of other growth factors, we predict that α<sub>2</sub>M has a novel and important role in controlling the transport and biological activity of IGFs."

https://openalex.org/W2025663558,"The crystal structure of Escherichia coli 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) in complex with MgADP has been determined at 1.5-Å resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 0.191. The solution structure of HPPK in complex with Mg2+ and β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (MgAMPPCP) has been determined using a simulated annealing protocol with 3,523 experimental NMR restraints. The root mean square deviation of the ensemble of 20 refined conformers that represent the solution structure from the mean coordinate set derived from them is 0.74 ± 0.26 Å for all backbone atoms and 0.49 ± 0.22 Å when residues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91 are excluded. Binding of MgADP causes significant changes in the conformation and dynamical property of three loops of HPPK that are involved in catalysis. A dramatic, unusual conformational change is that loop 3 moves away from the active center significantly with some residues moving by >17 Å. The binding of MgADP also stabilizes loop 1 and loop 3 but makes loop 2 more mobile. Very similar conformational and dynamical changes are observed in the NMR solution structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP. The conformational and dynamical changes may play important roles in both substrate binding and product release in the catalytic cycle. The crystal structure of Escherichia coli 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) in complex with MgADP has been determined at 1.5-Å resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 0.191. The solution structure of HPPK in complex with Mg2+ and β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (MgAMPPCP) has been determined using a simulated annealing protocol with 3,523 experimental NMR restraints. The root mean square deviation of the ensemble of 20 refined conformers that represent the solution structure from the mean coordinate set derived from them is 0.74 ± 0.26 Å for all backbone atoms and 0.49 ± 0.22 Å when residues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91 are excluded. Binding of MgADP causes significant changes in the conformation and dynamical property of three loops of HPPK that are involved in catalysis. A dramatic, unusual conformational change is that loop 3 moves away from the active center significantly with some residues moving by >17 Å. The binding of MgADP also stabilizes loop 1 and loop 3 but makes loop 2 more mobile. Very similar conformational and dynamical changes are observed in the NMR solution structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP. The conformational and dynamical changes may play important roles in both substrate binding and product release in the catalytic cycle. 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear Overhauser effect nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy root mean square deviation 6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK)1 catalyzes the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (HP, Scheme FSI), leading to the biosynthesis of folate cofactors (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the folate pathway is essential for microorganisms but absent from mammals, HPPK, like other enzymes in the pathway, is an important target for developing antimicrobial agents. HPPK belongs to a class of enzymes that catalyze the pyrophosphoryl transfer reaction (2Switzer R.L. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974: 607-629Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of many kinases that catalyze monophosphoryl transfer have been extensively characterized, little is known about the mechanisms of pyrophosphokinases. As a small (158 residues, ∼18 kDa), stable, monomeric protein, Escherichia coli HPPK is an excellent model system for studying the mechanisms of enzymatic pyrophosphoryl transfer. We have recently determined the crystal structures of ligand-free (apo-) E. coli HPPK (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and its complex with HP, α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMPCPP), and two Mg2+ ions (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) at 1.5 and 1.25 Å resolution, respectively. Hennig and co-workers (4Hennig M. Dale G.E. D'Arcy A. Danel F. Fischer S. Gray C.P. Jolidon S. Müller F. Page M.G.P. Pattison P. Oefner C. J. Mol.

Stammers and co-workers (5Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have determined the crystal structure of E. coli HPPK in complex with an HP analog, ATP, and two Mg2+ ions at 2.00-Å resolution. Comparative analysis of the crystal structures of the apo-HPPK and its ternary complex has revealed the interactions of the enzyme with the substrates at the atomic resolution and the dramatic substrate-induced conformational changes involving three catalytic loops (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It appears that the complete active center of HPPK is assembled only after both substrates bind to the enzyme. However, how the catalytic center is assembled is not known. It appears that some catalytic residues cannot move into their catalytic positions because of steric constraints. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of HPPK·MgADP at 1.5-Å resolution and the NMR solution structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP. The two structures reveal a dramatic, unusual movement of loop 3 and other significant changes in the conformation and dynamical property of HPPK. The dramatic substrate-induced movement of loop 3 is unusual because it moves away from the active center. Comparative structural analysis suggests that the structures reported here may represent an intermediate conformation required for both substrate binding and product release in the catalytic cycle. E. coli HPPK was purified as previously described (6Shi G. Gong Y. Savchenko A. Zeikus J.G. Xiao B. Ji X. Yan H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Crystals of HPPK·MgADP were grown in hanging drops at 19 ± 1 °C. The protein solution contained 4 mg/ml HPPK, 5 mm MgATP in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and the reservoir contained 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m NaAc in 0.2 mTris buffer (pH 8.5). The 4-µl hanging drops contained equal volumes (2 µl) of protein solution and reservoir solution. Two rounds of seeding produced diffraction-quality crystals. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) on a MarResearch image plate system at 100 K maintained with an Oxford Cryosystem. The crystal diffracted to 1.5 Å. X-ray data were processed using HKL2000 (7Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to space groupC 2 with unit-cell dimensions a = 79.12, b = 52.84, c = 36.63 Å, and β = 103.44°. Data collection and statistics are summarized in Table I. The asymmetric unit contains one complex, and the crystal contains ∼38% solvent. The structure was solved with the molecular replacement technique using AmoRe (8Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The apo-HPPK structure (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used as the search model after the solvent molecules were removed. Model building and adjustment were carried out with the program O (9Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Initial refinement was done with X-PLOR (10Brünger A.T. Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the final stage of the refinement was done with SHELXL-97 (11Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). All data within the resolution range of 20–1.5 Å were used with 21,914 reflections (∼95%) for structure refinement and 1,114 reflections (∼5%) for R free calculations. Residues 44–48 of loop 2 were not included in the refinement due to the lack of electron density. The peptide chain containing residues 85 and 86 was built with two distinct conformations based on the difference electron densities. The two conformations were assigned equal probabilities, which were verified by the comparable temperature factors resulting from subsequent refinement. The final R free was 0.263, and the crystallographic R factor was 0.191 for all reflections within 20.0 and 1.5 Å (Table II). The structure was assessed using PROCHECK (12Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), showing that 92.5% of the residues are in the most favored regions and no residue falls into disallowed regions on the Ramachandran plot.Table ISummary of x-ray data collection for the HPPK·MgADP complexX-ray source (rotating anode)X9B, NSLS, BNLDetector (image plate system)MarResearch (345)D min(Å)1.5No. of measurements83,381No. of unique reflections23,029Redundancy3.6Overall completeness (%)97.7Last shell completeness (%)85.4OverallI/ς(I)18.6Last shellI/ς(I)1.97R scaling1-aRscaling = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI.

Open table in a new tab Sequential resonance assignments have been previously reported (13Shi G. Gao J. Yan H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The NMR samples contained ∼1.5 mm HPPK, 8 mm AMPPCP, and 40 mmMgCl2 in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (pH meter reading without correction for isotope effects). All NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer. Approximate interproton distance restraints for the NMR structure determination were derived from the NOE data, including homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C/15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. The mixing time was 150 ms for all the NOESY experiments. Most of the NOE cross-peaks were picked from three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and13C/15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra using the program NMRView (version 4.0.3) (14Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Only a few NOE-cross peaks involving aromatic protons were picked from the homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY spectrum. The integrated peak volumes were converted into approximate interproton distances by normalizing them against the calibrated volumes of NOE peaks between backbone protons within the identified β-sheet regions. The upper limits of the interproton distances were calibrated according to the equationV a = V b(r b/r a)6, where V a and V b were the volumes and r a and r b the distances. The distance bounds were set to 1.8–2.7 Å (1.8–2.8 Å for NOE cross-peaks involving amide protons), 1.8–3.3 Å (1.8–3.5 Å for NOE cross-peaks involving amide protons), 1.8–5.0 Å (1.8–6.0 Å for NOE cross-peaks involving amide protons) and 1.8–6.0 Å (1.8–7.0 Å for NOE cross-peaks involving amide protons) corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs, respectively. Pseudoatom corrections were made for nonstereospecifically assigned methylene and methyl resonances (15Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). An additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper bounds for methyl protons. Structure calculations were performed on a Sun Ultra 1 work station using the program CNS (version 0.9) (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallog. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) with the provided CNS task files. Preliminary structures were calculated with a hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol based on the CNS task file dg_sa.inp. Final structures were calculated with an ab initio simulated annealing protocol based on the CNS task file anneal.inp. MgAMPPCP was not included in the structure calculations. An iterative strategy was used for structure refinement. In each round of structure refinement, newly computed NMR structures were employed to assign more NOE restraints, to correct wrong assignments, and to loosen the NOE distance bounds if spectral overlapping was deduced. Another round of structure refinement was then carried out with the modified NMR restraints. A total of 50 structures were generated. Twenty structures with no NOE violations >0.25 Å were selected for analysis by the programs INSIGHT II (version 97) (Molecular Simulations) and PROCHECK-NMR (version 3.4.4) (17Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). The crystal structure of E. coliHPPK in complex with MgADP (Fig.1a) contains 153 of 158 amino acid residues of the polypeptide chain (residues 44–48 are disordered), one Mg2+ ion, one ADP molecule, one phosphate ion, and 258 water molecules (Table II). As revealed by our apo-structure (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), HPPK has a three-layered αβα fold formed by six β strands and four α-helices in the sequence β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β4-β5-β6-α3-α4 (Fig.1 a). In the center, the six β-strands are organized into an antiparallel β-sheet (β2, β3, β1, and β4) and a β-hairpin (β6 and β5). The angle between the adjacent β4 and β6 is ∼70°. On each side of the central β structure, there are two α-helices. Residues 44–48 in loop 2 are completely disordered, and their occupancy factors are set to zero, as indicated with thedashed line in Fig. 1 a. Two conformations are observed for residues 85 and 86 in loop 3. Although the crystallization was carried out with the presence of MgATP, MgADP (Fig. 1 b) was found in the structure of the complex apparently due to the hydrolysis of the nucleotide. As previously predicted (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and observed (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the adenine base of ADP is positioned in the V-shaped cleft between β4 and β6 and the ribose and pyrophosphate extend along the valley and across β4 and β1 (Fig. 1 a). Two conformations of the ADP molecule are found to have equal probabilities (Fig. 1 b). A few water molecules and a phosphate ion occupy the HP-binding site. The crystallographic R factor is 0.191, and theR free is 0.263 for reflections within the resolution range 20.0–1.5 Å (Table II). The bound ADP has two conformations. The major differences are the positions of the α- and β-phosphates (Fig. 1 b). Fig. 2illustrates the interactions between HPPK and the bound ADP. The binding of the adenosine moiety to HPPK is essentially the same for both ADP conformations, whereas the phosphate chain interacts with the protein with significant differences. For both conformations of the ADP molecule, the adenine base has four strong electrostatic interactions with the protein: N1···N(Ile98), N6···O(Ile98), N6···O(Thr112), and N7···N(Thr112). In addition, residues Leu70, Leu111, His115, and Tyr116 provide hydrophobic interactions with the base, and the sugar moiety has one strong electrostatic interaction with the protein, O2*···O(R110) (Fig. 2). Thus, the adenine is held tightly in the V-shaped cleft between β4 and β6 (Fig.1 a). The phosphate-protein interaction shows significant differences between the two conformations, although some similarities are also found. For both conformations, the β-phosphate oxygen atoms interact with Glu77 through Mg2+ and also interact with Asp97 (Fig. 2). However, the side chains of Asp95 and Arg92 interact with the phosphate groups in conformation b, but not in conformation a (Fig. 2). Arg92 forms a strong and a weak hydrogen bond with O1B (2.4 Å) and O1A (3.2 Å), respectively. Although the core structures of apo-HPPK (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and HPPK·MgADP (this work) are essentially the same, the conformations of the three flexible loops are significantly different. Fig.3a shows the superposition of the Cα traces of the two structures optimized for 131 out of 158 pairs of Cα atoms. Twenty-seven pairs are excluded for optimization: residues 10–13, 44–53, 81–92, and 149. Residues 10–13 reside in loop 1, which has two conformations in apo-HPPK (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas, in HPPK·MgADP, loop 1 assumes one conformation that is not any of the two conformations in the apo-structure. Residues 44–48 are completely disordered. Although residues 49–53 have a defined conformation, it is different from the conformation of loop 2 in the apo-enzyme. The most striking difference is in loop 3 (residues 81–92) that assumes an even more open conformation in HPPK·MgADP than in apo-HPPK. The Cα atom of Glu87 of loop 3 in HPPK·MgADP is 18.4 Å away from the corresponding atom in apo-HPPK. Recently we have determined the crystal structure of HPPK in complex with HP, AMPCPP (an analogue of ATP), and two Mg2+ions (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The complex represents a close mimic of a state in which the enzyme is bound with both substrates and two Mg2+ ions required for catalysis. Fig. 3 b shows the superposition of the Cα trace of HPPK·MgADP with that of HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP. The residues that belong to loops 1–3 (Fig.1 a) are excluded for the optimization. The two structures are superimposed very well with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.41 Å for the Cα atoms of the optimized residues. The conformations of the three loops are strikingly different between the two structures. When MgADP binds to HPPK, loop 1 moves toward loop 2, whereas loop 3 moves dramatically away from the active center (Fig.3 a). In contrast, when both HP and AMPCPP bind to HPPK, loop 1 moves toward loop 3; both loops 2 and 3 move down toward the active center (Fig. 3 b). Part of loop 2 is disordered in HPPK·MgADP, but the entire loop 2 is well defined in HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP. The largest difference between the two structures is 6.0 Å for loop 1 and 23.4 Å for loop 3, as measured by their Cα atom positions of Ala12 and Glu87, respectively. The adenosine moieties of the bound nucleotides in the two structures are superimposed well, but the conformations of the phosphate moieties are significantly different between the two structures. Stammer and co-workers (5Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have determined the crystal structure of HPPK in complex with ATP, two Mg2+ions and an HP analog, of which the overall conformation is very similar to that of HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A total of 3,523 structurally useful distance restraints were obtained from the analyses of the homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY (D2O) and three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and13C/15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (TableIII). Of the NOE restraints, 1,129 were derived from long range NOEs. On average, each residue had ∼22 NOE restraints. The distribution of the NOE restraints is shown in Fig.4. Twenty structures with no NOE violations of >0.25 Å are shown in Fig.5a. The statistics of the structures are summarized in Table III. Except for residues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91, the structures are well defined (Fig. 5 a). The precision of the structures (r.m.s.d. of the 20 coordinates) is 0.77 Å for the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C, O) and 1.17 Å for all heavy atoms. When residues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91 are excluded, the precision of the structures is 0.49 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.88 Å for all heavy atoms. The distribution of the average r.m.s.d. calculated for the backbone heavy atoms is shown in Fig. 5 b. The average r.m.s.d. values of the backbone atoms are 1.63, 2.05, and 1.70 Å for residues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91, respectively.Table IIIRestraints and structural statistics for the solution structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCPRestraints for structure calculationsTotal NOE restraints3523Intraresidue573Sequential1006Medium range (2 ≤ ‖i − j‖ ≤ 4)815Long range (‖i − j‖ > 4)1129Statistics for structure calculations{SA}3-a{SA} represents the ensemble of 20 simulated annealing structures.{SA}r3-b{SA}r represents the restrained minimized mean structure obtained by restrained regularization of the mean structure, which is obtained by averaging the coordinates of the individual SA structures best fitted to each other.NOE violations (>0.25 Å)00RMSD from distance restraints (Å)0.0115 ± 0.00040.01RMSD from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.002 ± 0.000060.002Angle (°)0.357 ± 0.00560.356Impropers (°)0.227 ± 0.0060.221X-PLOR potential energies (kcal/mol)E total206.1 ± 8.34196.9E NOE34.8 ± 2.2332.3E vdw59.8 ± 4.8852.1E impr 3-cEimpr, is the energy derived from improper torsions.10.5 ± 0.589.94Ramachandran plot statistics3-dThe Ramachandran plot statistics were obtained from the PROCHECK-NMR analysis.Residues in most favored regions66.9%68.4%Residues in additionally allowed regions30.3%29.4%Residues in generously allowed regions2.8%2.2%Residues in disallowed regions0.0%0.0%r.m.s.d. of atomic coordinates (Å){SA}versus{SA}rBackbone atomsAll heavy atomsAll residues0.74 ± 0.261.17 ± 0.36Selected region3-eResidues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91 were excluded from the r.m.s.d. calculations.0.49 ± 0.220.88 ± 0.273-a {SA} represents the ensemble of 20 simulated annealing structures.3-b {SA}r represents the restrained minimized mean structure obtained by restrained regularization of the mean structure, which is obtained by averaging the coordinates of the individual SA structures best fitted to each other.3-c Eimpr, is the energy derived from improper torsions.3-d The Ramachandran plot statistics were obtained from the PROCHECK-NMR analysis.3-e Residues Pro14, Pro44–Gln50, and Arg84–Pro91 were excluded from the r.m.s.d. calculations.

The NMR structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP can be superimposed with the crystal structure of apo-HPPK with an average Cα deviation of 1.85 Å. The major conformational differences are located in loops 1 and 3, and the largest conformational difference is found in loop 3. When the two loops are excluded, the average Cα deviation between the two structures is 1.06 Å. The average Cα deviation between the two structures is 2.86 Å for loop 1 and 9.94 Å for loop 3. The largest Cα deviation is 18.49 Å for the Cα atom of Glu87. In comparison with the crystal structure of apo-HPPK, loop 1 in the NMR structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP moves toward loop 2, and loop 3 moves away from the active center. Although these loops are less well defined in the NMR structure, the conformational differences in these loops between the NMR structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP and the crystal structure of apo-HPPK are significant because they are much larger than the variations of the ensemble of the 20 NMR structures. The NMR solution structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP is rather similar to the crystal structure of HPPK·MgADP (Fig.6). The two structures can be superimposed with an average Cα deviation of 1.11 Å. No Cα deviations, except those of Pro14, Ala86, and Glu87, exceed 2.59 Å. The Cα deviations of Pro14, Ala87, and Glu87 are 5.68, 4.23, and 4.89 Å, respectively. It is clear that MgAMPPCP and MgADP induce very similar conformational changes in HPPK. In both structures, loop 1 moves toward loop 2, and loop 3 moves away from the active center. However, the magnitude of the movement is larger in the NMR structure. The binding of MgADP or MgAMPPCP causes significant changes in the conformations of three catalytic loops in HPPK. The movement of loop 3 is unusual and dramatic. First, the magnitude of the movement is large. In comparison with the crystal structure of apo-HPPK (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the Cα atoms of loop 3 move by as far as ∼17 Å. Movements of such a magnitude are usually observed in substrate-induced domain closure. Second, the loop moves away from the active center rather than moving in and closing the active center as usually observed in substrate-induced fit. Are the dramatic conformational changes of loop 3 real? The fact that virtually identical loop movements were observed in both crystal and NMR structures indicates that the unusual loop movements indeed occur in solution. To our knowledge, these are the first structures showing that a catalytic loop moves a long distance away from the active center of an enzyme upon the binding of a ligand. The unusual conformational changes of loop 3 cannot be discovered by comparing the crystal structures of apo-HPPK (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the ternary complex HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X.

Fig. 7shows a plot of the B-factors of the main-chain atoms of the crystal structures of apo-HPPK (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), HPPK·MgADP (this work), and HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Clearly, loops 2 and 3 in apo-HPPK have much higher B values than the rest of the molecule (green line), indicating that the two loops have high mobility. When HPPK is bound with HP, AMPCPP, and two Mg2+ ions, mimicking the catalytic ternary complex, the B-factors of all residues, except a few in the C-terminal region, decrease significantly. The B-factors of loop 2 fall into the average range. The B-factors of loop 3 as well as the C-terminal region are slightly higher than the average B value, but they are within the range of the average B value of apo-HPPK. The B-factor profile of HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP suggests that HPPK becomes much more rigid when both substrates and cofactors are bound. Although loop 3 and the C-terminal region in HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP are slightly more mobile than the rest of the molecule, they are not more mobile than the rigid portion of apo-HPPK. The B-factor profile of HPPK·MgADP is rather interesting. The average B value of HPPK·MgADP is about the same as that of apo-HPPK. The B factors of loops 1 and 3 are significantly lower than those of apo-HPPK, suggesting that binding of MgADP stabilizes loops 1 and 3. In contrast, residues 44–48 of loop 2 are completely disordered, suggesting that binding of MgADP makes loop 2 more mobile. Similar dynamical changes have been observed in our NMR studies of HPPK. Briefly, loops 1 and 2 of apo-HPPK had weak cross-peaks and loop 3 showed no cross-peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (13Shi G. Gao J. Yan H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the diminution or disappearance of these cross-peaks was caused by water saturation because the HSQC spectrum was recorded with a “water flip-back” pulse sequence designed to minimize water saturation and dephasing (18Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 19Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Rather, it suggests that these loops are flexible and undergo conformational exchange (20Wang L. Li Y. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Yan H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12727-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the presence of MgAMPPCP, all residues of loop 3 showed cross-peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. However, the intensities of some cross-peaks of loops 1 and 2 became weaker in the presence of MgAMPPCP. The result suggests that upon the binding of MgAMPPCP, loop 3 is stabilized but loops 1 and 2 become more mobile. 15N relaxation analysis is under way to characterize quantitatively the motional properties of HPPK in various forms. We have shown by comparing the crystal structures of apo-HPPK and the ternary complex that the catalytic center of HPPK is assembled only upon the binding of both substrates (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, how the catalytic center is assembled is not clear from comparing the two crystal structures. In apo-form, the side chains of several strictly conserved residues (Gln50, Arg82, and Arg92) point away from the active center (Fig.8a) (1Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It appears that the side chains of the two arginine residues, especially Arg92, cannot move into the active center without first opening loop 3 (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, additional conformational changes are required during the assembling of the catalytic center. The crystal structure of HPPK·MgADP and the solution structure of HPPK·MgAMPPCP may represent the intermediate conformations required for assembling the catalytic center. The idea is consistent with the ordered bi-bi mechanism suggested by Bermingham and co-workers (21Bermingham A. Bottomley J.R. Primrose W.U. Derrick J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). With the further opening of loop 3, Arg92 is able to move into the active center without steric clashes. Loop 3 stays in the intermediate conformation, partly due to the formation of a short hydrogen bond between Arg92 and Asp95 (Fig.8 b). The distance between the two heavy atoms that are involved in the hydrogen bond (NH2 of R92 and OD1 of D95) is 2.68 Å in the crystal structure of HPPK·MgADP. The conformation of the carboxyl group of Asp95 in HPPK·MgADP is very similar to that in apo-HPPK. In the ternary complex (HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP), however, the carboxyl group of Asp95 moves down so that the guanidinium group of Arg92 is able to move further into the active center. The key elements responsible for pulling down the carboxyl group of Asp95 appear to be the two bound Mg2+ ions. One Mg2+ is coordinated with the α- and β-phosphoryl groups of ATP, and the other with the β- and γ-phosphoryl groups of ATP and the hydroxyl group of HP (3Blaszczyk J. Shi G. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 2000; 8: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both Mg2+ ions are coordinated with the carboxyl groups of Asp95 and Asp97 and with water molecules to fulfill the octahedral coordination. There is only one Mg2+ in HPPK·MgADP. The location of Mg2+ in HPPK·MgADP is different from that of either of the two Mg2+ ions in HPPK·HP·MgAMPCPP (1.63 Å between Mg1 and Mg2, and 4.89 Å between Mg1 and Mg3; Fig.8 b), and so is its coordination. The Mg2+ in HPPK·MgADP is coordinated with two oxygen atoms of the β-phosphate of ADP and atom OE2 of conserved Glu77 (Fig. 2). The sealed active center needs to be opened up after the chemical reaction so that products can leave the active center. Transient kinetic analysis has shown that product release is rate-limiting in HPPK-catalyzed reaction. 2Y. Li, Y. Gong, G. Shi, J. Blaszczyk, X. Ji, and H. Yan, unpublished results. The conformational and dynamic changes revealed by this work may also play an important role in dissembling the active center and thereby releasing the products. We thank Dr. Z.

The P1 residue of the peptide binds to a well defined pocket at the base of PAI-2 that may be important in determining the specificity of protease inhibition.

A comparison of the Ramachandran plots of the stressed and relaxed state PAI-2 structures reveals the location of several hinge regions connecting these two domains. The hinge regions cluster in three locations on the structure, ensuring a cooperative S → R transition. We hypothesize that the hinge formed by the conserved Gly206 on β-strand s3A in the breach region of PAI-2 effects the S → R transition by altering its backbone torsion angles.

Patston P. Olson S. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Most serpins are serine (or cysteine) protease inhibitors that act in a suicide fashion, using the stability of the relaxed state to trap the protease in a nonfunctional covalent serpin-protease complex. The target protease cuts the accessible reactive center loop (RCL)1 on the serpin to produce a covalent acyl intermediate (2Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M.

The RCL then inserts into β-sheet 2All serpin secondary structure elements are labeled as per Loebermann et al. (17Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). 2All serpin secondary structure elements are labeled as per Loebermann et al. (17Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A to form the relaxed state. Attached to the RCL, the target protease moves to the base of the serpin, where it is partially unfolded, thus inhibiting its activity (4Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 5Egelund R. Petersen T.E. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This mode of action, whereby one protein uses the increased stability of an altered conformer to partially unfold a second, covalently bound target protein, is unprecedented in biology. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) is a serine protease inhibitor that belongs to the ov-serpin branch of the serpin superfamily (6Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). PAI-2 is an effective inhibitor of urinary plasminogen activator (urokinase or uPA) and, to a lesser extent, an inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator. PAI-2 has several features that distinguish it from the more widely studied serpins. PAI-2 lacks an N-terminal secretory signal but contains a relatively inefficient internal signal sequence (7von Heijne G. Liljestrom P. Mikus P. Andersson H. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15240-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This produces a distribution where a majority (∼70%) of the protein is nonglycosylated and intracellular, with the rest in a glycosylated, extracellular form. PAI-2 has a unique insertion of ∼30 residues between helices hC and hD (CD loop), which is the site of glycosylation and the site of cross-linking to the cell membrane and also fibrin via transglutaminase action (8Jensen P. Schuler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Hojrup P. Peterson T. Rasmussen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15394-15398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD loop also binds a number of largely unidentified cytoplasmic proteins (9Jensen P. Jensen T. Laug W. Hager H. Gliemann J. Pepinsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26892-26899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PAI-2 is expressed by specific cell types including epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, and keratinocytes (10Kruithof E. Baker M. Bunn C. Blood. 1995; 86: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed at high levels in the skin, hair follicles, gingival cells, the cervix, and placenta. PAI-2 is cross-linked to create the cornified envelope in terminally differentiated epithelial cells, where it forms a proteinaceous coat, with PAI-2 in both the active and relaxed forms (11Risse B. Brown H. Lavker R. Pearson J. Baker M. Ginsburg D. Jensen P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Risse B. Chung N. Baker M. Jensen P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PAI-2 appears to have several distinct biological functions (10Kruithof E. Baker M. Bunn C. Blood. 1995; 86: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, complexes between PAI-2 and uPA have not been observed in vivo. Several studies have indicated that the intracellular pool of PAI-2 plays a role in apoptosis (13Dickinson J. Bates E. Ferrante A. Antalis T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Medcalf R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12220-12226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of PAI-2 expression by inflammatory mediators and its high level of expression in macrophages and keratinocytes suggests a role in the regulation of the inflammatory response and wound healing. The high levels of PAI-2 observed in human pregnancy plasma indicate a role in maintenance of the placenta or perhaps embryonic development (15Lecander I. Åstedt B. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 62: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, PAI-2(−/−) null mice exhibit essentially normal development, survival, and fertility (16Dougherty K. Pearson J. Yang A. Westrick R. Baker M. Ginsburg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have been central to understanding serpin function. It was clear from the initial structure of cleaved α1-proteinase inhibitor (relaxed state) that the mechanism of protease inhibition was unusual (17Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Subsequently determined structures of serpins in various states have led to models for the stressed to relaxed state (S → R) transition, which is central to protease inhibition (18Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The determination of the stressed state structure of a PAI-2 CD loop deletion mutant has contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of this transition, especially with regard to the conserved shutter region (20Harrop S. Jankova L. Coles M. Jardine D. Whittaker J. Gould A. Meister A. King G. Mabbutt B. Curmi P. Structure. 1999; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have determined the structure of the complex formed by the PAI-2 CD loop deletion mutant with a peptide mimicking the RCL at 1.6-Å resolution. The complex adopts the relaxed state, facilitating a high resolution analysis of the S → R transition in PAI-2. By comparing the Ramachandran plots of PAI-2 in the two states, we have identified key hinge regions that facilitate the transition. These are clustered into three regions coordinating the transition. In particular, we hypothesize that the binding of P14 threonine 3Residues in the RCL (specifically the RCL peptide) are labeled P1, P2, etc. following the protease convention (42Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar). 3Residues in the RCL (specifically the RCL peptide) are labeled P1, P2, etc. following the protease convention (42Schechter I.

To aid comparison with other serpins, these are sometimes accompanied by canonical serpin numbers (37Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) in parentheses. Residues in the RCL peptide are numbered using the convention for protease targets (42Schechter I.

Recombinant human PAI-2 loop deletion mutant was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Jensen et al. (8Jensen P. Schuler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Hojrup P. Peterson T. Rasmussen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15394-15398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant lacks the loop between helices hC and hD (residues 66–98, inclusive, in the PAI-2 gene sequence). In order to generate a relaxed form of the protein, a synthetic peptide with an acetylated N terminus (N-acetyl-Thr-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Val-Met-Thr-Gly-Arg-OH (Auspep, Australia)), which mimics the RCL loop, was incubated with PAI-2 (1 mg/ml) at a 100-fold molar excess of the RCL peptide in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 48 h (21Saunders D. Buttigreig K. Gould A. McPhun V. Baker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10965-10971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PAI-2·peptide complex was dialyzed and concentrated to 10 mg/ml prior to crystallization using a vacuum dialysis system (Sartorius) against a buffer containing 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. All crystals were grown by vapor diffusion using the sitting drop technique at room temperature by mixing equal volumes (3 μl) of protein and reservoir solution (13% polyethyleneglycol 8000, 0.1 mMg(CH3COOH)2, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5). Large crystals (600 × 500 × 250 μm3) appeared within 3–5 days, belonging to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensionsa = 93.14 Å, b = 104.16 Å, andc = 41.34 Å. Crystals were cryoprotected by serially transferring them through a set of solutions containing 17% polyethyleneglycol 8000, 0.1 mMg(CH3COOH)2, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol (1% up to 16% in 1% steps) prior to freezing directly in liquid nitrogen. Synchrotron data were collected on station 9-2 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector with x-rays at 1.0-Å wavelength. Data were integrated using the program MOSFLM (22Leslie A. Moras D. Pojarny A. Thierry J. Crystallographic Computing 5: From Chemistry to Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar) and then scaled and reduced with the program SCALA, which is part of the CCP4 suite of programs (23Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). The structure of the stressed form of PAI-2 was used as a molecular replacement model (20Harrop S. Jankova L. Coles M.

Initial electron density maps showed that the PAI-2·peptide complex adopted the relaxed serpin structure with the peptide inserted as β-strand s4A in β-sheet A.

The final model consists of PAI-2 residues 2–61, 102–215, 220–270, 274–367, and 378–415, where Cys161 is modified by β-mercaptoethanol; the 14 residues of the RCL peptide plus its N-terminal acetylation; and 440 water molecules.

The structure of a complex between a PAI-2 deletion mutant (where residues 66–98, which form the CD loop, have been genetically removed) and a peptide mimicking the RCL loop has been determined at 1.6-Å resolution. The data reduction and refinement statistics are given in Table I. The electron density maps showed unambiguous electron density for all residues of the protein with the exception of the N terminus (residue 1); the remains of the CD loop (residues 62–65 and 99–101); a loop before β-strand s4C (residues 216–219); a loop joining β-strand s3B to helix hG (residues 271–273); and a portion of the endogenous RCL (residues 368–377). Clear density was observed for all 14 residues in the RCL peptide. The structure of the PAI-2·RCL peptide complex is typical of that seen in relaxed state serpins. The prominent β-sheet A contains six strands, with the RCL peptide forming strand s4A in the center of the sheet (Fig. 1). The structure is similar to that of the complex formed between antithrombin and a P14–P3 RCL peptide (28Skinner R. Chang W.S. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The PAI-2 molecule in the complex is intact; thus, it has a complete endogenous RCL, which is distinct from the peptide. Clear density is seen for approximately half of the endogenous RCL of the molecule (residues 364–367 and 378–386), which adopts an extended conformation (Fig. 1). The observed endogenous RCL residues are stabilized by crystal contacts with two neighboring molecules in the crystal. Such stabilization appears to be essential, since crystal forms lacking appropriate crystal contacts show no density for the stressed state, endogenous RCL (20Harrop S. Jankova L. Coles M. Jardine D.

Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), P14 Thr of the peptide forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Tyr258(Tyr244) (Fig.2 A), displacing the three water molecules seen in the stressed state structure of PAI-2 (20Harrop S. Jankova L. Coles M. Jardine D. Whittaker J. Gould A. Meister A. King G. Mabbutt B. Curmi P. Structure. 1999; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The P14 Thr backbone forms two hydrogen bonds with Gly206(Gly192), which may be important in initiating the S → R transition. The acetyl modification of the peptide N terminus mimics the peptide backbone by continuing the β-sheet hydrogen bonding to Asn363 (Asn341). This chemical modification is essential for peptide binding (21Saunders D. Buttigreig K. Gould A. McPhun V. Baker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10965-10971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The structure shows that PAI-2 has a well defined binding pocket for the P1 arginine residue of the inserted RCL peptide (Fig. 2 B). The site is formed by the long loop that joins helix hI to β-strand s5A at the base of the molecule. The guanidinium group of the arginine is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl groups of Lys335(Lys314), Ala338 (Ala316), and Asn347 (Asn325) as well as a hydrogen bond to the side chain oxygen of Asn347 (Asn325). An examination of the stressed state structure shows that the P1 binding pocket is essentially intact in both states, requiring only small backbone torsional changes between residues Ser344 and Leu349 and rotamer changes in Asn347 and Asp348 to accommodate the incoming arginine. An overlay of the PAI-2·RCL peptide structure with that of other relaxed state serpin structures shows considerable similarity (data not shown). Least-squares comparisons show that r.m.s. deviations between relaxed state serpin structures and the PAI-2·RCL peptide complex range between 1.0 and 1.4 Å, while the r.m.s. deviation between stressed state structures and the complex are ∼2.0 Å (TableII). As a comparison, the stressed state PAI-2 structure has an r.m.s. deviation compared with other stressed state structures of 1.5–1.7 Å, and relaxed state structures range from 1.5 to 2.2 Å. The alignments of the PAI-2·RCL peptide complex with other relaxed state structures overlay most of the secondary structural elements with nearly all of the structural differences confined to the loops. There are, however, several regions of structural difference.Table IIComparison of PAI-2 with other serpin structuresSerpinState2-aS indicates stressed state, while R indicates relaxed state structure.Accession codeResolutionr.m.s. deviation (No. of Cα atoms)StressedRelaxedÅÅÅOvalbuminS1OVA1.951.48 (338)1.95 (330)α1-AntitrypsinS1QLP2.001.64 (329)1.99 (318)Serpin KS1SEK2.101.67 (333)1.95 (313)PAI-1 (P)R1A7C1.952.09 (327)1.40 (340)LEIR1HLE1.951.51 (305)0.98 (356)AntichymotrypsinR1AS42.101.71 (311)1.25 (342)PAI-1 (L)R1DVN2.102.24 (291)1.60 (320)CrmAR1F0C2.261.37 (229)1.20 (302)Coordinates of the structures of ovalbumin (31Stein P.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). There is a significant structural rearrangement of the PAI-2·RCL peptide complex in the neighborhood of Trp294(Trp275), which is located at the C terminus of helix hH (Fig. 3 A). Trp294is conserved in many serpins, and an overlay of the structures of leukocyte elastase inhibitor (LEI) (30Baumann U. Bode W. Huber R. Travis J. Potempa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), ovalbumin (31Stein P. Leslie A. Finch J. Carrell R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), antithrombin (32Schreuder H. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H. Grootenhuis P. Hol W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and the stressed state of PAI-2 shows that its side chain is located in a pocket formed by helix hH and β-strands s1B and s2B (Fig. 3 A, red). Trp294 in the PAI-2·RCL peptide complex differs from this consensus, with the side chain adopting a different rotamer (Fig. 3 A,green). The electron density and the B-factors for this region indicate that it may be strained compared with the neighboring regions (mean B-factor for residues Asp289–Glu302 is 31 Å2 compared with 18 Å2 for Asn242–Ile246(s1B) and 15 Å2 for Pro393–Ser413(s4B and s5B)). The altered structure of Trp294 in the PAI-2·RCL peptide complex appears to be due to a packing interaction that transmits a structural change over ∼10 Å. The side chain of Tyr245(Tyr231) on β-strand s1B is at the surface of the molecule. An overlay of the stressed state and relaxed state structures of PAI-2 shows that the side chain of Tyr245 has moved significantly (1.4 Å), along with the backbone of β-strands s1B and s2B (Fig. 3 A). The cause of this rearrangement appears to be a steric clash between Tyr245 and the salt bridge formed between Glu140 (Glu129) and Arg143(Arg132) in a neighboring molecule. Although this structural rearrangement appears to be a result of the transmission of a distal packing interaction, the observed change indicates that there is some plasticity in this region of PAI-2. A comparison of the relaxed state PAI-2·RCL peptide structure with the stressed state PAI-2 structure shows all of the general features of the S → R transition that have been obtained from comparisons of different serpins (18Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or the same serpin at lower resolution (19Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given this, we will focus mainly on differences that are specific to PAI-2 and comparisons that are warranted by the higher resolution of our structures. An important difference between stressed and relaxed state serpins is the existence of a cavity beneath β-sheet A in the stressed state, which originates between s2A, hD, and hE (20Harrop S. Jankova L. Coles M. Jardine D. Whittaker J."
https://openalex.org/W1970225550,"This paper describes a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a molecule whose expression is mostly restricted to some of the forebrain areas that control singing behavior in adult estrildine species studied, including the zebra, Bengalese, and spice finches. When the song system displays extreme sexual dimorphism, as in these species, antibody staining occurs only in the male's song nuclei. However, protein expression is identical in both sexes of estrildine finches, in which females also have a well-developed song system. Canaries appear to lack the protein, but it can be induced in female zebra finches by early estrogen treatment. Antibody staining patterns in the zebra finch show that the protein's expression is developmentally regulated to coincide with the abrupt increase in the volume and cell size of the male's or the estrogen-treated female's song system."
