https://openalex.org/W2108845151,"I propose a reconceptualization of key phenomena important in the study of emotion—those phenomena that reflect functions and circuits related to survival, and that are shared by humans and other animals. The approach shifts the focus from questions about whether emotions that humans consciously feel are also present in other animals, and toward questions about the extent to which circuits and corresponding functions that are present in other animals (survival circuits and functions) are also present in humans. Survival circuit functions are not causally related to emotional feelings but obviously contribute to these, at least indirectly. The survival circuit concept integrates ideas about emotion, motivation, reinforcement, and arousal in the effort to understand how organisms survive and thrive by detecting and responding to challenges and opportunities in daily life.

Although current studies indicate that resveratrol produces neuroprotection against neurological disorders, the precise mechanisms for its beneficial effects are still not fully understood. We investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory and mechamisms of resveratrol by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine microglial BV-2 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings BV-2 cells were treated with resveratrol (25, 50, and 100 µM) and/or LPS (1 µg/ml). Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by Griess reagent and ELISA. The mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines were analysed by RT-PCR and double immunofluorescence labeling, respectively. Phosphorylation levels of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) cascades, inhibitor κB-α (IκB-α) and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) were measured by western blot. Resveratrol significantly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of NO, PGE2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in BV-2 cells. Resveratrol increased PTEN, Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner or a time-dependent manner. Rapamycin (10 nM), a specific mTOR inhibitor, blocked the effects of resveratrol on LPS-induced microglial activation. In addition, mTOR inhibition partially abolished the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on the phosphorylation of IκB-α, CREB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Conclusion and Implications This study indicates that resveratrol inhibited LPS-induced proinflammatory enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines via down-regulation phosphorylation of NF-κB, CREB and MAPKs family in a mTOR-dependent manner. These findings reveal, in part, the molecular basis underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of resveratrol."
https://openalex.org/W1987191606,"Anthropogenic CO2 is progressively acidifying the ocean, but the responses of harmful algal bloom species that produce toxins that can bioaccumulate remain virtually unknown. The neurotoxin domoic acid is produced by the globally-distributed diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. This toxin is responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning, which can result in illness or death in humans and regularly causes mass mortalities of marine mammals and birds. Domoic acid production by Pseudo-nitzschia cells is known to be regulated by nutrient availability, but potential interactions with increasing seawater CO2 concentrations are poorly understood. Here we present experiments measuring domoic acid production by acclimatized cultures of Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta that demonstrate a strong synergism between projected future CO2 levels (765 ppm) and silicate-limited growth, which greatly increases cellular toxicity relative to growth under modern atmospheric (360 ppm) or pre-industrial (200 ppm) CO2 conditions. Cellular Si∶C ratios decrease with increasing CO2, in a trend opposite to that seen for domoic acid production. The coastal California upwelling system where this species was isolated currently exhibits rapidly increasing levels of anthropogenic acidification, as well as widespread episodic silicate limitation of diatom growth. Our results suggest that the current ecosystem and human health impacts of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms could be greatly exacerbated by future ocean acidification and ‘carbon fertilization’ of the coastal ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2063504968,"The sestrin family of stress-responsive genes (SESN1-3) are suggested to be involved in regulation of metabolism and aging through modulation of the AMPK-mTOR pathway. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an effector of the tumour suppressor LKB1, which regulates energy homeostasis, cell polarity, and the cell cycle. SESN1/2 can interact directly with AMPK in response to stress to maintain genomic integrity and suppress tumorigenesis. Ionizing radiation (IR), a widely used cancer therapy, is known to increase sestrin expression, and acutely activate AMPK. However, the regulation of AMPK expression by sestrins in response to IR has not been studied in depth.Through immunoprecipitation we observed that SESN2 directly interacted with the AMPKα1β1γ1 trimer and its upstream regulator LKB1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. SESN2 overexpression was achieved using a Flag-tagged SESN2 expression vector or a stably-integrated tetracycline-inducible system, which also increased AMPKα1 and AMPKβ1 subunit phosphorylation, and co-localized with phosphorylated AMPKα-Thr127 in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, enhanced SESN2 expression increased protein levels of LKB1 and AMPKα1β1γ1, as well as mRNA levels of LKB1, AMPKα1, and AMPKβ1. Treatment of MCF7 cells with IR elevated AMPK expression and activity, but this effect was attenuated in the presence of SESN2 siRNA. In addition, elevated SESN2 inhibited IR-induced mTOR signalling and sensitized MCF7 cells to IR through an AMPK-dependent mechanism.Our results suggest that in breast cancer cells SESN2 is associated with AMPK, it is involved in regulation of basal and IR-induced expression and activation of this enzyme, and it mediates sensitization of cancer cells to IR."
https://openalex.org/W2064551211,"Dietary factors regulate immunological function, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that vitamin B9 is a survival factor for regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing high levels of vitamin B9 receptor (folate receptor 4). In vitamin B9-reduced condition in vitro, Treg cells could be differentiated from naïve T cells but failed to survive. The impaired survival of Treg cells was associated with decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and independent of IL-2. In vivo depletion of dietary vitamin B9 resulted in the reduction of Treg cells in the small intestine, a site for the absorption of dietary vitamin B9. These findings provide a new link between diet and the immune system, which could maintain the immunological homeostasis in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2026667514,"Recent studies using culture-independent methods have characterized the human airway microbiota and report microbial communities distinct from other body sites. Changes in these airway bacterial communities appear to be associated with inflammatory lung disease, yet the pro-inflammatory properties of individual bacterial species are unknown. In this study, we compared the immune stimulatory capacity on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) of selected airway commensal and pathogenic bacteria predominantly associated with lungs of asthma or COPD patients (pathogenic Haemophillus spp. and Moraxella spp.), healthy lungs (commensal Prevotella spp.) or both (commensal Veillonella spp. and Actinomyces spp.). All bacteria were found to induce activation of DCs as demonstrated by similar induction of CD83, CD40 and CD86 surface expression. However, asthma and COPD-associated pathogenic bacteria provoked a 3-5 fold higher production of IL-23, IL-12p70 and IL-10 cytokines compared to the commensal bacteria. Based on the differential cytokine production profiles, the studied airway bacteria could be segregated into three groups (Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella spp. vs. Prevotella spp. and Veillonella spp. vs. Actinomyces spp.) reflecting their pro-inflammatory effects on DCs. Co-culture experiments found that Prevotella spp. were able to reduce Haemophillus influenzae-induced IL-12p70 in DCs, whereas no effect was observed on IL-23 and IL-10 production. This study demonstrates intrinsic differences in DC stimulating properties of bacteria associated with the airway microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W1970834742,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease of complex clinical presentation and etiology and is likely influenced by numerous genetic and environmental factors. While a large number of susceptibility genes have been identified, the production of antibodies against a distinct subset of nuclear proteins remains a primary distinguishing characteristic in disease diagnosis. However, the utility of autoantibody biomarkers for disease sub-classification and grouping remains elusive, in part, because of the difficulty in large scale profiling using a uniform, quantitative platform. In the present study serological profiles of several known SLE antigens, including Sm-D3, RNP-A, RNP-70k, Ro52, Ro60, and La, as well as other cytokine and neuronal antigens were obtained using the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) approach. The resulting autoantibody profiles revealed that 88% of a pilot cohort and 98% of a second independent cohort segregated into one of two distinct clusters defined by autoantibodies against Sm/anti-RNP or Ro/La autoantigens, proteins often involved in RNA binding activities. The Sm/RNP cluster was associated with a higher prevalence of serositis in comparison to the Ro/La cluster (P = 0.0022). However, from the available clinical information, no other clinical characteristics were associated with either cluster. In contrast, evaluation of autoantibodies on an individual basis revealed an association between anti-Sm (P = 0.006), RNP-A (P = 0.018) and RNP-70k (P = 0.010) autoantibodies and mucocutaneous symptoms and between anti-RNP-70k and musculoskeletal manifestations (P = 0.059). Serologically active, but clinically quiescent disease also had a higher prevalence of anti-IFN-α autoantibodies. Based on our findings that most SLE patients belong to either a Sm/RNP or Ro/La autoantigen cluster, these results suggest the possibility that alterations in RNA-RNA-binding protein interactions may play a critical role in triggering and/or the pathogenesis of SLE."
https://openalex.org/W1979358876,"The Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM) are a family of transmembrane proteins that is known to inhibit cell invasion of viruses such as HIV-1 and influenza. We show that the IFITM genes are a subfamily in a larger family of transmembrane (TM) proteins that we call Dispanins, which refers to a common 2TM structure. We mined the Dispanins in 36 eukaryotic species, covering all major eukaryotic groups, and investigated their evolutionary history using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to infer a phylogenetic tree. We identified ten human genes that together with the known IFITM genes form the Dispanin family. We show that the Dispanins first emerged in eukaryotes in a common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoa, and that the family later expanded in vertebrates where it forms four subfamilies (A–D). Interestingly, we also find that the family is found in several different phyla of bacteria and propose that it was horizontally transferred to eukaryotes from bacteria in the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The bacterial and eukaryotic sequences have a considerably conserved protein structure. In conclusion, we introduce a novel family, the Dispanins, together with a nomenclature based on the evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W2043295004,"Background Food allergy may affect the gastrointestinal tract and eosinophilia is often associated with allergic gastrointestinal disorders. Allergy to peanuts is a life-threatening condition and effective and safe treatments still need to be developed. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of sustained oral exposure to peanuts on the esophageal and jejunal mucosa in sensitized mice. We also evaluated the effects of desensitization with epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) on these processes. Methods Mice were sensitized by gavages with whole peanut protein extract (PPE) given with cholera toxin. Sensitized mice were subsequently exposed to peanuts via a specific regimen and were then analysed for eosinophilia in the esophagus and gut. We also assessed mRNA expression in the esophagus, antibody levels, and peripheral T-cell response. The effects of EPIT were tested when intercalated with sensitization and sustained oral peanut exposure. Results Sustained oral exposure to peanuts in sensitized mice led to severe esophageal eosinophilia and intestinal villus sub-atrophia, i.e. significantly increased influx of eosinophils into the esophageal mucosa (136 eosinophils/mm2) and reduced villus/crypt ratios (1.6±0.15). In the sera, specific IgE levels significantly increased as did secretion of Th2 cytokines by peanut-reactivated splenocytes. EPIT of sensitized mice significantly reduced Th2 immunological response (IgE response and splenocyte secretion of Th2 cytokines) as well as esophageal eosinophilia (50 eosinophils/mm2, p<0.05), mRNA expression of Th2 cytokines in tissue - eotaxin (p<0.05), IL-5 (p<0.05), and IL-13 (p<0.05) -, GATA-3 (p<0.05), and intestinal villus sub-atrophia (2.3±0.15). EPIT also increased specific IgG2a (p<0.05) and mRNA expression of Foxp3 (p<0.05) in the esophageal mucosa. Conclusions Gastro-intestinal lesions induced by sustained oral exposure in sensitized mice are efficaciously treated by allergen specific EPIT."
https://openalex.org/W2076733365,"The ability of embryonic stem cells to differentiate into endothelium and form functional blood vessels has been well established and can potentially be harnessed for therapeutic angiogenesis. However, after almost two decades of investigation in this field, limited knowledge exists for directing endothelial differentiation. A better understanding of the cellular mechanisms regulating vasculogenesis is required for the development of embryonic stem cell-based models and therapies. In this study, we elucidated the mechanistic role of insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and 2) and IGF receptors (IGFR1 and 2) in endothelial differentiation using an embryonic stem cell embryoid body model. Both IGF1 or IGF2 predisposed embryonic stem to differentiate towards a mesodermal lineage, the endothelial precursor germ layer, as well as increased the generation of significantly more endothelial cells at later stages. Inhibition of IGFR1 signaling using neutralizing antibody or a pharmacological inhibitor, picropodophyllin, significantly reduced IGF-induced mesoderm and endothelial precursor cell formation. We confirmed that IGF-IGFR1 signaling stabilizes HIF1α and leads to up-regulation of VEGF during vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies. Understanding the mechanisms that are critical for vasculogenesis in various models will bring us one step closer to enabling cell based therapies for neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2068085668,"Music can be seen as a model system for understanding gene × environment interactions and how these can influence neurocognitive development. The concept of musicality, however, is underspecified and not well understood. Here, I propose a framework for defining musicality to provide a foundation for studying the contributions of biological and environmental factors. Music can be seen as a model system for understanding gene × environment interactions and how these can influence neurocognitive development. The concept of musicality, however, is underspecified and not well understood. Here, I propose a framework for defining musicality to provide a foundation for studying the contributions of biological and environmental factors. Musical ability is popularly regarded to be innate: one either is or is not born with musical talent. Increasingly, neuroscientists are collaborating with geneticists to understand the links between genes, brain development, cognition, and behavior (Ebstein et al., 2010Ebstein R.P. Israel S. Chew S.H. Zhong S. Knafo A. Neuron. 2010; 65: 831-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, Posner et al., 2011Posner M.I. Rothbart M.K. Sheese B.E. Voelker P. Dev. Psychol. 2011; (in press. Published online September 26, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Music can be seen as a model system for understanding what genes can accomplish and how they relate to experience. On the practical side, identifying genetic components that underlie musical ability can also help us to predict who will succeed or, more interestingly, what types of instruction will be most successful for individuals according to their genetic-cognitive profiles. In all domains, successful genotyping requires an accurately described phenotype. Unfortunately, the latter has not yet been accomplished for music, creating a significant hurdle to further progress. Part of the difficulty in describing the musical phenotype is its heterogeneity, the wide variety of ways in which musicality presents itself (Sloboda, 2008Sloboda J.A. Nature. 2008; 454: 32-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). My goal in this article is to review those factors that might be associated with the phenotype and to discuss definitions, measurement, and accuracy, three common obstacles in understanding the genetics of complex behavioral phenomena (Ebstein et al., 2010Ebstein R.P. Israel S. Chew S.H. Zhong S. Knafo A. Neuron. 2010; 65: 831-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), with the hope that this may stimulate discussion and future work on the topic. We now know that music activates regions throughout the brain, not just a single “music center.” As with vision, music is processed component by component, with specific neural circuits handling pitch, duration, loudness, and timbre. Higher brain centers bring this information together, binding it into representations of contour, melody, rhythm, tempo, meter, and, ultimately, phrases and whole compositions. The idea that music processing can be broken down into component operations was first proposed as a conceptual tool by cognitive theorists and has been confirmed by neuroimaging studies (Levitin and Tirovolas, 2009Levitin D.J. Tirovolas A.K. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience. 2009; 1156: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The early distinction that music processing is right hemisphere lateralized and that language is left hemisphere lateralized has been modified by a more nuanced understanding. Pitch is represented by tonotopic maps, virtual piano keyboards stretched across the cortex that represent pitches in a low-to-high spatial arrangement. The sounds of different musical instruments (timbres) are processed in well-defined regions of posterior Heschl's gyrus and superior temporal sulcus (extending into the circular insular sulcus). Tempo and rhythm are believed to invoke hierarchical oscillators in the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Loudness is processed in a network of neural circuits beginning at the brain stem and inferior colliculus and extending to the temporal lobes. The localization of sounds and the perception of distance cues are handled by a network that attends to (among other cues) differences in interaural time of arrival, changes in frequency spectrum, and changes in the temporal spectrum, such as are caused by reverberation. One can attain world-class expertise in one of these component operations without necessarily attaining world-class expertise in others. Higher cognitive functions in music, such as musical attention, musical memory, and the tracking of temporal and harmonic structure, have been linked to particular neural processing networks. Listening to music activates reward and pleasure circuits in the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, and amygdala, modulating production of dopamine (Menon and Levitin, 2005Menon V. Levitin D.J. NeuroImage. 2005; 28: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The generation of musical expectations is a largely automatic process in adults, developing in childhood, and is believed to be critical to the enjoyment of music (Huron, 2006Huron D. Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2006Crossref Google Scholar). Tasks that require the tracking of tonal, harmonic, and rhythmic expectations activate prefrontal regions, in particular Brodmann areas 44, 45, and 47, and anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus as part of a cortical network that also involves limbic structures and the cerebellum. Musical training is associated with changes in gray matter volume and cortical representation. Musicians exhibit changes in the white matter structure of the corticospinal tract, as indicated by reduced fractional anisotropy, which suggests increased radial diffusivity. Cerebellar volumes in keyboard players increase as a function of practice. Learning to name notes and intervals is accompanied by a leftward shift in processing as musical concepts become lexicalized. Writing music involves circuits distinct from other kinds of writing, and there are clinical reports of individuals who have musical agraphia without textual agraphia. Double dissociations have also been reported between musical agraphia and musical alexia. Indeed, the patient literature is rich with accounts of individuals who have lost one specific aspect of musical processing while others remain intact, bolstering claims of distinct, componential processing of music (Marin and Perry, 1999Marin O.M. Perry D.W. Neurological aspects of musical perception and performance.in: Deutsch D. The Psychology of Music. Second Edition. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 653-724Crossref Google Scholar). Each of the components mentioned above—for example, reading or remembering music, listening to various attributes of a musical performance, playing an instrument—seem intuitively to be involved in constructing a profile of musical abilities. The fact that they are distinguishable neuroanatomically lends credence to them as real, not merely theoretical, concepts and suggests the possibility of genetic correlates influencing neural development and differentiation. Rather than there being a single “music gene,” the most likely scenario is that we will discover genes that support component brain structures and thereby, by extension, component musical behaviors. Genetic polymorphisms, such as the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) gene, have been shown to modulate dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, and thereby working memory function (Posner et al., 2011Posner M.I. Rothbart M.K. Sheese B.E. Voelker P. Dev. Psychol. 2011; (in press. Published online September 26, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, Robbins and Kousta, 2011Robbins T.W. Kousta S. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 375-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Other polymorphisms no doubt influence the development of eye-hand coordination in rhythmic sequences or the structure and function of auditory long-term memory. The crux of the phenotype problem is that musicality presents itself in a number of different ways that may be uncorrelated with each other. How might one go about characterizing, and ultimately quantifying, the musical phenotype? I suggest that if an individual presented any one of the following behaviors at a high level of competence (say, two standard deviations above the population mean) we would regard that individual as having musical abilities: playing an instrument, composing, orchestrating, or conducting. It is necessary, however, to further fractionate these skills into subskills (e.g., McPherson, 1995McPherson G.E. Psychol. Music. 1995; 23: 142-161Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For example, some instrumentalists excel as soloists, and others as ensemble players or accompanists; some excel at sight reading, and others (in fact most musicians in the world) play only by ear. Within the domain of music reading, some musicians are good sight readers, and others are better at reading slowly and deliberately in the service of preparing pieces; some read single lines, and others can read many lines simultaneously, as conductors must do when scanning an orchestral score. Some musicians improvise, and many others do not. Many outstanding musicians are better known for a sense of rhythm than pitch (Buddy Rich, Charlie Watts). Composers tend to excel at a particular style or genre—popular, jazz, classical, film music, hip-hop, country—and a test of classical music ability, for example, would exclude not only many of the best-known composers of our era, but also most of the world's musicians who neither read nor write music. It is also worth noting the manifest lack of a correlation among these abilities. Players (e.g., Arthur Rubinstein) do not typically compose or arrange, and composers do not even necessarily play instruments: the composer Irving Berlin (“White Christmas,” “God Bless America”) famously was unable to play his own songs. An adequate theory of musicality must account for all these different ways that musicality presents itself. So far, my list shows a production bias; it does not account for the many individuals who show an intense receptive sensitivity to music. In our studies of individuals with the neurogenetic disorder Williams Syndrome, for example (Levitin et al., 2004Levitin D.J. Cole K. Chiles M. Lai Z. Lincoln A. Bellugi U. Child Neuropsychol. 2004; 10: 223-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we have seen people who are powerfully moved by music. After listening to sad music, parents report that they stay in a sad mood much longer than typically developing individuals, and, similarly, happy music “lifts them up” and allows them to maintain a positive mood state significantly longer than others. Other examples of people with receptive musicality include disc jockeys, music critics, recording engineers, film music supervisors, and record company talent scouts. Lacking formal musical training or the ability to play an instrument does not necessarily put them at a disadvantage, and yet their professions require various sorts of receptive (perceptual) musical skills. Choreographers and dancers, who set bodily movements to music, may constitute a separate category of crossmodal musical artists with distinct skill sets and neurocognitive processes to support their work. There also exist individuals with the auditory equivalent of eidetic imagery or photographic memory, what we might call phonographic memory. Some DJs can listen to the briefest excerpt of a musical piece, often 1 s or less, and identify the title, composer, and performers and distinguish several different performances of the same piece by the same group. DJs can introduce new connections between music we might not otherwise notice and introduce us to new music we might not otherwise discover. The connection, for example, between the Baroque composer Foscarini and the classic rock band Led Zeppelin only becomes apparent when Foscarini's “Toccata in E” is played back to back with Led Zeppelin's “Gallows Pole” (the rhythms, articulation, and chords are hauntingly close, despite being separated by 350 years). To discover these connections, a person requires a detailed musical memory coupled with the ability to extract certain elements of the music. While hearing one song, the listener must be consciously or unconsciously searching a vast mental repertoire of music to find a template match for chords, melodies, rhythms, timbres, or other component features, while performing mental transpositions to place them into equivalent keys and tempi (Levitin, 2006Levitin D.J. This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession. Dutton, New York2006Google Scholar). Recognizing these sorts of musical connections is not something that all musicians and not even all great musicians can do. It has been suggested that the primary purpose of music is to convey emotion, and this must also be considered in evaluating musicality. Some musicians are extraordinarily adept at communicating emotions through music, and this becomes especially clear when those musicians lack some of the other attributes we would normally associate with high levels of musical ability. Consider, for example, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, whose voices convey great emotional depth and nuance to millions of listeners. Both of them lack the beautiful voice and vocal clarity one traditionally associates with singers. Yet, even if they were not great songwriters, Dylan and Springsteen would be known for their ability to convey emotion with their voices. Another important notion concerns a cluster of attributes surrounding distinctiveness, novelty, and innovativeness. Not all great musicians possess these qualities, but those who do are highly prized in our society and by other musicians. Mozart, Louis Armstrong, and The Beatles are appreciated for these qualities, quite apart from the other musical skills they possessed. That is, they were able to bring uncommon amounts of creativity to their music (in spite of the technical limitations that the latter two had as instrumentalists). A number of general cognitive and physical factors are necessary for musical success, such as single mindedness, seriousness, conscientiousness, and goal directedness, qualities that are no doubt required to achieve mastery or expertise in any field (Ericsson and Smith, 1991Ericsson K.A. Smith J. Toward a General Theory of Expertise. Cambridge University Press, New York1991Google Scholar, Kalbfleisch, 2004Kalbfleisch M.L. Anat. Rec. B New Anat. 2004; 277: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There may well be genetic correlates to these traits. In particular, neural structures mediating these traits and propensities probably have genetic underpinnings, and yet the genetic basis needs to be triggered environmentally by exposure to music, access to musical instruments, and some combination of internal and external positive reinforcement. The data favor gene × environment (G × E) interactions (e.g. Hyde et al., 2011Hyde L.W. Bogdan R. Hariri A.R. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the changing role of genes in childhood. In this regard, genes may predict who will benefit from which kinds of training, and what kinds of interventions will modulate gene expression. The interaction between parenting interventions and the DRD4 gene—associated with novelty seeking, effortful control, and dopaminergic function—may be a good starting point (Posner et al., 2011Posner M.I. Rothbart M.K. Sheese B.E. Voelker P. Dev. Psychol. 2011; (in press. Published online September 26, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Part of the difficulty in distinguishing “nature” from “nurture” with music is that the child raised in a musical household—regardless of her genotype—is almost certainly apt to receive more musical input, feedback, and encouragement than the child raised in a nonmusical household. Although young children clearly start out with widely different musical abilities and interests, their actual achievements correlate most significantly with practice, hard work, and time on task, not with observed early potential. Self-reports of world-class musicians, as well as experimental studies, point strongly to the view that practice accounts for a significant proportion of the variance in who becomes an expert musician and who does not (Howe et al., 1998Howe M.J.A. Davidson J.W. Sloboda J.A. Behav. Brain Sci. 1998; 21 (discussion 407–442): 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). What factors cause some children to practice more than others? Some are no doubt genetic, such as goal directedness, self-confidence, reflexes, finger speed, motor coordination, auditory memory, and auditory structuring abilities. Others are environmental, including having a teacher or family member who encourages or motivates the child and having access to musical stimulation and musical instruments. There may also exist individual differences in the capacity for forging neural connections and building up mental schemas (what Donald Hebb termed “Intelligence A”) that could serve to increase the chances that an individual will become a successful musician. General intelligence, an ability to practice, and exposure to music may account for a good deal of the variance in who becomes a professional musician and who does not. An adequate, overarching theory of musicality should account for the entire range of abilities observed in the population, including those at the low end of the spectrum. A small percentage of the population appears to lack musical ability or sensitivity, and this condition of amusia has been known for over a century. In the popular press, the terms tone deafness and tin-ear syndrome have also been used. However, the amusias comprise a heterogeneous set of disabilities with distinct etiologies, sometimes present from birth and sometimes acquired following injury, disease, or other organic trauma. Some individuals simply cannot identify songs; a self-reported sufferer, Ulysses S. Grant, quipped, “I only know two tunes: one of them is ‘Yankee Doodle’ and the other one isn't.” Others retain identification ability but cannot sing in tune, producing abnormal variability in the tones they generate. Some individuals have an inability to detect a single aberrant note falling outside of a musical key. This is believed to be associated with abnormal gray and white matter in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal cortex. Based on one small aggregation study, such “wrong note” detection appears to have a hereditary component (Peretz et al., 2007Peretz I. Cummings S. Dubé M.-P.

Specific deficits in rhythm, pitch, and timbre have also been observed, as a result of either brain injury or congenital defect. The characterization of amusia remains an active area of research. The most commonly used musical assessment tests over the last century have been based on Seashore's standardized tests (Seashore, 1919Seashore C.E. Seashore Measurement of Musical Talent. Columbia Phonograph Company, New York1919Crossref Google Scholar). These are narrowly focused on perception, although there is no firm evidence that perception and production are correlated. Moreover, the tests allow no opportunity for the test taker to demonstrate individuality, emotion, or creativity. In one module of the test, for example, individuals listen to a sequence of tones that play a simple melody. A second sequence is played, and students simply have to answer whether the two sequences are “same” or “different.” As the test progresses, the sequences become increasingly difficult. A parallel version is administered in which musical rhythms are presented. The chief psychometric problem is that many individuals who would be considered musical (e.g., those making a living as professional orchestral musicians) only score in the middle range of the Seashore tests, while many without musical training or externally observable ability do very well on them. On three of six Seashore items, professional symphony players scored below the 50th percentile, making their performance indistinguishable from that of nonmusicians. Correlations between standardized musical aptitude tests and real-world musical achievement are consistently low. I believe that in an effort to control stimuli and reduce music to its atomic elements, the makers of standardized tests have removed its essence, its dynamic and emotional nature. In short, they have removed the muse from music. I argue for a new approach that is both broader based and more naturalistic. Because such research is still in its infancy, I advocate casting a wide net: an inclusive approach to capture as many musical behaviors as possible in initial studies of understanding what it means to be musical. To begin with, we need to be more sensitive to the variety of ways that assessing musicality can present itself, such as in production and perception, and technically and emotionally. Assessments need to allow for spontaneity and creativity. Consider the ways that musicians evaluate one another: it is not through objective yes/no testing, but through auditions and a process of subjective evaluation. After a century of cognitive psychology and psychophysics embracing objective methods as the gold standard, I believe the time is right to reintroduce the opinions and ratings of qualified observers. As Justice Potter Stewart might have said, we may not be able to define musicality, but we know it when we hear it. Subjective evaluations, properly done with blind coding and tests of interrater reliability, can yield repeatable and rigorous results and have greater real-world validity. Musicality can also be evaluated for individuals who are not players. Disc jockeys already compile demonstration tapes to exhibit their ability to create meaningful playlists and segues. Potential music critics are given assignments, and their work output is evaluated by more experienced critics and editors. The future of music phenotyping should allow for inclusive definitions of musicality, with subjective ratings made by experienced professionals according to replicable scoring guidelines. Designing a suitable test would ideally recruit the involvement of experts from music perception and cognition, education, performance, statistics, and psychometrics. It would involve several steps:(1)Cataloguing those behaviors that we regard as musical. A partial list might include: (a) Playing a musical instrument or singing; (b) Composing; (c) Arranging and orchestrating music; (d) Conducting; (e) Programming music for aesthetic purposes or for finding connections between songs (disc jockeys, film supervisors); (f) Great receptive sensitivity to music and its emotional content; (g) Ability to detect out-of-tune or out-of-key notes; (h) Crossmodal practices, such as writing about or choreographing music.(2)Creating test items and batteries that tap into these behaviors.(3)Creating a set of guidelines by which performance can be assessed by qualified, independent judges.(4)Performing standard psychometric test construction operations, such as test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, face validity, and construct validity.(5)Cataloguing objective measures of success that one might use to correlate the items of (1) above. Examples include being a member of a world-class symphony orchestra, winning awards (such as the Polar Prize, Grammy Awards, or the Gershwin Prize), or having the respect of peers. The validity of the measures of (1) would be supported with such real-world achievements. The point is not that everyone who performs well on the tests will have achieved real-world recognition, but that we would expect that those who have achieved such recognition should do well on the tests (modus ponens).(6)Norming the test against a suitable number of participants drawn from a range of musical backgrounds and abilities.(7)Conducting factor analysis (or similar data reduction techniques) to uncover latent mathematical relations among variables. Factor analysis will allow the researcher to bind together variables that are intercorrelated, that is, groups of two or more test items that are tapping in to some common, underlying neurocognitive process.(8)Association studies should then be conducted on the reduced set of supervariables or orthogonal factors obtained from the previous step. A comprehensive investigation of the genetic correlates of musicality should also include data from personality and various psychosocial instruments. Of particular interest would be measures of the Big Five Factor Structure, the Tellegen Absorption Scale, the Creativity Achievement Questionnaire, and measures of self-discipline and interpersonal communication, alongside measures of musical engagement and background, such as The Salk and McGill Musical Inventory and the Queens University Musical Experience Questionnaire. Ideally, these should be correlated with scores on the music battery, as well as with genes and neural structures. The selection and choice of variables for heritability studies should be data driven. Searching for heritability of one supervariable called “music” is too coarse a level of analysis and will miss the many nuances of musicality described above. On the other hand, attempting to correlate genes with every possible behavioral variant is too fine a level of analysis and will obscure any latent unifying or underlying factors that bind together different variables. Association studies should include those nonmusical genetic factors and personality trait variables discussed above. Furthermore, it is important to use large samples in order to avoid false positives that may arise from the enormous number of genes involved compared to the sample size of individuals (Robbins and Kousta, 2011Robbins T.W. Kousta S. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 375-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Also important are independent replications and family-based association methods in which genetic differences both within and between families are used (Ebstein et al., 2010Ebstein R.P. Israel S. Chew S.H. Zhong S. Knafo A. Neuron. 2010; 65: 831-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The subsequent narrowing of criteria should be data driven, and the distinctions or correlations between musical potential and musical achievement will ideally be revealed in the data. Such an approach should allow researchers to remain alert to the presence of endophenotypes that may arise from psychological, neurochemical, or biological bases. As with any other complex trait, music is likely to be the result of thousands of small-effect loci, which together can produce significant heritability quotients. A study of the genetics of dance (Bachner-Melman et al., 2005Bachner-Melman R. Dina C. Zohar A.H. Constantini N. Lerer E. Hoch S. Ebstein R. et al.PLoS Genetics. 2005; 1: e42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) found evidence for involvement of the AVPR1a (vasopressin) gene, which had been previously shown to mediate affiliative, social, and courtship behaviors, learning and memory, and, interestingly, pain sensitivity. In addition, significant differences were found between dancers and nondancers in the serotonin transporter SLC6A4, which had previously been shown to play a role in spiritual experiences. Moreover, SLC6A4 enhances the release of vasopressin in the brain, creating a link between the two genes and their expression in professional dancers and suggesting epistasis, or gene-gene interactions. The vasopressin gene has also been implicated in musical activities (Ukkola-Vuoti et al., 2011Ukkola-Vuoti L. Oikkonen J. Onkamo P. Karma K. Raijas P. Järvelä I. Journal of Human Genetics. 2011; 56: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AVPR1a was shown to be associated with listening behavior and audio structuring ability. Highly significant epistatic interactions have also been observed between promoter region polymorphisms in the AVPR1a and SLC6A4 genes and musical memory (Ebstein et al., 2010Ebstein R.P. Israel S. Chew S.H. Zhong S. Knafo A. Neuron. 2010; 65: 831-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Future studies would be well advised to study genes that encode for oxytocin (OXTR), a neuropeptide with a pervasive role in mammalian social behaviors, including empathy, and with a known association with the AVPR1a gene. AVPR1a has been linked to anxiety and depression, and the connection between musical creativity and these traits is well known. Taken together, this suggests a role for AVPR1a as part of a putative genetic basis for both creativity and the artistic temperament. Linking genetic polymorphisms to personality variables is an area of active research. Data from these investigations should be brought to bear on the question of identifying candidate genes for musicality to the extent that those personality variables are discovered to be linked to the musical phenotype. In summary, musicality is polymorphic. It is a complex interaction of physical, emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial traits, including some that are overtly “musical” and others that are not but that contribute to musicality in a variety of supporting ways. Musicality presents as both productive and receptive ability, and skill can manifest itself as primarily technical, cognitive, intuitive, or emotional, or in various combinations. If research is to provide an adequate account of how music, genes, environment, and neural development interact, it must embrace the full variety of musical experiences and contexts (Sloboda, 2008Sloboda J.A. Nature. 2008; 454: 32-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2045958047,"Social networks affect in such a fundamental way the dynamics of the population they support that the global, population-wide behavior that one observes often bears no relation to the individual processes it stems from. Up to now, linking the global networked dynamics to such individual mechanisms has remained elusive. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in networked populations and let individuals interact via a 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma – a characteristic defection dominant social dilemma of cooperation. We show how homogeneous networks transform a Prisoner's Dilemma into a population-wide evolutionary dynamics that promotes the coexistence between cooperators and defectors, while heterogeneous networks promote their coordination. To this end, we define a dynamic variable that allows us to track the self-organization of cooperators when co-evolving with defectors in networked populations. Using the same variable, we show how the global dynamics — and effective dilemma — co-evolves with the motifs of cooperators in the population, the overall emergence of cooperation depending sensitively on this co-evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1995396494,"The Hippo pathway has recently been implicated in the regulation of organ size and stem cells in multiple tissues. The transcriptional cofactor yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1) is the most downstream effector of Hippo signaling and is functionally repressed by the upstream components of the pathway. Overexpression of YAP1 stimulates proliferation of stem and progenitor cells in many tissues, consistent with inhibition of Hippo signaling. To study the role of Hippo signaling in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we created a transgenic model with inducible YAP1 expression exclusively within the hematopoietic system. Following 3 months induction, examination of blood and bone marrow in the induced mice revealed no changes in the distribution of the hematopoietic lineages compared to control mice. Moreover, the progenitor cell compartment was unaltered as determined by colony forming assays and immunophenotyping. To address whether YAP1 affects the quantity and function of HSCs we performed competitive transplantation experiments. We show that ectopic YAP1 expression does not influence HSC function neither during steady state nor in situations of hematopoietic stress. This is in sharp contrast to effects seen on stem- and progenitor cells in other organs and suggests highly tissue specific functions of the Hippo pathway in regulation of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085978380,"With the aim of uncovering all of the most basal variation in the northern Asian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, we have analyzed mtDNA control region and coding region sequence variation in 98 Altaian Kazakhs from southern Siberia and 149 Barghuts from Inner Mongolia, China. Both populations exhibit the prevalence of eastern Eurasian lineages accounting for 91.9% in Barghuts and 60.2% in Altaian Kazakhs. The strong affinity of Altaian Kazakhs and populations of northern and central Asia has been revealed, reflecting both influences of central Asian inhabitants and essential genetic interaction with the Altai region indigenous populations. Statistical analyses data demonstrate a close positioning of all Mongolic-speaking populations (Mongolians, Buryats, Khamnigans, Kalmyks as well as Barghuts studied here) and Turkic-speaking Sojots, thus suggesting their origin from a common maternal ancestral gene pool. In order to achieve a thorough coverage of DNA lineages revealed in the northern Asian matrilineal gene pool, we have completely sequenced the mtDNA of 55 samples representing haplogroups R11b, B4, B5, F2, M9, M10, M11, M13, N9a and R9c1, which were pinpointed from a massive collection (over 5000 individuals) of northern and eastern Asian, as well as European control region mtDNA sequences. Applying the newly updated mtDNA tree to the previously reported northern Asian and eastern Asian mtDNA data sets has resolved the status of the poorly classified mtDNA types and allowed us to obtain the coalescence age estimates of the nodes of interest using different calibrated rates. Our findings confirm our previous conclusion that northern Asian maternal gene pool consists of predominantly post-LGM components of eastern Asian ancestry, though some genetic lineages may have a pre-LGM/LGM origin."

This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii among veterinary medicine students and to identify associated risk factors.A cross-sectional study with questionnaire and blood sample collection was performed among all veterinary medicine students studying in The Netherlands in 2006. Serum samples (n = 674), representative of all study years and study directions, were analyzed for C. burnetii IgG and IgM phase I and II antibodies with an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Seropositivity was defined as IgG phase I and/or II titer of 1:32 and above.Of the veterinary medicine students 126 (18.7%) had IgG antibodies against C. burnetii. Seropositivity associated risk factors identified were the study direction 'farm animals' (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.27 [95% CI 2.14-5.02]), advanced year of study (OR year 6: 2.31 [1.22-4.39] OR year 3-5 1.83 [1.07-3.10]) having had a zoonosis during the study (OR 1.74 [1.07-2.82]) and ever lived on a ruminant farm (OR 2.73 [1.59-4.67]). Stratified analysis revealed study direction 'farm animals' to be a study-related risk factor apart from ever living on a farm. In addition we identified a clear dose-response relation for the number of years lived on a farm with C. burnetii seropositivity.C. burnetii seroprevalence is considerable among veterinary medicine students and study related risk factors were identified. This indicates Q fever as an occupational risk for veterinary medicine students."
https://openalex.org/W2056610118,"Ghrelin acylation by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) has recently been reported to be essential for the prevention of hypoglycemia during prolonged negative energy balance. Using a unique set of four different genetic loss-of-function models for the GOAT/ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) system, we thoroughly tested the hypothesis that lack-of-ghrelin activation or signaling would lead to hypoglycemia during caloric deprivation.Male and female knockout (KO) mice for GOAT, ghrelin, GHSR, or both ghrelin and GHSR (dKO) were subjected to prolonged calorie restriction (40% of ad libitum chow intake). Body weight, fat mass, and glucose levels were recorded daily and compared to wildtype (WT) controls. Forty-eight hour blood glucose profiles were generated for each individual mouse when 2% or less body fat mass was reached. Blood samples were obtained for analysis of circulating levels of acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin, IGF-1, and insulin.Chronic calorie restriction progressively decreased body weight and body fat mass in all mice regardless of genotype. When fat mass was depleted to 2% or less of body weight for 2 consecutive days, random hypoglycemic events occurred in some mice across all genotypes. There was no increase in the incidence of hypoglycemia in any of the four loss-of-function models for ghrelin signaling including GOAT KO mice. Furthermore, no differences in insulin or IGF-1 levels were observed between genotypes.The endogenous GOAT-ghrelin-GHSR system is not essential for the maintenance of euglycemia during prolonged calorie restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2049209126,"Background Malaria kills almost 1 million people every year, but the mechanisms behind protective immunity against the disease are still largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, surface plasmon resonance technology was used to evaluate the affinity (measured as kd) of naturally acquired antibodies to the Plasmodium falciparum antigens MSP2 and AMA1. Antibodies in serum samples from residents in endemic areas bound with higher affinities to AMA1 than to MSP2, and with higher affinities to the 3D7 allele of MSP2-3D7 than to the FC27 allele. The affinities against AMA1 and MSP2-3D7 increased with age, and were usually within similar range as the affinities for the monoclonal antibodies also examined in this study. The finding of MSP2-3D7 type parasites in the blood was associated with a tendency for higher affinity antibodies to both forms of MSP2 and AMA1, but this was significant only when analyzing antibodies against MSP2-FC27, and individuals infected with both allelic forms of MSP2 at the same time showed the highest affinities. Individuals with the highest antibody affinities for MSP2-3D7 at baseline had a prolonged time to clinical malaria during 40 weeks of follow-up, and among individuals who were parasite positive at baseline higher antibody affinities to all antigens were seen in the individuals that did not experience febrile malaria during follow up. Conclusions/Significance This study contributes important information for understanding how immunity against malaria arises. The findings suggest that antibody affinity plays an important role in protection against disease, and differs between antigens. In light of this information, antibody affinity measurements would be a key assessment in future evaluation of malaria vaccine formulations."
https://openalex.org/W1981910395,"The anterodorsal projection neuron lineage of Drosophila melanogaster produces 40 neuronal types in a stereotypic order. Here we take advantage of this complete lineage sequence to examine the role of known temporal fating factors, including Chinmo and the Hb/Kr/Pdm/Cas transcriptional cascade, within this diverse central brain lineage. Kr mutation affects the temporal fate of the neuroblast (NB) itself, causing a single fate to be skipped, whereas Chinmo null only elicits fate transformation of NB progeny without altering cell counts. Notably, Chinmo operates in two separate windows to prevent fate transformation (into the subsequent Chinmo-indenpendent fate) within each window. By contrast, Hb/Pdm/Cas play no detectable role, indicating that Kr either acts outside of the cascade identified in the ventral nerve cord or that redundancy exists at the level of fating factors. Therefore, hierarchical fating mechanisms operate within the lineage to generate neuronal diversity in an unprecedented fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2037451457,"In colorectal cancer (CRC), chromosomal instability (CIN) is typically studied using comparative-genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. We studied paired (tumor and surrounding healthy) fresh frozen tissue from 86 CRC patients using Illumina's Infinium-based SNP array. This method allowed us to study CIN in CRC, with simultaneous analysis of copy number (CN) and B-allele frequency (BAF) - a representation of allelic composition. These data helped us to detect mono-allelic and bi-allelic amplifications/deletion, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and levels of mosaicism for mixed cell populations, some of which can not be assessed with other methods that do not measure BAF. We identified associations between CN abnormalities and different CRC phenotypes (histological diagnosis, location, tumor grade, stage, MSI and presence of lymph node metastasis). We showed commonalities between regions of CN change observed in CRC and the regions reported in previous studies of other solid cancers (e.g. amplifications of 20q, 13q, 8q, 5p and deletions of 18q, 17p and 8p). From Therapeutic Target Database, we identified relevant drugs, targeted to the genes located in these regions with CN changes, approved or in trials for other cancers and common diseases. These drugs may be considered for future therapeutic trials in CRC, based on personalized cytogenetic diagnosis. We also found many regions, harboring genes, which are not currently targeted by any relevant drugs that may be considered for future drug discovery studies. Our study shows the application of high density SNP arrays for cytogenetic study in CRC and its potential utility for personalized treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2026516410,"Whole exome sequencing provides unprecedented opportunities to identify causative DNA variants in rare Mendelian disorders. Finding the responsible mutation via traditional methods in families with hearing loss is difficult due to a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. In this study we combined autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing in a family with 3 affected children having nonsyndromic hearing loss born to consanguineous parents. Two novel missense homozygous variants, c.508C>A (p.H170N) in GIPC3 and c.1328C>T (p.T443M) in ZNF57, were identified in the same ∼6 Mb autozygous region on chromosome 19 in affected members of the family. Both variants co-segregated with the phenotype and were absent in 335 ethnicity-matched controls. Biallelic GIPC3 mutations have recently been reported to cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Thus we conclude that the hearing loss in the family described in this report is caused by a novel missense mutation in GIPC3. Identified variant in GIPC3 had a low read depth, which was initially filtered out during the analysis leaving ZNF57 as the only potential causative gene. This study highlights some of the challenges in the analyses of whole exome data in the bid to establish the true causative variant in Mendelian disease."
https://openalex.org/W2037119566,"Cells of the neural stem cell lineage in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) respond to brain insult by increasing their numbers and migrating through the rostral migratory stream. However, in most areas of the brain other than the SVZ and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, such a regenerative response is extremely weak. Even these two neurogenic regions do not show extensive regenerative responses to repair tissue damage, suggesting the presence of an intrinsic inhibitory microenvironment (niche) for stem cells. In the present study, we assessed the effects of injection of clustered ephrin-A1-Fc into the lateral ventricle of rats with unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Ephrin-A1-Fc clustered by anti-IgG(Fc) antibody was injected stereotaxically into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle of rats with unilateral nigrostriatal lesions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, and histologic analysis and behavioral tests were performed. Clustered ephrin-A1-Fc transformed the subventricular niche, increasing bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the subventricular area, and the cells then migrated to the striatum and differentiated to dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes. In addition, clustered ephrin-A1-Fc enhanced angiogenesis in the striatum on the injected side. Along with histologic improvements, behavioral derangement improved dramatically. These findings indicate that the subventricular niche possesses a mechanism for regulating both stem cell and angiogenic responses via an EphA–mediated signal. We conclude that activation of EphA receptor–mediated signaling by clustered ephrin-A1-Fc from within the lateral ventricle could potentially be utilized in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070153584,"Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) and Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) are key growth factors in regulating corneal scarring. Although CTGF was induced by TGF-β1 and mediated many of fibroproliferative effects of TGF-β1, the signaling pathway for CTGF production in corneal scarring remains to be clarified. In the present study, we firstly investigated the effects of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) on CTGF expression induce by TGF-β1 in Telomerase-immortalized human cornea stroma fibroblasts (THSF). Then, we created penetrating corneal wound model and determined the effect of JNK in the pathogenesis of corneal scarring. TGF-β1 activated MAPK pathways in THSF cells. JNK inhibitor significantly inhibited CTGF, fibronectin and collagen I expression induced by TGF-β1 in THSF. In corneal wound healing, the JNK inhibitor significantly inhibited CTGF expression, markedly improved the architecture of corneal stroma and reduced corneal scar formation, but did not have a measurable impact on corneal wound healing in vivo. Our results indicate that JNK mediates the expression of CTGF and corneal scarring in corneal wound healing, and might be considered as specific targets of drug therapy for corneal scarring."

We asked whether increased MT and immune activation may hamper anti-HCV response in HIV/HCV patients.98 HIV/HCV patients who received pegylated-alpha-interferon (peg-INF-alpha)/ribavirin were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline MT (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), host response to MT (sCD14), CD38+HLA-DR+CD4+/CD8+, HCV genotype, severity of liver disease were assessed according to Early Virological Response (EVR: HCV-RNA <50 IU/mL at week 12 of therapy or ≥2 log(10) reduction from baseline after 12 weeks of therapy) and Sustained Virological Response (SVR: HCV-RNA <50 IU/mL 24 weeks after end of therapy). Mann-Whitney/Chi-square test and Pearson's correlation were used. Multivariable regression was performed to determine factors associated with EVR/SVR.71 patients displayed EVR; 41 SVR. Patients with HCV genotypes 1-4 and cirrhosis presented a trend to higher sCD14, compared to patients with genotypes 2-3 (p = 0.053) and no cirrhosis (p = 0.052). EVR and SVR patients showed lower levels of circulating sCD14 (p = 0.0001, p = 0.026, respectively), but similar T-cell activation compared to Non-EVR (Null Responders, NR) and Non-SVR (N-SVR) subjects. sCD14 resulted the main predictive factor of EVR (0.145 for each sCD14 unit more, 95%CI 0.031-0.688, p = 0.015). SVR was associated only with HCV genotypes 2-3 (AOR 0.022 for genotypes 1-4 vs 2-3, 95%CI 0.001-0.469, p = 0.014).In HIV/HCV patients sCD14 correlates with the severity of liver disease and predicts early response to peg-INF-alpha/ribavirin, suggesting MT-driven immune activation as pathway of HIV/HCV co-infection and response to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2014299551,"Dioscorea is an important plant genus in terms of food supply and pharmaceutical applications. However, its classification and identification are controversial. DNA barcoding is a recent aid to taxonomic identification and uses a short standardized DNA region to discriminate plant species. In this study, the applicability of three candidate DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, and psbA-trnH) to identify species within Dioscorea was tested.One-hundred and forty-eight individual plant samples of Dioscorea, encompassing 38 species, seven varieties and one subspecies, representing majority species distributed in China of this genus, were collected from its main distributing areas. Samples were assessed by PCR amplification, sequence quality, extent of specific genetic divergence, DNA barcoding gap, and the ability to discriminate between species. matK successfully identified 23.26% of all species, compared with 9.30% for rbcL and 11.63% for psbA-trnH. Therefore, matK is recommended as the best DNA barcoding candidate. We found that the combination of two or three loci achieved a higher success rate of species discrimination than one locus alone. However, experimental cost would be much higher if two or three loci, rather than a single locus, were assessed.We conclude that matK is a strong, although not perfect, candidate as a DNA barcode for Dioscorea identification. This assessment takes into account both its ability for species discrimination and the cost of experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2064203251,"The re-emergence of tuberculosis (TB) as a global public health threat highlights the necessity of rapid, simple and inexpensive point-of-care detection of the disease. Early diagnosis of TB is vital not only for preventing the spread of the disease but also for timely initiation of treatment. The later in turn will reduce the possible emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is an important non-protein antigen of the bacterial cell wall, which is found to be present in different body fluids of infected patients including blood, urine and sputum. We have developed a bispecific monoclonal antibody with predetermined specificities towards the LAM antigen and a reporter molecule horseradish peroxidase (HRPO). The developed antibody was subsequently used to design a simple low cost immunoswab based assay to detect LAM antigen. The limit of detection for spiked synthetic LAM was found to be 5.0 ng/ml (bovine urine), 0.5 ng/ml (rabbit serum) and 0.005 ng/ml (saline) and that for bacterial LAM from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was found to be 0.5 ng/ml (rabbit serum). The assay was evaluated with 21 stored clinical serum samples (14 were positive and 7 were negative in terms of anti-LAM titer). In addition, all 14 positive samples were culture positive. The assay showed 100% specificity and 64% sensitivity (95% confidence interval). In addition to good specificity, the end point could be read visually within two hours of sample collection. The reported assay might be used as a rapid tool for detecting TB in resource constrained laboratory settings."
https://openalex.org/W2139367613,"The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) cannot be fully addressed by therapy targeting known pathophysiological pathways. Even with stringent control of all risk factors CVD events are only diminished by half. A number of additional pathways probably play a role in the development of CVD and might serve as novel therapeutic targets. Genome wide expression studies represent a powerful tool to identify such novel pathways. We compared the expression profiles in monocytes from twenty two young male patients with premature familial CAD with those from controls matched for age, sex and smoking status, without a family history of CVD. Since all patients were on statins and aspirin treatment, potentially affecting the expression of genes in monocytes, twelve controls were subsequently treated with simvastatin and aspirin for 6 and 2 weeks, respectively. By whole genome expression arrays six genes were identified to have differential expression in the monocytes of patients versus controls; ABCA1, ABCG1 and RGS1 were downregulated in patients, whereas ADRB2, FOLR3 and GSTM1 were upregulated. Differential expression of all genes, apart from GSTM1, was confirmed by qPCR. Aspirin and statins altered gene expression of ABCG1 and ADBR2. All finding were validated in a second group of twenty four patients and controls. Differential expression of ABCA1, RSG1 and ADBR2 was replicated. In conclusion, we identified these 3 genes to be expressed differently in CAD cases which might play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2000579646,"A novel electronic cell sensor array technology, the real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system, was developed to monitor cell events. Unlike the conventional methods labeling the target cells with fluorescence, luminescence, or light absorption, the RTCA system allows for label-free detection of cell processes directly without the incorporation of labels. Here, we used this new format to measure the cytopathic effect (CPE) of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies in human sera to this virus. The real-time dynamic monitoring of CPE was performed on MDCK cell cultures infected with the H1N1 virus, ranging from 5.50×10(2) to 5.50×10(7) copies/mL. The resulting CPE kinetic curves were automatically recorded and were both time and viral load dependent. The CPE kinetics were also distinguishable between different H1N1 stains, as the onset of CPE induced by the A/Shanghai/37T/2009 H1N1 virus was earlier than that of the A/Shanghai/143T/2009 H1N1 virus. Furthermore, inhibition of H1N1 virus-induced CPE in the presence of human specific anti-sera was detected and quantified using the RTCA system. Antibody titers determined using this new neutralization test correlated well with those obtained independently via the standard hemagglutination inhibition test. Taken together, this new CPE assay format provided label-free and high-throughput measurement of viral growth and the effect of neutralizing antibodies, illustrating its potential in influenza vaccine studies."
https://openalex.org/W2027560643,"The microenvironment of a tumor can influence both the morphology and the behavior of cancer cells which, in turn, can rapidly adapt to environmental changes. Increasing evidence points to the involvement of amoeboid cell migration and thus of cell blebbing in the metastatic process; however, the cues that promote amoeboid cell behavior in physiological and pathological conditions have not yet been clearly identified. Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is found in high amount in the microenvironment of aggressive tumors and is considered as an independent marker of bad prognosis. Here we show by immunoblotting, activity assay and immunofluorescence that, in SW620 human colorectal cancer cells, matrix-associated PAI-1 plays a role in the cell behavior needed for amoeboid migration by maintaining cell blebbing, localizing PDK1 and ROCK1 at the cell membrane and maintaining the RhoA/ROCK1/MLC-P pathway activation. The results obtained by modeling PAI-1 deposition around tumors indicate that matrix-bound PAI-1 is heterogeneously distributed at the tumor periphery and that, at certain spots, the elevated concentrations of matrix-bound PAI-1 needed for cancer cells to undergo the mesenchymal-amoeboid transition can be observed. Matrix-bound PAI-1, as a matricellular protein, could thus represent one of the physiopathological requirements to support metastatic formation."
https://openalex.org/W2156913459,"Background The analysis of co-localized protein expression in a tissue section is often conducted with immunofluorescence histochemical staining which is typically visualized in localized regions. On the other hand, chromogenic immunohistochemical staining, in general, is not suitable for the detection of protein co-localization. Here, we developed a new protocol, based on chromogenic immunohistochemical stain, for system-wide detection of protein co-localization and differential expression. Methodology/Principal Findings In combination with a removable chromogenic stain, an efficient antibody stripping method was developed to enable sequential immunostaining with different primary antibodies regardless of antibody's host species. Sections were scanned after each staining, and the images were superimposed together for the detection of protein co-localization and differential expression. As a proof of principle, differential expression and co-localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase67 (GAD67) and parvalbumin proteins was examined in mouse cortex. Conclusions/Significance All parvalbumin-containing neurons express GAD67 protein, and GAD67-positive neurons that do not express parvalbumin were readily visualized from thousands of other neurons across mouse cortex. The method provided a global view of protein co-localization as well as differential expression across an entire tissue section. Repeated use of the same section could combine assessments of co-localization and differential expression of multiple proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2046072400,"Background Sensory deprivation induces dramatic morphological and neurochemical changes in the olfactory bulb (OB) that are largely restricted to glomerular and granule layer interneurons. Mitral cells, pyramidal-like neurons, are resistant to sensory-deprivation-induced changes and are associated with the precursor to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF); here, we investigate its unknown function in the adult mouse OB. Principal Findings As determined using brain-slice electrophysiology in a whole-cell configuration, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not proBDNF, increased mitral cell excitability. BDNF increased mitral cell action potential firing frequency and decreased interspike interval in response to current injection. In a separate set of experiments, intranasal delivery of neurotrophic factors to awake, adult mice was performed to induce sustained interneuron neurochemical changes. ProBDNF, but not BDNF, increased activated-caspase 3 and reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in OB glomerular interneurons. In a parallel set of experiments, short-term sensory deprivation produced by unilateral naris occlusion generated an identical phenotype. Conclusions Our results indicate that only mature BDNF increases mitral cell excitability whereas proBDNF remains ineffective. Our demonstration that proBDNF activates an apoptotic marker in vivo is the first for any proneurotrophin and establishes a role for proBDNF in a model of neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2057573898,"The magnocellular neurons (MCNs) in the hypothalamus selectively express either oxytocin (OXT) or vasopressin (AVP) neuropeptide genes, a property that defines their phenotypes. Here we examine the molecular basis of this selectivity in the OXT MCNs by stereotaxic microinjections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors that contain various OXT gene promoter deletion constructs using EGFP as the reporter into the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON). Two weeks following injection of the AAVs, immunohistochemical assays of EGFP expression from these constructs were done to determine whether the EGFP reporter co-localizes with either the OXT- or AVP-immunoreactivity in the MCNs. The results show that the key elements in the OT gene promoter that regulate the cell-type specific expression the SON are located −216 to −100 bp upstream of the transcription start site. We hypothesize that within this 116 bp domain a repressor exists that inhibits expression specifically in AVP MCNs, thereby leading to the cell-type specific expression of the OXT gene only in the OXT MCNs."
https://openalex.org/W2073360640,"The functions of HCN channels in neurons depend critically on their subcellular localization, requiring fine-tuned machinery that regulates subcellular channel trafficking. Here we provide evidence that regulatory mechanisms governing axonal HCN channel trafficking involve association of the channels with specific isoforms of the auxiliary subunit TRIP8b. In the medial perforant path, which normally contains HCN1 channels in axon terminals in immature but not in adult rodents, we found axonal HCN1 significantly increased in adult mice lacking TRIP8b (TRIP8b(-/-)). Interestingly, adult mice harboring a mutation that results in expression of only the two most abundant TRIP8b isoforms (TRIP8b[1b/2](-/-)) exhibited an HCN1 expression pattern similar to wildtype mice, suggesting that presence of one or both of these isoforms (TRIP8b(1a), TRIP8b(1a-4)) prevents HCN1 from being transported to medial perforant path axons in adult mice. Concordantly, expression analyses demonstrated a strong increase of expression of both TRIP8b isoforms in rat entorhinal cortex with age. However, when overexpressed in cultured entorhinal neurons of rats, TRIP8b(1a), but not TRIP8b(1a-4), altered substantially the subcellular distribution of HCN1 by promoting somatodendritic and reducing axonal expression of the channels. Taken together, we conclude that TRIP8b isoforms are important regulators of HCN1 trafficking in entorhinal neurons and that the alternatively-spliced isoform TRIP8b(1a) could be responsible for the age-dependent redistribution of HCN channels out of perforant path axon terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2016931907,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a formidable human pathogen, responsible for massive global morbidity and mortality. The ability to utilize carbohydrates in a variety of host niches appears to be integral to pneumococcal pathogenesis. In this study we investigated a genomic island, which includes a ROK family protein, a putative cellobiose phosphotransferase system (PTS) and a putative sulfatase. This accessory region is widespread in the pneumococcus in strains of various serotypes and levels of virulence. We have performed simple bioinformatic analysis of the region and investigated its role in vivo in 2 strains with markedly different virulence profiles (WCH206 of serotype 3, ST180; Menzies5 of serotype 11A, ST662). Deleting and replacing the entire island with an antibiotic resistance cassette caused the virulent serotype 3 strain to become attenuated in a murine pneumonia/sepsis model. Further mutants were constructed and used to show that various components of the island contribute significantly to the fitness of WCH206 in a variety of niches of this model, including the nasopharynx, ears and blood, but especially in the lungs. In addition, the island conferred a competitive advantage in nasopharyngeal colonization for the serotype 11A strain, which was essentially avirulent in the pneumonia/sepsis model. The contribution of this island to both pathogenesis and colonization may explain why this accessory region is widespread in the pneumococcus."
https://openalex.org/W2046809382,"K+ channels play a vital homeostatic role in cells and abnormal activity of these channels can dramatically alter cell function and survival, suggesting that they might be attractive drug targets in pathogenic organisms. Pathogenic protozoa lead to diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis and dysentery that are responsible for millions of deaths each year worldwide. The genomes of many protozoan parasites have recently been sequenced, allowing rational design of targeted therapies. We analyzed the genomes of pathogenic protozoa and show the existence within them of genes encoding putative homologues of K+ channels. These protozoan K+ channel homologues represent novel targets for anti-parasitic drugs. Differences in the sequences and diversity of human and parasite proteins may allow pathogen-specific targeting of these K+ channel homologues."
https://openalex.org/W2031144972,"Background Artemia eggs tend to develop ovoviviparously to yield nauplius larvae in good rearing conditions; while under adverse situations, they tend to develop oviparously and encysted diapause embryos are formed instead. However, the intrinsic mechanisms regulating this process are not well understood. Principal Finding This study has characterized the function of cyclin K, a regulatory subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in the two different developmental pathways of Artemia. In the diapause-destined embryo, Western blots showed that the cyclin K protein was down-regulated as the embryo entered dormancy and reverted to relatively high levels of expression once development resumed, consistent with the fluctuations in phosphorylation of position 2 serines (Ser2) in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit (Rpb1) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). Interestingly, the cyclin K transcript levels remained constant during this process. In vitro translation data indicated that the template activity of cyclin K mRNA stored in the postdiapause cyst was repressed. In addition, in vivo knockdown of cyclin K in developing embryos by RNA interference eliminated phosphorylation of the CTD Ser2 of RNAP II and induced apoptosis by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) survival signaling pathway. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these findings reveal a role for cyclin K in regulating RNAP II activity during diapause embryo development, which involves the post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin K. In addition, a further role was identified for cyclin K in regulating the control of cell survival during embryogenesis through ERK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1978825331,"HIV-1 infection increases the risk and severity of malaria by poorly defined mechanisms. We investigated the effect of HIV-1Ba-L infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) on phagocytosis of opsonised P. falciparum infected erythrocytes (IE) and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Compared to mock-infected MDM, HIV-1 infection significantly inhibited phagocytosis of IE (median (IQR) (10 (0–28) versus (34 (27–108); IE internalised/100 MDM; p = 0.001) and decreased secretion of IL-6 (1,116 (352–3,387) versus 1,552 (889–6,331); pg/mL; p = 0.0078) and IL-1β (16 (7–21) versus 33 (27–65); pg/mL; p = 0.0078). Thus inadequate phagocytosis and cytokine production may contribute to impaired control of malaria in HIV-1 infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2062443932,"Streptococcus mutans plays an important role in biofilm formation on the tooth surface and is the primary causative agent of dental caries. The binding of S. mutans to the salivary pellicle is of considerable etiologic significance and is important in biofilm development. Recently, we produced NOD/SCID.e2f1−/− mice that show hyposalivation, lower salivary antibody, and an extended life span compared to the parent strain: NOD.e2f1−/−. In this study we used NOD/SCID.e2f1−/− 4 or 6 mice to determine the roles of several salivary components in S. mutans colonization in vivo. S. mutans colonization in NOD/SCID.e2f1−/− mice was significantly increased when mice were pre-treated with human saliva or commercial salivary components. Interestingly, pre-treatment with secretory IgA (sIgA) at physiological concentrations promoted significant colonization of S. mutans compared with sIgA at higher concentrations, or with human saliva or other components. Our data suggest the principal effects of specific sIgA on S. mutans occur during S. mutans colonization, where the appropriate concentration of specific sIgA may serve as an anti-microbial agent, agglutinin, or an adherence receptor to surface antigens. Further, specific sIgA supported biofilm formation when the mice were supplied 1% sucrose water and a non-sucrose diet. The data suggests that there are multiple effects exerted by sIgA in S. mutans colonization, with synergistic effects evident under the condition of sIgA and limited nutrients on colonization in NOD/SCID.e2f1−/− mice. This is a new animal model that can be used to assess prevention methods for dental biofilm-dependent diseases such as dental caries."
https://openalex.org/W2011321269,"The ribosomal DNA comprised of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions is widely used as a fungal marker in molecular ecology and systematics but cannot be aligned with confidence across genetically distant taxa. In order to study the diversity of Agaricomycotina in forest soils, we designed primers targeting the more alignable 28S (LSU) gene, which should be more useful for phylogenetic analyses of the detected taxa. This paper compares the performance of the established ITS1F/4B primer pair, which targets basidiomycetes, to that of two new pairs. Key factors in the comparison were the diversity covered, off-target amplification, rarefaction at different Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) cutoff levels, sensitivity of the method used to process the alignment to missing data and insecure positional homology, and the congruence of monophyletic clades with OTU assignments and BLAST-derived OTU names. The ITS primer pair yielded no off-target amplification but also exhibited the least fidelity to the expected phylogenetic groups. The LSU primers give complementary pictures of diversity, but were more sensitive to modifications of the alignment such as the removal of difficult-to align stretches. The LSU primers also yielded greater numbers of singletons but also had a greater tendency to produce OTUs containing sequences from a wider variety of species as judged by BLAST similarity. We introduced some new parameters to describe alignment heterogeneity based on Shannon entropy and the extent and contents of the OTUs in a phylogenetic tree space. Our results suggest that ITS should not be used when calculating phylogenetic trees from genetically distant sequences obtained from environmental DNA extractions and that it is inadvisable to define OTUs on the basis of very heterogeneous alignments."
https://openalex.org/W1997080796,"Objective Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) clinically exhibit a deficit in positive emotional processing and are often distracted by especially negative emotional stimuli. Such emotional-cognitive interference in turn hampers the cognitive abilities of patients in their ongoing task. While the psychological correlates of such emotional conflict have been well identified in healthy subjects, possible alterations of emotional conflict in depressed patients remain to be investigated. We conducted an exploratory psychological study to investigate emotional conflict in MDD. We also distinguished depression-related stimuli from negative stimuli in order to check whether the depression-related distractors will induce enhanced conflict in MDD. Methods A typical word-face Stroop paradigm was adopted. In order to account for valence-specificities in MDD, we included positive and general negative as well as depression-related words in the study. Results MDD patients demonstrated a specific pattern of emotional conflict clearly distinguishable from the healthy control group. In MDD, the positive distractor words did not significantly interrupt the processing of the negative target faces, while they did in healthy subjects. On the other hand, the depression-related distractor words induced significant emotional conflict to the positive target faces in MDD patients but not in the healthy control group. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated for the first time an altered valence-specific pattern in emotional conflict in MDD patients. The study sheds a novel and specific light on the affective mechanisms underlying the abnormal emotional-cognitive interference in MDD. Such emotional conflict bears important clinical relevance since it may trigger the widespread cognitive dysfunctions frequently observed in MDD. The present findings may have important clinical implications in both prediction and psychotherapy of MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2016433745,"Bmi-1, a polycomb transcriptional repressor, is implicated in cell cycle regulation and cell senescence. Its absence results in generalized astrogliosis and epilepsy during the postnatal development, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of oxidative stress in the brain of four-week-old Bmi-1 null mice. The mice showed various hallmarks of neurodegeneration including synaptic loss, axonal demyelination, reactive gliosis and brain mitochondrial damage. Moreover, astroglial glutamate transporters and glutamine synthetase decreased in the Bmi-1 null hippocampus, which might contribute to the sporadic epileptic-like seizures in these mice. These results indicate that Bmi-1 is required for maintaining endogenous antioxidant defenses in the brain, and its absence subsequently causes premature brain degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2018115632,"Remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) is a critical step in peripheral nerve regeneration. In fact, in human neuropathies, endoneurial ECM enriched in fibrin and vitronectin associates with poor regeneration and worse clinical prognosis. Accordingly in animal models, modification of the fibrinolytic complex activity has profound effects on nerve regeneration: high fibrinolytic activity and low levels of fibrin correlate with better nerve regeneration. The urokinase plasminogen receptor (uPAR) is a major component of the fibrinolytic complex, and binding to urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) promotes fibrinolysis and cell movement. uPAR is expressed in peripheral nerves, however, little is known on its potential function on nerve development and regeneration. Thus, we investigated uPAR null mice and observed that uPAR is dispensable for nerve development, whereas, loss of uPAR affects nerve regeneration. uPAR null mice showed reduced nerve repair after sciatic nerve crush. This was a consequence of reduced fibrinolytic activity and increased deposition of endoneurial fibrin and vitronectin. Exogenous fibrinolysis in uPAR null mice rescued nerve repair after sciatic nerve crush. Finally, we measured the fibrinolytic activity in sural nerve biopsies from patients with peripheral neuropathies. We showed that neuropathies with defective regeneration had reduced fibrinolytic activity. On the contrary, neuropathies with signs of active regeneration displayed higher fibrinolytic activity. Overall, our results suggest that enforced fibrinolysis may facilitate regeneration and outcome of peripheral neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W1976693775,"Hyperthermia enhanced transdermal (HET) immunization is a novel needle free immunization strategy employing application of antigen along with mild local hyperthermia (42°C) to intact skin resulting in detectable antigen specific Ig in serum. In the present study, we investigated the adjuvant effect of thermal component of HET immunization in terms of maturation of dendritic cells and its implication on the quality of the immune outcome in terms of antibody production upon HET immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT). We have shown that in vitro hyperthermia exposure at 42°C for 30 minutes up regulates the surface expression of maturation markers on bone marrow derived DCs. This observation correlated in vivo with an increased and accelerated expression of maturation markers on DCs in the draining lymph node upon HET immunization in mice. This effect was found to be independent of the antigen delivered and depends only on the thermal component of HET immunization. In vitro hyperthermia also led to enhanced capacity to stimulate CD4+ T cells in allo MLR and promotes the secretion of IL-10 by BMDCs, suggesting a potential for Th2 skewing of T cell response. HET immunization also induced a systemic T cell response to TT, as suggested by proliferation of splenocytes from immunized animal upon in vitro stimulation by TT. Exposure to heat during primary immunization led to generation of mainly IgG class of antibodies upon boosting, similar to the use of conventional alum adjuvant, thus highlighting the adjuvant potential of heat during HET immunization. Lastly, we have shown that mice immunized by tetanus toxoid using HET route exhibited protection against challenge with a lethal dose of tetanus toxin. Thus, in addition to being a painless, needle free delivery system it also has an immune modulatory potential."
https://openalex.org/W1994320069,"The generation of affinity reagents, usually monoclonal antibodies, remains a critical bottleneck in biomedical research and diagnostic test development. Recombinant antibody-like proteins such as scFv have yet to replace traditional monoclonal antibodies in antigen detection applications, in large part because of poor performance of scFv in solution. To address this limitation, we have developed assays that use whole yeast cells expressing scFv on their surfaces (yeast-scFv) in place of soluble purified scFv or traditional monoclonal antibodies. In this study, a nonimmune library of human scFv displayed on the surfaces of yeast cells was screened for clones that bind to recombinant cyst proteins of Entamoeba histolytica, an enteric pathogen of humans. Selected yeast-scFv clones were stabilized by lyophilization and used in detection assay formats in which the yeast-scFv served as solid support-bound monoclonal antibodies. Specific binding of antigen to the yeast-scFv was detected by staining with rabbit polyclonal antibodies. In flow cytometry-based assays, lyophilized yeast-scFv reagents retained full binding activity and specificity for their cognate antigens after 4 weeks of storage at room temperature in the absence of desiccants or stabilizers. Because flow cytometry is not available to all potential assay users, an immunofluorescence assay was also developed that detects antigen with similar sensitivity and specificity. Antigen-specific whole-cell yeast-scFv reagents can be selected from nonimmune libraries in 2–3 weeks, produced in vast quantities, and packaged in lyophilized form for extended shelf life. Lyophilized yeast-scFv show promise as low cost, renewable alternatives to monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis and research."
https://openalex.org/W2018278499,Vaccinia Tian Tan (VTT) was attenuated by deletion of the TC7L-TK2L and TA35R genes to generate MVTT3. The mutant was generated by replacing the open reading frames by a gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) flanked by loxP sites. Viruses expressing EGFP were then screened for and purified by serial plaque formation. In a second step the marker EGFP gene was removed by transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding cre recombinase and selecting for viruses that had lost the EGFP phenotype. The MVTT3 mutant was shown to be avirulent and immunogenic. These results support the conclusion that TC7L-TK2L and TA35R deletion mutants can be used as safe viral vectors or as platform for vaccines.
https://openalex.org/W1991763803,"Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of β-amyloid plaques composed primarily of the amyloid-β peptide, a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). While mutations in APP lead to the development of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD), sporadic AD has only one clear genetic modifier: the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene. Cholesterol starvation in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to molting and arrest phenotypes similar to loss-of-function mutants of the APP ortholog, apl-1 (amyloid precursor-like protein 1), and lrp-1 (lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), suggesting a potential interaction between apl-1 and cholesterol metabolism. Methodology/Principal Findings Previously, we found that RNAi knock-down of apl-1 leads to aldicarb hypersensitivity, indicating a defect in synaptic function. Here we find the same defect is recapitulated during lrp-1 knock-down and by cholesterol starvation. A cholesterol-free diet or loss of lrp-1 directly affects APL-1 levels as both lead to loss of APL-1::GFP fluorescence in neurons. However, loss of cholesterol does not affect global transcription or protein levels as seen by qPCR and Western blot. Conclusions Our results show that cholesterol and lrp-1 are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, similar to apl-1. Both are able to modulate APL-1 protein levels in neurons, however cholesterol changes do not affect global apl-1 transcription or APL-1 protein indicating the changes are specific to neurons. Thus, regulation of synaptic transmission and molting by LRP-1 and cholesterol may be mediated by their ability to control APL-1 neuronal protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2002866686,"NF-κB signalling plays an essential role in T cell activation and generation of regulatory and memory populations in vivo. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of NF-κB signalling in post-activation T cells using tissue specific ablation of inhibitor of kappa-B kinase 2 expression, an important component of the inhibitor of kappa-B kinase complex in canonical NF-κB signalling. The OX40 antigen is expressed on activated T cells. Therefore, we used previously described mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase from the endogenous OX40 locus. Ablation of IKK2 expression using OX40(Cre) mice resulted in the development of an inflammatory response in the skin epidermis causing wide spread skin lesions. The inflammatory response was characterised by extensive leukocytic infiltrate in skin tissue, hyperplasia of draining lymph nodes and widespread activation in the T cell compartment. Surprisingly, disease development did not depend on T cells but was rather associated with an unanticipated expression of Cre in skin epidermis, and activation of the T cell compartment did not require Ikbk2 deletion in T cells. Employment of Cre reporter strains revealed extensive Cre activity in skin epidermis. Therefore, development of skin lesions was rather more likely explained by deletion of Ikbk2 in skin keratinocytes in OX40(Cre) mice."
https://openalex.org/W1973622998,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated end-stage liver diseases are the leading causes of liver transplantation (LT) in Taiwan. Relapse of hepatitis B occurs after LT, raising the risk of graft failure and reducing patient survival. Although several oral antiviral agents have been approved for anti-HBV treatment, lamivudine (LAM) remained to be the most widely used preventive regimen in Taiwan. While several clinical predictors have been identified for hepatitis B relapse, the predictive roles of the histopathological characteristics in liver explants as well as the genotypic features of the viruses in pre-LT serum samples have not been assessed. Between September 2002 and August 2009, 150 consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients undergoing LT were included for outcome analysis following assessment of the clinicopathological and virological factors prior to LT. Kaplan-Meier analyses discovered that pre-operative LAM treatment ≤3 months; membranous distribution and higher expression of tissue HBsAg in liver explants; preoperative viral load ≧106 copies/ml; and presence of large fragment (>100 base pairs) pre-S deletion (LFpreSDel) correlated significantly with hepatitis B relapse. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of LFpreSDel (P = 0.001) and viral load ≧106 copies/mL (P = 0.023) were independent predictors for hepatitis B relapse. In conclusion, besides high viral load, LFpreSDel mutation is an important independent predictor for hepatitis B relapse after LT. More aggressive preventive strategies should be applied for patients carrying these risk factors."

https://openalex.org/W2092318106,"Within the large group of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα)-negative breast cancer patients, there is a subgroup carrying the phenotype ERα−, PR−, and Her2−, named accordingly “Triple-Negative” (TN). Using cell lines derived from this TN group, we wished to establish cell clones, in which ERα is ectopically expressed, forming part of a synthetic lethality screening system. Initially, we generated cell transfectants expressing a mono-cistronic ERα transcription unit, adjacent to a separate dominant selectable marker transcription unit. However, the yield of ERα expressing colonies was rather low (5–12.5%), and only about half of these displayed stable ectopic ERα expression over time. Generation and maintenance of such cell clones under minimal exposure to the ERα ligand, did not improve yield or expression stability. Indeed, other groups have also reported grave difficulties in obtaining ectopic expression of ERα in ERα-deficient breast carcinoma cells. We therefore switched to transfecting these cell lines with pERα-IRES, a plasmid vector encoding a bicistronic translation mRNA template: ERα Open Reading Frame (ORF) being upstream followed by a dominant-positive selectable marker (hygroR) ORF, directed for translation from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). Through usage of this bicistronic vector linkage system, it was possible to generate a very high yield of ERα expressing cell clones (50–100%). The stability over time of these clones was also somewhat improved, though variations between individual cell clones were evident. Our successful experience with ERα in this system may serve as a paradigm for other genes where ectopic expression meets similar hardships."
https://openalex.org/W2162935444,"Quantifying exposure-disease associations is a central issue in epidemiology. Researchers of a study often present an odds ratio (or a logarithm of odds ratio, logOR) estimate together with its confidence interval (CI), for each exposure they examined. Here the authors advocate using the empirical-Bayes-based ‘prediction intervals’ (PIs) to bound the uncertainty of logORs. The PI approach is applicable to a panel of factors believed to be exchangeable (no extra information, other than the data itself, is available to distinguish some logORs from the others). The authors demonstrate its use in a genetic epidemiological study on age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The proposed PIs can enjoy straightforward probabilistic interpretations—a 95% PI has a probability of 0.95 to encompass the true value, and the expected number of true values that are being encompassed is for a total of 95% PIs. The PI approach is theoretically more efficient (producing shorter intervals) than the traditional CI approach. In the AMD data, the average efficiency gain is 51.2%. The PI approach is advocated to present the uncertainties of many logORs in a study, for its straightforward probabilistic interpretations and higher efficiency while maintaining the nominal coverage probability."
