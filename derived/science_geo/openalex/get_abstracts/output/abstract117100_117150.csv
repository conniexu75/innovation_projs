https://openalex.org/W2049085719,"The cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a is inactivated in many human tumors and in families with hereditary melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Tumor-associated alterations in the INK4a locus may also affect the overlapping gene encoding p19ARF and the adjacent gene encoding p15I1NK4b, both negative regulators of cell proliferation. We report the phenotype of mice carrying a targeted deletion of the INK4a locus that eliminates both p16INK4a and p19ARF. The mice are viable but develop spontaneous tumors at an early age and are highly sensitive to carcinogenic treatments. INK4a-deficient primary fibroblasts proliferate rapidly and have a high colony-formation efficiency. In contrast with normal cells, the introduction of activated Ha-ras into INK4a-deficient fibroblasts can result in neoplastic transformation. These findings directly demonstrate that the INK4a locus functions to suppress neoplastic growth."

Recently, a number of novel binding proteins have been proposed to mediate the signaling of these death receptors. Here we report that an N-terminal truncation of one of these candidate signal transducers, FADD/MORT1, abrogates CD95-induced apoptosis, ceramide generation, and activation of the cell death protease Yama/CPP32. In addition, this dominant-negative derivative of FADD (FADD-DN) blocked TNF-induced apoptosis while not affecting NF-κB activation. FADD-DN bound both receptors, and in the case of CD95, it disrupted the assembly of a signaling complex. Taken together, our results functionally establish FADD as the apoptotic trigger of CD95 and TNFR-1.

Activation of these receptors is caused by aggregation mediated by the respective ligands or agonist antibodies(1.Dhein J. Daniel P.T. Trauth B.C. Oehm A. Moller P. Krammer P.H. J.

Instead, it is becoming apparent that signal transduction is accomplished via association with an emerging class of novel and diverse signaling molecules. For example, a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 was shown to block TNFR-2-mediated NF-κB activation(5.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Numerous candidate signal transducers have been identified for the two death receptors, TNFR-1 and CD95, including FADD/MORT1, TRADD, RIP, FAP-1, FAF1, and TRAP1/2(9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K.

The anti-CD95 monoclonal antibodies used in this study include anti-Fas IgM (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-APO-1 (IgG3,(2.Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W.

Anti-AU1 murine ascites was obtained from Babco, Inc. Anti-PARP antibody was clone C-2-10, which is described previously (16.Lamarre D. Talbot B. Murcia G.D. Laplante C. Leduc Y. Mazen A. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and recognizes an epitope near the N terminus of PARP located between amino acids 216 and 375 (generous gift of Dr. G. Poirier). Antibodies were raised against recombinant GST-FADD fusion protein as described previously(17.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-peptide antibodies (Lampire) were raised against NNKNFHKSTGMTSRSGTD of the p17 subunit of Yama and STAPGYYSWRNSKDGS of the p12 subunit. C2-ceramide (D-erythro) and C2-dihydroceramide (D-erythro) were purchased from Matreya, Inc. and dissolved in ethanol. The B lymphoma cell line BJAB and the breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 were grown in RPMI 1640 complete medium (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids). MCF7-Fas cells, as described previously(18.Jaattela M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar), were grown in RPMI 1640 complete media supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). BJAB and MCF7 stable cell lines were grown in complete media supplemented with 3 and 0.5 mg/ml G418, respectively. To generate the pooled stable cell lines, BJAB-FADD-DN and MCF7-FADD-DN, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FADD-DN using a protocol described previously(19.Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). From the pooled populations, individual clones were obtained and plated in duplicate on 48-well Costar plates. One set of cells was treated with anti-Fas IgM (100 ng/ml), and clones resistant to Fas-induced cell death were identified. The untreated, resistant clones were then pooled to obtain BJAB-sFADD-DN (which represents a pool of seven resistant clones) and MCF7-sFADD-DN (which represents a pool of nine resistant clones). All stable lines generated were assessed for expression of FADD-DN by immunoblotting. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with lipofectamine as described previously (9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). To assess nuclear morphology, fluorescent DNA-staining dyes were utilized as described previously(19.Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) was determined using the in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). BJAB cells were air-dried onto Colorfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher) using 4% paraformaldehyde, and the manufacturer's protocol was followed. The TUNEL-stained cells were then counterstained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To assess cell viability, the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide conversion assay was done on the BJAB cell lines as described previously(20.Tepper C. Jayadev S. Liu B.

Ceramide levels were determined by a modified diacylglycerol kinase assay (21.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of cell lysates for PARP was carried out as described previously(17.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). Yama processing was assessed using 1 × 107 BJAB vector and BJAB-sFADD-DN cells untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml anti-Fas IgM for 18 h. Cells were then lysed in 60 μl of 0.1% Nonidet P-40, free-thawed three times, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Cytoplasmic extracts were carefully added to sample buffer and run on a 15% gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies directed against the p17 and p12 subunits of Yama. To show expression of FADD-DN in BJAB and MCF7 cells, cells were immunoprecipitated in phosphate-buffered saline-TDS (TDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) with anti-AU1 antibody (1:100) and Western blotted with anti-FADD polyclonal antisera (1:1000). Immunoprecipitation of the DISC and analysis on two-dimensional gels was done as described previously(23.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-AU1 antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously (23.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). MCF7 vector and MCF7-sFADD-DN cells were transfected with the NF-κB-dependent E-selectin reporter construct and luciferase activity assessed as described previously (5.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FADD causes apoptosis(9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar), resulting in cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to signature apoptotic fragments (data not shown). A previously reported deletion mutant of FADD, NFD4 (hereon referred to as FADD-DN), was able to interact with CD95, but failed to initiate apoptosis (9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it may have a dominant negative effect on CD95 signaling. FADD-DN lacks 80 N-terminal amino acids, but contains the death domain responsible for association with the related death domain of CD95(9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The B lymphoma cell line BJAB was transfected with either the expression vector pcDNA3 alone or as a FADD-DN expression construct. Stable transfectants were generated by neomycin (G418) selection and pooled populations assessed for FADD-DN expression and sensitivity to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (BJAB-FADD-DN, Fig. 1B). Expression of FADD-DN in both a pooled population and in a mixture of selected clones (BJAB-sFADD-DN) dramatically abrogated CD95-induced cell death (Fig. 1B). The apoptotic nature of the cell death was confirmed by the TUNEL assay which detects 3′-OH DNA strand breaks. The FADD-DN expressing BJAB cells were not inherently resistant to apoptotic cell death, since the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the calcium ionophore A23187 equally killed the three cell lines (data not shown). CD95 surface expression was equivalent in the vector and FADD-DN cell lines as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown). The possibility that clonal variation in the stable lines was responsible for the observed resistance to CD95 killing was discounted by the observation that transient overexpression of the FADD derivative ablated CD95-induced cell death in BJAB and Jurkat cells (data not shown). The sphingolipid ceramide has been implicated as a signaling intermediate in the CD95 pathway(20.Tepper C. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24.Cifone M.G. De Maria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp.

Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green G. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To determine whether this signaling event was blocked by the FADD derivative, BJAB cells expressing FADD-DN were treated with anti-Fas IgM and, subsequently, ceramide levels assessed. Consistent with a proximal role of FADD in CD95 signaling, FADD-DN inhibited CD95-mediated ceramide generation (Fig. 1C). Additionally, vector and FADD-DN transfected BJAB cells were equally susceptible to cell death induced by the cell-permeable, active ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide, confirming that the block in the death pathway was prior to ceramide generation (Fig. 1D). Mammalian homologs of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death protease CED-3 are thought to be distal effectors of the CD95 cell death pathway. Here we show that the apoptotic protease Yama/CPP32 (17.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is activated by CD95 engagement (Fig. 1E). Endogenous Yama is expressed as a 32-kDa pro-enzyme and upon activation is proteolytically processed into active p17 and p12 subunits(17.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 27.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3696) Google Scholar). One of the proposed substrates of Yama is the nuclear enzyme PARP(17.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 27.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3696) Google Scholar). As expected, CD95-mediated activation of Yama and resulting PARP cleavage was blocked by FADD-DN (Fig. 1E). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, FADD had a weak but specific interaction with TNFR-1(9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). To determine whether FADD has a role in TNFR-1-induced cell death, the FADD derivative was transfected into TNF-sensitive MCF7 breast carcinoma cells and stable cell lines generated. Interestingly, FADD-DN expressing MCF7 cells were equally resistant to both CD95- and TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 2A, Table 1), suggesting a proximal convergence of the cytokine-mediated cell death pathway. Additionally, 293T cells transiently overexpressing TNFR-1 were protected from cell death by co-transfecting FADD-DN (data not shown). As with the BJAB cell lines, the FADD-DN MCF7 cell lines were not resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Table 1). Overexpression of interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) could “bypass” the dominant-negative effect of the FADD derivative, suggesting that the death pathway was being blocked upstream of the ICE-like proteases implicated in the apoptotic pathway.Tabled 1 While the main activity of CD95 is to trigger apoptosis, TNFR-1 can signal an array of diverse pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities(29.Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Distinct from CD95, TNFR-1 is an inducer of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)(30.Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether expression of FADD-DN modulated TNF-induced NF-κB activation. MCF7 vector and MCF7-sFADD-DN cells were transfected with an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene (5.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) and relative NF-κB activity assessed (Fig. 2B). In both cell lines, NF-κB was activated equally well, suggesting that TNFR-1 utilizes FADD to transduce the death signal and activates NF-κB by a different mechanism. To determine the mechanism by which the FADD derivative exerts its dominant negative effect, co-immunoprecipitation of FADD and FADD-DN with CD95 or TNFR-1 was assessed. 293T cells were co-transfected with AU1 epitope-tagged FADD constructs and FLAG epitope-tagged CD95, FLAG-TNFR-1, or FLAG-B94(31.Sarma V. Wolf F.W. Marks R.M. Shows T.B. Dixit V.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 269: 3302-3312Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FADD antibody and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. TNFR-1 and CD95, but not a control cytoplasmic protein, B94, co-immunoprecipitated with FADD-DN (Fig. 3A). The association of FADD and FADD-DN with CD95 was 10-fold greater than with TNFR-1, correlating with the relative apoptotic potential of the two death receptors(32.Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that FADD-DN exerts its inhibitory action by directly or indirectly forming a complex with the death receptors, preventing recruitment of endogenous FADD. It remains formally possible, however, that FADD-DN functions by binding and sequestering other death signaling molecules. In the case of CD95, the endogenous signaling machinery was studied. Four proteins, termed CAPs (for cytotoxicity-dependent APO-1-associated proteins), associate with CD95 in a ligand-dependent fashion(23.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). CAP1 and CAP2 were shown to be FADD, while CAP3 and CAP4 remain unidentified(23.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). The oligomerized receptor, along with the associated CAPs, has been designated the DISC (23.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). CAP3 or CAP4 are not the recently described candidate signaling molecules FAP-1 or RIP, as antipeptide antibodies capable of detecting endogenous FAP-1 or RIP, respectively, were unable to detect either protein associated with activated or unactivated CD95. ( 2M. E. Peter, unpublished observation.) As expected, in vector transfected BJAB cells, the DISC formed upon anti-APO-1 treatment (Fig. 3B). By contrast, anti-APO-1-stimulated sFADD-DN cells did not form a complete DISC. Instead, FADD-DN complexed with CD95 in a ligand-dependent fashion and inhibited the recruitment of FADD (CAP1 and CAP2), CAP3 and CAP4, thereby disrupting the DISC (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using FADD-DN expressing MCF7 cells (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the N terminus of FADD, which is missing in FADD-DN, is required for the recruitment and assembly of the downstream DISC components, CAP3 and CAP4. Studies are underway to identify an analagous TNFR-1 DISC. In conclusion, this is the first report to functionally establish FADD, one of numerous candidate signaling molecules, in the proximal signal transduction of CD95. Many of the contenders, including RIP and FAP1, were not found associated with the active or inactive receptor, nor are dominant negative inhibitors likely to exist. Of paramount importance is the fact that the dominant-negative version of FADD potently abrogates TNF-induced apoptosis but not TNF-induced NF-κB activation. This suggests that FADD is the common conduit of the cytokine-mediated death signal and also demonstrates that the signaling pathways for TNF-induced apoptosis and NF-κB activation are distinct (Fig. 3C). Taken together, our results demonstrate that FADD is both a necessary and sufficient mediator of CD95 and TNFR-1-induced apoptosis as overexpression of FADD engages the cell death machinery (9.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar), while a truncated derivative acts as a potent dominant-negative regulator. Future studies will hopefully elucidate downstream components of the pathway, thus linking FADD to the apoptotic proteases of the ICE/ced-3 family. We are grateful to Drs. Yusuf A. Hannun and Supriya Jayadev for their helpful advice on the ceramide measurements and Dr. Guy G. Poirier for the anti-PARP antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2051311335,"To determine the role of the FHIT gene, which encompasses the fragile site at 3p14.2, we analyzed 59 tumors of the small cell and non-small cell type by reverse transcription of FHIT mRNA, followed by PCR amplification and sequencing of products. Allelic losses affecting the gene were evaluated by microsatellite polymorphism analysis and genomic alterations by hybridization using cDNA and genomic probes. Small cell lung tumors (80%) and non-small cell lung cancers (40%) showed abnormalities in RNA transcripts of FHIT, and 76% of the tumors exhibited loss of FHIT alleles. Abnormal lung tumor transcripts lack two or more exons of the FHIT gene. Small cell lung cancer tumors and cell lines were analyzed by Southern blotting and showed rearranged BamHI fragments. These data suggest a critical role of the FHIT gene in lung carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994811935,"Expression of a constitutively active R-ras converted two cell lines that grow in suspension into highly adherent cells. There was little change in cell surface expression of integrins, but attachment to surfaces coated with the integrin ligands was greatly enhanced. Cells transfected with activated R-ras bound integrin ligands from solution with higher affinities and assembled severalfold more fibronectin matrix than control transfectants. Introduction of a dominant negative R-ras into adherent cells reduced the adhesiveness of the cells, indicating that endogenous R-ras can control the ligand-binding activity of integrins. These results provide a mechanism for the modulation of integrin ligand-binding activity as well as novel function for R-ras."
https://openalex.org/W2126223002,"Telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for chromosome stability. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, telomeric DNA is bound in a sequence-specific manner by RAP1, a multifunctional protein also involved in transcriptional regulation. Here we report the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of RAP1 in complex with a telomeric DNA site at 2.25 Å resolution. The protein contains two similar domains that bind DNA in a tandem orientation, recognizing a tandemly repeated DNA sequence. The domains are structurally related to the homeodomain and the proto-oncogene Myb, but show novel features in their DNA-binding mode. A structured linker between the domains and a long C-terminal tail contribute to the binding specificity. This structure provides insight into the recognition of the conserved telomeric DNA sequences by a protein."
https://openalex.org/W2028472887,"Using a yeast one-hybrid screen with a DNA-bound Ets-1 protein, we have identified MafB, an AP-1 like protein, as a direct interaction partner. MafB is specifically expressed in myelomonocytic cells and binds to the DNA-binding domain of Ets-1 via its basic region or leucine-zipper domain. Furthermore, it represses Ets-1 transactivation of synthetic promoters containing Ets binding sites and inhibits Ets-1-mediated transactivation of the transferrin receptor, which is known to be essential for erythroid differentiation. Accordingly, overexpression of MafB in an erythroblast cell line down-regulates the endogenous transferrin receptor gene and inhibits differentiation without affecting cell proliferation. These results highlight the importance of inhibitory interactions between transcription factors in regulating lineage-specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2003525376,"V(D)J recombination requires a pair of signal sequences with spacer lengths of 12 and 23 base pairs. Cleavage by the RAG1 AND RAG2 proteins was previously shown to demand only a single signal sequence. Here, we established conditions where 12- and 23-spacer signal sequences are both necessary for cleavage. Coupled cutting at both sites requires only the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, but depends on the metal ion. In Mn2+, a single signal sequence supports efficient double strand cleavage, but cutting in Mg2+ requires two signal sequences and is best with the canonical 12/23 pair. Thus, the RAG proteins determine both aspects of the specificity of V(D)J recombination, the recognition of a single signal sequence and the correct 12/23 coupling in a pair of signals."

In the same cells, a biologically active benzoquinone photoaffinity label specifically binds a protein of about 100 kDa, and the ability of various GA derivatives to reduce the intracellular level of p185erbB2 correlates with their ability to compete with the photoaffinity label for binding to this protein. In this report, we present evidence that the ~100-kDa ansamycin-binding protein is GRP94. Membrane-associated p185erbB2 exists in a stable complex with GRP94. GA binding to GRP94 disrupts this complex, leading to degradation of pre-existing p185erbB2 protein, and resulting in an altered subcellular distribution of newly synthesized p185erbB2.

https://openalex.org/W1997017839,"A yeast gene homologous to bacterial RNase III (RNT1) encodes a double-strand–specific endoribonuclease essential for ribosome synthesis. Two rRNA processing events are blocked in cells temperature sensitive for RNT1: cleavage at the snoRNA-dependent A0 site in the 5′ ETS and cleavage in the 3′ ETS. Recombinant RNT1 protein accurately cleaves a synthetic 5′ ETS RNA at the A0 site in vitro, in the absence of snoRNA or other factors. A synthetic 3′ ETS substrate is specifically cleaved at a site 21 nt downstream of the 3′ end of 28S rRNA. These observations show that a protein endonuclease collaborates with snoRNAs in eukaryotic rRNA processing and exclude a catalytic role for snoRNAs at certain pre-rRNA cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W2083833295,"E. coli preprotein translocase comprises SecA and a SecY/E/G complex. SecA delivers the preprotein to the putative protein-conducting channel formed by SecY/E by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion. SecG renders the translocase highly efficient. An antibody raised against the C-terminal region of SecG inhibits preprotein translocation into everted membrane vesicles despite the exposure of this region to the inside of membrane vesicles in the absence of preprotein translocation. When preprotein translocation was started with ATP and then blocked by the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, the C-terminal region was exposed to the outside of membrane vesicles. Another region of SecG showed a change in membrane sidedness upon preprotein translocation, indicating that SecG undergoes topology inversion. This topology inversion was tightly coupled to the SecG function and linked with the insertion–deinsertion cycle of SecA."
https://openalex.org/W1970590142,"The partially purified myosin-bound phosphatase had an associated protein kinase that phosphorylated the holoenzyme, primarily on the large (130-kDa) subunit. Phosphorylation of the 130-kDa subunit resulted in inhibition of phosphatase activity. The major site of phosphorylation was threonine 654 of the 130-kDa subunit or threonine 695 of the 133-kDa isoform. Phosphorylation of the large subunit did not dissociate the holoenzyme. Dephosphorylation of the large subunit was achieved by the holoenzyme, and addition of the catalytic subunit of the type 2A enzyme did not increase the rate of dephosphorylation. The associated kinase was inhibited by chelerythrine, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 5 microM (in 150 microM ATP). The associated kinase phosphorylated two synthetic peptides, one corresponding to the sequence flanking the phosphorylated threonine, i.e. 648-661 of the 130-kDa subunit, and the other to a known protein kinase C substrate, i.e. a modified sequence from the autoinhibitory region of epsilon protein kinase C. The associated kinase was activated by arachidonic and oleic acid and to a lesser extent by myristic acid. The protein kinase that phosphorylated the 130-kDa subunit and resulted in inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity was not identified."
https://openalex.org/W2111204906,"As the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system, astrocytes are positioned to nurture and sustain neurons, especially in response to cellular stresses, which occur in ischemic cerebrovascular disease. In a previous study (Hori, O., Matsumoto, M., Kuwabara, K., Maeda, M., Ueda, H., Ohtsuki, T., Kinoshita, T., Ogawa, S., Kamada, T., and Stern, D.(1996) J. Neurochem., in press), we identified five polypeptide bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding to molecular masses of about 28, 33, 78, 94, and 150 kDa, whose expression was induced/enhanced in astrocytes exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia followed by replacement into the ambient atmosphere (reoxygenation). In the current study, the ≈150-kDa polypeptide has been characterized. Chromatography of lysates from cultured rat astrocytes on fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q followed by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis led to isolation of a ≈150-kDa band only observed in hypoxic cells and which had a unique N-terminal sequence of 15 amino acids. Antisera raised to either the purified ≈150-kDa band in polyacrylamide gels or to a synthetic peptide comprising the N-terminal sequence detected the same polypeptide in extracts of cultured rat astrocytes exposed to hypoxia; expression was not observed in normoxia but was induced by hypoxia within 24 h, augmented further during early reoxygenation, and thereafter decreased to the base line by 24 h in normoxia. ORP150 expression in hypoxic astrocytes resulted from de novo protein synthesis, as shown by inhibition in the presence of cycloheximide. In contrast to hypoxia-mediated induction of the ≈150-kDa polypeptide, neither heat shock nor a range of other stimuli, including hydrogen peroxide, cobalt chloride, 2-deoxyglucose, or tunicamycin, led to its expression, suggesting selectivity for production of ORP150 in response to oxygen deprivation, i.e. it was an oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150). Northern and nuclear run-off analysis confirmed the apparent selectivity for ORP150 mRNA induction in hypoxia. Subcellular localization studies showed ORP150 to be present intracellularly within endoplasmic reticulum and only in hypoxic astrocytes, not cultured microglia, endothelial cells, or neurons subject to hypoxia. Consistent with these in vitro results, induction of cerebral ischemia in mice resulted in expression of ORP150 (the latter was not observed in normoxic brain). These data suggest that astroglia respond to oxygen deprivation by redirection of protein synthesis with the appearance of a novel stress protein, ORP150. This polypeptide, selectively expressed by astrocytes, may contribute to their adaptive response to ischemic stress, thereby ultimately contributing to enhanced survival of neurons.

This polypeptide, selectively expressed by astrocytes, may contribute to their adaptive response to ischemic stress, thereby ultimately contributing to enhanced survival of neurons. Astrocytes are strategically located to exert neurotrophic functions, especially in response to environmentally stressful situations that threaten neuronal survival but are well tolerated by astrocytes(2.Hertz L. Lajtha A. Handbook of Neurochemistry. 2nd Ed. 1. Plenum Press, New York1981: 603-661Google Scholar, 3.Petito C.K. Morgello S. Felix J.C. Lesser M.L. J. Cerebr. Blood Flow Metab. 1990; 10: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Several examples of this beneficial impact of astrocytes on neuronal homeostasis include their ability to enhance the viability of neuronal cells subjected to glucose deprivation (4.Swanson A.R. Choi D.W. J. Cerebr. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and hypoxia(5.Matsumoto K. Yamada K. Kohmura E. Kinoshita A. Hayakawa T. Neurol. Res. 1994; 16: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underlying these effects are likely to be complex, and they include such factors as regulation of extracellular potassium concentration (6.Henn F.A. Haljamae H. Hamberger A. Brain Res. 1972; 43: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and glutamate uptake(7.Schousobe A.L. Hertz L. Svenneby G. Neurochem. Res. 1977; 2: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Astrocytes can also express neurotrophic factors(8.Pechan P.A. Chowdhury K. Seifert W. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this context, we have reported that cultured rat astrocytes exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation elaborate a neurotrophic cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), ( 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salineHhypoxiaRreoxygenationORPoxygen-regulated proteinGRPglucose-regulated proteinFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideHO-1heme oxygenase type 1.) suggesting that this is an inducible factor produced by astrocytes that could enhance neuronal survival(9.Maeda Y.

Another aspect of the cellular response to hypoxia is characterized by the expression of a set of stress proteins, termed oxygen-regulated proteins (ORP)(16.Wilson R.E. Sutherland R.M. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1989; 6: 9561-9566Google Scholar), which are believed to have important roles in protecting cellular biosynthetic activities under stressful circumstances. In cultured astrocytes subjected to hypoxia, expression of a group of stress proteins, with molecular mass values corresponding to ≈28, 33, 78, 94, and 150 kDa, was observed. The 28-, 78-, and 94-kDa stress proteins had properties of glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs), based on parallel induction in normoxic astrocytes exposed to 2-deoxyglucose or calcium ionophore. Furthermore, the 78-kDa polypeptide proved to be identical to GRP78/Bip by the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis(1.Hori, O., Matsumoto, M., Kuwabara, K., Maeda, M., Ueda, H., Ohtsuki, T., Kinoshita, T., Ogawa, S., Kamada, T., Stern, D. (1996) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). In our previous study(1.Hori, O., Matsumoto, M., Kuwabara, K., Maeda, M., Ueda, H., Ohtsuki, T., Kinoshita, T., Ogawa, S., Kamada, T., Stern, D. (1996) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar), we observed an ≈150-kDa polypeptide expressed by hypoxic astrocytes that has been characterized in detail in the current experiments. The ≈150-kDa polypeptide is selectively expressed by cultured rat astrocytes but not endothelial cells, microglia, or neurons subjected to oxygen deprivation. Identification of the first 15 N-terminal amino acid residues indicates that this polypeptide is unique. Based on its induction in hypoxic astrocytes but not in astrocyte cultures exposed to heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, 2-deoxyglucose, or other agents, it has been termed an oxygen-regulated protein-150 or ORP150. ORP150 is present intracellularly, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and induced in gerbil brain following experimentally induced ischemia. These data suggest that ORP150 may be a selective marker of astrocyte adaptation to oxygen deprivation, potentially enhancing the synthesis and/or export of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum important for astrocyte and, possibly, neuronal survival in ischemia. Rat primary astrocytes and microglia were obtained from neonatal rats by a minor modification of previously described methods(9.Maeda Y. Matsumoto M. Ohtsuki T. Hori O. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Yan S.D. Ohtsuki T. Kinoshita T. Kamada T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral hemispheres were harvested from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats within 24 h of birth, meninges were carefully removed, and brain tissue was digested at 37°C in minimal essential medium with Joklik's modification (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing Dispase II (3 mg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended and grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%, CellGrow, Boston, MA). After 10 days, cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μg/ml; Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) was added (48 h) to prevent fibroblast overgrowth, and cultures flasks were agitated on a shaking platform. Then, floating cells were aspirated (predominantly microglia), and the adherent cell population was identified by morphological and immunohistochemical (detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein) criteria. Cultures used for experiments were >98% astrocytes. Brain microvessel endothelial cells and neurons were separated from digested neonatal rat brain homogenates as described(17.Gordon E.L. Danielsson P.E. Nguyen T. Winn H.R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 312-326Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18.Boyd F.T. Clarke D.W. Muther T.F. Raizada M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15880-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of about 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in the above medium except neurons, which were cultured in astrocyte-conditioned medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and glucose (20 mM). When cultures achieved confluence, they were exposed to hypoxia using an incubator attached to a hypoxia chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI), which maintained a humidified atmosphere with low oxygen tension, as described previously(1.Hori, O., Matsumoto, M., Kuwabara, K., Maeda, M., Ueda, H., Ohtsuki, T., Kinoshita, T., Ogawa, S., Kamada, T., Stern, D. (1996) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar, 19.Ogawa S. Gerlach H. Esposito C. Macaulay A.P. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Where indicated, after exposure to hypoxia, cultures were returned to the ambient atmosphere (reoxygenation, R), at which time the conditioned medium was rapidly exchanged with fresh medium. Oxygen tension in the medium was measured using a blood gas analyzer (ABL-2, Radiometer, Sweden). Cell viability was assessed by several methods including morphological criteria, trypan blue exclusion, lactose dehydrogenase release, and evaluation of general protein synthesis based on incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material(20.Hori O. Matsumoto M. Maeda Y. Ueda H. Kinoshita T. Stern D. Ogawa S. Kamada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Astrocytes (about 5 × 108 cells) exposed to hypoxia for 48 h were harvested, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.0), and protein was extracted with PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), PMSF (1 mM), and EDTA (5 mM). Extracts were then filtered (0.45 μm); either extracts were subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE (7.5%, about 25 μg/lane) or 2-3 mg of protein was diluted with 50 ml of PBS (pH 7.0) containing Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40; 0.05%) and EDTA (5 mM) and applied to FPLC Mono Q (bed volume, 5 ml; Pharmacia, Sweden). The column was washed with 0.2 M NaCl and eluted with an ascending salt gradient (0.2-1.8 M NaCl); 10 μl of each fraction (0.5 ml) was applied to reduced SDS-PAGE (7.5%), along with molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad). Proteins in the gel were visualized by silver or Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions eluted from FPLC Mono Q that contained the ≈150-kDa polypeptide band (fractions 6-7) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) 50-fold, and about 200 μg of protein was subjected to preparative, reduced SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Following electrophoresis, proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically (0.5 mA/cm2) to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) paper (Millipore, Tokyo), the paper was dried, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band with a molecular mass corresponding to ≈150 kDa (ORP150) was cut out. N-terminal sequencing of the band was performed using an automated peptide sequencing system (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer Co., Ltd., Japan), and protein sequence data were compared with those available in the data banks using the SWISSPROT data base. The ≈150-kDa gel band visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of fractions from preparative SDS-PAGE was destained and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures(21.Cooper H.M. Paterson Y. Coligen J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 2.4.1-2.4.7Google Scholar). A peptide was also synthesized based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of ORP150, aggregated by the multiple antigen peptide method (Sawadie Technology Inc., Tokyo)(22.Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), and used to immunize rabbits by the same procedure. Animals received a second immunization at 4 weeks; 1 month later, immune serum was harvested, and IgG was prepared by affinity chromatography using immobilized protein A (Econopack, Bio-Rad). The titer of antiserum raised against the N-terminal ORP150 synthetic peptide was assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay after overnight dialysis versus PBS (about 1 mg/ml in each case). To assess the specificity of anti-ORP150 IgG, Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al.(23.Towbin H. Strachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44583) Google Scholar). In brief, either normoxic or hypoxic astrocytes were exposed to Nonidet P-40 (1%), and about 10 μg of extracted protein (in each case) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred to PVDF paper, and reacted with anti-ORP150 IgG (1:200 dilution, 5 μg/ml) raised against the purified native ORP150. Fractions (2 μl) from FPLC Mono Q of hypoxic astrocyte extracts were similarly subjected to Western blotting using the anti-ORP150 IgG. To further test the specificity of anti-ORP150 IgG, studies were performed with synthetic peptide comprising the first 15 amino acid residues of ORP150. The indicated amount of either ORP150 N-terminal peptide or bovine serum albumin was blotted onto nitrocellulose paper and reacted with anti-ORP150 IgG (5 μg/ml) raised to purified ORP150 as described above. In brief, protein extract prepared from about 5 × 108 astrocytes exposed to hypoxia for 48 h was incubated in Tris-buffered saline (about 12 ml) containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), EDTA (5 mM), and PMSF (1 mM) and was incubated for 12 h at 4°C with either anti-ORP150 IgG or preimmune IgG (1:50 dilution, 20 μg/ml in each case). Then, a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (0.4 ml/tube, 10% suspension of IgGSorb, The Enzyme Center, Malden, MA) was added to each tube and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min), the supernatant was collected, concentrated 50-fold by ultrafiltration, an aliquot (20 μl containing about 10 μg of protein) was subjected to Western blotting, and blots were reacted with anti-ORP150 IgG raised to the N-terminal ORP150 synthetic peptide. Cultured astrocytes (about 5 × 106 cells) were exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation, as described. In certain experiments, cycloheximide (3 μg/ml) was added at the start of hypoxia, and the incubation was continued for 48 h. At the indicated time points, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in the presence of PBS (200 μl) containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), EDTA (5 mM), and PMSF (1 mM). After centrifugation (5000 × g for 5 min at 4°C), the supernatant (about 1 μg of protein) was applied to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred to PVDF paper, and stained with anti-ORP150 IgG raised to purified ORP150. To examine whether exposure of astrocytes to environmental stresses other than hypoxia could induce ORP150 expression, cultured astrocytes maintained in normoxia were either subjected to heat shock (43°C for 3 h) or hydrogen peroxide (5 μM for 10 min) was added and subsequently incubated for 6 h prior to harvest. In other experiments, astrocytes were incubated under normoxic conditions and exposed to either cobalt chloride (1 mM), 2-deoxyglucose (25 mM), or tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and subjected to Western blotting using the anti-ORP150 IgG prepared against purified ORP150. In each experiment, samples were also immunoblotted with anti-GRP78 antiserum (Stressgen, USA), anti-HSP72 monoclonal antibody (Amersham), or anti-heme oxygenase type 1 (HO-1) antiserum (Stressgen, USA) at recommended concentrations. To determine the cellular localization of ORP150 antigen in hypoxic astrocytes, about 108 astrocytes were exposed to hypoxia for 48 h and harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Fractionation of cell lysates was performed as described(24.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and, following measurement of protein concentration, each fraction (about 1 μg of protein) was immunoblotted with anti-ORP150 IgG raised to purified ORP150. Immunocytochemical studies were performed in hypoxic astrocytes as described(25.Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25752-25781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). In brief, astrocytes plated on glass coverslips were exposed to hypoxia for 48 h, fixed in paraformaldehyde (3.3%), permeabilized using PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), and incubated with either anti-ORP150 IgG (raised to purified ORP150) or preimmune rabbit IgG (in each case at 1:100 dilution, 10 μg/ml). Sites of primary antibody binding were visualized using rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). To further analyze the subcellular localization of ORP150 antigen in hypoxic astrocytes, about 5 × 108 hypoxic astrocytes were pelleted and fractionated as described(26.Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In brief, astrocyte cell pellets frozen at −80°C were thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone), and the cells were cavitated at 400 psi N2 pressure for 30 min by nitrogen cavitation bomb (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ). Following homogenization, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF). The clarified lysate was then centrifuged and fractionated by a series of sucrose steps: 38, 30, and 20% sucrose (all prepared in 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol) at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4°C. Layered fractions (fractions 1-4) were collected by puncturing the tube at the desired depth, and gently withdrawing the fluid. The pellet at the bottom of the tube was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A (precipitate fraction). Following measurement of protein concentration, each fraction (about 1 μg of protein) was subjected to Western blotting using either anti-ORP150 IgG raised to purified ORP150 or anti-GRP78 antiserum. To confirm the induction of ORP150 mRNA in astrocytes by hypoxia, a partial ORP150 cDNA corresponding to 151-570-base pair deduced amino acid residues 51-190 were employed for Northern analysis (GenBank No. U41853). ( 2J. Ikeda, H. Yanagi, K. Kuwabara, S. Ogawa, M. Matsumoto, and Y. Yura, manuscript in preparation.) About 5 μg of total RNA was extracted from astrocytes exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation for the indicated times by the AGPC method. RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose/formamide gels and transferred overnight onto Biodyne B paper (Pall BioSupport, NY). The membrane was prehybridized for 3 h at 42°C in hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 5 × Denhardt's solution, SDS (0.5%), and heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml). ORP150 cDNA was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NZ522, DuPont NEN) by the random hexamer procedure(27.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B.V. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16561) Google Scholar). After hybridization overnight at 42°C in hybridization buffer containing radiolabeled cDNA probe (5 ng/ml), filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS and 0.2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 52°C, exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film, Japan), and subjected to autoradiography. The level of ORP150 mRNA was evaluated by the comparison with β-actin mRNA. Nuclear run-off analysis was performed as described (9.Maeda Y. Matsumoto M. Ohtsuki T. Hori O. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Yan S.D. Ohtsuki T. Kinoshita T. Kamada T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) to determine the relative rates of ORP150 transcription. In brief, nuclear suspension (0.2 ml), obtained from about 2 × 108 astrocytes prepared under the indicated conditions, was incubated with CTP, ATP, and GTP (0.5 mM each) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (250 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN). Samples were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, and RNA was precipitated and resuspended in hybridization buffer. Hybridization to denatured rat ORP150 and rat β-actin (control) probes (20 μg in each case) dot-blotted onto nylon membranes was performed at 42°C for 2 days. Filters were washed, dried, and exposed to Fuji x-ray film. To examine the expression of ORP150 antigen in the central nervous system, cultured rat microglia, brain microvessel endothelial cells, and cortical neurons were exposed to hypoxia for 24 h. Cells were lysed in PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), and about 1 μg of protein extract was subjected to Western blotting by using the anti-ORP150 IgG (raised to purified ORP150) as described above. Expression of ORP150 antigen in ischemic brain was studied using adult C57BL mouse (20-25 g) subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery(28.Tamura A. Graham D.I. McCulloch J. Teasdale G.M. J. Cerebr. Blood Flow Metab. 1981; 1: 449-452Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed 24 h after ischemia, and the frontal and parietal cortex was harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were thawed and homogenized in PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), EDTA (5 mM), and PMSF (1 mM) and immunoblotted using anti-ORP150 IgG. Expression of ORP150 antigen in ischemic brain was also examined by immunohistochemical analysis(29.Kitagawa K. Matsumoto M. Tagaya M. Kuwabara K. Hata R. Handa N. Fukunaga R. Kimura K. Kamada T. J. Cerebr. Blood Flow Metab. 1991; 11: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and 24 h after ischemia, they were perfused transcardially with 0.01 M PBS, followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brains were immersed for 12 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stored in 20% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH7.4). Brain sections were cut in a cryostat and stained with anti-ORP150 IgG (raised to purified ORP150) as described (9.Maeda Y. Matsumoto M. Ohtsuki T. Hori O. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Yan S.D. Ohtsuki T. Kinoshita T. Kamada T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Oxygen tension in the medium fell to about 8 torr within 8 h after cultures were transferred to the hypoxia chamber. Cell viability was maintained throughout hypoxia (H) and following replacement of cultures back to normoxia (reoxygenation (R)), based on lack of lactose dehydrogenase release into the culture supernatant, continued trypan blue exclusion, adherence of cells to the culture substrate, and unchanged morphologic features. Total cellular protein synthesis in astrocytes exposed to hypoxia for 48 h, assessed by incorporation of [3H]leucine, decreased to 68.4 ± 1.8% of that observed in normoxic controls by 48 h. The reversibility of this approximately 30% suppression of protein synthesis was evident by the rebound to levels about 1.7 times that seen in normoxia within 3 h of restoring hypoxic cultures to the ambient atmosphere. In a previous study, we observed that metabolically labeled astrocytes exposed to hypoxia demonstrated five induced/enhanced bands corresponding to molecular masses of ≈28, 33, 78, 94, and 150 kDa within 12 h(1.Hori, O., Matsumoto, M., Kuwabara, K., Maeda, M., Ueda, H., Ohtsuki, T., Kinoshita, T., Ogawa, S., Kamada, T., Stern, D. (1996) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Increased expression of these polypeptides was observed to be sustained throughout hypoxia (up to 48 h) and into the first 4-8 h of reoxygenation. At later times after replacement into the ambient atmosphere, their expression was diminished, reaching levels close to normoxic controls within 24-48 h. Our earlier study characterized the 78-kDa polypeptide as GRP78 based on N-terminal sequence analysis and immunoreactivity with antisera to GRP78. In this study, we have characterized the ≈150-kDa polypeptide band whose expression was induced in hypoxic astrocytes, termed oxygen-regulated protein 150 kDa or ORP150.

Many drugs and chemicals that form reactive electrophiles modify protein structure by binding covalently to nucleophilic functional groups. Although many of these agents also activate transcription of the inducible member of the hsp70 gene family, it is not clear if covalent modification of cellular proteins per se is sufficient. Iodoacetamide (IDAM) is a prototypical alkylating toxicant that induces hsp70 transcription. However, IDAM-induced cell death is indirectly linked to protein alkylation through depletion of glutathione, induction of oxidative stress, and increased lipid peroxidation. Therefore, we determined if any of these secondary cytotoxic events might lead to activation of hsp70 transcription. IDAM treatment increased hsp70 transcription by activating heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1). The addition of antioxidants and iron or calcium chelators prevented cell death but did not prevent hsp70 transcription or HSF1 activation. However, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked activation of hsp70 by low concentrations of IDAM. Furthermore, the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) after IDAM removal blocked hsp70 transcription and HSF1 activation without altering IDAM binding. DTT had no effect on activation of HSF1 by hyperthermia. After IDAM treatment, cellular nonprotein and protein thiols had decreased to less than 20 and 70%, respectively, of the value in control cells. DTT treatment in situ prevented the loss of cellular protein thiols and blocked the formation of high molecular weight protein aggregates. Thus, alkylation of proteins is insufficient to activate hsp70 transcription and DNA binding of HSF1.

Our results indicate that both cell types attach and spread on fibrillin-1 and that the RGD sequence in the fourth 8-cysteine motif mediates this interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1993963200,"Incubating rat diaphragm muscles with insulin increased the glycogen synthase activity ratio (minus glucose 6-phosphate/plus glucose 6-phosphate) by approximately 2-fold. Insulin increased the activities of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the Mr = 90,000 isoform of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (Rsk) by approximately 1.5-2.0-fold. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was more effective than insulin in increasing MAP kinase and Rsk activity, but in contrast to insulin, EGF did not affect glycogen synthase activity. The activation of both MAP kinase and Rsk by insulin was abolished by incubating muscles with the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD 098059; however, the MEK inhibitor did not significantly reduce the effect of insulin on activating glycogen synthase. Incubating muscles with concentrations of rapamycin that inhibited activation of p70S6K abolished the activation of glycogen synthase. Insulin also increased the phosphorylation of PHAS-I (phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein) and promoted the dissociation of the PHAS-I•eIF-4E complex. Increasing MAP kinase activity with EGF did not mimic the effect of insulin on PHAS-I phosphorylation, and the effect of insulin on increasing MAP kinase could be abolished with the MEK inhibitor without decreasing the effect of insulin on PHAS-I. The effects of insulin on PHAS-I were attenuated by rapamycin. Thus, activation of the MAP kinase/Rsk signaling pathway appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for insulin action on glycogen synthase and PHAS-I in rat skeletal muscle.

INTRODUCTIONGlycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle has a key role in the control of blood glucose levels by insulin. The large majority of postprandial glucose uptake occurs in skeletal muscle(1.Baron A.D. Brechtel G. Wallace P. Edelman S.V. Am. J.

(Lond.). 1975; 247: 273-288Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and most of the glucose that enters muscle fibers in response to insulin is converted to glycogen(3.Jue T. Rothman D.L. Shulman G.I.

This hormonal effect involves activation of glycogen synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of intracellular glucose to glycogen(4.Cohen P. Boyer P. Krebs E.G.

The pattern of dephosphorylation is consistent with the hypothesis that insulin activates PP1G, the glycogen-bound form of type I protein phosphatase, as this phosphatase is able to dephosphorylate multiple sites in the synthase subunit(6.Cohen P.

PHAS-I is an excellent substrate for MAP kinase in vitro, and the major site (Ser64) phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro is phosphorylated in response to insulin in adipocytes(27.Haystead T.A.J.

Moreover, essentially all of the insulin-stimulated PHAS-I kinase activity in adipocyte extracts is accounted for by the ERK-1 and ERK-2 isoforms of MAP kinase(23.Lin T.-A. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Based on these results, MAP kinase was proposed to mediate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I by insulin in adipocytes. Thus far, all studies of the regulation of PHAS-I by insulin have been confined to adipocytes.Recent findings indicate that activation of MAP kinase is neither necessary nor sufficient for the effects of insulin on glycogen synthase in fat cells(28.Robinson L.J.

MAP kinase activation by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was blocked by a novel inhibitor of MEK, PD 098059, without inhibiting the effect of insulin on glycogen synthase(30.Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J.

PHAS-I phosphorylation is increased by agonists that activate MAP kinase; however, the phosphorylation of PHAS-I by insulin was not attenuated by inhibition of MAP kinase activation with PD 098059(22.Lin T.-A.

In contrast, the effect of insulin on increasing PHAS-I phosphorylation and promoting the dissociation of the PHAS-I•eIF-4E complex was markedly inhibited by rapamycin(21.Lin, T.-A., Lawrence, J.

J. 1995; 305: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Multiple pathways had been previously shown to exist for the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin in rat adipocytes(38.Lawrence Jr., J.C. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different cell types might utilize different transduction pathways to activate synthase, and it has been suggested that the mechanism of activation of synthase in skeletal muscle differs from that in adipocytes.In view of the importance of skeletal muscle in the regulation of glycogen and protein metabolism by insulin, it is important to determine which signaling pathways are utilized by insulin in this tissue. In the present experiments, we have investigated the roles of the MAP kinase and rapamycin-sensitive pathways in mediating the effects of insulin on glycogen synthase and PHAS-I in rat diaphragm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIncubation of Muscle in VitroMale rats (60-80 g, Sprague-Dawley, Sasco) were fed ad libitum before diaphragms with the surrounding ribs were removed as described by Goldberg et al.(39.Goldberg A.L. Martel S.B. Kushmerick M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 82-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Incubations were conducted essentially as described previously(40.Smith R.L. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2201-2207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to remove endogenous hormones, muscles were incubated at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min. For treatments, muscles were transferred to Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM potassium phosphate, 1.2 mM MgSO4, and 25 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.4) plus 5 mM glucose and incubated at 37°C with insulin (20 nM) or EGF (100 nM) for the desired time. When present, rapamycin or PD 098059 was added 30 min before insulin or EGF. All media were gassed continuously by bubbling with a 19:1 mixture of O2:CO2. To terminate the incubations, the muscles were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diaphragms were chipped out of the rib cages, ground into powder in a porcelain mortar chilled with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −75°C.For measurements of glycogen synthase, powdered muscle (100 mg) was homogenized using a tissue grinder (Teflon-glass) at 4°C in a solution (1 ml) composed of 100 mM potassium fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM sodium potassium phosphate, 2 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and protease inhibitors benzamidine (1 mM), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mM). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were retained. When protein kinase activities were to be measured, powders were homogenized in buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 μM microcystin, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, and the same protease inhibitors as used in the synthase homogenization buffer. After preparation of extracts by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min), the protein content of each sample was measured (41.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar) and adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml by adding homogenization buffer.Measurements of Glycogen Synthase ActivitiesSynthase activities were measured by monitoring the incorporation of [14C]glucose from UDP-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen(42.Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Activity ratios represent the activity measured without glucose 6-phosphate divided by the activity measured in the presence of 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate. Total activity represents that measured in the presence of 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate and is expressed relative to extract protein(43.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).AntibodiesERK-1 antisera were generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide (CQETARFQPGAPEAP) based on a sequence in the COOH-terminal region of ERK-1, and antibodies were affinity-purified before use as described previously(44.Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 10305-10309Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The p70S6K and Rsk antisera were from the laboratory of Dr. Edwin Krebs (University of Washington) and were generated by immunizing rabbits with the peptides corresponding to sequences found in mouse Rsk (ESSILAQRRVRKLPSTTL) (45.Eldar-Finkelman H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or in p70S6K (CQAFPMISKRPEHLRMNL). PHAS-I antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with purified [His6]PHAS-I(27.Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

Purified synthase protein (46.Takeda Y. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8951-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was administered subcutaneously (0.2 mg/injection) at monthly intervals as emulsions (complete adjuvant for the initial injection and incomplete adjuvant for boosts). After the second boost, eggs were collected, and IgY was purified from the yolks by using the dextran sulfate method described by Jensenius et al.(47.Jensenius J.C. Andersen I. Hau J. Crone M. Koch C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 46: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (2 mg of synthase/ml) as directed by the supplier (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the synthase resin was used to affinity purify the antibodies as described previously(44.Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 10305-10309Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar).MAP Kinase ActivitiesThe activities of MAP kinase in extracts were measured by using [γ-32P]ATP and MBP as substrates(48.Ahn N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11495-11501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of the reaction mixture and the incubation procedures used were exactly as described previously(29.Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21255-21261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An immune complex assay was used to assess the activity of the ERK-1 isoform of MAP kinase. Except for the use of diaphragm extracts (20 μg of protein), this assay was performed exactly as described previously for measuring ERK-1 activity in adipocyte extracts(44.Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 10305-10309Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 was also assessed by using the “in-gel” assay described by Wang and Erikson(49.Wang H.-W. R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this assay, extract samples (25 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in gels containing MBP fixed within the matrix of the gel. Kinase activities were measured after renaturation as described previously(49.Wang H.-W. R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In some experiments, single muscle fibers were manually dissected from freeze-dried specimens of control and EGF-treated diaphragms and dissolved in SDS sample buffer(50.Lawrence Jr., J.C. Chi M.M. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The “in-gel” assay was used to assess ERK-1 and ERK-2 activities in samples (0.2 μg, dry weight) of individual fibers.Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase ActivitiesProtein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad, 0.1 ml of serum per ml of packed beads) were incubated at 23°C for 60 min with nonimmune serum or antisera to either Rsk or p70S6K. The beads were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (145 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, and 10 mM sodium PD, pH 7.4) and once with homogenization buffer. Samples of extract (100 μl) were incubated with beads (10 μl) for 60 min at 4°C with constant mixing and then washed twice (0.5 ml of homogenization buffer/wash) and suspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer.Rsk activity was measured by mixing beads with 10 μl of solution containing 50 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.4), 14 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 9 μM cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitory peptide(51.Cheng H.C.

The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30°C before the reactions were terminated.The S6 peptide, KEAKEKRQEQIAKRRRLSSLRASTSKSGGSQK, is based on a phosphorylated region of ribosomal protein S6 and was used by Dent et al.(9.Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) to assay the activity of the RGL kinase, ISPK, later identified as Rsk-2(10.Donella-Deana A. Lavoinne A. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11.Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). With S6 peptide as substrate, the reactions were terminated by spotting samples (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose papers (1 × 2 cm, Whatman P81) and immediately immersing the papers in 175 mM H3PO4. The amounts of 32P incorporated into the peptide were determined after washing the papers as described previously(29.Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21255-21261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When [His6]ΔRGL was used as substrate for Rsk, the reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE(52.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), and the relative amounts of 32P incorporated into [His6]ΔRGL were determined by using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics).To measure p70S6K activities, immune complexes were incubated as described for measuring Rsk activities, except that 40 S ribosomes (2 mg/ml final concentration) were used as substrate. The ribosomes were purified from rat liver as described by Krieg et al.(53.Krieg J. Olivier A.R. Thomas G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The protein kinase reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE(52.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of 32P incorporated into ribosomal protein S6 were determined by phosphorimaging.Preparation of [His6]ΔRGLThe 1329-base pair NcoI-NcoI fragment was excised from G•pET-8c plasmid(8.Tang P.M.

This construct encodes the first 443 amino acid residues of RGL plus 6 NH2-terminal His residues and 4 additional amino acids (Val-Ser-Asn-Asn) at the COOH terminus. The orientation and reading frame of the insert were determined to be correct by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. The resulting plasmid, ΔC-G•pET, was transformed into Escherichia coli [BL21(DE3)], and after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, [His6]ΔRGL was extracted and purified by chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). After SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue, the recombinant protein appeared as a species of apparent Mr = 65,000. This is somewhat higher than the Mr = 52,300 expected of the protein encoded by the cDNA, but intact RGL also exhibits lower electrophoretic mobility than would be expected of its actual Mr(8.Tang P.M.

CFTR also decreased the extent of elevation of the renal Na+ channel P0 following PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Moreover, the presence of CFTR prohibited the inward rectification of the gating of this renal Na+ channel normally induced by PKA-mediated phosphorylation, thus down-regulating inward Na+ current. This interaction between CFTR and Na+ channels occurs independently of whether or not wild-type CFTR is conducting anions. However, the nonconductive CFTR mutant, G551D CFTR, cannot substitute for the wild-type molecule.

Moreover, both the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, agents that act via the cAMP second messenger system, stimulate airway Na+ reabsorption. Aerosolized amiloride, an inhibitor of epithelial Na+ channels, has been found to inhibit excessive Na+ reabsorption, to improve mucociliary clearance, and to reduce the decline in pulmonary function(11.Knowles M.R. Olivier K.N. Hohneher K. Noone P. Mason S. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1993; 9: 148Google Scholar). In cell-attached patches of cultured human nasal epithelial cells, Chinet et al.(12.Chinet T.C. Fullton J.M. Yankaskas J.R. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1050-C1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recorded amiloride-sensitive cation channels. These channels had a single channel conductance of 21 pS and a Na+/K+ permeability ratio of 6. However, upon excision, these channels lost their ability to discriminate between Na+ and K+. The same channels were observed in cultured CF nasal tissue(13.Chinet T.C. Fullton J.M. Yankaskas J.R. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1061-C1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cell-attached patches, the single channel open probability (P0) was found to be twice as high compared with that in normal cells, consistent with the earlier results of Duszyk et al.(14.Duszyk M. French A.S. Man S.F.P. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1989; 67: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Grubb et al.(15.Grubb B.R. Vick R.N. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1478-C1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that freshly excised nasal epithelia from CFTR-/- “knockout” mice also displayed Na+ hyperabsorption. These electrophysiologic results contrast with studies on the development of Na+ transport in the neonatal rat lung, which indicate that increased Na+ transport results in an increase in absolute levels of Na+ channel mRNA(16.O'Brodovich H. Canessa C. Ueda J. Rafii B. Rossier B.C. Edelson J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C491-C496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Voilley N. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Mattei M.G. Waldemann R. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Northern analysis of human airway epithelia revealed that all three subunits of a recently cloned epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) (18.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) were present in both normal and CF tissues, but with a lower relative amount in CF compared with normal tissue(19.Burch L.H. Talbot C. Knowles M.R. Canessa C. Rossier B. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C511-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, while it is clear that Na+ reabsorption is increased in CF-affected airway epithelia, the mechanism underlying this enhanced Na+ transport is not known. Recent evidence that CFTR can regulate the function of other ion channels (20.Egan M. Flotte T. Afione S. Solow R. Zeitlin P.L. Carter B.J. Guggino W.B. Nature. 1992; 358: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 21.Gabriel S.E. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the hypothesis that CFTR may also regulate epithelial Na+ channels. We co-incorporated immunopurified CFTR and either immunopurified bovine renal Na+ channel protein or α,β,γ-rENaC into planar lipid bilayer membranes. The intimate relationship between ENaC (18.Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) and immunopurified bovine renal Na+ channel (23.Oh Y. Benos D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) has yet to be determined. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that ENaC is one of the components, most likely the core conduction unit, of the immunopurified complex(24.Ismailov, I. I., Berdiev, B. K., Bradford, A. L., Awayda, M. S., Fuller, C. M., Benos, D. J. (1996) J. Membr. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). We examined basal Na+ channel activity in the absence and presence of CFTR as well as the influence of CFTR on protein kinase A regulation of renal Na+ channel function. In the presence of CFTR, the single channel activity of both ENaC and the immunopurified renal Na+ channel was decreased. In addition, the inward rectification of the renal channel induced by PKA-mediated phosphorylation (25.Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10235-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prevented by co-incorporation of this channel with CFTR. In the absence of CFTR, PKA-mediated phosphorylation increased the activity of the immunopurified renal Na+ channel, but had no effect whatsoever on ENaC activity either in bilayers or following expression in Xenopus oocytes. ( 2M. S. Awayda, I. I. Ismailov, B. K. Berdiev, C. M. Fuller, and D. J. Benos, submitted for publication.) Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that CFTR exerts a tonic inhibition of Na+ transport through amiloride-sensitive channels, as suggested by the recent observations of Stutts et al.(27.Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Purification of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel protein from bovine renal papillary collecting duct cells was performed as described previously(23.Oh Y. Benos D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The procedure involved homogenization, differential centrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography, and immunoaffinity purification. Final protein purity was determined by [3H]methyl bromoamiloride binding as described previously(23.Oh Y. Benos D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In all preparations, the specific activity of binding exceeded 1200 pM/mg of protein. CFTR was immunopurified from bovine tracheal epithelium essentially as described (22.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some cases, CFTR was heterologously expressed in oocytes (see below). Immunopurified renal Na+ channel protein or CFTR was reconstituted into liposomes as described earlier(22.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23.Oh Y. Benos D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Reconstituted proteoliposomes were stored at −80°C until use. Membrane vesicles from α,β,γ-rENaC mRNA-injected and water-injected oocytes were made as described by Perez et al.(28.Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman A.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thirty to forty oocytes in each group were washed and homogenized in high K+/sucrose medium containing the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μM), and DNase I (2 μg/ml). Oocyte membranes were isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient density centrifugation and resuspended in 300 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, and 5 mM MOPS (pH 6.8). Membrane vesicles were separated into 50-μl fractions and stored at −80°C until use. Planar lipid bilayers were made from a lipid solution containing a 2:1:2 mixture of diphytanoylphosphatidylethanolamine/diphytanoylphosphatidylserine/oxidized cholesterol (in n-octane; final lipid concentration = 25 mg/ml). Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Bilayer formation was ascertained by an increase in membrane capacitance to 300-400 picofarads. Bilayers were bathed in 100 mM NaCl containing 10 mM MOPS/Tris buffer (pH 7.4). All solutions were made with Milli-Q water and were filter-sterilized by passing the solution through 0.22-μm filters (Sterivax-GS filters, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Current measurements were performed using a high gain amplifier circuit (29.Alvarez O. Benos D.J. Latorre R. J. Electrophysiol. Tech. 1985; 12: 159-177Google Scholar) as described previously(30.Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The electrical continuity was provided by Ag/AgCl electrodes and 3 M KCl, 3% agar bridges that prevented electrode polarization in Cl--free solutions. The reconstituted vesicles or oocyte membranes were applied with a glass rod to one side (trans) of a preformed bilayer with the membrane potential held at −40 mV. Under these experimental conditions, the channels were oriented with the amiloride-sensitive (extracellular) side facing the trans solution and the cytoplasmic side facing the cis solution in over 90% of the incorporations. Voltage was applied to the cis chamber, and the trans chamber was held at virtual ground. The total number of channels incorporated into any given bilayer membrane was determined by PKA-induced phosphorylation or by imposition of a hydrostatic pressure gradient as described previously in detail (30.Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31.Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PKA + ATP act by increasing the P0 of immunopurified amiloride-sensitive renal Na+ channels and CFTR in planar lipid bilayers rather than by recruiting new channels because no channel-containing vesicles are present in the solutions bathing the bilayer. Imposition of a hydrostatic pressure gradient across a channel-containing bilayer also increases P0, but only for the ENaC channels (31.Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, these maneuvers reveal “silent” channels already resident in planar lipid bilayers. Single channel records were acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) as described previously(30.Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Single channel data were stored digitally and, for analysis, were filtered at 300 Hz with an 8-pole Bessel filter and acquired at 1 ms/point. All data analyses were performed in bilayers containing a single active Na+ channel. If more than one Na+ channel was detected, then any data acquired from that experiment was not used in the analysis. We have not found conditions in which only a single CFTR channel could be incorporated into a bilayer. Consequently, in the CFTR experiments, two or three CFTR channels were present. The existence of conductance sublevels in both ENaC (32.Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and immunopurified renal amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (30.Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33.Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1789-1800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) makes the definition of P0 ambiguous because it depends upon whether the unitary current is assumed to be the main state current (I) or a substate current (is). Mean current (I) is the product of unitary current (I), number of functional channels (N), and their P0: I = I N P0. However, P0 calculated using the same value for unitary conductance within the same set of experiments can represent accurately the changes in activity of the channel. For our purposes (namely, current/voltage (I/V) curves and as a descriptor of channel activity), we employed this approach of calculating P0, using the most frequently observed main transition state as the unitary current. We have previously shown that using either I or is results in the same P0 as long as the subconductance levels (m) are equally spaced(24.Ismailov, I. I., Berdiev, B. K., Bradford, A. L., Awayda, M. S., Fuller, C. M., Benos, D. J. (1996) J. Membr. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Experiments were analyzed by one-way analyses of variance. The probability (p) that the difference between two population means was significant was determined by computing the t statistic using Student's t test. Data are expressed as the mean value ± S.D. for n experiments. To test the hypothesis that CFTR influenced epithelial Na+ channel activity, plasma membrane vesicles prepared from oocytes expressing α,β,γ-rENaC alone, α,β,γ-rENaC + CFTR, or CFTR alone were fused to planar lipid bilayer membranes. Fig. 1(top trace) shows a typical current record of α,β,γ-rENaC activity. The channel had a mean conductance of 13 ± 1 pS, with a time constant of opening of 90 ± 17 ms and a time constant for exit from the closed state of 41 ± 13 ms. This channel was open ~50% of the time, with occasional openings of 53 ± 10 ms in duration to a 40-pS level. α,β,γ-rENaC in bilayers was Na+-selective (Na+versus K+ permeability of 10:1, n = 9) and displayed a high sensitivity to amiloride (apparent inhibitory equilibrium constant (Ki(amil)) of 170 ± 35 nM, n = 10). The P0 of α,β,γ-rENaC was different when vesicles from oocytes expressing both α,β,γ-rENaC and CFTR were fused with the bilayer or when oocyte membrane vesicles containing wild-type CFTR were incorporated into bilayers already containing a single α,β,γ-rENaC. The success rate in achieving simultaneous incorporation of both α,β,γ-rENaC and CFTR channels from vesicles presumably containing both these channels was 32% (12/38, where 38 represents the total number of successful incorporations of α,β,γ-rENaC) and 9% for sequential incorporations of CFTR into rENaC-containing bilayers (6/67, where 67 represents the total number of successful incorporations of α,β,γ-rENaC). However, in only three of these latter six successful experiments did CFTR exert any influence on α,β,γ-rENaC (see below). The major effect of CFTR was to decrease α,β,γ-rENaC P0 by 24%, from 0.51 ± 0.05 to 0.39 ± 0.03 (p < 0.005, n = 15 successful co-incorporations). The Na+versus K+ permeability ratio and amiloride sensitivity were unaffected by CFTR (n = 4 for each) (data not shown). Control experiments using membrane vesicles prepared from water-injected oocytes produced no channel activity at all (600 attempts). In addition, experiments were performed using ENaC- and water-injected oocyte membrane vesicles or liposomes prepared without CFTR. In these cases, the biophysical properties of α,β,γ-rENaC remained unaltered. Thus, other constituents present in the vesicles were not responsible for the observed effects. The same control experiments were performed using purified renal Na+ channels (see below). As described above, in 26 of the 38 experiments in which incorporations of α,β,γ-rENaC and CFTR coexpressed in oocytes were attempted, only α,β,γ-rENaC was detected. Because CFTR channel activity could not be recorded in the absence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation and because CFTR by itself oriented in the bilayer in a random fashion (22.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Dedman J.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29194-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), PKA + ATP were first added to the trans solution, followed by addition to the cis bathing solutions. In the 12 successful experiments, PKA + ATP addition to the cis compartment resulted in activation of CFTR, whereas trans addition had no effect. Three CFTR channels are evident in the experiment shown. The addition of anti-CFTR-(505-511) antibodies (34.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29194-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35.Chan H.-C. Kaetzel M.A. Nelson D.J. Hazarika P. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8411-8416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) subsequent to the addition of PKA + ATP inhibited CFTR, leaving α,β,γ-rENaC unscathed (P0 = 0.39 ± 0.04; p > 0.1) (Fig. 1, fourth trace, left), thus providing a way to discern ENaC activity. These anti-CFTR-(505-511) antibodies did not have any effect on α,β,γ-rENaC in the absence of co-incorporated CFTR (n = 5) (data not shown). PKA + ATP had no effect on α,β,γ-rENaC activity in the absence of CFTR (n = 5).2 The subsequent addition of 5 μM amiloride or 300 μM DPC completely inhibited α,β,γ-rENaC and CFTR, respectively (Fig. 1, bottom trace). These results indicate that CFTR, in combination with α,β,γ-rENaC, preferentially oriented in the bilayer in the same direction as the Na+ channel, namely, with its presumptive cytoplasmic side facing the cis compartment. Consequently, amiloride or DPC was effective only from the trans compartment, while the anti-CFTR-(505-511) antibodies worked from the cis side. Amiloride and DPC had no effect on CFTR and Na+ channels, respectively, at these concentrations (n = 6 for each). Therefore, the increase in total membrane current seen upon PKA + ATP addition was due to activation of CFTR alone. A similar sidedness to PKA action was noted in the series of experiments performed in which CFTR was incorporated into a bilayer already containing an active α,β,γ-rENaC. The total membrane current was increased in three experiments (out of a total of 67) when PKA + ATP were added to the cis side of the bilayer chamber. In these same three experiments, the P0 of α,β,γ-rENaC was decreased after the presumed insertion of CFTR, but before PKA + ATP addition. In 63 of the remaining 64 experiments in which the activity of α,β,γ-rENaC was not altered upon the presumed insertion of CFTR, the cis addition of PKA and ATP did not result in any change of membrane current, suggesting that CFTR was not present. However, in 2 of these 64 experiments, the subsequent addition of PKA and ATP to the trans side revealed increased CFTR channel activity, with no concomitant alteration of α,β,γ-rENaC P0. Also, an increase in CFTR channel activity upon PKA + ATP addition to the cis compartment was noted in a single experiment. In this experiment, the activity of α,β,γ-rENaC was not initially altered upon the insertion of CFTR, nor was it altered after CFTR activation with PKA + ATP. One explanation for these observations is that while both α,β,γ-rENaC and CFTR are present in the membrane, they are not in close enough proximity to interact. These results are consistent with our previous observations of a directed orientation of ENaC channels incorporated into bilayers held at −40 mV (32.Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and a random orientation of CFTR channels incorporated into bilayers by themselves (34.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29194-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results also suggest that a parallel orientation of CFTR and ENaC may be critical for their interaction. To ensure that the anti-CFTR-(505-511) antibodies did not alter the activity of α,β,γ-rENaC in the presence of wild-type CFTR, a series of anion replacement experiments was performed with CFTR-impermeable MOPS- anion substituted for Cl- (Fig. 2). Incorporations of α,β,γ-rENaC and CFTR were performed using vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing either channel. In 27 experiments, no CFTR channel activity was observed when PKA and ATP were added to either or both bathing solutions. This result was expected because CFTR, although activated by phosphorylation, could not conduct MOPS-. However, at the end of each experiment, dry CsCl was added to both compartments to a final concentration of 100 mM (note: in five separate experiments, we found that ENaC in bilayers was essentially impermeable to Cs+). In 7 of the 27 experiments, CFTR channel activity became evident after the addition of CsCl. In five of these seven experiments, the initial P0 of α,β,γ-rENaC was lower subsequent to the putative incorporation of CFTR. This decrease in P0 averaged 23.1 ± 2.0%. There was no change in the P0 of α,β,γ-rENaC in two of these experiments. This lack of effect of CFTR on α,β,γ-rENaC presumably occurred because CFTR was not oriented properly in the bilayer, as evidenced by the inability of DPC to inhibit CFTR when applied to the same compartment as amiloride. The addition of PKA and ATP did not affect α,β,γ-rENaC, similar to what was observed in Cl--containing solutions. All of these results on ENaC are summarized in the current/voltage curves shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 demonstrates that CFTR decreased current through ENaC at all potentials independent of whether or not CFTR was conductive. Given the usual variability in the gating of ion channels over long periods of time, we have performed a rigorous analysis of α,β,γ-rENaC activity in the presence and absence of CFTR (before and after the addition of PKA + ATP (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). P0 was calculated for each minute of recording (total of 10 min for each experimental condition) starting at the third minute after the addition of reagents. Clearly, the P0 of α,β,γ-rENaC was significantly higher in the absence of CFTR than in its presence. p values for these unpaired measurements were less than 0.01 and 0.05 over the time course of these experiments. The influence of CFTR on an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel that was sensitive to PKA-mediated phosphorylation was next examined. For these experiments, immunopurified bovine renal papillary collecting duct amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (NaCh) (22.Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23.Oh Y. Benos D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and immunopurified bovine CFTR were used. Typically, immunopurified renal Na+ channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers displayed a very low P0 (0.02 ± 0.01)(23.Oh Y. Benos D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25.Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Under these circumstances, it was pointless to expect further inhibition of this mostly closed channel by the presence of CFTR. To overcome this problem, we reduced [Na+]cis to 10 mM (leaving [Na+]trans at 100 mM) in order to increase single channel P0 by a factor of 5(33.Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1789-1800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All other biophysical characteristics of this channel were unaltered by the imposition of this Na+ gradient.

Similarly, the activated forms of Syk and its homolog, ZAP-70, were found in soluble fractions prepared from pervanadate-treated Jurkat T-cells. A 54-kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitated with Syk from the soluble fraction of activated B-cells was identified by peptide mapping as α-tubulin. α-Tubulin was an excellent <i>in vitro</i> substrate for Syk and was phosphorylated on a single tyrosine present within an acidic stretch of amino acids located near the carboxyl terminus. α-Tubulin was phosphorylated on tyrosine in intact cells following aggregation of the B-cell antigen receptor in a reaction that was inhibited by the Syk-selective inhibitor, piceatannol. Thus, once activated, Syk releases from the aggregated antigen receptor complex and is free to associate with and phosphorylate soluble proteins including α-tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2044222466,"Inositol phosphate signaling has been implicated in a wide variety of eukaryotic cellular processes. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the phototransduction cascade is mediated by a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) encoded by the <i>norpA</i> gene. We have characterized eight <i>norpA</i> mutants by electroretinogram (ERG), Western, molecular, and <i>in vitro</i> PLC activity analyses. ERG responses of the mutants show allele-dependent reductions in amplitudes and retardation in kinetics. The mutants also exhibit allele-dependent reductions in <i>in vitro</i> PLC activity levels and greatly reduced or undetectable NorpA protein levels. Three carry a missense mutation and five carry a nonsense mutation within the <i>norpA</i> coding sequence. In missense mutants, the amino acid substitution occurs at residues highly conserved among PLCs. These substitutions reduce the levels of both the NorpA protein and the PLC activity, with the reduction in PLC activity being greater than can be accounted for simply by the reduction in protein. The effects of the mutations on the amount and activity of the protein are much greater than their effects on the ERG, suggesting an amplification of the transduction signal at the effector (NorpA) protein level. Transgenic flies were generated by germline transformation of a null <i>norpA</i> mutant using a P-element construct containing the wild-type <i>norpA</i> cDNA driven by the <i>ninaE</i> promoter. Transformed flies show rescue of the electrophysiological phenotype in R1-R6 photoreceptors, but not in R7 or R8. The degeneration phenotype of R1-R6 photoreceptors is also rescued."

We have isolated and characterized three novel cDNAs related to the B′ subunit of bovine cardiac PP2A. Two human (B′α1 and B′α2) and a mouse (B′α3) cDNA encode for alternatively spliced variants of the B′ subunit. The deduced primary sequences of these clones contain 12 of 15 peptides derived from the purified bovine B′ subunit. Differences between the deduced sequences of the B′α splice variants and the cardiac peptide sequences suggest the existence of multiple isoforms of the B′ subunit. Comparison of the protein and nucleotide sequences of the cloned cDNAs show that all three forms of B′α diverge at a common splice site near the 3′-end of the coding regions. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that the B′α transcripts (4.3-4.4 kb) are widely expressed and very abundant in heart and skeletal muscle. The expressed human and mouse B′α proteins readily associated with the PP2A core enzyme in both in vitro and in vivo complex formation assays. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that epitope-tagged B′α was localized in both the cytosol and nuclei of transiently transfected cells.

INTRODUCTIONTranscriptional activation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) ( 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPIIRNA polymerase IITFtranscription factorTBPTATA-binding proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) genes requires the coordinated function of several classes of proteins (Tjian and Maniatis, 43.Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators, or activator complexes, bind to specific DNA sequences generally upstream of the core promoter. A second class of more general factors together constitute the basal transcription apparatus, which includes RNAPII and other factors required for initiation and elongation (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH; for review, see Buratowski(7.Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and Zawel and Reinberg (45.Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)). Activators induce high levels of transcription by stimulating the activity of the basal complex, either increasing the rate of initiation or elongation by RNAPII.Functional and physical interactions between activators and basal factors require a third class of cofactors, which are not well characterized, but may physically bridge or functionally modify interactions between activators and basal factors (Gill and Tjian, 14.Gill G. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; Lewin, 30.Lewin B.

In general these cofactors are required for optimal responses to activators, but their particular mechanisms may be quite varied. These cofactors include coactivators (Gill and Tjian, 1992), adaptors (Berger et al., 4.Berger S.L. Cress W.D. Cress A. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1990; 61: 1199-1208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar; Berger et al., 5.Berger S.L. Piña B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L.

Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes, since putative homologues have been found from yeast to humans (for example, see Candau et al. (1996), Kwon et al.(27.Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), and Reese et al. (37.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)), suggesting that their roles are fundamentally important in transcriptional activation.One commonality among these factors is that they may all constitute large multicomponent complexes, perhaps to provide a high degree of flexibility in transcriptional regulation. Thus, the TFIID complex consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), associated with accessory factors (TBP-associated factors and coactivators; Dynlacht et al.(12.Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar)), which are necessary for activated transcription (Chen et al., 10.Chen J. Attardi L. Verrijzer C. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Mediators (Kim et al., 20.Kim Y.J. Björklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

The SWI/SNF complex (Peterson et al., 34.Peterson C.L. Dingwall A. Scott M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) may be required for activators to overcome chromatin-mediated repression, perhaps by associations with activators (Cote et al., 11.Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar; Kwon et al., 1994) and TBP (Imbalzano et al., 18.Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).Finally, putative transcriptional adaptors are required for full function of certain acidic activators. In previous work we identified these cofactors by their biochemical (Berger et al., 1990) and genetic interaction (Berger et al., 1992) with the activation domain of herpes simplex virus VP16. Several genes were cloned, termed ADA2 (Berger et al., 1992), ADA3 (Piña et al., 35.Piña B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and GCN5 (Marcus et al., 32.Marcus G. Silverman N. Berger S. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and mutations in them affected transcription in a manner suggestive of adaptor function. For example, mutations in ADA2 affected transcriptional activation in vivo and in vitro by certain acidic activators including VP16 and yeast GCN4, but did not affect activation by the acidic activator HAP4 (Berger et al., 1992). This functional specificity was reflected in physical interactions between ADA2 and activation domains derived from VP16 (Silverman et al., 41.Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11665-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and GCN4, but not HAP4 (Barlev et al., 3.Barlev N. Candau R. Wang L. Darpino P. Silverman N. Berger S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19337-19344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In yeast nuclear extracts, ADA2 both interacted with the TBP component of TFIID and was required for VP16 activation domain interaction with TBP (Barlev et al., 1995). These data suggested that adaptors may be required for physical interaction between activation domains and the basal transcription apparatus.ADA2, ADA3, and GCN5 interacted in vitro (Horiuchi et al., 17.Horiuchi J. Silverman N. Marcus G. Guarente L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Marcus et al., 1994), and activation in vivo by ADA2 fused to the bacterial lexA DNA binding domain (lexA-ADA2) was dependent on GCN5 and ADA3 (Marcus et al., 1994; Silverman et al., 1994). Here we report a primary structure and functional study of the adaptors. We mapped regions of GCN5 necessary for interaction with ADA2. We also defined regions of ADA2 required for interaction with GCN5 and ADA3 in vitro and then analyzed the dependence of these ADA2 mutants on ADA3 for in vivo function. We found parallels in the behavior of these mutants in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we detected physical interaction between ADA2, ADA3, and GCN5 in yeast extracts. These data indicate that the adaptors function as a complex in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast StrainsThe double adaptor deletion strain, PSY-17A Δada2 Δada3 (ade-Δhis4-519 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52), was generated from a cross between PSY316 Δada2 (MATα ade2-101 Δhis3-200 leu2-3, 112 lys2 ura3-52; Berger et al.(1992)) and BWG1-7A Δada3 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his4-519 ade1-100; Piña et al.(1993)). The resulting diploid was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected using standard techniques (Sherman and Hicks, 40.Sherman F. Hicks J. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 21-37Google Scholar). Spores that grew poorly on minimal media were tested for deletion of both ADA2 and ADA3 by transformation with ADA2 and ADA3 expression plasmids.The Δada2 derivative of BJ2168 (mata ura3-52 leu2 trp1 prb1-1122 pep4-3 prc1-407) was generated by transformation with pyADA2.KO as described (Berger et al., 1992).Plasmids and Deletion MutantsPlasmids were constructed using standard procedures (Ausubel et al., 2.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The deletion mutants of ADA2 or lexA-ADA2 were made as described (Kunkel et al., 25.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) using pRS316-ADA2 (Berger et al., 1992) or pRS316-lexA-ADA2 as parental plasmids and the following oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis.

The ADA3 expression vector was described (Piña et al., 1993).For in vitro translation, PCR fragments of ADA3 bearing BamHI restriction sites or ADA2 and GCN5 bearing BglII restriction sites were cloned into SP64 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The three genes were cloned into a yeast expression vector and were functional as assayed for complementation of ada2 or ada3 disruption strains.SP64-NotI was generated cloning a NotI linker in SP64 digested with SmaI. To generate the ADA2 deletion mutants for in vitro translation, the lexA-ADA2 deletion mutants were digested with NotI and cloned into SP64-NotI.To generate the deletion mutants of GCN5 for in vitro translation, fragments between residues 1-440, 1-350, 1-250, 1-170, 95-440, 170-440, and 250-440 of GCN5 bearing a NotI restriction site at the 5′ end and an EagI restriction site at the 3′ end were amplified by PCR. These fragments were digested with EagI and inserted in SP64-NotI opened with NotI.To generate the two halves of ADA3 for in vitro translation, fragments of ADA3 between residues 1-364 with BamHI restriction sites and 363-702 with a BglII restriction site at the 5′ end and a BamHI restriction site at the 3′ end were amplified by PCR. These fragments were digested with BamHI or BamHI/BglII and inserted in SP64 digested with BamHI.pRS426-GAL1-ADA2 and pRS425-GAL1-GCN5 were constructed by PCR generation of ADA2 or GCN5 bearing BglII restriction sites and ligation into the BamHI site of pRS426-GAL1 or pRS425-GAL1 (Mumberg et al., 33.Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) pRS424-GAL1-HA-ADA3 was constructed in three steps. First, a linker with the sequence encoding the 12CA5 epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Kolodziej and Young, 24.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was inserted into the NotI site of SP64-NotI to generate SP64-HA (only the NotI site downstream of the linker was restored after the ligation); second, ADA3 was PCRed with a NotI restriction site at the 5′ end and an EagI restriction site at the 3′ end was cloned into the NotI site of SP64-HA to generate SP64-HA-ADA3; finally, SP64-HA-ADA3 was digested with EcoRI and PstI, and HA-ADA3 was cloned into pRS424-GAL1 digested with EcoRI and PstI.Growth Complementation, Growth Inhibition, and β-Galactosidase AssaysPSY316 Δada2 was transformed as described (Ito et al., 19.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the ADA2 deletion mutants and plated in fully supplemented SD medium. After 3 days, single colonies were streaked on SD minimal medium and their ability to complement growth was tested.Growth inhibition by GAL4-VP16 was carried out in BWG1-7A Δada2 cotransformed with the ADA2 deletion mutants and GAL4-VP16 high expression plasmid and plated on SD minimal medium.β-Galactosidase assays (Rose et al., 39.Rose M. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) were carried out in PSY-17A Δada2 Δada3 or in PSY316 Δada2 transformed with the plasmids described for each experiment. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as units/mg of protein.The lacZ reporters used were pLGSD5 (Guarente et al., 15.Guarente L.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). In vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments were immunoblotted using α-ADA2 antisera (Silverman et al., 1994), α-GCN5 antisera (Candau et al., 1996), or α-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco). Immunodetection was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.).In Vitro Translation and Coimmunoprecipitation AssaysIn vitro translation experiments were performed as described (TNT kit, Pharmacia). A 20-μl slurry of Gammabind Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) was washed two times with and resuspended in 20 μl of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 300 mM potassium acetate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μM pepstatin A, 0.6 μM leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 mM benzamidine). 10 μl of reticulocyte extract containing cotranslated proteins and 2 μl of α-ADA2 antisera were added to the beads, mixed, and rotated for 3 h at 4°C. The reactions were centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A. Following the last wash, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE as indicated in each case. Input was 50% of the material used in the immunoprecipitation reaction. The gels were dried and exposed overnight on Kodak film.In Vivo Coimmunoprecipitation AssaysBJ2168 transformed with pRS426-GAL1-ADA2, pRS425-GAL1-GCN5, and pRS424-GAL1-HA-ADA3 or BJ2168 Δada2 transformed with pRS425-GAL1-GCN5 and pRS424-GAL1-HA-ADA3 as a negative control were selectively grown in fully supplemented lactate medium. When the cultures reached an optical density = 0.5, galactose was added to final concentration of 2% and incubation was continued 6 h (wild type strain) or overnight (ada2 deletion strain).50 μl of whole cell extract prepared as described (Berger et al., 1992), except without reducing agents, were incubated with 0.2 μl (to precipitate ADA2 and coprecipitate GCN5) or 2 μl (to coprecipitate HA-ADA3) of α-ADA2 antisera and a 40-μl slurry of Gammabind Sepharose beads as described for the in vitro immunoprecipitation. Because ADA2 and GCN5 electrophorese similarly to IgG, the samples used to immunoblot with α-ADA2 antisera were electrophoresed in non-reducing conditions, and the samples used to immunoblot with α-GCN5 antisera were eluted with 1 M NaCl, 0.2% SDS. Input was 30% of the material used in the immunoprecipitation reaction. The immunoblot probed with α-GCN5 showing the elutions from the protein G precipitate was exposed for 20 min, and all other immunoblots were exposed for 3 min.RESULTSGeneration of Deletion Mutants of ADA2 and Complementation TestsTo study the primary structure and function of the putative adaptors, we created deletion mutations within ADA2. Two series of deletion mutants in ADA2 (Fig. 1) were created by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987). In the first series, regions that previously had been noted to be of potential importance (Berger et al., 1992) were removed. Five regions were deleted individually: a cysteine-rich, potential zinc-binding domain that is similar to regions in the putative adaptors CBP and p300 (Δ1; Arany et al.(1.Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar)); a region of sequence similarity with the myb oncogene (Δ2; Lane and Crawford(28.Lane D.P. Crawford L.V. Nature. 1979; 278: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar)); a region of similarity with PGM, a Drosophila melanogaster protein (Δ3; Stoffers et al.(1989)); a region of strong negative charge in the middle (Δ4); and a region rich in leucine at the carboxyl terminus (Δ5). The second series was a set of overlapping deletions from the amino to the carboxyl terminus, each removing 200 base pairs (Δ6 through Δ17). Twelve mutants were initially in this series, but two were not used in the functional assays (ADA2Δ8 and ADA2Δ11) because sequence analysis revealed errors in the junctions of the deletions and the resulting proteins were shorter than predicted (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 1, each portion of the gene was deleted in at least one mutant.Several assays were used to determine the effect of the deletions on the function of ADA2. We showed previously that genetic deletion of ADA2 results in defective growth on minimal media (Berger et al., 1992). Thus, as an overall estimate of function, the ability of the ADA2 deletion mutants to complement growth of an ada2 disruption strain was tested. Each deletion mutant was transformed, and each transformant was restreaked onto minimal media along with wild type ADA2 or vector alone, as positive and negative controls for growth (Fig. 2 and Table 1, column 1). Growth of the mutants divided into three groups. Some mutants grew similar to (ADA2Δ1and ADA2Δ5) or indistinguishable from (ADA2Δ15, ADA2Δ16, and ADA2Δ17) wild type. Five mutants complemented very poorly (ADA2Δ6, ADA2Δ7, ADA2Δ12, ADA2Δ13, and ADA2Δ14). The remaining mutants gave intermediate growth phenotypes (ADA2Δ2, ADA2Δ3, ADA2Δ4, ADA2Δ9, and ADA2Δ10). In summary, the carboxyl end of the protein was dispensable for growth. Two regions were crucial for complementation, the amino terminus (Δ6 and Δ7) and a region within the middle of the protein (Δ12, Δ13, and Δ14). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the amount of protein of each mutant was similar to wild type, except mutant ADA2Δ13, which was not detected (data not shown), even though the mutant protein was stable in vitro (see below). The instability of ADA2Δ13 may be significant with regard to the structure and function of the adaptor complex, as will be discussed below.Figure 2:Growth complementation assay in the ada2 disruption strain. Each ADA2 deletion mutant was transformed into PSY316 Δada2, and each transformant was restreaked onto minimal medium. The dividing line shown in the figure separates two different experiments. Full-length ADA2 and vector alone were used as positive or negative controls in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tabled 1In cells containing wild type ADA2, overproduction of GAL4-VP16 results in a strong inhibition of growth and deletion of ADA2 relieves this toxicity (Berger et al., 1992). The growth inhibition by GAL4-VP16 was the basis of the genetic selection used to identify the adaptors ADA2 (Berger et al., 1992), ADA3 (Piña et al., 1993), and GCN5 (Marcus et al., 1994). This assay was used to assess the effect of the deletion mutations on ADA2 function (Table 1, column 2). The results were largely consistent with the growth complementation assay, since the mutations that allowed wild type colonial growth in the first assay (Δ1, Δ5, Δ15, Δ16, and Δ17) did not reduce the ability of ADA2 to complement growth inhibition by GAL4-VP16. Similarly, mutations that resulted in defective growth (Δ6, Δ7, Δ12, Δ13, and Δ14), were defective for growth inhibition by GAL4-VP16. The intermediate group for complementation (mutations Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, Δ9, and Δ10) was somewhat more negative in the growth inhibition assay, particularly Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4. Overall the results were similar in the assays and pointed to two regions crucial for ADA2 function, one at the amino terminus and the second in the middle of the protein.A third measure of function of the ADA2 mutants is their ability to substitute for wild type ADA2 in transcriptional activation. For example, a total deletion of ADA2 results in a 7-10-fold reduction in activation by GAL4-VP16 (Berger et al., 1992). Each deletion mutant was cotransformed into the ada2 disruption strain with a GAL4-VP16 low copy expression plasmid and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid. The level of GAL4-VP16 activation dependent on each of the ADA2 deletion mutants was largely consistent with the results of growth complementation and growth inhibition assays (Table 1, column 3), since the amino terminus (Δ2, Δ3, Δ6, and Δ7) and a middle region (Δ12, Δ13 and Δ14) were required for activity and the carboxyl terminus (Δ15, Δ16, and Δ17) was dispensable. However, this assay seemed to be more stringent than the other two, since certain mutations were intermediate in the previous assays, but negative for GAL4-VP16 activation (Δ2, Δ3, Δ9, and Δ10).In summary all of these assays suggest that regions of ADA2 required for function are within the amino terminus and the middle of the protein. The carboxyl terminus was dispensable in all assays.Mapping of ADA2 Interaction with GCN5 in VitroADA2 physically interacts with the putative adaptors GCN5 (Marcus et al., 1994) and ADA3 (Horiuchi et al., 1995) in vitro; however, the significance of these interactions in vivo is not known. We examined the relationship between functional interaction of the adaptors in vivo and physical interaction in vitro, reasoning that if specific mutations in ADA2 affect in vivo and in vitro interactions with other adaptors in a parallel fashion, then this would constitute strong evidence that the adaptors function in a complex in vivo.To define sequence elements within ADA2 that are required for interaction with GCN5 in vitro, the overlapping ADA2 deletion mutants (Fig. 1) were tested for their ability to coimmunoprecipitate GCN5 (Fig. 3). As shown previously (Marcus et al., 1994), wild type ADA2 co-immunoprecipitated GCN5. Deletion of the amino terminus of ADA2 (Δ6 or Δ7) abolished interaction with GCN5, while deletions downstream of Δ7 did not affect interaction with GCN5. This was consistent with previous results showing that regions contained within the first 166 amino acids (i.e. corresponding to the regions deleted in ADA2Δ6 through ADA2Δ9) were sufficient to interact with GCN5, and the rest of the protein did not form a complex with GCN5 (Candau et al., 1996).Figure 3:Effect of deletions in ADA2 on coimmunoprecipitation of GCN5. GCN5 was cotranslated with each ADA2 deletion mutant. Cotranslated proteins were immunoprecipitated with α-ADA2 antisera, and 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography after 8% SDS-PAGE. in, input; ppt, precipitate. ADA2 proteins and GCN5 are indicated on the left. The migration of ADA2 varies because of the internal deletions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To more finely map the region of ADA2 required for interaction with GCN5, the series of smaller deletion mutants, ADA2Δ1 through ADA2Δ5, was tested in the same assay (Fig. 3). Only Δ1, the Cys-rich region, and Δ3, the region showing similarity to PGM, eliminated interaction. This was consistent with the results of the coarser deletions, since Δ1 and Δ3 lie within the larger deletions Δ6 and Δ7, respectively. The other three small deletions (Δ2, Δ4, and Δ5) did not affect coprecipitation of GCN5. These results support growth complementation and other assays (Table 1) and suggest that mutants containing deletions in the amino terminus of ADA2 (ADA2Δ3, ADA2Δ6, and ADA2Δ7) fail to complement growth because, at least in part, they are unable to interact with GCN5. Mutant ADA2Δ1 did not fit this correlation, since coprecipitation was reduced but the mutant was similar to wild type in vivo, which is discussed below.To map the region of GCN5 responsible for interaction with ADA2, a series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions were made in GCN5 (Fig. 4A). The protein was divided into five regions, based on sequence conservation with the putative human homologue of GCN5 (hGCN5). Since hGCN5 interacts with both the human and yeast ADA2 homologues (Candau et al., 1996), regions of strong sequence similarity between yGCN5 and hGCN5 may be involved in the GCN5/ADA2 interaction. The region between residues 1 and 95 in the yeast protein has low similarity to the equivalent human region, the regions between 95 and 170 and between 250 and 350 have strong similarity, and the region between 170 and 250 has very strong similarity. Finally, the bromodomain, between 350 and 440, not only has strong similarity between yeast and human GCN5 (Candau et al., 1996), it is conserved with other transcription factors (Georgakopoulos and Thireos, 13.Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These yeast GCN5 mutants were then tested for their ability to interact with ADA2, using the coimmunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4B). Neither the amino terminus (amino acids 1-250) or, as previously observed, the carbox"

INTRODUCTIONProliferation and cell differentiation are mutually exclusive processes, as best exemplified in muscle precursor cells. Proliferation inhibition is a crucial step that precedes muscle-specific gene expression and cell fusion into myotubes in the process of muscle cell terminal differentiation(1.Olson E.N. Brennan T.J. Chakraborty T. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Edmondson D. James G. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 104: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, terminal differentiation of myoblastic cell lines in vitro is triggered by the accumulation of the precursor cells (myoblasts) in a G0 state(1.Olson E.N. Brennan T.J. Chakraborty T.

These proteins are all able to elicit in vitro a muscle determination program in a number of nonmuscle cell types(18.Olson E.N.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).MEF-2 transcription factors are members of the MADS box protein family. MADS box proteins are widely expressed, from plants to man and including yeast(30.Schwarz-Sommer Z. Huijser P. Nacken W. Saedler H. Sommer H. Science. 1990; 250: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). MADS box proteins exert a wide range of functions from development in plant cells to muscle differentiation or growth factor responses in mammalian cells. In yeast, the MADS box protein MCM1 is involved in the mating-type phenotype(31.Passmore S. Elble R. Tye B.K. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 921-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A highly homologous protein, the serum response factor (SRF), is instrumental to immediate early gene mitogenic responses in mammals(32.Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 33.Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The sequences that are recognized by the two proteins are homologous(34.Hayes T.E. Sengupta P. Cochran B.H. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The two proteins function in a similar manner: although both proteins are able to transactivate transcription(35.Christ C. Tye B.K. Genes & Dev. 1995; 5: 751-763Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36.Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), they mainly function by recruiting ternary complex-forming factors through a protein motif located in the MADS box(37.Primig M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The MEF-2 subset of MADS box proteins includes four members, MEF-2A, MEF-2B, MEF-2C, and MEF-2D, some of which are ubiquitous and some restricted to differentiated muscle cells. These proteins are related to SRF and are often referred to as rSRF proteins(39.Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). They bind to and transactivate CTA(A/T)4TAG DNA elements, a consensus sequence that is homologous, but not identical, to the CArG boxes (CC(A/T)6GG), which are recognized by SRF. In fact, SRF and rSRF(MEF-2) cannot heterodimerize with each other(39.Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and thus, they belong to distinct subsets of MADS box proteins.The factors that control the balance between proliferation and differentiation in muscle are not fully understood at present. However, myogenic factors of the bHLH family seem to be involved in this delicate control. In particular, MyoD is both a target for mitogens that are inhibiting differentiation (2.Vaidya T.B.

Part of the mechanism by which MyoD blocks cell proliferation in vitro seems to be the repression of proliferation-associated genes, and indeed, most of the proliferation-associated genes are silent in differentiated muscle cells(42.Leibovitch M.P. Leibovitch S.A. Hillion J. Guillier M. Schmitz A. Harel J. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

In fact, the transcription factor AP1, which is formed by heterodimers between members of the Fos-related proteins and members of the Jun-related factors, is a prominent target for MyoD: MyoD interferes with AP1 function by forming specific complexes with Jun proteins(44.Bengal E.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The SRE includes a CArG box, the binding site for SRF, which is repressed on differentiation.Paradoxically, CArG boxes are involved in the up-regulation of some muscle-specific genes such as cardiac α-actin(22.French B.A. Chow K.L.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. Tuil D. Schweighoffer F. Pinset C. Kahn A. Minty A. Eur. J.

Furthermore, SRF seems to be indispensable for muscle cell terminal differentiation(57.Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, CArG boxes of muscle genes can be replaced by the c-fos SRF-binding site without any loss of function(58.Taylor M.R. Treisman R. Garett N. Mohun T. Development (Camb.). 1989; 106: 67-78PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the same protein is involved in the activation of both genes. Thus, SRF is instrumental to the activation of both mitogen-responsive genes, such as c-fos or β-actin, which are down-regulated on muscle cell terminal differentiation(32.Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 33.Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 46.Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and muscle-specific genes.The mechanism by which SRF is converted into a muscle-specific transactivator is largely unknown. In muscle-specific promoters, transactivation by SRF could use a slightly different mechanism than that used in the c-fos promoter: the affinity of SRF for muscle CArG boxes is lower than its affinity for c-fos SRE (58.Taylor M.R. Treisman R. Garett N. Mohun T. Development (Camb.). 1989; 106: 67-78PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas one SRF-binding site is sufficient for mitogen responses, several sites are necessary to observe muscle-specific expression(51.Lee T.C. Chow K.L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60.Soulez M. Tuil D. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that with regard to muscle genes, SRF needs to cooperate with other factors for optimal transactivation. A tempting hypothesis would thus be that, in order to be active on muscle promoters, SRF needs to interact physically with other factors.In this paper, we have tested the hypothesis that SRF interacts with the myogenic bHLH proteins. We demonstrate that a heterotrimeric complex forms between bHLH proteins and SRF both in vitro and in cultured cells. The formation of this complex could be one of the means by which SRF activity is deviated from proliferative to differentiating genes upon muscle cell terminal differentiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidspEMSV-E12, pGST-SRF, and pSRE-CAT were as described in (43.Trouche D.

Olson. pEMSV-ΔbH1-myogenin (in which amino acids 71-96 have been deleted) and pEMSV-ΔH-myogenin (in which amino acids 71-163 have been deleted) were constructed using a polymerase chain reaction-amplified insert. The internal primers were TGCAAGGTGCACAGCGCCTCCTGCAG and GGCGCTGTGCACCTTGCATGCCCACG for pEMSV-ΔH-myogenin and TGCAAGGTGGTGAATGAGGCCTTCGAGG and CTCATTCACCACCTTGCATGCCCACG for pEMSV-ΔbH1-myogenin. The forward external primer included a consensus translation start site(61.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar), and both forward and reverse external primers included an EcoRI restriction site for cloning convenience. The sequences of these primers were GGAATTCACCATGGAGCTGTATGAGACATCCC (forward) and GGGGGGAATTCAGTTGGGCATGGTTTCG (reverse). pHIV-SRF, used in in vitro translation experiments, was constructed by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in a pGEM-HIV-CAT construct (62.Trouche D. Grigoriev M. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with a sequence encoding the complete SRF protein obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification (forward primer sequence, 5′-CCCCAAGCTTACCATGTTACCGACCCAA-3′; and reverse primer sequence, 5′-TCATTCACTCTTGGTGCTGTGGGCGGTG-3′).Plasmids pGAD424 and pGBT9 were a kind gift of Dr. S. Fields(63.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRS313 has been described by Sikorski and Hieter(64.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pGAD-E12 and pGAD-myogenin were constructed by inserting the corresponding complete coding sequence, obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the above-described primers for myogenin or the primers described in (43.Trouche D. Grigoriev M. Lenormand J.L. Robin P. Leibovitch S.A. Sassone-Corsi P. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1993; 363: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) for E12, into the EcoRI site of pGAD424. Plasmid pGB-SRF was constructed by inserting the complete coding sequence of SRF, obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the above-described primers and subcloned into a Bluescribe™ vector, between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGBT9. pRS-E12 and pRS-myogenin were constructed by subcloning an SphI-SphI insert from the corresponding pGAD construct into the SmaI site of pRS313. These constructs were controlled by partial sequence (which did not reveal any mutations), and results obtained with these constructs were confirmed using two independent clones.pEMSV-MyoD, pEMSV-MyoD-ΔbH, pEMSV-MyoD-bE12, and pEMSVMyoD-bT4 were kind gifts of Dr. H. Weintraub(27.Davis R.L. Cheng P. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). pEMSV-myogenin, pEMSV-ΔN-myogenin, pEMSV-ΔC-myogenin, and pEMSV-ΔN/ΔC-myogenin were kind gifts of Dr. E. Olson(65.Schwarz J.J. Chakraborty T. Martin J. Zhou J.M. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 266-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cells and TransfectionsNIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) used according to the manufacturer's recommendations) and 5% FCS. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously(43.Trouche D. Grigoriev M. Lenormand J.L. Robin P. Leibovitch S.A. Sassone-Corsi P. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1993; 363: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by scraping, washed, and resuspended in 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS. 2 μg of SRE-CAT; the indicated doses of pEMSV-E12, pEMSV-myogenin, or mutants; and 1 μg of RSV-luc (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) were added. After electrical shock (using a Bio-Rad apparatus at 960 microfarads and 200 V), each sample was divided into two aliquots, and cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS for 48 h, after which one of the aliquots was treated with 20% serum for 4 h. Cells were harvested, and extracts were standardized based on the luciferase activity of the nonserum-treated sample (samples from the same transfection were standardized based on the protein content, as measured by a Bio-Rad assay). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured using [14C]chloramphenicol and standard procedures with a 4-h assay.GST Pull-downGST or GST-SRF beads were prepared according to Lassar et al.(66.Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), except that the fusion proteins were not eluted. After four washes in NETN buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 8, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), aliquots of 10 μl of beads were frozen at −70°C. pEMSV-E12, pEMSV-myogenin, pEMSV-MyoD, and various mutants were in vitro translated or cotranslated using the TNT translation kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The programed lysates (10 μl) were incubated with the GST or GST-SRF beads (10 μl) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times in NETN buffer and mixed with 1 volume of 2 × SDS loading buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using standard procedures.Analysis of Myoblastic ProteinsC2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent dishes were induced to differentiate by switching the medium to 0.5% FCS. Differentiating cells were harvested by scraping, and nuclear proteins were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al.(67.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1486Crossref Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). 200 μg of extracts were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with GST or GST-SRF beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by dry transfer. Filters were probed with an anti-myogenin monoclonal antibody, a kind gift of Dr. W. E. Wright(68.Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and revealed by chemiluminescence using an Amersham kit following the manufacturer's recommendations.Double and Triple Hybrids in YeastYeast cells (strain Y526) were transfected with 1 μg of each of the indicated plasmids and brought to 5 μg in salmon sperm DNA as described by Legrain and Chapon(69.Legrain P. Chapon C. Science. 1993; 262: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transfected yeast cells were processed for colorimetric detection of β-galactosidase activity using standard procedures(70.Legrain P. Chapon C. Galisson F. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clones of transfected yeast were also grown to 0.8 A600 nm and extracted as described(69.Legrain P. Chapon C. Science. 1993; 262: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 20 μl of extract were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a chemiluminescent detection procedure (Tropix Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSMyogenin Physically Interacts with SRFA biochemical approach was used (71.Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) to test the hypothesis of a physical interaction between SRF and myogenic bHLH. GST or GST-SRF covered beads were incubated with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated myogenin and/or E12 (Fig. 1A). These experiments were controlled using an irrelevant translation product (luciferase) as a negative control and standardized using SRF core (DNA binding and dimerization domain) as an internal positive control (data not shown). The results demonstrated that neither myogenin (lane 6) nor E12 (lane 4) was able to bind to SRF when isolated. However, a significant level of binding could be detected when both proteins were cotranslated (lane 8), suggesting that formation of heterodimers between myogenin and E12 results in SRF recognition. The converse experiments, in which beads were coated with a mixture of GST-E12 and GST-myogenin and used to retain in vitro translated SRF, did not give clearly interpretable data, most likely due to inefficient heterodimerization of E12 and myogenin on the beads. However, when myogenin-coated beads were incubated sequentially with in vitro translated E12 and then with SRF, a significant level of SRF retention could be observed (data not shown).These results were confirmed in vivo using a double-hybrid approach in yeast(63.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). Indicator yeast cells (permanently transfected with a GAL1-lacZ reporter construct) were transfected with expression vectors encoding fusion proteins between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pGB series) or transactivating domain (pGAD series) and SRF, myogenin, or E12 in all combinations. These experiments showed that expression of fusion products between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and E12 or myogenin resulted in a high background, indicating that the transactivation domains of these proteins are active in yeast (data not shown). Therefore, these constructs could not be used in subsequent assays. When yeast cells were transfected with pGB-SRF and pGAD-myogenin or pGAD-E12, no β-galactosidase could be detected, suggesting that a heterodimer does not form between SRF and E12 or myogenin, as expected from the results of GST pull-down assays. We next introduced, into the same yeast indicator cells, three expression vectors bearing three distinct selectable markers and encoding a fusion protein between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and SRF and fusion proteins between the GAL4 activation domain and myogenin or E12, respectively. Yeast that had received the three expression vectors expressed significant amounts of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1B), indicating that a heterotrimer had formed in the cells, resulting in the activation of the GAL4-responsive promoter. In contrast, galactosidase activity was hardly detectable in yeast transfected with SRF and E12 or with SRF and myogen"

Previously we demonstrated that the α2AR subtype is directly delivered to lateral subdomain of MDCK II cells. Surface biotinylation strategies demonstrated that the α2AR, like the α2AR, achieves 85-90% basolateral localization at steady-state. However, in contrast to the α2AR, this polarization occurs after initial random insertion of the α2AR into both apical and basolateral surfaces followed by selective retention on the lateral subdomain (t½on the apical surface is 15-30 min; t½on the basolateral surface is 8-10 h). The α2AR also is enriched on the basolateral surface at steady-state and, like the α2AR, is directly delivered there. Morphological evaluation of the epitope-tagged α2AR, α2AR, and α2AR subtypes by laser confocal microscopy not only corroborated the biochemically-defined basolateral localization of all three α2AR subtypes but also revealed that the α2AR uniquely exists in an intracellular compartment(s) as well. Immunofluorescence due to intracellular α2AR partially overlaps that due to calnexin, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum, as well as that due to mannosidase II, a marker for the trans-Golgi network. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that the α2AR, α2AR, and α2AR subtypes, which possess highly homologous structures and ultimately achieve similar polarization to the lateral surface of MDCK II cells, nonetheless manifest distinct trafficking itineraries.

https://openalex.org/W2072947383,"The role of Shc as a substrate of receptors for growth factors and cytokines is well established. To gain further insight into the function of Shc in signal transduction, we used an affinity method to identify potential Shc-binding proteins. Incubation of bovine brain lysates with a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Shc fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads resulted in the binding of cellular proteins of ~115, 110, and 100 kDa as well as those of 50 and 17 kDa. Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides revealed that the 100-kDa protein was almost identical to β-adaptin and that the 110- and 115-kDa proteins were almost identical to αA-adaptin. Using immunoblot analysis, anti-α-adaptin antibody recognized several proteins of 100~115 kDa, and anti-β-adaptin antibody recognized a 100-kDa protein, suggesting that αA-, αB-, and β-adaptins are bound to the GST-Shc fusion protein. Immunoblot analysis with anti-α-adaptin antibody revealed that α-adaptin was coimmunoprecipitated with Shc from PC12, KB, and COS cell lysates, suggesting a specific interaction of Shc and adaptins in intact cells. A binding study using mutant GST-Shc fusion proteins revealed that the collagen homologous region (amino acids 233-377) of Shc was required for adaptin binding. Conversely, the collagen homologous region of Shc inhibited the binding of adaptins to GST-Shc. In addition, adaptin was able to bind mutant fusion proteins containing amino acids 233-369, 233-355, 346-369, and 346-355 of Shc, but failed to bind a mutant containing amino acids 233-345, suggesting that amino acids 346-355 (RDLFDMKPFE) in the collagen homologous region of Shc are required for adaptin binding.

https://openalex.org/W1591235965,"β1,4-Galactosyltransferase (β4-GT) is a constitutively expressed enzyme that synthesizes the β4-N-acetyllactosamine structure in glycoconjugates. In mammals, β4-GT has been recruited for a second biosynthetic function, the production of lactose which occurs exclusively in the lactating mammary gland. In somatic tissues, the murine β4-GT gene specifies two mRNAs of 4.1 and 3.9 kilobases (kb), as a consequence of initiation at two different start sites ~200 base pairs apart. We have proposed that the region upstream of the 4.1-kb start site functions as a housekeeping promoter, while the region adjacent to the 3.9-kb start site functions primarily as a mammary gland-specific promoter (Harduin-Lepers, A., Shaper, J. H., and Shaper, N. L.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14348-14359).Using DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we show that the region immediately upstream of the 4.1-kb start site is occupied mainly by the ubiquitous factor Sp1. In contrast, the region adjacent to the 3.9-kb start site is bound by multiple proteins which include the tissue-restricted factor AP2, a mammary gland-specific form of CTF/NF1, Sp1, as well as a candidate negative regulatory factor that represses transcription from the 3.9-kb start site. These data experimentally support our conclusion that the 3.9-kb start site has been introduced into the mammalian β4-GT gene to accommodate the recruited role of β4-GT in lactose biosynthesis. β1,4-Galactosyltransferase (β4-GT) is a constitutively expressed enzyme that synthesizes the β4-N-acetyllactosamine structure in glycoconjugates.

It catalyzes the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues, forming the β4-N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ4-GlcNAc) or poly-N-acetyllactosamine structure found in glycolipids and the N- and O-linked side chains of glycoproteins and proteoglycans(1.Hill R.L.

Since glycoconjugate biosynthesis occurs in essentially all tissues, it can be considered a housekeeping function. In mammals, β4-GT has been recruited for an additional tissue-specific biosynthetic function, which is the production of lactose (Galβ4-Glc) in the lactating mammary gland (LMG)(2.Brodbeck U. Denton W.L. Tanahashi N. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The synthesis of lactose is catalyzed by the protein heterodimer, lactose synthetase (EC 2.4.1.22), which is assembled from β4-GT and α-lactalbumin. The net result of this association is to lower the Km of glucose for β4-GT about three orders of magnitude, thus making glucose an effective acceptor substrate at physiological concentration. α-Lactalbumin is synthesized exclusively in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland beginning in late pregnancy(3.Turkington R.W. Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3382-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic levels of β4-GT also increase in the mammary gland beginning in mid-pregnancy, in preparation for lactose biosynthesis(3.Turkington R.W. Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3382-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of both α-lactalbumin and β4-GT is positively influenced by the lactogenic hormones, insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin(3.Turkington R.W. Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3382-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown that the murine (4.Shaper N.L. Hollis G.F. Douglas J.G. Kirsch I.R. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10420-10428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine (5.Russo R.N. Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3324-3331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) β4-GT genes specify two mRNAs of ~4.1 and ~3.9 kb in somatic cells. The two transcripts are generated as a result of initiation at two different start sites located on exon 1, and separated by ~200 bp. The main difference between the two mRNAs is the length and extent of predicted secondary structure present in the respective 5′-untranslated region(6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because each start site is positioned either upstream of the first two in-frame ATGs (4.1 kb) or between these two in-frame ATGs (3.9 kb), translation of the two mRNAs results in the synthesis of two functional, structurally related protein isoforms that differ only in the lengths of their NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain (reviewed in Shaper and Shaper(7.Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 701-709Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar)).The 4.1-kb start site is predominantly used in all somatic cells and tissues examined. An exception is found in the mid- to late pregnant and lactating mammary gland, where the 3.9-kb start site is preferentially utilized(6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This switch to the predominant use of the 3.9-kb start site is coincident with the cellular requirement for increased levels of β4-GT enzyme for lactose biosynthesis. These observations, combined with a promoter deletion analysis using β4-GT/CAT hybrid constructs, led us to propose a model for transcriptional and translational regulation of the β4-GT gene in which the distal region upstream of the 4.1-kb start site functions as a housekeeping promoter in all somatic cells, while the proximal region upstream of the 3.9-kb start site serves primarily as a mammary gland-specific promoter. In addition, we proposed that a putative negative regulatory region identified adjacent to the 3.9-kb start site, down-regulates transcription from this start site in all somatic tissues except the mid- to late pregnant and lactating mammary gland. The key feature of our model is that mammals have evolved a two-step mechanism to generate the elevated levels of β4-GT enzymatic activity required for lactose biosynthesis. First, there is an up-regulation of the steady state levels of β4-GT mRNA by the predominant synthesis of the transcript (3.9 kb) that is regulated by mammary gland-specific factors. Second, the 3.9-kb β4-GT transcript with its short (~20 nucleotides), less structured 5′-untranslated region is translated more efficiently compared to its housekeeping counterpart (4.1 kb) which has a long (~200 nucleotides), highly structured 5′-untranslated region(6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have focused on verifying those predictions of our model pertaining to the transcriptional regulation of the β4-GT gene. We have used DNase I protection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to identify specific cis-acting elements and the corresponding trans-acting factors potentially involved in the expression of the 4.1-kb and the 3.9-kb β4-GT transcripts. We show that the distal promoter region immediately upstream of the 4.1-kb start site is bound primarily by the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. In contrast, the proximal promoter region adjacent to the 3.9-kb start site is a target for binding by multiple proteins which include a candidate negative regulatory factor, Sp1, a mammary gland-specific form of CTF/NF1 and the tissue-restricted factor, AP2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsReagents for molecular biology and tissue culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. 232P-Labeled radioisotopes were from Amersham Corp.

Anti-CTF/NF1 antiserum was a kind gift from Dr. N. Tanese (New York University Medical Center).Cells and Cell CultureMouse L-cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2.Preparation of Nuclear ExtractsNuclear extracts from mouse L-cells (~90% confluent) were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al.(8.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) and from mouse brain and LMG by the combination of methods of Roy et al.(9.Roy R.J. Gosselin P. Guerin S.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar) and Dignam et al.(8.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen tissue (2 g) was pulverized under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder, using a mortar and pestle, and transferred to an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle) containing 10 ml of NE1 buffer (250 mM sucrose, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). The number of strokes required to lyse the cells depended on the individual tissue, and this step was monitored by checking aliquots of the lysate with a phase-contrast microscope. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was washed once with the same buffer and resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of NE2 buffer (NE1 buffer containing 350 mM KCl). The extracted nuclei were centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 90 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected, dialyzed against buffer D(8.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar), aliquoted, and stored at −70°C. All of the steps were carried out at 4°C, and the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of the following protease inhibitors: 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added from anhydrous stock immediately before use), 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 unit/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations of the extracts, which ranged from 2 to 5 mg/ml, were estimated by the method of Bradford(10.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Oligonucleotide Probes for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysSingle-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, and complementary strands were annealed before use. Each double-stranded oligonucleotide contained a recessed 3′-end which was filled in with [α-32P]dCTP and the remaining dNTPs using the Klenow enzyme. The 32P-labeled probes were separated from the unincorporated nucleotides by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 (fine) packed in a 9-inch disposable Pasteur pipette and equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA. The DNA sequence of the oligonucleotides used is shown in Table 1.Tabled 1Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysEMSAs were performed essentially as previously described(11.von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Nakagawa J. Rajput B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7527-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of each nuclear extract was incubated with 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled, double-stranded probe (5-10 fmol) and 1 μg poly(dI-dC) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 4% Ficoll at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, a 50-500-fold molar excess of unlabeled, doubled-stranded probe was incubated with the nuclear extract for 20 min, prior to the addition of the labeled probe. To identify specific transcription factors in a protein-DNA complex, 2 μl (1 mg/ml IgG) of antibodies against a known transcription factor were included in the binding reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 60 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing, polyacrylamide gel in 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA at 10 V/cm at room temperature. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C with intensifying screens.Probes for DNase I Protection AssaysRestriction digests, fragment isolation and purification, and 3′- and 5′-end labeling with Klenow enzyme or T4 polynucleotide kinase, respectively, were performed using standard techniques(12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 13.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar). The cDNA clone, MGT-P5(4.Shaper N.L. Hollis G.F. Douglas J.G. Kirsch I.R. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10420-10428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), harboring the mouse β4-GT sequence from −172 to +187, was digested with HindIII and BamHI, or EcoRV and BamHI, and the respective fragment was isolated. The former was labeled at the 3′-end and digested with MaeIII, and the 299-bp single-end-labeled HindIII-MaeIII fragment (containing 17 bp of the vector sequence and β4-GT region from −172 to +110) was purified on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. To generate a probe labeled on the complementary (coding) strand, the EcoRV-BamHI fragment was digested with MaeIII and labeled at the 3′-end, and the 293-bp EcoRV-MaeIII fragment (with 11 bp of the vector sequence and the β4-GT sequence from −172 to +110) was isolated. Two additional probes prepared from the −474/+55 CAT-En construct (6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were labeled at the 3′-end on the noncoding strand: (i) HinfI-HindIII fragment (containing the β4-GT sequence from −295 to +55 and 13 bp of vector DNA) and (ii) EcoRI-HindIII fragment (with β4-GT sequence from −474 to +55 and 20 and 10 bp of vector sequence at each end). Finally, a 379-bp AvaII-EcoO109I fragment containing the β4-GT sequence from −828 to −449 was isolated from the −1897/+55 CAT plasmid (6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 5′-end-labeled on the noncoding strand.DNase I Protection AssaysThe protein-DNA binding reactions were performed as described for EMSA above, except that 10,000 cpm of 232P-, single-end-labeled DNA fragment was incubated with 25 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 25-50 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Following incubation at room temperature for 20 min, 1 μl of DNase I, diluted from a 5 mg/ml stock solution in 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, and 25 mM CaCl2, was added to the binding mixture, and digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 min at room temperature. Dilutions of DNase I used were 1:1500 for BSA, 1:150 for L-cell nuclear extract, and 1:20 for brain and LMG nuclear extracts. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 10 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K. The samples were incubated at 45°C for 60 min, extracted once with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and precipitated with ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in 80% formamide dye and electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gel. An aliquot of the same end-labeled DNA fragment was also subjected to the A + G chemical sequencing reaction (14.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8992) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on the same gel to determine the position and the sequence of the protected regions. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C with an intensifying screen.RESULTSWe have previously shown that the cellular requirement for β4-GT enzymatic activity correlates with the transcriptional start site used (6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the majority of mouse somatic tissues, including the mammary gland from virgin mice, ( 2B. Rajput and N. L. Shaper, unpublished data.) and established cell lines derived from somatic tissues (e.g. L-cells), the 4.1-kb start site is predominantly used (the ratio of the 4.1- to the 3.9-kb transcript is ~5:1). However, in brain tissue, the N18TG2 neuroblastoma cell line, and spermatogonia, the steady state levels of β4-GT mRNA are ~10-fold lower relative to most somatic tissues and L-cells, and the 4.1-kb start site is exclusively used. Additionally, in the mid- to late pregnant and lactating mammary gland, the steady state β4-GT mRNA levels are ~10-fold higher compared to most somatic tissues and L-cells, and the 3.9-kb start site is preferentially used (the ratio of the 4.1- to the 3.9-kb transcript is ~1:10). This differential utilization of the two start sites suggested that housekeeping and mammary gland-specific transcription factors, binding to different promoter elements, regulated the use of the 4.1- and the 3.9-kb start sites, respectively. Therefore, to experimentally verify this prediction, the DNA sequence flanking the two start sites was analyzed for protein binding by DNase I footprinting and EMSAs using nuclear extracts prepared from L-cells, brain tissue, and LMG, which represent the three patterns of β4-GT mRNA expression described above.Identification of Nuclear Factor Binding Sites in the Region Adjacent to the 3.9-kb Transcriptional Start Site (−172 to +110): Evidence for Tissue-specific BindingPromoter deletion analysis using β4-GT-CAT hybrid constructs transfected into L-cells showed that the DNA fragment just upstream of the 3.9-kb start site (−172 to −13) had promoter activity. However, inclusion of additional sequence from −13 to +55 in this construct reduced this activity about 90-fold, suggesting the presence of a negative regulatory element within this 68-bp region. An examination of the sequence from −172 to +55 revealed potential binding sites for positive ubiquitous and mammary gland-specific transcription factors, as well as a putative negative element(6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To determine whether these, or other, sequence elements do in fact bind nuclear factors, and if this binding is tissue-specific, a single end-labeled DNA fragment containing the β4-GT sequence from −172 to +110 was subjected to DNase I footprinting analysis using nuclear extracts from mouse L-cells, brain tissue, and LMG. Five protected regions, designated FP-1 to FP-5, were seen on the noncoding strand (Fig. 1A), and four protected regions corresponding to FP-1 to FP-4, were observed on the coding strand (Fig. 1B). The sequence of each protected region was subsequently compared against the entries in the transcription factor data base (15.Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3117-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The combined results of these analyses are summarized in Fig. 2.Figure 1:DNase I footprinting analyses of the region adjacent to the 3.9-kb transcriptional start site. A, the DNA fragment containing β4-GT sequence from −172 to +110 was labeled at the 3′-end of the noncoding strand, incubated with BSA (lane 1) or nuclear extract from L-cells (L, lane 2), brain (Br, lane 3), and lactating mammary gland (LMG, lane 4), and treated with DNase I. An A + G chemical sequencing reaction (lane 5) performed on the same probe was run in parallel with the samples on an 8% sequencing gel. The nucleotide numbering is relative to A (+1) of the first in-frame ATG (Fig. 2). The areas protected from DNase I digestion are marked by brackets and designated FP-1 to FP-5. The DNase I hypersensitive sites are indicated by arrows. B, identical to A except that the DNA fragment (−172 to +110) was labeled at the 3′-end of the coding strand. C, identical to A except that an overlapping DNA fragment (−295 to +55) 3′-end labeled on the noncoding strand was used. Footprints FP-3 to FP-7 are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2:The location of the DNase I protected regions and the nuclear factor binding motifs in the 5′-flanking region of the β4-GT gene. The sequence of the β4-GT gene (−850 to +60) is shown; numbers are relative to A (+1) of the first in-frame ATG. The first two in-frame ATGs are underlined. The clusters of upward bent arrows designate the transcriptional start sites of the 3.9-kb (+14 to +24), the 4.1-kb (−190 to −145) and the male germ cell-specific (Gc, −732) transcripts. The sequences protected from DNase I digestion on the coding and the noncoding strands are overlined and underlined, respectively, and are labeled FP-1 to FP-15. Protein binding motifs, identified by comparison to a transcription factor data base, are boxed. In the case of FP-2, FP-4, FP-7, and FP-8, the protected region extends further than the designated Sp1 site and may well contain an additional Sp1 site. The binding of each indicated nuclear factor was experimentally established by EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FP-1, a rather weak footprint seen with all three extracts, is located between +36 to +60. It contains a GC-rich element (5′-GGGCGCG-3′) which is similar to a sequence motif (5′-GGGCGGC-3′) found just upstream (+24 to +30) of FP-1. Although this upstream region was not protected, a hypersensitive site indicative of a protein-DNA interaction, was seen at position +29 (Fig. 1B). Footprints FP-2 and FP-4 were also obtained with all three extracts but were more clearly observed on the coding strand (Fig. 1B) compared to the noncoding strand (Fig. 1A), where the interactions were primarily characterized by the presence of hypersensitive sites (indicated by the arrows). FP-2 (−34 to +2) contains an inverted GT box (5′-CCCACCC-3′) and FP-4 (−119 to −87) an inverted GA box (5′-CCCTCCC-3′).In contrast to footprints FP-1, FP-2, and FP-4, footprint FP-3 was most prominent with the LMG extract and footprint FP-5 was clearly LMG-specific (Fig. 1A, lane 4). FP-3 (−70 to −42) is a complex region that contains multiple overlapping protein binding motifs: a CTF/NF1 half-site (5′-TGGC-3′), a GC-rich element (5′-GGGCGGC-3′) identical to that found at +24 to +30, an AP2 site (5′-GCCTGCGGG-3′), and an Sp1 site (5′-GGGCGGG-3′). The only motif noted within FP-5 (−162 to −140) is a perfect AP2 site (5′-GCCGCAGGC-3′). Because FP-5 extended to the extreme 5′-end of the DNA probe, an overlapping fragment (−295 to +55) was used to more precisely map its 5′-boundary (Fig. 1C). This analysis revealed an additional LMG-specific, DNase I-protected region (FP-6, −185 to −165) that also contains an AP2 site (5′-TCCCGCGGC-3′).The above data obtained from the DNase I footprinting analysis corroborates our previous studies (6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shows that the region adjacent to the 3.9-kb start site is recognized by mammary gland-specific as well as ubiquitous factors. In order to characterize the nuclear proteins interacting with the protected sites, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the footprinted regions were analyzed by EMSA using nuclear extracts from mouse L-cells, brain tissue, and LMG.Characterization of the Nuclear Protein Binding to the FP-1 Site: Identification of a Putative Negative Regulatory FactorBased on our previous data, a negative regulatory element involved in repressing transcription from the 3.9-kb start site is predicted to reside between −13 and +55(6.Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential candidate for the negative regulatory factor is the protein(s) that interacts at the FP-1 site (+36 to +60) and the hypersensitive site at +29. To characterize this factor, oligo 1 (+20 to +59, Table 1), containing both GC-rich elements, was analyzed by EMSA. An equal amount of total protein (5 μg) was used per reaction in order to compare the relative binding activity of this factor in each of the three nuclear extracts.A protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3A, indicated by the solid arrow) of similar mobility was seen with all three extracts (lanes 2-4), with the brain extract giving the most intense band. It should be noted that, even though footprint FP-1 was rather weak, the protein-DNA complex as visualized by EMSA was quite strong. This is due to the fact that EMSA is a more sensitive DNA-protein binding assay than the DNase I protection assay(13.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar). The formation of the complex was extract-dependent, as it was not seen in the control reaction performed in the absence of the nuclear extract (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The specificity of binding was demonstrated by competition assays in which unlabeled oligo 1 was preincubated with L-cell nuclear extract followed by the addition of labeled oligo 1. As seen in Fig. 3B, preincubation with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligo 1 greatly diminished complex formation (lane 2) and preincubation with a 500-fold molar excess abolished complex formation (lane 3).Figure 3:Characterization by EMSA of the putative negative regulatory factor that binds to the FP-1 site. A, labeled oligo 1 (+20 to +59), spanning the FP-1 site, was incubated without (-, lane 1) or with nuclear extract from L-cells (L, lane 2), brain (Br, lane 3), and lactating mammary gland (LMG, lane 4) and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing, polyacrylamide gel. The solid arrow indicates the position of the specific protein-DNA complex and the open arrow that of the free probe. B, competition experiments in which none (-, lane 1) or a 100- or 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligo 1 (lanes 2 and 3) or oligo Sp1, containing the consensus Sp1 recognition sequence (lanes 4 and 5), was incubated with the L-cell extract prior to the addition of labeled oligo 1. C, L-cell nuclear extract and labeled oligo 1 were incubated without (-, lane 1), or with irrelevant serum (IS, lane 2) or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Sp1, lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since the GC-rich elements (GGGCGGC and GGGCGCG) contained within oligo 1 are similar to the Sp1 recognition sequence (GGGCGGG), an oligonucleotide containing the consensus Sp1 site (oligo Sp1, Table 1) was also tested in competition assays with labeled oligo 1 as the probe. Oligo Sp1 was not an effective competitor, even at a 500-fold molar excess (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that the protein recognizing oligo 1 was not Sp1 or an Sp1 family member. This conclusion was verified by showing that polyclonal antibodies against human Sp1, which cross-react with the mouse protein, neither inhibited nor caused a supershift (retard the mobility) of the specific protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3C, lane 3). The anti-Sp1 antibodies were shown to supershift authentic Sp1 in a control experiment (data not shown, also see Fig. 4). Analogous experiments performed using oligo 1 and nuclear extracts from brain and LMG gave results similar to those described for L-cells (data not shown).Figure 4:Sp1 o"
https://openalex.org/W2045882325,"Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) is a vasopressin-regulated water channel in the kidney collecting duct. AQP-2 is selectively permeable to water molecule and is translocated between the apical membrane and subapical endosomes in response to vasopressin. To investigate the localization and structure of the aqueous pathway of the AQP-2 water channel, a series of site-directed mutants was constructed and functionally analyzed.

Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2, ( 1The abbreviations used are: AQPaquaporinMIPmajor intrinsic proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHLhydrophilic loop.) previously reported as WCH-CD or AQP-CD) is a water channel in the apical membrane of the kidney collecting duct(1.Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Water permeability of this nephron segment is regulated by vasopressin through the membrane shuttle mechanism(2.Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Chou C.L. DiGiovanni S.R. Semin.

Complementary DNAs for rat and human AQP-2 have been isolated(8.Fushimi, K., Sasaki, S., Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, M., Furukawa, T., Uchida, S., Kuwahara, M., Ishibashi, K., Kawasaki, M., Kihara, I., Marumo, F.

AQP-2 is a very hydrophobic membrane-integral protein of a molecular mass of ~29 kDa. It is a member of the MIP protein family (10.Chrispeels M.J. Maurel C. Plant. Physiol. 1994; 105: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and is homologous to aquaporin-1 (AQP-1, previously reported as CHIP28)(11.Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional expression of AQP-2 showed that it is highly permeable to water molecule but not to urea, glycerol, and ions and that its water permeability is mercury-sensitive and temperature-insensitive(8.Fushimi, K., Sasaki, S., Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, M., Furukawa, T., Uchida, S., Kuwahara, M., Ishibashi, K., Kawasaki, M., Kihara, I., Marumo, F.

Furthermore, it has been shown that mutations in AQP-2 gene are responsible for deficient vasopressin antidiuresis in some patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus(14.Deen P.M.

Despite accumulated knowledge of AQP-2 physiology implicating functional importance of AQP-2 in urine concentration and homeostasis of body fluid, the molecular structural basis of AQP-2 is not well known. The localization and higher order structure of the aqueous pathway of AQP-2 have to be elucidated to account for its selective permeability to water molecule and explain the mutation-related channel malfunction. The molecular structure of AQP-1, the first identified water channel, has been studied and partially resolved. It was shown that AQP-1 exists in plasma membrane with tetramer formation(16.Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. van Hoeck A.N. Ma T.

Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Shi L. Skach W.R. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10417-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the structure of the aqueous pore in functionally active AQP-1 monomer, three structural models have been proposed(20.Fushimi K. Marumo F. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1995; 4: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar): the hourglass model(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the α-helical model(22.Skach W.R. Shi L. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the β-barrel model(23.Fischbarg J. Li J. Cheung M. Czegledy F. Iserovich P. Kuang K. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). According to the hourglass model, the aqueous pathway is formed by two domains with an NPA box, which is an asparagine-proline-alanine sequence highly conserved among the MIP family members. In the α-helical model, the aqueous pathway is located between transmembrane segments with α-helical conformation. In the β-barrel model, the aqueous pore is formed with ~16 antiparallel β-sheets analogous to a porin channel of bacteria species(24.Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The validity of these models has not been sufficiently examined. Moreover, there have been no investigations regarding the molecular structure of aquaporins other than AQP-1. In addition to being significant for understanding the general structure of channels, elucidation of the structure of aquaporins will provide insights for the development of an AQP-2 inhibitor, which is potentially of remarkable use as a water diuretic. This study examined membrane topology, mercury-sensitive sites, and functional roles of the two of the NPA-containing domains and other hydrophilic loops of AQP-2. We found significant participation of hydrophilic loops other than NPA-containing domains in the formation of the aqueous pathway of AQP-2. Based on our observations, a new structural model for AQP-2 is proposed. AQP-2 mutants were constructed using polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis. A fragment between SphI site at nucleotide 219 and StuI site at nucleotide 809 in pAQP-2/ev1 (8.Fushimi, K., Sasaki, S., Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, M., Furukawa, T., Uchida, S., Kuwahara, M., Ishibashi, K., Kawasaki, M., Kihara, I., Marumo, F. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. F573-F582Google Scholar) was replaced by a polymerase chain reaction fragment coding for mutants. Potential glycosylation sites were produced by inserting an N-glycosylation reporter sequence (asparagine-threonine-serine, NTS) (25.Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into one of four hydrophilic loops of non-glycosylated mutant of AQP-2, N124D (Fig. 1). For hydrophilic loops (HL) 1, 2, 4, and 5, an NTS motif was inserted after serine 36 (producing 36NTS), alanine 65 (65NTS), glycine 154 (154NTS), and valine 194 (194NTS) of N124D, respectively. To directly compare the structure of AQP-2 and AQP-1, the insertion positions were chosen corresponding to the BamHI sequence insertion positions in the previous study(26.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of mercury sensitivity, some residues of mercury-resistant mutant of AQP-2, C181A, were substituted with cysteine. For recombination of HL-3 or HL-4, a cluster of amino acids in HL-3 of AQP-2, ALHNNATA, was replaced with YPNPHINF in the corresponding part of E. coli glycerol facilitator (GlpF), and ERRGDNLGSP in HL-4 of AQP-2 was replaced with DGNGVPRGP of GlpF, with RRRRDLGGSA of AQP-1, or with ERRNGRLGSV of MIP. The nucleotide sequences of mutants were verified by a fluorescence sequencer (model 373A, Applied Biosystems). Mutated plasmid was purified by affinity columns (Qiagen, Germany) and linearized with NotI or XbaI. Capped cRNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase and in vitro transcription system (Promega). Standard molecular biological procedures were used(27.Sambrook J. Fristsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Defolliculated stage V and VI oocytes from female Xenopus laevis were injected with 20 nl of water or cRNAs (0.1 mg/ml). After incubation in 200 mosm modified Barth's buffer at 18°C for 48 h, oocytes were transferred to 70 mosm Barth's buffer diluted with distilled water, and the time course of osmotic volume increase was monitored as described(8.Fushimi, K., Sasaki, S., Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, M., Furukawa, T., Uchida, S., Kuwahara, M., Ishibashi, K., Kawasaki, M., Kihara, I., Marumo, F. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. F573-F582Google Scholar). Oocyte volume was calculated from oocyte projection area. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was determined from initial oocyte volume (V0 = 9 × 10-4 cm3), initial oocyte surface area (S = 0.045 cm2), molar volume of water (Vw = 18 cm3/mol), and osmolarity inside (osmin) and outside (osmout) the cell as shown: Pf={V0×d(V/V0)/dt}/{S×Vw×osmin−osmout)}(Eq. 1) The effects of mercury reagents were examined by incubating oocytes in Barth's buffer containing 1 mM HgCl2 for 10 min prior to Pf measurements. Kidney medulla from 200-g Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected, homogenized in 9 volumes of homogenization medium (0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 15 strokes of a Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove organelles. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to collect the membrane fractions. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of suspension buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA). Total membrane fractions of oocytes were collected as follows(18.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): groups of 10-15 oocytes prepared as for P measurements were homogenized in 9 volumes of homogenization medium. The yolk and cellular organelles were removed by centrifuging at 750 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The membrane fractions were then pelleted from the supernatant at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and suspended in 10 μl of 1.25% SDS/oocyte. Plasma membrane fractions of oocytes were collected as described(28.Young G.P. Young J.D. Deshpande A.K. Goldstein M. Koide S.S. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5155-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-40 oocytes were homogenized, and organelles were removed by centrifugation at 350 × g for 5 min. Supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and membranes were suspended with ~100 μl of 1.22 g/ml sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were overlaid onto layers of 1.22, 1.18, and 1.16 g/ml sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline solution and centrifuged at 85,000 × g for 90 min. Plasma membrane fractions in mid-layer were collected, diluted seven times with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h. Plasma membrane fractions were enriched >10 times as assessed by alkaline phosphodiesterase activity(29.Touster O. Aronson Jr., N.N. Dulaney J.T. Hendrickson H. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 604-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To remove the N-glycosylation side chains, 10 μg of kidney membranes or membrane fractions from one oocyte were digested with 2 units of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 μl of incubation buffer (0.5% (w/v) SDS, 50 mM B-mercaptoethanol, 1.3% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM phenanthroline) for 12 h at 37°C and analyzed by immunoblotting. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as described(8.Fushimi, K., Sasaki, S., Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, M., Furukawa, T., Uchida, S., Kuwahara, M., Ishibashi, K., Kawasaki, M., Kihara, I., Marumo, F. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. F573-F582Google Scholar). Total membrane from 1 oocyte and plasma membrane from 20 oocytes were solubilized by heating at 70°C for 10 min in sample buffer (3% SDS, 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Protein was separated by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE slab gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in blotting buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) containing 2% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with either preimmune or immune serum (diluted 1:200 in blotting buffer) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then washed in several changes of blotting buffer, incubated for 1 h with blotting buffer containing 3 μCi of 125I-labeled protein A (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA), washed three times, and exposed to x-ray film for 12 h. The AQP-2 protein was evaluated in intact oocyte membrane as reported(30.Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Terada Y. Bai L. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10384-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). An anti-AQP-2 antibody against the external domain of AQP-2 was raised in rabbit using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues at 113-127 as described(8.Fushimi, K., Sasaki, S., Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, M., Furukawa, T., Uchida, S., Kuwahara, M., Ishibashi, K., Kawasaki, M., Kihara, I., Marumo, F. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. F573-F582Google Scholar). Oocytes, prepared as for Pf measurements, were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in modified Barth's buffer for 1 h at 4°C and then washed with Barth's buffer. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. A group of 10 oocytes was incubated with 1:100 diluted antibody against an external domain in Barth's buffer for 1 h, washed with a large volume of washing buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin in modified Barth's buffer) three times, incubated with 1 μCi/ml 125I-protein A in Barth's buffer for 1 h, and washed several times in a large volume of washing buffer. The 10 oocytes were dissolved in 10% SDS, and the radioactivity was measured by a gamma counter. Immunoblot analysis of rat kidney membrane and oocyte expressing AQP-2 showed that AQP-2 consists of ~29 kDa and higher molecular mass components, which were removed by N-glycoside F digestion (Fig. 2). N-Glycosylation was not observed when asparagine 124 (Asn-124) was replaced with aspartic acid, showing that AQP-2 is N-glycosylated at Asn-124. Injection with N124D induced high osmotic water permeability that was comparable to that of wild type, suggesting that N-glycosylation is not required for water channel function of AQP-2 (Fig. 3). The sidedness of each hydrophilic loop was determined by the insertion of asparagine-threonine-serine (NTS) consensus motif and assessing the accessibility of N-glycosyltransferase. As shown in Fig. 2, AQP-2 mutants were glycosylated only when the NTS signal was inserted into the first or the fifth loop and not when NTS was inserted into the second or the fourth loop (Fig. 2, lanes 3-6). Molecular sizes of glycosylation in these mutants were the same as those in wild type of AQP-2. In both of these N-glycosylated mutants, the glycosylated −29 kDa protein was removed by digestion of N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicated that the first, third, and fifth hydrophilic loops are localized extracellularly.Figure 3:Osmotic water permeability of oocytes expressing N-glycosylation mutants of AQP-2.

Data are shown as means and S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of three amino acid insertions on the channel function were examined by looking at osmotic water permeability of oocytes expressing NTS-inserted mutants (Fig. 3). Insertions of a few amino acid residues into HL-2 and HL-5 had little effect on the function of AQP-2, in contrast to the fact that amino acid insertion into the corresponding position of AQP-1 completely abolished water channel function(26.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic water permeability induced by NTS-inserted mutants was slightly lower than that induced by non-glycosylated mutant of AQP-2, N124D. Relative plasma membrane expressions assessed by radioimmunoassay were 91 ± 3% (36NTS), 81 ± 4% (65NTS), 94 ± 4% (154NTS), and 90 ± 2% (194NTS) of N124D, showing that the plasma expression of these mutants is slightly decreased from N124D. Taken together, osmotic water permeability of all glycosylation mutants was slightly lower than N124D, partly due to decreased plasma membrane expression. Since it was significantly higher than that of water-injected control, however, and since mercuric inhibition was apparent, it can be assumed that all of the NTS-inserted mutants preserve water channel function. As the mercury-sensitive site is expected to be localized close to the aqueous pore(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition by mercury agent was examined for a series of cysteine mutants. When cysteine at 181 was replaced, mercury inhibition disappeared in contrast to other substitutions of C75S, C79S, and C144S; replacements of cysteine 181 with larger residues inhibited water permeability, suggesting cysteine 181 is localized near the aqueous pathway (Fig. 4). Substitution by cysteine of alanine at 65, an alternative mercury-sensitive site proposed by the hourglass model, in mercury-resistant mutant C181A did not induce mercury sensitivity. Localization of mercury-sensitive site in the first NPA domain, something which strongly supports the hourglass model for AQP-1, was not observed in AQP-2, implicating the difference in the structures of the aqueous pathways of AQP-1 and AQP-2. Observations from NTS insertion and cysteine substitution taken together indicated that cooperative participations of HL-2 and HL-5 in the formation of the aqueous pathway of AQP-2 is not as critical as proposed in the hourglass model for AQP-1. Participation of HL-3 and HL-4 in the formation of the aqueous pathway was revealed by the replacement of these domains with the corresponding part of E. coli GlpF (Fig. 4). GlpF was chosen because its function has been examined in detail and because it is known to be permeable to glycerol but not to water(31.Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant HL-3 or HL-4 to GlpF did not induce osmotic water permeability (Fig. 4). In contrast, replacement of HL-4 with other water channels, AQP-1 and MIP, induced osmotic water permeability to a level comparable to that of the wild type. To exclude the possibility of the decrease in readily assembled protein and plasma membrane expression, localization of AQP-2 in total membrane fractions or in plasma membrane fractions was examined by immunoblots. Oocyte membrane was fractionated through a sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation, and plasma membrane fraction was collected. Immunoblot of fractionated membranes from oocytes injected with GlpF recombinants cRNA indicated that the amounts of synthesized mutants and mutants expressed in plasma membrane were comparable to those of the wild type (Fig. 5). Independent analysis of the amount of the plasma membrane expression was performed by radioimmunoassay. Binding of antibody against external domain of intact oocytes expressing mutants was assayed. Specificity and sensitivity of the antibody were confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Relative expression to the wild type was 65 ± 10% for HL-3 mutant and 68 ± 12% for HL-4 mutants, indicating substantial expression of immunoreactive protein on oocyte plasma membrane. Intact glycosylation of recombinant HL-4 suggested natural maturation of the mutants. When HL-3 was replaced with GlpF, glycosylation was not observed because of removal of the natural glycosylation site of AQP-2. A series of single-residue substitutions in HL-3 and HL-4 was performed to investigate the interaction of these loops with the aqueous pathway. Replacement of native residues to cysteine has successfully been used to determine the localization of the aqueous pathway of aquaporins (21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale is that there is a high probability that cysteine residues near the aqueous pathway interact with imposed mercury agents and inhibit water channel function. When a cysteine residue was introduced into amino acid 122 or 123 of mercury-resistant mutant of AQP-2, C181A, up to 40% inhibition by low concentration of HgCl2 was observed, which was significantly higher than that for C181A (p < 0.001, n = 20). The mercury inhibition, although it is not complete, implicated that Asn-123 is likely to be located near the aqueous pathway. Subsequently, a residue Asn-123 was replaced with a series of amino acids to examine the interaction of the lateral moiety with the aqueous pathway. Osmotic water permeability was decreased roughly in accordance with the size of the lateral moiety (Fig. 4). This may be interpreted as the localization of the constriction of the aqueous pathway at Asn-123 and the occlusion by the larger lateral moiety. Plasma membrane expressions of the series of Asn-123 mutants were comparable to those of the wild type as assessed by immunoblot (Fig. 6) and radioimmunoassay (60 ± 10% for N123A, 65 ± 12% for N123Q, 65 ± 12% for N123D, 65 ± 12% for N123W, relative to the wild type, n = 3-5), showing substantial expression of N123 mutants in the plasma membrane. A similar analysis was done for HL-4. Cysteines in 154, 155, and 156 exhibited high mercury sensitivity, with the highest at Asp-155 (p < 0.001 versus C181A, n = 20), implicating close localization of Asp-155 to presumed aqueous pathway. In this study, we have examined the structure of the aqueous pathway of rat AQP-2 and found that the contribution of HL-3 and HL-4 is significant in the formation of the aqueous pathway. It was suggested that the structure of the aqueous pore is somehow different from that of AQP-1 proposed previously(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Skach W.R. Shi L. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J.

Biol. 1995; 143: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A six-transmembrane topology and mercury-sensitive positions in AQP-2 are identical to AQP-1 hourglass model(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutations near NPA boxes in HL-2 and HL-5 did not significantly alter water channel function, and cysteine residues inserted near the first NPA box did not induce the alternative mercury-sensitive site. Alternatively, based on the findings that the replacement of HL-3 and HL-4 with hydrophobic residues decreased water permeability without affecting plasma membrane expression and that mercury sensitivity was found in these domains, it was suggested that HL-3 and HL-4 are located near the aqueous pore. Membrane topology and mercury-sensitive cysteine residues have first been determined experimentally in this study, and it was shown that AQP-2 is similar to AQP-1 proposed as the hourglass model in its topological presentation. Membrane topology was partially determined from the presence of N-glycosylation, which indicates extracellular localization of the site. N-Glycosylation site insertion has been successfully used to map membrane topology of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (25.Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the glutamate receptor (32.Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The N-glycosylation insertion was used in the present study because the glycosylation is natural and the consensus glycosylation sequence minimally perturbs the native sequence and structure(25.Chang X.-B.

Immunoblot results indicated the extracellular localization of HL-1, HL-3, and HL-5, implicating that the α-helical model (22.Skach W.R. Shi L. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the β-barrel model (23.Fischbarg J. Li J. Cheung M. Czegledy F. Iserovich P. Kuang K. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) are not adequate for the structure of AQP-2. Sidedness of both termini, HL-2 and HL-4, cannot be determined because the extracellular NTS motif is not always glycosylated. However, when the evidence of phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of AQP-2 is also taken into account(30.Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Terada Y. Bai L. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10384-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it may be reasonable to conclude that AQP-2 has a six-transmembrane topology identical to that of AQP-1 proposed in the hourglass model(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of osmotic water permeability by low concentration of mercury chemicals is characteristic of protein water channel, and mercury is believed to interact with cysteine residues located near the aqueous pore, perturbing the structure and function of the aqueous pore (21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of the mercury-sensitive cysteine residue is critical for locating the aqueous pore. The results showed that the mercury-sensitive cysteine of AQP-2 is Cys-181, which corresponds to Cys-189 of AQP-1. In addition, molecular size-dependent impairment of water permeability was observed in Cys-181 replacement, which was similar to observations in AQP-1. When Cys-181 was replaced with tryptophan, Pf had the lowest value. Because the plasma membrane expression of C181 mutants was similar as assessed by antibody binding and membrane fractionation (data not shown), it is likely, as proposed in the AQP-1 experiments(18.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that replacement of Cys-181 with larger residues interfered with the aqueous pathway. These data suggested that the aqeuous pore of AQP-2 may be closely located to Cys-181. Although identical topology and the mercury-sensitive site of AQP-2 and AQP-1 reasonably implicated the structural similarity of the two channels, our observation from mutational analysis indicated that the structure of the aqueous pathway of AQP-2 is somehow different from that of AQP-1. Although the contribution of HL-2 and HL-5 to the formation of the aqueous pathway has been strongly postulated in the hourglass model for AQP-1(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our results were not compatible with the previous observations. First, introduction of cysteine to Ala-65, which corresponds to Ala-73 of AQP-1, did not induce mercury sensitivity. Symmetrical localization of mercury-sensitive sites in Cys-189 and Ala-73 were one of the bases for the hourglass model for AQP-1. Second, insertion of a few amino acid residues into HL-2 and HL-5 of AQP-2 did not affect water channel function. Inhibition of water permeability by the insertion of the BamHI sequence into the corresponding sites of HL-2 or HL-5 supported the hourglass model of AQP-1(26.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the hourglass model, it was claimed that HL-2 and HL-5, being folded into the lipid bilayer, partially form the aqueous pore(21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a glycosylation reporter sequence inserted into HL-5 was properly glycosylated with minimal effects on water permeability, showing extracellular localization of this part. Our results may indicate that the hourglass model is not adequate for describing the aqueous pore of AQP-2. Functional analysis of replacement, mercury sensitivity, and point mutations in HL-3 and HL-4 implicated that these loops participate in the formation of the aqueous pathway of AQP-2. HL-3 and HL-4 are relatively hydrophilic compared to other segments of AQP-2. Hydropathy analysis of other aquaporins including AQP-1, AQP-3, MIP, and γ-TIP showed that hydrophilicity of these domains is a common feature of water channels(33.Chepelinsky A.B. The MIP Transmembrane Channel Gene Family. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1994: 413-432Google Scholar, 34.Mulders S.M. Preston G.M. Deen P.M. Guggino W.B. van Os C.H. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that HL-3 and HL-4 contribute to the structure of the aqueous pore and to selective water permeability. Disappearance of water permeability by the replacement of HL-4 with GlpF but not with AQP-1 or MIP implicated that hydrophilicity of this domain may be critical for water permeability. Furthermore, the findings that mercury sensitivity was maximum at positions Asn-123 and Asp-155 and that substitutions of Asn-123 with larger residues decreased Pf can be interpreted that Asn-123 and Asp-155 are the closest to the presumed constriction of the aqueous pore of an expected size of ~2 Å (21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Skach W.R. Shi L. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S.

Biol. 1995; 143: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, our observations may raise several questions, which must be resolved before any definitive conclusions can be made. First, although mercury inhibition found in HL-3 and HL-4 was significant compared to C181A, it was lower than that for wild type. The lower mercury sensitivity can be explained by the possibility that HL-3 and HL-4 are located further to the aqueous pathway than Cys-181. Second, insertion of NTS after the residue 154, which should be the critical site for water channel function according to our data, did not alter Pf. This may be because hydrophilicity of inserted residues minimally disturbed the pore structure. Further structural analyses will be required to interpret our current observations and those of the previous studies and to describe a more precise structure of the aqueous pore. Care must be taken for the interpretation of mutational analysis of aquaporins because it has been well known that mutations in aquaporins sometimes disturb synthesis, assembling, and plasma membrane expression of mutant proteins in oocytes(19.Shi L. Skach W.R. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10417-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, functions of mutated channel have to be normalized with the amount of protein in the plasma membrane. Therefore, we undertook immunological analysis of synthesized mutants to ensure that mutants were readily synthesized and expressed in the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane expression of mutated channel was successfully resolved by two methods. For this purpose, we did not use immunohistochemical staining of oocyte membranes, which is less quantitative compared to the two methods we used. All mutations in HL-3 and HL-4 examined here did not significantly affect plasma membrane expression, confirming that the mutations only minimally perturb the channel structure. On the basis of our results, we propose a structure model for AQP-2 water channel (Fig. 7). Between six transmembrane α-helices, a central channel may be formed, the diameter of which would be larger than the expected size for selective aqueous pore. Constrictions with a pore size of ~2 Å that determine selective water permeability may be assembled in the association of HL-3 and HL-5 in the extracellular side and in the association of HL-2 and HL-4 in the cytoplasmic side. These hydrophilic loops may be partially folded into the large pore, forming constrictions and hydrophilic apparatus that exclude charged ions and large molecules. Since N-glycosylation of HL-3 or HL-5 did not influence pore structure, it is likely that these domains are not folded deep into lipid bilayer as described in the hourglass model. The roles of the NPA boxes, which are strictly conserved among the MIP family, are not clear from our study. It is speculated that the NPA boxes are critical to correctly assemble three-dimensional structures of aquaporins because AQP-2 proteins with mutations near NPA boxes were suggested to be folded improperly(35.Deen P.M.

A screen for mutants that overreplicated their DNA uncovered new conditional alleles that cause accumulation of up to 8C DNA. DNA overreplication involves all chromosomes and does not require passage through mitosis or another START. It occurs within a single cell cycle and can cause arrest at the MEC1 checkpoint. Remarkably, Clb2–Cdc28 activity remains elevated in the overreplicating cells. These observations distinguish CDC16 and CDC27 from other mutants that accumulate extra DNA after completing an aberrent mitosis, or skipping mitosis altogether, and entering a second, inappropriate G1 and S phase. CDC16 and CDC27 may contribute to replication control by targeted proteolysis of an S phase initiator."

https://openalex.org/W1520385835,"The synaptic basal membrane protein agrin initiates the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane of the developing neuromuscular junction. Recently, α-dystroglycan was found to be a major agrin-binding protein on the muscle cell surface and was therefore considered a candidate agrin receptor. Employing different truncation fragments of agrin, we determined regions of the protein involved in binding to α-dystroglycan and to heparin, an inhibitor of α-dystroglycan binding. Deletion of a 15-kDa fragment from the C terminus of agrin had no effect on its binding to α-dystroglycan from rabbit muscle membranes, even though this deletion completely abolishes its acetylcholine receptor aggregating activity. Conversely, deletion of a central region does not affect agrin's clustering activity, but reduced its affinity for α-dystroglycan. Combination of these two deletions resulted in a fragment of ~35 kDa that weakly bound to α-dystroglycan, but displayed no clustering activity. All of these fragments bound to heparin with high affinity. Thus, α-dystroglycan does not show the binding specificity expected for an agrin receptor.

Our data suggest the existence of an additional component on the muscle cell surface that generates the observed ligand specificity. During formation of the neuromuscular junction, motor neurons provide a number of signals that promote the differentiation of the postsynaptic membrane(1.Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1993; 10: 99-121Google Scholar). An early signal is the secretion of specific isoforms of agrin, a large protein of the extracellular matrix, and their incorporation into the basal lamina(2.Bowe M.A. Fallon J.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Agrin initiates the concentration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: AChRsacetylcholine receptorsG-domainglobular domainEGFepidermal growth factorDGCdystrophin glycoprotein complexmAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) and other components of the muscle cell surface at the site of contact with axons of motor neurons(3.McMahan U.J.

Intermingled with these laminin G-domains are four EGF-like repeats. acetylcholine receptors globular domain epidermal growth factor dystrophin glycoprotein complex monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alternative splicing at three positions (X, Y, and Z) in this region generates several agrin isoforms(7.Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H.

Splicing at site Z is particularly important: agrin variants containing no insert at this position are widely expressed in basement membranes of many tissues and display only weak AChR clustering activity. In contrast, inserts of 8, 11, or 19 amino acids are found only in agrin of neuronal origin (9.Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J.

The insert of 11 amino acids increases agrin's clustering activity ~50-fold, and inserts of 8 or 19 amino acids ~10,000-fold (12.Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Studies of structure-function relationships indicate that a C-terminal 50-kDa fragment of rat agrin is sufficient for induction of AChR clustering. Additional deletion from either side of this recombinant fragment abolishes agrin's aggregating activity(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In chick, a similar 45-kDa fragment is necessary for full clustering activity, and at very high concentrations, a C-terminal fragment of only 21 kDa induces AChR aggregation(14.Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which agrin induces the formation of AChR clusters is unknown. Recently, several groups have reported that α-dystroglycan is a major binding protein for agrin on the muscle cell surface (15.Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 16.Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Several characteristics of this binding support the hypothesis that α-dystroglycan serves as a functional agrin receptor. (i) Binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan is Ca2+-dependent, as is agrin's AChR aggregating activity. (ii) Binding and function of agrin are inhibited by heparin. (iii) In mutant muscle cell lines that are defective in processing of proteoglycans, a much higher concentration of agrin is needed to induce AChR clustering compared with normal muscle fibers(7.Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12.Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, α-dystroglycan in these cell lines, which has a smaller apparent molecular weight, shows a reduced binding to agrin (16.Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17.Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Early in development, α-dystroglycan is widely distributed over the muscle cell surface and becomes concentrated at developing AChR clusters upon addition of agrin(19.Nastuk M.A. Lieth E. Ma J. Cardasis C.A. Moynihan E.B. McKechnie B.A. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1991; 7: 807-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is part of a complex including several transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins that are associated with the submembrane cytoskeleton proteins dystrophin and utrophin(20.Ervasti J.M.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the extrasynaptic region, α-dystroglycan binds to laminin(26.Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 27.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the DGC forms a link between the extracellular matrix and dystrophin and thereby stabilizes the muscle fiber(28.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 68: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, dystrophin expression is restricted to the extrasynaptic regions and the troughs of the synaptic folds. In the crests of these folds, where the AChRs are concentrated, dystrophin is replaced by its homologue utrophin(24.Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 29.Man N.T. Ellis J.M. Love D.R. Davies K.E. Gatter K.C. Dickson G. Morris G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1695-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, agrin is most likely linked to utrophin via the DGC in the mature synapse, and this link may stabilize synaptic structures. The important question of whether α-dystroglycan mediates the AChR aggregating activity of agrin alone or in conjunction with other surface components and therefore is an agrin receptor is still unanswered. In an attempt to solve this problem, several groups inhibited agrin binding to α-dystroglycan in culture by addition of a mAb against α-dystroglycan. However, the effects on agrin-induced AChR clustering are controversial: in some studies, no effects on AChR aggregation could be detected(18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 30.Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Godfrey E.W. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One group observed a significant reduction in the number of AChR aggregates(17.Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Cell. 1994; 77: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), while another group found no change in the number of clusters, but rather a more dispersed appearance of AChR aggregates(16.Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Here, we addressed this question using a different approach. We assessed the binding of previously and newly generated truncation fragments of agrin to α-dystroglycan and compared the binding pattern with the functional activity of these fragments. Our results demonstrate that α-dystroglycan does not display the ligand specificity expected for an agrin receptor. Rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes were prepared as described (21.Ohlendieck K.

Alkaline extraction of proteins from rabbit skeletal muscle membranes was performed as described(27.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J.

Extraction was quantitative since no α-dystroglycan immunoreactivity was detected in the pellet. The alkaline extract was diluted 1:2 with 50 mM Tris, 4 mM calcium chloride, and 20 μM E-64, and the pH was adjusted to 8 at 4°C. An extract of 1.7 mg of membrane protein, containing ~10 pmol of α-dystroglycan(20.Ervasti J.M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), was used for each binding experiment (see below). The agrin constructs N1, N4, N6, and C2 have been previously described(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Construct N4/C2, containing truncations from both ends, was generated by digestion of constructs N4 and C2 with AvrII. The two DNA fragments containing the N-terminal agrin sequence of N4 and the C-terminal sequence of C2 as well as different parts of the pCMV vector were ligated. Correct orientation of the fragments was confirmed by digestion with SfiI/XbaI, and the integrity of the cloning sites was confirmed by recutting with AvrII. All constructs used in this study contained the 19-amino acid insert at splicing site Z and, except for N6, the 4-amino acid insert at splicing site Y(7.Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10.Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with these agrin constructs using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously(5.Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Rupp F. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was substituted for the serum-containing medium 1 day after transfection. The concentration of construct N1 in conditioned medium collected 3 days after transfection was ~50 nM(12.Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Based on this estimate, concentrations of the other agrin constructs were determined using a dot-blot procedure(32.Becker C.-M. Hoch W. Betz H. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For agrin-containing conditioned media, this assay was linear between 5 and 100 ng of total protein. Hybridoma supernatants containing mAbs IIH6 and IVA41 against α-dystroglycan (28.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 68: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) were a gift from S. Roberds and K. Campbell (University of Iowa). A mixture of these antibodies was employed at a 1:3 dilution for immunostaining. The polyclonal antiserum AS 11 against agrin (10.Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1:5. Anti-agrin mAbs 30, 86, 131, and 435 (13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified from hybridoma supernatants using protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from Promega. In some Western blot experiments, peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson/Dianova) were used. For the generation of high capacity affinity beads in a batch procedure, we modified a method described by Schneider et al.(33.Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.9 mg of anti-agrin mAb was diluted in 50 mM Tris, pH 6.7 (buffer A), and mixed with 50 μl of prewashed GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), a protein G derivative, for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with buffer A and twice with buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl, followed by two washes with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7. GammaBind Plus-Sepharose and antibodies were equilibrated in 200 mM triethanolamine, pH 8.2, and cross-linked with 10 mM dimethyl suberimidate (Pierce) in the same buffer for 45 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 200 mM ethanolamine, pH 8.2. After subsequent washes with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (buffer B), containing 500 mM NaCl, with buffer B containing 150 mM NaCl, and with buffer B, the beads were mixed with agrin-containing conditioned media for 2 h. In control samples, agrin was replaced by buffer B. These and all subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The beads were washed with buffer B containing 150 mM NaCl and with buffer B and incubated with 1.4 ml of diluted alkaline extract of rabbit muscle membranes overnight on a shaking platform. Unbound fractions were collected, and the beads were washed twice with 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM calcium chloride (buffer C) and twice with buffer C containing 150 mM NaCl. Bound α-dystroglycan was eluted by replacing Ca2+-containing buffer C with 500 μl of 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EGTA for 1 h with shaking. This step was repeated once. Finally, the agrin fragments were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Agrin-containing conditioned media (12 ml) were diluted 1:3 with 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and concentrated in Centriplus concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). Equal volumes (4 ml) of each construct were loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at a flow rate of 18 ml/h. After collection of the flow-through fraction, the column was washed with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and bound agrin was eluted by applying a linear gradient ranging from 50 mM to 1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for agrin immunoreactivity by dot-blot assay. SDS-PAGE was performed on 3-12% gradient gels or on 4-15% PhastGel (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll) utilizing the procedure of Kyhse-Andersen(34.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously(5.Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Rupp F. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.) was used for peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Because of the sensitivity of anti-α-dystroglycan antibodies to even moderate salt concentrations, low salt buffers containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8, and 50 mM NaCl were used in the washing procedures for these antibodies. Cultivation of C2 myotubes and quantification of agrin-induced AChR were performed as described (12.Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with the following modification. C2 myotubes were incubated with conditioned media containing various agrin constructs for only 6 h to reduce the number of spontaneous clusters. The number of AChR clusters in at least 15 microscopic fields was quantitated for each construct. We have previously generated a panel of truncated agrin fragments and characterized their ability to induce aggregation of AChRs on the surface of muscle fibers (Fig. 1A)(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fragments N1 and N4 showed high clustering activity, while the other fragments were inactive at equal concentrations. In this study, we used several of these fragments, which were highly expressed and efficiently secreted into the medium of transfected cells (Fig. 1B), to identify regions of the agrin protein required for binding to α-dystroglycan and to heparin. Since only relatively small amounts of different agrin fragments can conveniently be generated by transient transfection, we developed a two-step affinity chromatography protocol to evaluate α-dystroglycan's ability to bind to different agrin fragments. We immobilized an appropriate monoclonal antibody against agrin on protein G beads by cross-linking. In the first step, we loaded these beads with different agrin fragments. Because the epitopes of all rat agrin mAbs are known(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it was possible to predict which agrin fragments would bind to the beads. In a second step, these agrin mAb beads were used as affinity matrices to detect possible binding of α-dystroglycan. To this end, an alkaline extract of rabbit skeletal muscle was incubated with different agrin matrices as well as a control matrix containing only mAb, but no agrin. α-Dystroglycan bound quantitatively to N1, comprising the C-terminal half of agrin, as judged by the almost complete removal of α-dystroglycan from the unbound fraction and its detection in the eluate (Fig. 2). Binding depended on agrin since the control matrix did not retain any α-dystroglycan. Binding was also Ca2+-dependent because bound immunoreactivity could be eluted by substituting 20 mM EGTA for Ca2+ in the elution buffer (Fig. 2B). Thus, this interaction displayed characteristics previously described for the binding of α-dystroglycan to agrin(15.Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 16.Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17.Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Cell. 1994; 77: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the first set of experiments, we looked at the importance of the C-terminal sequence for α-dystroglycan binding. Agrin construct C2, which lacks the last of the three laminin G homology regions, bound to α-dystroglycan to the same extent as construct N1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Comparable amounts of both fragments could be eluted from the beads (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we conclude that deletion of a C-terminal fragment of agrin, which completely abolishes agrin's AChR clustering activity(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), did not affect its binding to α-dystroglycan. Next, we investigated the effects of truncations from the N-terminal region of N1. For these experiments, we used a mAb whose epitope is located close to the C terminus. Agrin fragment N1, bound to mAb 86, was able to remove α-dystroglycan almost quantitatively from the muscle extract (Fig. 3A). However, construct N4, which has a similar potency to induce AChR aggregation compared with N1(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), did not bind α-dystroglycan above the level of the antibody control under these conditions (Fig. 3B). The same result was obtained with fragment N6, for which no AChR aggregating activity has been detected. Analysis of agrin that remained on the beads after elution of α-dystroglycan demonstrated that comparable amounts of the three constructs had been bound to the matrices (Fig. 3C). After prolonged development of similar Western blots, we observed weak binding of α-dystroglycan to agrin construct N4, but not to construct N6 (data not shown). This is demonstrated in Fig. 4, in which we used a more sensitive method for the detection of weak immunoreactivities on Western blots. To estimate the differences in α-dystroglycan binding between constructs N1 and N4, we adsorbed ~100 pmol of agrin fragment N4 as well as only 50, 25, and 10 pmol of N1 to mAb 30 affinity beads (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the smallest immobilized amount of fragment N1, which would correspond to a concentration of ~7 nM in solution, removed less than half of the α-dystroglycan present in the extract (Fig. 4, A and B). We estimate that the amount of α-dystroglycan in the binding reactions was similar to the smallest amount of N1. Even the small amount of N1 bound more α-dystroglycan than a 10-fold larger amount of fragment N4. We therefore conclude that unlike C-terminal deletions, truncations from the N terminus of N1 reduce agrin's capability of binding to α-dystroglycan. These results suggest that the second laminin G-domain, which is known to be important for agrin's clustering activity(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14.Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), as well as flanking sequences might be sufficient to mediate weak α-dystroglycan binding. To directly test this hypothesis, we generated an additional construct, N4/C2 (Fig. 1), which contained only the third and fourth EGF-like repeats and the second laminin G-domain. When expressed in COS-7 cells, N4/C2 was readily secreted into the medium and appeared as a band of 35 kDa on a Western blot (Fig. 1B). Fragment N4/C2 was indeed sufficient for low affinity binding of α-dystroglycan as similar amounts of α-dystroglycan were bound to this fragment and to N4 (Fig. 4B). Similar to the longer C-terminal deletion construct C2, N4/C2 was unable to induce clustering of AChR on C2 myotubes above control levels (Fig. 1A). Binding of α-dystroglycan to laminin (27.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 35.Gee S. Blacher R. Douville P. Provost P. Yurchenko P. Carbonetto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14972-14980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to agrin(16.Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17.Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Cell. 1994; 77: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) is inhibited by heparin. Several lines of evidence implicate proteoglycans as important for agrin-induced AChR aggregation(7.Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12.Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 36.Martin P.T. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 743-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to map the binding site on the agrin molecule for heparin and to compare it with the α-dystroglycan site. We assessed the retention of different agrin fragments on a heparin column (Fig. 5). All fragments, except N6, bound almost quantitatively and required high ionic strength (>0.4 M NaCl) for elution. Constructs N4 and N4/C2 were eluted at slightly higher concentrations (data not shown). Thus, the second laminin G-domain present in all binding constructs was sufficient to mediate binding to heparin. We used truncation fragments of the C-terminal half of agrin to determine the regions of the agrin protein necessary for binding to the candidate agrin receptor, α-dystroglycan, and to heparin, an inhibitor of agrin-induced AChR clustering. Since the clustering activity of these fragments has previously been determined(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a comparison of the binding and activity profiles has implications for the possible role of α-dystroglycan as a functional agrin receptor. Our analysis shows that at least two regions of the agrin protein are required for α-dystroglycan binding (Fig. 6): fragment N4/C2 contained the second laminin G homology region as well as the two C-terminal EGF-like repeats. These regions were sufficient for low affinity binding. However, only the presence of the first laminin G-domain and the first two EGF-like repeats, as in construct C2, led to an agrin with high affinity α-dystroglycan binding similar to the largest construct, N1. The difference between low and high affinity binding is substantial since fragment N4 bound considerably less α-dystroglycan than a 10-fold smaller amount of construct N1. It is likely that the second laminin G-domain is crucial for α-dystroglycan and heparin binding as homologous domains mediate binding of laminin to α-dystroglycan and to heparin(35.Gee S. Blacher R. Douville P. Provost P. Yurchenko P. Carbonetto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14972-14980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The related third laminin G-domain did not influence binding at all, and the first laminin G-domain possibly had an effect on α-dystroglycan binding, but not on heparin binding. A further refinement of our analysis would require even smaller fragments of agrin. However, additional agrin truncation constructs are secreted into the medium in very low amounts insufficient for affinity chromatography(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Comparing regions of the agrin molecule necessary for α-dystroglycan binding and for AChR clustering activity, we found two important differences (Fig. 6): the C2 and N4/C2 constructs, lacking the C-terminal region of agrin, displayed binding, but no AChR aggregating activity. Conversely, N4, a construct lacking the first laminin G-domain and the first two EGF-like repeats, displayed normal AChR clustering activity, but significantly reduced binding to α-dystroglycan. Furthermore, in our experiments, we employed two antibodies to immobilize agrin that were known to block the AChR clustering activity of soluble agrin in culture(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); surprisingly, mAb 30 (Fig. 3) and mAb 435 (data not shown) did not prevent simultaneous binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan. Two observations made in previous studies had indicated discrepancies between the ability of agrin fragments to bind to α-dystroglycan and their biological activity. First, proteolytic 70- and 95-kDa fragments of purified agrin both bound to membranes of Torpedo electric organ(37.Ma J. Nastuk M.A. McKechnie B.A. Fallon J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25108-25117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the 70-kDa fragment, the C terminus had been removed by proteolysis at an unknown position. Similar to our fragments C2 and N4/C2, this fragment was not able to induce AChR clustering (38.Nitkin R.M. Smith M.A. Magill C. Fallon J.R. Yao Y.-M. M. Wallace B. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, although the major agrin-binding protein in these membranes is α-dystroglycan(15.Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), other proteins might have contributed to binding of the 70-kDa fragment. Second, a neuron-specific insert of 8 amino acids (10.Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11.Smith M.A. O'Dowd D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39.O'Connor L.T. Lauterborn J.C. Gall C.M. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a region close to the fourth EGF-like repeat (Fig. 1A) increases agrin's AChR clustering activity 10,000-fold(12.Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, Sugiyama et al.(18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) found that two agrin splice variants, with or without this insert, equally bound to α-dystroglycan. In their experiments as well as in our study, α-dystroglycan dissociated from β-dystroglycan and the other members of the DGC was used as a binding partner for agrin. The alkaline extraction procedure used in our experiments might have affected the characteristics of the binding of α-dystroglycan to different agrin fragments. However, this appears unlikely since a previous study demonstrated that this procedure does not affect the binding of homologous laminin G-domains of laminin to α-dystroglycan (27.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). In fact, binding of agrin can be detected even after SDS denaturation and renaturation of α-dystroglycan on nitrocellulose (15.Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 17.Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Cell. 1994; 77: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the insert sequence and the C terminus of agrin determine a particular conformation of agrin that is defined by the presence of the epitope for mAb 86(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both regions do not affect agrin binding to α-dystroglycan. Thus, this conformation, which is crucial for the clustering activity of agrin, is not required for binding to α-dystroglycan. Taken together, our results support the idea that α-dystroglycan alone is not the functional agrin receptor. A different or additional component that generates the observed ligand specificity has to be postulated(18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 40.Fallon J.R. Hall Z.W. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 469-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Three principal scenarios can be considered for the agrin-α-dystroglycan interaction. First, α-dystroglycan may in some manner collaborate with other signaling proteins and facilitate their binding to agrin. Receptor systems that utilize auxiliary proteoglycans are known for several growth factors. For example, transforming growth factor-β first binds to an accessory proteoglycan, betaglycan, and later combines with a different receptor to form a ternary complex, which is finally converted into the signaling receptor(41.López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). However, the concept of α-dystroglycan as an analogous auxiliary proteoglycan does not readily explain why construct C2 does not act as an inhibitor of agrin-induced AChR aggregation (13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and why the weaker binding of construct N4 does not correlate with reduced clustering activity. Therefore, our data favor two models in which the active agrin fragments N1 and N4, but not inactive fragments such as C2, bind to a yet unknown receptor other than α-dystroglycan(18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In a second scenario, binding of agrin to this so far unidentified receptor alone is sufficient to induce AChR clustering. α-Dystroglycan does not participate in this process. Instead, it merely is a structural protein involved in stabilization of the synaptic sarcolemma. This model is entirely consistent with our data. A more intriguing third scenario, however, would be a two-step model in which α-dystroglycan is important for the second phase of receptor aggregation. According to this model, binding of agrin to the hypothetical receptor only initiates the formation of small clusters of AChRs that are observed during the early phase of receptor aggregation both in vivo and in vitro(42.Steinbach J. Dev. Biol. 1981; 84: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43.Wallace B.G. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). α-Dystroglycan can be detected very early in these microclusters (30.Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Godfrey E.W. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan could be required for a following maturation step. This binding could trigger a reorganization of the membrane cytoskeleton, for example, an association of utrophin with the DGC. Utrophin colocalizes with mature AChR clusters, but is not detectable in microclusters(44.Phillips W.P. Noakes P. Roberds S. Campbell K. Merlie J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The recruitment of utrophin or another rearrangement of the submembrane cytoskeleton could initiate the condensation of microclusters into larger aggregates. According to this model, this consolidation of AChR clusters is mediated by all α-dystroglycan-binding agrin fragments, including C2. In contrast, inactive fragments such as C2 are not expected to bind to the hypothetical receptor. Therefore, fragment C2 should inhibit neither clustering initiation nor cluster condensation. Indeed, this fragment does not block aggregation of AChRs(13.Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The question remains how construct N4 can induce clusters with similar efficiency compared with N1 despite its reduced binding to α-dystroglycan. A possible explanation is that agrin synthesized by muscle fibers can compensate for the diminished binding of N4 to α-dystroglycan(18.Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The function of muscle-derived agrin, which does not contain an insert at splicing site Z and therefore has a low capability of initiating AChR clustering (7.Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), is unknown. Its strong binding to α-dystroglycan may suggest a role for muscle-derived agrin during this maturation step. To test these models, it will be necessary to identify and isolate additional high affinity agrin-binding proteins. Our construct N4 could be a valuable tool in this search as its binding to the signaling receptor should be less overshadowed by its binding to α-dystroglycan. We thank Sigrun Helms for excellent technical assistance and Uli Schwarz, Wulf-Dirk Leuschner, Andreas Hohn, and Camila Esguerra for critical reading of the manuscript. We also thank Uli Schwarz for support and Drs. Kevin Campbell and Steven Roberds for generously providing antibodies against α-dystroglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2008018303,"Mammalian Class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is normally associated with neoplastic transformation or xenobiotic induction by aromatic hydrocarbons in liver. However, Class 3 ALDH is constitutively expressed at it's highest specific activity in corneal epithelium. Tissue-specific, differential gene expression is often controlled by alternative, independent molecular pathways. We report here the development of an in vitro corneal epithelium culture system that retains constitutive high expression of the ALDH3 gene. This model system was used to establish, by enzymatic assays, Western and Northern analyses, histochemical and immunocytochemical staining, and 5′3′ RACE methodologies that constitutive and xenobiotic induction of Class 3 ALDHs occurs from a single gene. Our results also provide a plausible explanation for the very high Class 3 ALDH activity in mammalian cornea, as the primary mechanism of oxidation of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes. Further studies with corneal epithelium suggest the presence of additional mechanisms, other than Ah-receptor-mediated, by which the ALDH3 gene can be differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner."

https://openalex.org/W2074384878,"An immunochemical approach was employed as a direct test for functional activities of isozymes of methylcobamide:coenzyme M methyltransferase (MT2-M and MT2-A) in the metabolic pathways of methane formation from: methanol, acetate, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine. Specific removal of the MT2 isozymes from buffer soluble cell extracts of Methanosarcina barkeri was accomplished by use of immobilized, affinity-purified, ovine polyclonal antibodies. Extracts of methanol-grown cells depleted of MT2-M lost entirely the ability to carry out conversion of methanol to 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonate (methyl-CoM). Methanol:CoM methyl transfer activity was completely restored by addition of purified MT2-M, but no activity was recovered by addition of MT2-A. In contrast, the activity of trimethylamine-grown cell extracts to convert monomethylamine and dimethylamine to methyl-CoM was lost almost entirely by immunosorptive removal of MT2-A. Addition of purified MT2-A, but not MT2-M, to the MT2-A-depleted extract fully reconstituted methyl-CoM formation from both mono- and dimethylamine. Interestingly, in extracts resolved of MT2-A, trimethylamine-dependent methylation of coenzyme M was observed at approximately 20% of the rate of controls not treated with antibody. Furthermore, both isozymes were effective in full restoration of trimethylamine conversion. Tests indicated that neither of the two MT2 isozymes are involved in methane formation from acetate. The results establish that MT2-A plays a specific role in metabolism of methylated amine substrates, whereas, MT2-M functions in methane formation from trimethylamine and methanol."
https://openalex.org/W2023552163,"The growth promoting activity of the subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) is attributed to sequestration of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by heparan sulfate proteoglycans and its regulated release by heparin-like molecules and heparan sulfate (HS) degrading enzymes. HS is also involved in bFGF receptor binding and activation. The present study focuses on the growth promoting activity and bFGF binding capacity of sulfate-depleted ECM. Corneal endothelial cells (EC) maintained in the presence of chlorate, an inhibitor of phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate synthesis, produced ECM containing 10-15% of the sulfate normally present in ECM. Incorporation of sulfate into HS was reduced by more than 90%. Binding of 125I-bFGF to sulfate-depleted ECM was reduced by 50-60% and only about 10% of the ECM-bound bFGF was accessible to release by heparin. Incubation of 125I-bFGF on top of native ECM resulted in dimerization of the ECM-bound bFGF, but there was a markedly reduced binding and dimerization of bFGF on sulfate-depleted ECM. ECM produced in the presence of chlorate contained a nearly 10-fold less endogenous bFGF as compared to native ECM and exerted little or no mitogenic activity toward vascular EC and 3T3 fibroblasts. In other studies, we investigated the interaction between chlorate-treated vascular EC and either native or sulfate-depleted ECM. Exogenous heparin stimulated the proliferation of chlorate-treated EC seeded on native ECM, suggesting its interaction with ECM-bound bFGF and subsequent presentation to high affinity cell surface receptors. On the other hand, heparin had no effect on chlorate-treated cells seeded in contact with sulfate-depleted ECM or regular tissue culture plastic. Altogether, the present experiments indicate that heparan sulfate proteoglycans associated with the cell surface and ECM act in concert to regulate the bioavailability and growth promoting activity of bFGF. While HS in the subendothelial ECM functions primarily in sequestration of bFGF in the vicinity of responsive cells, HS on cell surfaces is playing a more active role in displacing the ECM-bound bFGF and its subsequent presentation to high affinity signal transducing receptors.

Recent interest in heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) stems from increasing awareness of the functional implications of their interactions with growth factors, matrix molecules, and cytoskeletal elements (Gitay-Goren et al., 11.Gitay-Goren H.

The HS chains have been implicated in a variety of physiological processes including the regulation of glomerular basement membrane permeability to proteins, assembly of basement membranes, regulation of nuclear metabolism, cell attachment and spreading, recruitment of inflammatory cells (chemokines), and the regulation of mammalian cell proliferation and differentiation (Gallagher et al., 1986; Jackson et al., 1991; Ruoslahti and Yamaguchi, 1991; Tanaka et al., 38.Tanaka Y.

The sulfate residues, which may be present on four different positions of the polysaccharide backbone, are of high interest, since they have been shown to be major factors in the determination of specificity in protein-polysaccharide interactions (Lindahl, 27.Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin: Chemical and Biological Properties, Clinical Applications. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar). Of particular significance is the interaction between HS and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), involved in bFGF receptor binding and signal transduction (Ornitz et al., 31.Ornitz D.M. Yayon A.

This ECM closely resembles the subendothelium in vivo in its morphological appearance and molecular organization. It contains collagens (mostly types III and IV, with smaller amounts of types I and V), proteoglycans (mostly HS- and dermatan sulfate-proteoglycans, with smaller amounts of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans), laminin, fibronectin, entactin, and elastin. EC and other cell types plated in contact with this ECM no longer require the addition of soluble bFGF in order to proliferate and express their differentiated functions (Gospodarowicz et al., 1980; Vlodavsky et al., 1980). In subsequent studies bFGF was identified as a complex with HSPG in the subendothelial ECM produced in vitro (Bashkin et al., 4.Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I.

On the basis of these results, the ECM is regarded as a storage depot for bFGF and possibly other heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines. These immobilized growth factors are held responsible for the growth promoting activity of the ECM. In the present study, corneal EC were cultured in the presence of chlorate to produce sulfate-depleted ECM. This ECM was analyzed for its ability to sequester and dimerize bFGF and its growth promoting activity toward vascular EC and 3T3 fibroblasts, in the absence and presence of exogenously added heparin. We have also analyzed the ability of chlorate-treated EC to respond to native and sulfate-depleted ECM. Recombinant human bFGF was kindly provided by Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Sepharose 6B was from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Sodium heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (PM-heparin, Mr 14,000, anti-FXa 165 IU/mg) was obtained from Hepar Industries (Franklin, OH). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, 1 g of glucose/liter or 4.5 g glucose/liter), Fisher medium (sulfate-free), fetal calf serum, calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Saline containing 0.05% trypsin, 0.01 M sodium phosphate, and 0.02% EDTA (STV) was obtained from Biological Industries (Beit-Haemek, Israel). Tissue culture dishes and multiwell plates were obtained from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). [3H]Thymidine, Na235SO4 and Na125I were obtained from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was purchased from Pierce, and sodium chlorate was purchased from Aldrich. Triton X-100, dextran T-40, and all other chemicals were of reagent grade, purchased from Sigma. Balb/c 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM (4.5 g of glucose/liter) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37°C in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator. Cultures of bovine corneal EC were established from steer eyes as described previously (Bashkin et al., 1989; Gospodarowicz et al., 15.Gospodarowicz D. Mescher A.L. Birdwell C.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 25: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Stock cultures were maintained in DMEM (1 g of glucose/liter) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator. Recombinant human bFGF (1 ng/ml) was added every other day during the phase of active cell growth. Bovine aortic EC were cloned and cultured in DMEM (1 g of glucose/liter) supplemented with 10% calf serum, as described (Gospodarowicz et al., 14.Gospodarowicz D. Moran J. Braun D. Birdwell C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar; Vlodavsky et al., 1987). Bovine corneal EC were dissociated from stock cultures (second to fifth passage) with STV and plated into four-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml/well. Cells were maintained as described above, except that 5% dextran T-40 was included in the growth medium (Gospodarowicz et al., 1980; Vlodavsky et al., 1980). The cells were cultured in the absence and presence of sodium chlorate (30 mM, except when stated otherwise) without replacing the medium and without addition of bFGF. Ten to 12 days after seeding, the subendothelial ECM was exposed by dissolving (5 min, room temperature) the cell layer with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mM NH4OH, followed by four washes in PBS. The ECM remained intact, free of cellular debris, and firmly attached to the entire area of the tissue culture dish (Gospodarowicz et al., 1980, 17.Gospodarowicz D. Gonzalez R. Fujii D.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 1983: 191-201Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar; Vlodavsky et al., 1980, 1987). For preparation of sulfate-labeled ECM, corneal EC were plated into four-well plates and cultured as described above. Na235SO4 (540-590 mCi/mmol) was added (20 μCi/ml) 1 and 5 days after seeding, and the cultures were incubated with the label without medium change. Ten to 12 days after seeding, the cell monolayer was dissolved and the ECM exposed, as described above. To determine the total amount of sulfate labeled material, the ECM was digested with trypsin (25 μg/ml, 24 h, 37°C) and the solubilized material counted in a β-counter. Protein was determined in aliquots of the trypsinized material using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the amount of sulfate labeled HS, the ECM was digested (48 h, 37°C, pH 6.2) with a human placental heparanase (endo-β-D-glucuronidase) purified and characterized as described (Gilat et al., 12.Gilat D. Hershkoviz R. Goldkorn I. Cahalon L. Korner G. Vlodavsky I. Lider O. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1929-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The estimated Mr of the HS fragments was 5,000-7,000 as compared to a Mr of about 30,000 ascribed to intact HS side chains released from ECM by treatment with alkaline borohydride or papain (Vlodavsky et al., 1983). Sulfate-labeled low Mr degradation products released into the incubation medium were analyzed by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B, as described (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1990). Recombinant bFGF was iodinated using chloramine T, as described (Benezra et al., 1993). The specific activity was 1.2-1.7 × 105 cpm/ng bFGF, and the labeled preparation was kept for up to 6 weeks at −70°C. 125I-bFGF binding to ECM was performed as described (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992). Unbound bFGF was removed and the remaining ECM was solubilized with 1 N NaOH and counted in a γ-counter. Displacement of ECM-bound 125I-bFGF by heparin was performed as described (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992). bFGF cross-linking experiments were carried out as described (Ornitz et al., 1992; Spivak-Kroizman et al., 37.Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-bFGF (25 ng/0.25 ml/well) was incubated (1 h, 24°C) with ECM (four-well plates) in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). The incubation medium was removed, the dishes were washed three times with PBS followed by incubation (30 min, 24°C) with 0.15 mM DSS in PBS. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 10 mM ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0) for 30 min, the incubation medium removed, and the remaining ECM scraped and dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer (150 μl/well, 1 h, 37°C). The soluble material was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. The cross-linked bFGF was visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film. Heparin was reacted with Bolton-Hunter reagent and iodinated as described (Dawes and Pepper, 9.Dawes J. Pepper D.S. Throm. Res. 1979; 14: 845-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The specific activity was 6,000 cpm/ng. Binding of 125I-heparin to ECM was performed in the absence and presence of 20 μg/ml unlabeled heparin. Assay for DNA synthesis in growth-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells was performed as described (Vlodavsky et al., 1987). For measurements of EC proliferation, cells were seeded on ECM or regular tissue culture plastic at a low density (1 × 103/16-mm well) in 0.5 ml DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. Five to 6 days after seeding, the cells were dissociated with STV and counted in a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics). Alternatively, the cells were exposed (3-4 h, 37°C) to [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/well) and DNA synthesis was determined by measuring the radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1990). Thymidine incorporation was linearly correlated to the number of cells per well. In other experiments, the EC were seeded at a clonal cell density (300 cells/35-mm dish) and cell colonies were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, 10 days after seeding (Gospodarowicz et al., 1976; Vlodavsky et al., 1987). Corneal EC were seeded at a confluent cell density into four-well plates, in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of chlorate (0.1-60 mM). Under these conditions, a contact inhibited cell monolayer was formed within 6 h and there was no effect to chlorate on the cell number and morphological appearance, thereafter. The cells were maintained in sulfate-free Fisher medium containing 20 μCi/ml Na235SO4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ten days after seeding, the cell layer was dissolved to expose the subendothelial ECM. The ECM was then subjected to complete digestion with trypsin (25 μg/ml, 24 h, 37°C) and the digest counted in a β-counter. Eighty-90% decrease in sulfate content was obtained in ECM produced in the presence of 30 mM chlorate (Fig. 1, inset). Similar results were obtained when the stock of corneal EC was treated (48 h) with 30 mM chlorate before seeding into the four-well plates and thereafter. At this concentration, chlorate had little or no effect on the total amount of ECM protein deposited by the cells, nor on the morphology and organization of the ECM as revealed by phase and scanning electron microscopy. Exposure to 60 mM chlorate resulted in an almost complete inhibition of sulfate incorporation, but this was associated with a slight decrease (<20%) in ECM deposition. In subsequent experiments, sulfate-depleted ECM was produced by cells maintained in the presence of 30 mM chlorate, as described above. Specific incorporation of sulfate into HS was analyzed by measurements of sulfate-labeled material released from ECM during incubation (24 h, 37°C) with a highly purified preparation of human placental heparanase. Sulfate-labeled HS degradation products released into the incubation medium were analyzed by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B, as described (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1990). As demonstrated in Fig. 1, there was little (<10%) release of sulfate-labeled HS degradation products (fractions 15-35, 0.5 < Kav < 0.8) from ECM produced in the presence of 30 mM chlorate. Sulfate groups are involved in bFGF binding to isolated heparin and HS (Aviezer et al., 1994b; Habuchi et al., 1992; Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992, 1993; Maccarana et al., 1993; Turnbull et al., 1992). The availability of sulfate-deficient ECM provided an appropriate means to investigate to what extent sulfate groups are involved in bFGF binding to a multimolecular structure such as intact subendothelial ECM. Binding of 125I-bFGF to ECM produced in the presence of 30 mM chlorate was inhibited by 50-60%. Sulfate depletion had a more pronounced effect on bFGF binding to HS in the ECM, as revealed by 70-80% reduction in the amount of ECM-bound bFGF displaced by heparin (Fig. 2). A similar value was obtained when the ECM-HS was degraded by human placental heparanase (data not shown). While heparin or heparanase treatment released 50-60% of the 125I-bFGF bound to native ECM, only 10-15% of the bFGF bound to sulfate-depleted ECM was released under the same conditions. It is therefore conceivable that binding of bFGF to sulfate-depleted ECM produced in the presence of 30 mM chlorate was due primarily to binding to other components of the ECM (i.e. fibronectin) or to glycosaminoglycan side chains deprived of their sulfate moieties (Ornitz et al., 32.Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that EC and other cell types plated in contact with the subendothelial ECM no longer require the addition of soluble bFGF in order to proliferate (Gospodarowicz et al., 1980; Vlodavsky et al., 1987). This mitogenic effect was attributed primarily to the presence of bFGF in ECM, although the mode of bFGF deposition was not elucidated (Vlodavsky et al., 1987). ECM produced in the absence and presence of chlorate was tested for mitogenic activity toward vascular EC and 3T3 fibroblasts. For this purpose, vascular EC were seeded at a low cell density (1,000 cells/16-mm well) on top of ECM produced in the absence and presence of 30 mM chlorate. Six days after seeding, the cultures were exposed to [3H]thymidine and the amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined 3 h afterwards (Fig. 3A). EC were also seeded at a clonal cell density (300 cells/35-mm dish) on top of native and sulfate-depleted ECM and cell colonies were stained 10 days after seeding (Fig. 3, inset). As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, ECM produced in the presence of chlorate exerted a greatly reduced mitogenic activity toward vascular EC seeded at a low or clonal cell density. In other experiments (Fig. 3B), ECM produced in the presence of increasing concentrations of chlorate was subjected to trypsin digestion and aliquots of the solubilized material were added to confluent, growth-arrested 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3B) or to sparsely seeded EC (1,000 cells/16-mm well) maintained in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (data not shown). A trypsin digest of native ECM was highly mitogenic to growth arrested 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3B), and this activity was inhibited by neutralizing anti-bFGF antibodies (data not shown). In contrast, ECM produced in the presence of 30 mM chlorate was devoid of mitogenic activity toward 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). Likewise, chlorate markedly reduced (~60%) the growth promoting activity of ECM extracts toward sparsely seeded EC (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, EC plated on chlorate-treated ECM responded to exogenously added bFGF in a manner similar to cells plated on regular tissue culture plastic. These results indicate that sulfation is critical for the growth promoting activity of the ECM. In other experiments, ECM produced in the absence and presence of 30 mM chlorate was digested (3 h, 37°C) with 0.1 μg/ml trypsin and the amount of bFGF in the solubilized material was determined by an immunoassay (Quantikine human bFGF, R& Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The amount of bFGF in sulfate-depleted ECM was about 10-fold lower than that determined in native ECM (i.e. 11 and 121 pg of bFGF/ECM-coated 16-mm culture well, respectively). Similar results were obtained when the ECM was digested with bacterial (Flavobacterium heparinum) heparinase I (IBEX Technologies, Montreal, Canada) rather than trypsin. The heparinase-treated ECM exerted little or no mitogenic activity on vascular EC. We investigated the effect of heparin on bFGF sequestration and the growth promoting activity of ECM produced by corneal EC maintained in the absence and presence of chlorate. Heparin was included in the cell lysis solution to prevent binding of intracellular bFGF to ECM-HS when the ECM-producing cells are lysed. When 125I-bFGF was added to the lysis solution, it was found that only about 2 and 0.2% of the added bFGF was sequestered by native and sulfate-depleted ECM, respectively, during the 5-min cell lysis period (Fig. 4). Heparin (10-20 μg/ml) inhibited by about 80% the deposition of bFGF on top of ECM produced in the absence of chlorate, and there was little or no effect to heparin on the residual binding of 125I-bFGF to ECM produced in presence of chlorate (Fig. 4). We next analyzed the effect of heparin on the growth promoting activity of ECM produced in the absence and presence of chlorate. Heparin, present during the 5-min cell lysis period, had little or no effect on the growth promoting activity of native ECM toward vascular EC seeded on ECM at a low (Fig. 5) or clonal (data not shown) cell densities. Surprisingly, the mitogenic activity toward EC of ECM produced in the presence of chlorate was stimulated (1.5-4-fold, in different experiments) when heparin was included in the cell lysis solution. This stimulation was observed both when the endothelial cells were seeded directly on the ECM (Fig. 5) and when the ECM was first digested with trypsin and aliquots of the solubilized material were tested for mitogenic activity on vascular EC (data not shown). Measurements of 125I-heparin binding revealed that under the experimental conditions applied in Fig. 5, <0.5% of the heparin was bound to the ECM and there was no difference in heparin binding to ECM produced in the absence or presence of chlorate (data not shown). It has been previously demonstrated that heparin restores the ability of chlorate-treated 3T3 fibroblasts to proliferate in response to bFGF (Rapraeger et al., 1991). We investigated whether proliferation of chlorate-treated EC can be similarly restored by native ECM, in the absence and presence of added heparin. For this purpose, vascular EC were pretreated (24 h) with 30 mM chlorate and seeded in the presence of 30 mM chlorate and absence of exogenously added bFGF, on (i) tissue culture plastic, (ii) sulfate-depleted ECM, and (iii) native ECM. Heparin (1 μg/ml) was added to some of the cultures and the cells counted on day 5 after seeding. Fig. 6 demonstrates that chlorate-treated EC exhibited little or no proliferative response to he"

Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Embedded within the cytoplasmic tails of both Ig-α and β is a sequence common to other multichain immune recognition receptor (MIRR) subunits including CD3δ, CD3γ, TCRχ, FcγRIIIγ, and Fc∊RIγ, termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)(16.Keegan A.D.

The motif contains two tyrosines, both of which are critical for initiating tyrosine kinase activation (10.Sanchez M. Misulovin Z. Burkhardt A.L. Mahajan S. Costa T. Franke R. Bolen J.B.

The presence of the ITAM in all MIRR chains involved in signal transduction has led some to suggest that apparently heterologous chains such as CD3∊ and TCRχ are functionally redundant and the presence of multiple ITAMs within each MIRR serve to increase the strength of signal which can be generated via the receptor. Evidence for this assertion has been obtained in studies of both the B and T cell antigen receptors(8.Burkhardt A.L. Costa T. Misulovin Z. Stealy B. Bolen J.B. Nussenzweig M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Law D.A. Chan V.W.F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr.

In contrast, we and others have provided evidence indicating that each heterologous ITAM containing chain has a distinct function(10.Sanchez M. Misulovin Z. Burkhardt A.L. Mahajan S. Costa T.

Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Many of the above studies utilized chimeras in which irrelevant extracellular and transmembrane domains were fused to the single cytoplasmic domain under study(18.Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 27.Irving B.A. Weiss A.

Although this approach has yielded considerable insight into ITAM-containing chains, it assumes that functions observed in the isolated circumstance of a single chimera are reflective of the function of that cytoplasmic domain within the intact receptor complex. This might not be true since most ITAM-containing chains, such as Ig-α and Ig-β, are expressed on cell surfaces as heterodimers(29.Alarcon B. Ley S.C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30.Campbell K.S. Cambier J.C.

Harford J. Schwartz R.H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that within the context of a heterodimer, Ig-α and Ig-β would have new, complementary or even synergistic functions, not predicted from studies of single chain chimeras.As demonstrated in this report, Ig-α and β have new and unpredicted functions in the context of a heterodimer. Using a novel chimera system, which allowed us to form either hetero- or homodimers of the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-β, we observed that when Ig-β is ligated independently it is able to activate tyrosine kinases. However, when co-aggregated with Ig-α, Ig-β appears to remarkably enhance Ig-α phosphorylation. This in turn correlates with an increase in the range and intensity of cellular substrates phosphorylated by the heterodimer and a lowering of the stimulation threshold for tyrosine kinase activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of PDGFR/Ig-α/β ChimerasThe construction and expression of the chimeras has been described in detail elsewhere. ( 2B. J. Eisfelder and M. R. Clark, submitted for publication.) Briefly, cDNAs encoding the PDGFRα and β chains (gift of A. Kazlauskas, National Jewish Center, Denver, CO) were mutated to introduce BamHI and EcoRI sites immediately after that portion of each cDNA which encodes the transmembrane domain. The introduction of these sites facilitated the insertion of cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-β(25.Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These fragments were assembled with an EcoRI/XhoI-flanked cDNA fragment containing multiple stop codons in pSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which were then subcloned into the expression vector pCB6+/muTk (gift of H. Singh, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) which contains a neomycin resistance gene, an IgM enhancer and a thymidine kinase promoter. The cDNAs encoding the chimeric constructs PDGFRβ/Ig-α and PDGFRβ/Ig-β were transfected either separately or together into A20 IIA1.6 (33.Jones B. Tite J.P. Janeway C.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar) by electroporation. Clones were derived by selection with G-418 and stained with anti-PDGFRα and anti-PDGFRβ antibodies (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) then FITC-conjugated anti-IgG1 (Zymed, San Francisco, CA). They were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA).ReagentsPolyclonal anti-Ig-α and anti-Ig-β antibodies were made by immunizing rabbits (HTI Bioproducts, Ramona, CA) with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of murine Ig-α or Ig-β(25.Clark M.R.

The serum of rabbits immunized with the Ig-α fusion protein was purified over a column (CNBr-activated Sepharose, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) coupled to a peptide corresponding to the murine Ig-α cytoplasmic tail ITAM (amino acid residues 177-196)(34.Sakaguchi N.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3457-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), whereas the polyclonal anti-Ig-β antibody was purified over a column containing the immunizing Ig-β fusion protein. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies FB2 and Ab2 were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and Oncogene Sciences (Uniondale, NY), respectively.Cell Growth and StimulationFor most experiments, cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan UT), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 7.5% CO2. For the experiments described in Fig. 6, cells were serum-starved (0.5% fetal calf serum) for 18 h before initiation of each experiment. For all the stimulation experiments described, aliquots of 10 × 106 cells were suspended in 300 μl of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. To stimulate cells via the endogenous BCR, cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) at 15 μg/ml for the times indicated in each experiment. To stimulate transfectants through the chimera, cells were incubated with PDGF-BB ligand (100 ng/ml, except where noted) (Sigma) for 5 min, followed by anti-PDGFRβ antibody (5 μg/ml, except where noted) (Genzyme) for 3 min, then anti-IgG1 antibody (5 μg/ml) (Jackson Immunoresearch).Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingAliquots of stimulated or unstimulated cells were lysed on ice with an equal volume of 2% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer(19.Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After lysis, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with FB2 (3 μg), anti-Ig-α antibody (3 μg), and/or anti-Ig-β antibody and then with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and finally immunoblotted with anti-Ig-α (1 μg/ml), anti-Ig-β (1 μg/ml), or Ab2 (1 μg/ml) antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST). After washing in TBST, blots were incubated in either horseradish-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Corp.), washed in TBST, and then visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham).RESULTSConstruction, Expression, and Stimulation of PDGFR ChimerasTo examine if Ig-α and Ig-β may function together to initiate pathways of cellular activation, we designed a system using the human PDGFRs, which allowed us to form either homo- or heterodimers of Ig-α and β. Two forms of PDGFR exist, α and β, each of which is recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, although distinct, each has an equal affinity for the naturally occurring ligand, PDGF-BB(35.Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Therefore, each chain can be expressed independently, yet made to form homodimers or predominantly heterodimers on singly or doubly transfected cells, respectively, by the addition of PDGF-BB. These dimers, which are representative of the resting complex (PDGF-BB does not induce tyrosine kinase activation; data not shown), can then be activated by specific antibodies (Fig. 1A).Figure 1:A, stimulation of PDGFR chimeras. Homodimers or predominantly heterodimers were formed on singly (left) or doubly transfected (middle) cells, respectively, by first treating with PDGF-BB. Complexes were then aggregated with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies, followed by goat anti-mouse antibodies. Omission of PDGF-BB before stimulating doubly transfected cells led to the aggregation of PDGFRβ/Ig-α alone (right panel). B, schematic representation of PDGFR chimeras. cDNAs encoding the PDGFRα and β chains were mutated to introduce BamHI and EcoRI sites immediately after that portion of each cDNA encoding the transmembrane domain (Tm). The introduction of these sites facilitated the insertion of cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-β. Assembled cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pCB6+/muTk, which contains a neomycin resistance gene, an IgM enhancer and a thymidine kinase promoter. C, flow cytometric analysis of A20 IIA1.6 cells expressing PDGFR chimeras. Expression of either surface IgG, PDGFRα or PDGFRβ on wild type, β/Ig-α, β/Ig-β, and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells. To stain for surface IgG, 2 × 105 cells/sample from each cell line were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-IgG at 4°C. For chimera staining, 2 × 105 cells/sample from each cell line were incubated with anti-PDGFRα or anti-PDGFRβ antibodies and subsequently FITC-conjugated anti-IgG1 at 4°C. Also shown is staining of each cell line without primary antibody. As demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, cells with equal staining intensity with anti-PDGFRα and anti-PDGFRβ antibodies expressed approximately equal amounts of each protein (Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We engineered cDNAs encoding for molecules in which either the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α or Ig-β were fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of either PDGFR α or β (Fig. 1B). These cDNAs were expressed singly or in combination in A20 IIA1.6, a B cell lymphoma that lacks FcγRII, to yield three cell lines expressing approximately equal levels of each chimera (β/Ig-α (expressing PDGFRβ/Ig-α), β/Ig-β and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α) (Fig. 1C and Fig. 3).Figure 3:Only Ig-α was phosphorylated upon stimulation through the chimeras in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α. 10 × 106 cells/sample of the wild type (WT) or α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells were either left unstimulated or were stimulated through the chimeras as in Fig. 2. Lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated with FB2, anti-Ig-α, or anti-Ig-β antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and then probed with Ab2, anti-Ig-α, or anti-Ig-β antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Cytoplasmic Domains of Both Ig-α and Ig-β Are Needed to Induce the Efficient Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cellular ProteinsWe first asked if the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α or Ig-β alone, or the two chains together, were capable of inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in a manner similar to that induced via the endogenous BCR. Chimeras were stimulated by sequential incubation with PDGF-BB, followed by anti-PDGFRβ antibody and rabbit anti-mouse IgG1. In parallel samples, the endogenous BCR on each transfectant was stimulated with polyclonal antibodies to IgG. After stimulation, cells were lysed and phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (with FB2) from each lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Ab2). As shown in Fig. 2, stimulation of the BCR on wild type and transfected cells induced a similar spectrum and intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, only in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells did stimulation of chimeras induce tyrosine phosphorylation that was similar in distribution and intensity to that induced by the endogenous antigen receptor. In β/Ig-α or β/Ig-β cells, stimulation of the chimeras could only induce the strong tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins. In related experiments, truncated co-expressed versions of each chimera which lacked cytoplasmic domains, PDGFRα/- and PDGFRβ/-, were incapable of inducing any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation.2 However, differences were observed in the induction via the chimeras in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells and by the endogenous BCR. Stimulation of α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α failed to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 32 and 40 kDa. Subsequent immunoblotting revealed that the 32-kDa protein was Ig-α (data not shown). The 40-kDa protein appears to be a novel molecule which is associated with the endogenous Ig-α/β heterodimer. ( 3Y. J. Lee and M. R. Clark, manuscript in preparation.) These observations suggest that the chimeras do not utilize the BCR, or associated structures, to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, at least one protein of 120-130 kDa was phosphorylated strongly in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α, weakly in β/Ig-α and β/Ig-β, and not at all by stimulation of the BCR. Since the chimeras are predicted to have molecular masses of approximately this size, we examined if this protein was a chimeric molecule.Figure 2:The pattern of total protein phosphorylation in wild type (WT), β/Ig-α, β/Ig-β, and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells upon stimulation through endogenous receptor or through the chimeras. 10 × 106 cells/sample from each cell line were left unstimulated (us) or were stimulated through the endogenous receptor (Ig) or through the chimeras (Ch). Cells were then lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (FB2). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and then probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody Ab2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Stimulation of Chimeric Heterodimers Induces the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PDGFRβ/Ig-α but Not PDGFRα/Ig-βThe wild type A20 IIA1.6 and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells were treated with PDGF-BB and then stimulated with anti-receptor antibodies as above. Anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Ig-α, or anti-Ig-β immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies of the same specificity in various combinations. Immunoblotting of the Ig-α and Ig-β immunoprecipitates with the same antibodies confirmed that α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells but not wild type cells expressed PDGFRβ/Ig-α (135 kDa) and PDGFRα/Ig-β (125 kDa) (Fig. 3). Although both chimeras were expressed in readily detectable amounts, only PDGFRβ/Ig-α was observed to be phosphorylated following stimulation. The phosphorylation of PDGFRβ/Ig-α was detected in both Ig-α and Ig-β immunoprecipitations, the latter presumably being a result of co-ligation during stimulation. The PDGFRβ/Ig-α chimera co-migrated with a prominent tyrosine phosphoprotein precipitated from the lysates of stimulated cells. No tyrosine phosphoprotein corresponding to the PDGFRα/Ig-β chimera was observed, even on overexposed gels (data not shown). From these results, it is readily apparent that PDGFRβ/Ig-α, but not PDGFRα/Ig-β, was inducibly phosphorylated in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells. However, it is not clear if the differences in phosphorylation observed are due to differences intrinsic to each chain or due to interactions between the chains. To differentiate between these possibilities, we compared PDGFRβ/Ig-α and PDGFR/Ig-β phosphorylation in singly and doubly transfected cells.The Phosphorylation of Ig-β Was Extinguished in the Presence of Ig-αWe first examined the influence of Ig-α on Ig-β phosphorylation by comparing PDGFR/Ig-β phosphorylation in β/Ig-β and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α. The chimeras were precipitated from the lysates of unstimulated cells (us) or cells stimulated with PDGF-BB ligand and anti-PDGFRβ antibody followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 for 1, 2, or 5 min. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4(n = 4). In the β/Ig-β cell line, stimulation of the chimera induced its own phosphorylation, which was maximal at 2 min and transient (Fig. 4, upper panel). In contrast, phosphorylation of PDGFRα/Ig-β was not detected in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells, even though more PDGFRα/Ig-β protein was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4, lower panel). These results suggest that when expressed in isolation, Ig-β can be phosphorylated. However, when ligated in the presence of Ig-α, its own phosphorylation is inhibited. These observations are in accordance with the minimal inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig-β observed following BCR ligation in A20 (Fig. 5C).Figure 4:Ig-β phosphorylation was extinguished to undetectable levels in α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α. 10 × 106 cells/sample of β/Ig-α, β/Ig-β and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α were stimulated through the chimeras as before and then lysed at different time points after stimulation. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a combination of anti-Ig-α and anti-Ig-β antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and blotted with Ab2 (upper panel). The immunoblot was then stripped and reprobed with a combination of anti-Ig-α and anti-Ig-β antibodies (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5:A, Ig-β enhanced Ig-α phosphorylation. 10 × 106 cells/sample of β/Ig-α and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α cells were stimulated through their respective chimeras and then lysed at different time points after stimulation.

The immunoblot was then stripped and reprobed with combination of anti-Ig-α and anti-Ig-β antibodies. B, quantitation of the enhancement of Ig-α phosphorylation by Ig-β. Immunoreactivities from the immunoblot in A were quantitated densiometrically. The specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig-α was calculated as: (immunoreactivity of sample to Ab2/immunoreactivity of sample to anti-Ig-α) × 100. This value was plotted as a function of time. C, the induction of Ig-α and Ig-β tyrosine phosphorylation following BCR stimulation in wild type A20 IIA1.6. 10 × 106 cells/sample of wild type cells were stimulated with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies. Cells were then lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with FB2. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with Ab2. The position of Ig-α and Ig-β, which was determined by probing parallel samples with antibodies to these molecules (data not shown) is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ig-β Enhances the Phosphorylation of Ig-αIn Fig. 3 and 4, it is apparent that only PDGFRβ/Ig-α is tyrosine-phosphorylated following chimera stimulation and its phosphorylation is strong only when co-ligated with PDGFR/Ig-β. To examine this further, we compared the inductive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRβ/Ig-α when expressed alone (β/Ig-α) or with PDGFRα/Ig-β (α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α). The cell lines β/Ig-α and α/Ig-β//β/Ig-α were stimulated via the chimeras, lysed, and then immunoprecipitated with a combination of anti-Ig-α and anti-Ig-β antibodies. Shown in Fig. 5 are the results of a representative experiment (n = 3). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and after transfer to membrane, probed first with Ab2 (Fig. 5A, upper panel), then stripped and reprobed with a combination of anti-Ig-α and Ig-β antibodies (lower panel). There were remarkable differences in both the degree and kinetics of PDGFRβ/Ig-α phosphorylation with and without PDGFR/Ig-β co-ligation. In the absence of PDGFR/Ig-β, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRβ/Ig-α was weak at 1 min, increased to a ma"

Biol. Chem. 269, 27029-27035). The K+ requirement, template-strand specificity, template concentration independence, and involvement of Hoogsteen bonding suggested that the underlying basis of this new type of DNA synthesis arrest site might be an intrastrand tetrahelical structure. However, the arrest site lacks the four G-rich repeats that are a hallmark of previously described intramolecular tetraplexes and contains a number of noncanonical bases that would be expected to greatly destabilize such a structure. Here we report evidence for an unusual K+-dependent intrastrand “cinched” tetraplex. This structure has several unique features including the incorporation of bases other than guanine into the stem of the tetraplex, interaction between loop bases and bases in the flanking region, and base pairing between bases 3′ and 5′ of the tetrahelix-forming region to form a molecular “cinch.” This finding extends the range of sequences capable of tetraplex formation as well as our appreciation of the conformational complexity of the chicken β-globin promoter.

A. 1993; 90: 10013-10017Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have recently described the presence of a strong K+-dependent DNA synthesis arrest site in a G-rich region of the chicken β-globin gene promoter(18.Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the arrest site is shown in boldface type in Fig. 1A. The arrest site is composed of three independent blocks to DNA synthesis (K1, K2, and K3), suggesting three different structural blocks to DNA synthesis. The first block is the strongest, and under some conditions no chain extension is seen beyond this site (Fig. 1B). The characteristics of this region are not consistent with any previously defined category of DNA synthesis arrest site. We have previously shown that the underlying physical basis of this block to DNA synthesis is the formation of a series of intrastrand DNA structures that involve Hoogsteen base interactions between guanines (18.Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that some G-rich sequences associate into higher order structures via guanine tetrad formation. Four DNA strands containing sequences with a single G-rich motif can associate to form an intermolecular tetraplex referred to as G4 DNA(19.Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Sequences containing two G-rich repeats can form G-G hairpins that can then dimerize to form tetraplexes made up of two DNA strands(20.Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and sequences with four G-rich repeats or long G runs (21.Panyutin I.G. Kovalsky O.I. Budowsky E.I. Dickerson R.E. Rikhirev M.E. Lipanov A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) can fold back to form an intrastrand tetraplex. An example of a generic intrastrand tetraplex is shown in Fig. 1C. The properties of the chicken β-globin DNA arrest site are consistent with the formation of an intrastrand tetraplex, in that they are template concentration-independent, are specific to the G-rich strand, are stable at elevated temperatures, require K+, and involve non-Watson-Crick base interactions between guanines. The K+ specificity is particularly compelling since the binding constants of alkali metal ions to the phosphate groups in DNA are known to decrease slightly with increasing metal ion radius, i.e. Li+ ≥ Na+ ≥ K+ ≥ Rb+ ≥ Cs+, and it is therefore difficult to rationalize the K+ specificity in terms of a hairpin or other similar structure. It has been suggested that the K+ specificity for tetraplexes results from some sort of size constraint for which K+ ions are particularly well suited(20.Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding between four DNA strands in an intramolecular tetraplex creates an internal cavity that would exclude large ions such as Cs+. Small ions such as Li+ can fit inside the cavity but are too small to form stable complexes with multiple ligand binding sites within the cavity. It has been claimed that the K+ ion is both small enough to fit inside the cavity and large enough to be able to bridge multiple binding sites within the cavity, thus forming octahedral coordination complexes with O-6 atoms in adjacent tetrads, thereby stabilizing the tetraplex(20.Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). However, the chicken β-globin promoter arrest site sequence G16CG(GGT)2GG lacks the repeated motif normally associated with tetraplexes and contains a number of non-guanine bases that might be expected to reduce the stability of the tetraplex. Data presented here indicate that the chicken β-globin promoter DNA synthesis arrest site does indeed form an intrastrand tetrahelical structure in the presence of K+. However, this structure differs from conventional tetraplexes in a number of important respects. In addition to the incorporation of a number of non-guanine bases into the stem of the tetraplex, the structure is stabilized by interactions between a loop guanine and a guanine in the flanking region and hydrogen bonding between bases in the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions to form a “cinch” that holds one end of the tetraplex together. We suggest that the stabilizing effect is due to duplex formation by the G-rich flanking sequence that effectively closes off the “open” end of the tetraplex. We also demonstrate that in the absence of K+, part of this region is able to form a hairpin containing a mixture of G-G and G-C base pairs. Our findings, together with those that describe the triplex-forming ability of this same sequence, demonstrate the structural complexity of the chicken β-globin promoter. This conformational complexity may have implications for the transcriptional regulation of this gene. Our data also indicate that since the absence of four perfect G-motifs does not preclude tetraplex formation, the number of potential tetrahelix-forming sequences is much broader than previously thought. Our observations demonstrate a clear link between K+-dependent DNA synthesis arrest sites and tetrahelix formation, suggesting that the K+-dependent blocks to DNA synthesis might be a general feature and useful diagnostic property of this class of structures. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 381A synthesizer according to standard procedures and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM, EDTA, pH 8.0 (TE). Oligonucleotides used for sequencing and polymerase chain reaction amplification were used without further purification. Oligonucleotides used for chemical modification experiments were purified by electrophoresis on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Bands containing full-length synthesis products were excised and eluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.3 M NaCl overnight at 55°C. Eluates were filtered through a Durapore filter and precipitated with ethanol. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using 6 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in 10 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM MgCl2 for 30 min at 37°C and then purified by elution from Nensorb columns (DuPont NEN) using 40% ethanol. Eluates were evaporated to dryness, and the residue was resuspended in TE. The arrest site oligonucleotide used in these studies contained the arrest site flanked by 10 bases of sequence at the 5′ end and 25 bases at the 3′ end (5′-GTA CGA ATT CGG GGG GGG GGG GGG GGC GGG TGG TGG TGT GGC TCG AGT CAA CGT AAC ACT TT-3′). Oligonucleotides were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, 2.5 mM MgCl2, or TE at a concentration of approximately 13 nM, overlaid with a drop of mineral oil, and denatured for 5 min at 94°C. Immediately following denaturation, KCl was added to some of the samples to a final concentration of 40 mM. Oligonucleotides were heated for 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C on a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler. Samples were removed from under the oil and placed in screw-capped 1.5-ml tubes. Modification of labeled oligonucleotides with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) ( 1The abbreviations used are: DMSdimethyl sulfateBAAbromoacetaldehyde.) was performed using reagents from a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing kit (Sigma) using a modified version of the manufacturer's procedure. Briefly, the oligonucleotide suspensions were diluted with 180 μl of DMS reaction buffer. One microliter and 0.5 μl of DMS was added to tubes with KCl and without KCl, respectively, and incubated at 18°C for 1 min. dimethyl sulfate bromoacetaldehyde. Bromoacetaldehyde (BAA) modification was carried out as follows. BAA was prepared as described previously(22.Usdin K. Furano A.V. J. Biol.

Labeled oligonucleotides were brought to a volume of 49 μl with distilled H2O and mixed with 1 μl of BAA and then incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The volume was brought to 100 μl with distilled H2O, extracted with 100 μl of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then with 100 μl of ether. Formic acid modification was carried out using a final concentration of 36% formic acid for 40 s at 18°C. Osmium tetroxide (OsO4; Sigma) modification was carried out as described by Palecek(23.Palecek E. Boublikova P. Galazka G. Klysik J. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1987; 6: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were stopped by precipitating the oligonucleotides with 1 ml of butanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and dried under vacuum. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 M piperidine, and the cleavage reaction was carried out for 30 min at 90°C. Reactions were removed from heat and butanol-precipitated. Samples were resuspended in 6-10 μl of distilled H2O to which a volume of Sequenase Stop buffer (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Amersham Corp.) had been added. A portion of the reaction was run on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The image from the gel autoradiograph of the BAA chemical modification assays was captured using a CCD camera, and the relative density of each band on the autoradiograph was determined using NIH Image (24.O'Neill R.R.

Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the chicken β-globin gene promoter contains a G-rich sequence, G16CG(GGT)2GG, that forms a strong DNA synthesis arrest site in the presence of K+(18). The location of this arrest site in the promoter is shown in Fig. 1A. The individual bases in the arrest site are labeled 1-26 with base 1 being the 5′-most guanine in the arrest site (G1). In fact, this arrest site consists of a series of three successive blocks to DNA synthesis, since under some conditions three stops are seen opposite successive T residues in the template (see arrows in Fig. 1A, labeled K1, K2, and K3). Polymerase arrest is significantly more efficient at K1 than at K2 and K3, and under some conditions almost no read-through is seen past K1 ( Fig. 1B). The amount of DNA synthesis arrest by the chicken β-globin promoter is similar to that seen for a run of uninterrupted guanines of the same length ( Fig. 1B). These blocks to DNA synthesis are eliminated if some of the guanines in this sequence are blocked at the N-7 position, suggesting that formation of a series of structures involving non-Watson-Crick base interactions is responsible for DNA synthesis arrest. Arrest of DNA synthesis is independent of the anion present and is not seen in the presence of other cations such as Li+, NH4+, Rb+, or Cs+(18.Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . This K+-specific effect is thus not simply a general ion-screening effect. We have also previously shown that a hairpin-forming sequence, G13C13, of the same length as the β-globin arrest site does not form a K+-specific block to DNA synthesis, ( 2M. N. Weitzmann, K. J. Woodford, and K. Usdin, manuscript in preparation.) suggesting that the K+-specific effect seen in the chicken β-globin promoter is not due to hairpin formation. Neither the pattern of DNA synthesis arrest nor the ion specificity are consistent with the formation of triplexes(2.Baran N. Lapidot A. Manor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previous data showed that the arrest site is found only when the G-rich strand served as template and was independent of template concentration, with the arrest of DNA synthesis being observed even when only femtomoles of template were present(18.Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that unusual intrastrand tetraplex-like structures might form the basis of the blocks to DNA synthesis. The intrastrand nature of these structures was confirmed by the observation that even at very low oligonucleotide concentrations, corresponding to template concentrations at which the blocks to DNA synthesis are still clearly visible, no intermolecular associations of an oligonucleotide containing the arrest site were observed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). However, in gels containing KCl, this oligonucleotide migrates slightly faster than an oligonucleotide containing the complement of the arrest site, suggesting that it can form a more compact intrastrand structure. While the difference in mobility is small, it is reproducible and is consistent with mobility differences that we have found for known tetraplex-forming sequences(26.Usdin K. Woodford K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To examine the K+-dependent structures at single-nucleotide resolution we probed the arrest site oligonucleotide with DMS, OsO4, and BAA. These results are shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:.Figure 2:Densitometric analysis of the bromoacetaldehyde modification of the arrest site oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide was reacted with bromoacetaldehyde in the absence (A) and presence of 40 mM K+ (B) and treated with hot piperidine as described under “Materials and Methods.” The products were resolved on a 20% sequencing gel. The gel was autoradiographed, and the autoradiographic image was captured using a CCD camera and imported to NIH Image for analysis. The C residue in the arrest site is marked with an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Chemical modification reactions carried out under the same conditions as the assay of DNA synthesis arrest produce a result that reflects the sum total of the chemical modification of all the structures in the mixture. From a comparison of the amount of prematurely terminated polynucleotide chains relative to full-length products it is clear that the major molecular species present in the reaction represent those that cause DNA synthesis arrest at K1, with minor contributions from the structures that cause arrest at K2 and K3 (see Fig. 1), and that for all intents and purposes the chemical modification data will reflect the K1 structure. To examine if the cytosine residue at position 17 was base-paired we first reacted the oligonucleotide with BAA and then treated it with formic acid, followed by piperidine. BAA reacts with the N-3 and the N-4 position of unpaired C residues. Treatment of a BAA-modified cytosine with formic acid enhances β-elimination by piperidine. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained for the BAA/formic acid modification of the arrest site oligomer. In the presence of 40 mM KCl, a strong band corresponding to the C17 residue is seen on a sequencing gel. This strong band translates into a tall peak for this residue on densitometric analysis. However, in the absence of KCl the density of this band is much reduced. These data suggest that C17 is modified by BAA in the presence of KCl, i.e. it is unpaired, while in the absence of KCl, it is resistant to BAA modification and is thus involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction. As expected, the C17 residue was not reactive in the presence or absence of K+ when treated only with formic acid (data not shown). To examine the thymidine residues in the arrest site, the arrest site oligonucleotide was modified with OsO4 in the presence of pyridine. Under these conditions, addition to the C-5 and C-6 double bonds of thymidine residues promotes formation of osmium esters that are susceptible to cleavage with hot piperidine. OsO4 is significantly more reactive with unpaired residues and has been used successfully as a probe for DNA conformation junctions and for identifying loop regions in cruciforms ((27.Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and references therein). Our results are shown in Fig. 3. All thymidine residues in the sequence were reactive in the presence and absence of K+, but the intensity of modification of the T residues in the G tract was markedly increased in the presence of 40 mM K+, with T27 being particularly susceptible to OsO4 modification in comparison with T21 and T24. DMS treatment of DNA results in the methylation of G residues at the N-7 position. This modification makes the residue susceptible to cleavage by piperidine. In the absence of KCl, cleavage with piperidine is significantly above background at all positions. G13 is most reactive, followed by G22-G26, G1-G5, and the guanines outside of the arrest site (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, BAA modification indicated some protection of the C17 site, suggesting that it is base-paired. The pattern of slight protection from DMS by bases in the middle of the arrest site, combined with the hyperreactivity of G13, is consistent with the formation of a stem-loop structure with the G13 being in the loop. In such a hairpin, the N-7 of each G in a G-G base pair would be available for DMS modification about 50% of the time. The base that constitutes the hairpin loop, G13, would be the only base that was consistently available for DMS modification and would therefore appear hyperreactive. Since no arrest of DNA synthesis is seen under these conditions, it seems that this hairpin structure does not block DNA synthesis. This is consistent with our observation that a G-C hairpin of the same length also does not block DNA synthesis under these conditions. In contrast, almost complete protection from DMS modification of some residues was seen in the presence of 40 mM KCl (Fig. 3). In the presence of K+, DMS modification at G1 was similar to guanines outside the arrest site, and intermediate reactivity was observed at G2, G4, G7, and G11. DMS hyperreactivity was observed at position G3. The reactivity of the remaining G residues was reduced to close to background levels. Protection of the N-7 position of guanine residues is diagnostic of structures containing G-G Hoogsteen base interactions. The apparent complete protection of some of the guanine residues from DMS modification indicates that they are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions in which they act as N-7 donors almost all of the time. The DMS reactivity pattern observed in 40 mM NaCl was identical to that observed without potassium, illustrating that the DMS protection observed in the presence of K+ is not simply a general cation effect (data not shown). If the structure formed by the wild-type chicken β-globin gene promoter were indeed a tetrahelical structure of some sort, it would suggest that a number of non-guanine bases could be accommodated in the tetrahelix. Our chemical modification experiments with BAA indicated that the cytosine in the structure is unpaired. We addressed the question of the effect of a C residue in a tetraplex stem on structural stability in two other sets of experiments. First, a plasmid bearing the sequence (T2G5)T2G2CG2(T2G5)2 (pCstem) was constructed and tested for its ability to arrest DNA synthesis in vitro. For comparison a plasmid bearing the known tetraplex-forming sequence (T2G5)4 that was constructed in our lab and shown to block DNA synthesis in the presence of K+ was employed. ( 3M. N. Weitzmann, K. J. Woodford, and K. Usdin, unpublished results.) The Cstem sequence has a single cytosine in place of a guanine in the central guanine-tract that comprises one strand of the stem of the tetraplex. The Cstem sequence still formed a block to DNA synthesis at the same position as that observed for the (T2G5)4 sequence (Fig. 4), although the arrest site was significantly weaker than that observed with the (T2G5)4 sequence. This is consistent with our observation of strong protection from DMS modification for the (T2G5)4 sequence, and much weaker protection for the Cstem sequence (data not shown). However, the arrest site in the chicken β-globin locus seems to contain at least three non-G interruptions. The fact that this region still forms such a strong block to DNA synthesis is indicative of the fact that some additional stabilizing factors must be present that compensate in some way for these interruptions. To define those bases important for the structure adopted by the G16CG(GGT)2GG sequence, we constructed a series of plasmids with slight sequence variations in the arrest site. The pattern of DNA synthesis arrest in these variants is shown in Fig. 5. Stopping at K1 was restored only in those variants pM2 and pM3, but the strength of the arrest sites was not duplicated in any of the constructed mutants. Replacement of G1-G4 with TCGA, TGGA, TCGG, and TCCC abolished stopping at K2 (BG6, pM1, pM2, and pM3), indicating that the structure forming the underlying block to synthesis at K2 requires at least the sequence G15CG3TG2. The stop at K3 was not negatively affected by any of these mutations, indicating that the sequence necessary and sufficient for the structure that causes the stop at K3 is G12CG3. This observation is interesting since it demonstrates that even relatively short interrupted G runs can still form blocks to DNA synthesis. With respect to K1, replacing G1-G2 with TC (pM2) reduced the extent of stopping but did not abolish it, suggesting that these residues are important for stability but are not essential in order to get a block at this point. However, replacement of G4 by an A was sufficient to eliminate the stop (BG6), and this effect could be partially alleviated by substitution of a C for the A (pM3). Elimination of T24 changed the pattern of polymerase arrest, illustrating that this residue is not looped out of the structure but is an integral feature of the arrest site. We have previously shown that the chicken β-globin promoter contains a strong composite arrest site for DNA synthesis in vitro(18.Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That DNA synthesis arrest is template concentration-independent and is seen only on one strand suggested that the underlying physical basis was the formation of a series of intrastrand structures. The G-richness of the arrest site (the sequence 5′-G16CG(GGT)2GG-3′ is necessary and sufficient to cause synthesis arrest) suggested that the arrest site might involve G-G base interactions. The K+ specificity suggested that despite its relatively short length, its lack of four clearly identifiable G-repeats, and the presence of a number of non-canonical bases, arrest was due to a series of intrastrand tetrahelical structures of some kind. These conclusions are supported by experiments shown here. In gel electrophoresis of oligonucleotides containing the arrest site in the presence of K+ a high mobility species was observed consistent with intrastrand folding. The fact that a hairpin-forming sequence (G13C13) of the same length as the arrest site produces no K+-dependent block to DNA synthesis suggested that arrest of DNA synthesis by the chicken promoter is not due to hairpin formation. Our chemical modification data are consistent with the major DNA synthesis arrest site being due to the formation of a novel intramolecular tetrahelical structure in the presence of K+. The complete protection of bases G12-G26 from DMS modification indicates that guanine tetrads are involved. The hyperreactivity of G3 suggests that it might be located at the junction between the tetraplex and bases 5′ of the tetraplex, and the OsO4 hyperreactivity of the T just 3′ of the arrest site defines the 3′ limit of bases involved in the structure. A tetraplex of the length defined by the distance between these two bases i.e. 23 would have three loops spaced approximately an equal number of bases apart at around G7-G9, G13-G15, and G19-T21. The DMS reactivity seen for bases G4-G26 is confined to bases G4, G7, and G11. It is hard to fit all of these reactive bases into the loops of the tetraplex, and it seems likely that the loop bases are not in fact DMS-reactive and that reactivity at G4, G7, and G11 is the result of some other structural feature. The lack of reactivity of loop bases may be due to stacking interactions, transient base pairing in or between loops, or binding to K+. The reactivity of G4, G7, and G11 can perhaps be accounted for by placing them adjacent to some of the non-G bases. The reactivity of C17 with BAA and the OsO4 hyperreactivity of T21 and T24 suggest that these bases are all unpaired. The DMS protection of G residues that would be in the same plane as G4, G7, and G11 are consistent with G-G-G base triplets, with the DMS-reactive base acting as an N-7 acceptor but not an N-7 donor. The non-G base adjacent to the reactive G presumably fills the space that would normally be occupied by the fourth G in the tetrad but does not participate in hydrogen bonding. One possible structure that accounts for this pattern of reactivity is shown in Fig. 6B. In this structure G14 is shown as being in a loop on the same side of the structure as the base G3 and G25. Interaction among G3, G14, and G25 in a G-G-G triplet in which G14 and G25 act as N-7 donors would explain the DMS protection of G14 and G25. The pattern of DNA synthesis arrest by sequence variants confirms various details of the structure shown in Fig. 6B. Replacement of G1-G2 with the residues T-C eliminates the second arrest site (K2) and reduces the extent of arrest at K1. Replacement of these residues together with a substitution of A for G4 eliminates the first arrest site altogether. On the other hand, replacement of G4 by a C reduces but does not eliminate this arrest site. This might indicate that G4 is involved in hydrogen bonding in a context in which a C can substitute at least partially. We interpret the hydrogen-bonding contribution made by G3 in terms of a molecular cinch that holds the end of the tetraplex closed, making it more difficult for the polymerase to traverse this region. The fact that a G-to-A substitution at G4 eliminates the stop at K1 and that a C at that position partially restores the stop might be due to the fact that the C permits interaction with the top portion of the stem that, according to this model, becomes folded back, while an A at that position would hydrogen bond to the T in the same end of the stem, providing no stabilization of the fold-back structure. The fact that the ability of all of these variants to block DNA synthesis is considerably less than that of the wild type suggests that bases G1-G2 also make a contribution to the stability of the structure, perhaps as a result of stacking interactions on the single strand or from pairing with bases outside the tetraplex-forming region. The DMS protection of G26 is consistent with a G-G interaction between G26 and G2 in which G2 acts as the N-7 acceptor. Deletion of T24 (Tout in Fig. 5) abolished the original pattern of DNA synthesis arrest and resulted in the formation of two new arrest sites both located at bases 3′ of the original arrest site. This illustrates that T24 plays an important role in the arrest site structure. The pattern of arrest in this mutant is also consistent with the structure shown in Fig. 6B, if it is assumed that formation of a G-G base pair with bases immediately flanking the tetrahelix is an important stabilizing factor. In this case G25 would move into the tetrahelix, and G26 would be available for hydrogen bonding to G3 and G14. However, in the absence of a hydrogen bonding partner for G2 3′ of G26 this interaction might not be stable, resulting in the stop at G26. In spite of the paucity of complete tetrads in the wild type arrest site structure, K+ may still be able to bind to guanines in adjacent rungs of the structure since the internal dimension of the channel might still resemble a more conventional tetraplex. Direct evidence for the ability of non-G bases to be accommodated into the stems of tetraplexes was obtained by comparing a known tetraplex-forming sequence (T2G5)4, and a sequence T2G5T2G2CG2(T2G5)2 that is identical except for a single C residue that disrupts one of the four G-rich repeat motifs. Both the ability to block DNA synthesis and the DMS protection of stem guanines were decreased markedly in the template containing the interrupted motif, but clear evidence for tetraplex formation was still visible. The extent of DNA synthesis arrest by the full-length arrest site is comparable with a pure G tract of the same length as the chicken arrest site (Fig. 1B) despite the presence of three non-G bases. Given the effect of a single interruption in these experiments, the relative efficiency of the chicken β-globin DNA arrest site is thus all the more remarkable. Tetraplex-forming sequences studied to date have not shown evidence for incorporation of bases other than G into the tetraplex stems. In telomere sequences with a (TXAGY)4 repeated motif, the A bases have been shown to reside in the loop of the intramolecular tetraplex, and other variants of this sequence such as (T4G3A)4, (T4AGAG)4, and (T4GAGA)4 were unable to form stable intramolecular tetraplexes(28.Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our observation that a number of non-G bases can be accommodated within the stem of a tetraplex, particularly if additional stability is provided by hydrogen-bonding interactions of flanking G-rich sequences to form a cinch, greatly extends the range of sequences that could potentially form tetrahelical structures that block DNA synthesis. In theory the structure we have described could form in vivo any time that the duplex region containing the sequence becomes unpaired. Replication or transcription would provide such an opportunity, as would local melting of the duplex or formation of the triplex, found in this region(29.Kohwi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In fact a large region of the chicken β-globin gene promoter is known to be susceptible to chemical modification in vivo(30.Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Gelinas R. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31.McGhee J.D. Wood W.I. Dolan M. Engel J.D. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1981; 27: 45-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). One possible role for the hairpin or cinched tetraplex could be in modifying expression of the β-globin gene, with this region perhaps acting as a K+-sensitive switch. The structure may act by binding of conformation-specific factors that affect transcription or by the occlusion of a binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1549973123,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the existence of a heterogeneous population of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores underlies the polarized agonist-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in pancreatic acinar cells (Kasai, H., Li, Y. X., and Miyashita, Y.(1993) Cell 74, 669-677; Thorn, P., Lawrie, A. M., Smith, P. M., Gallacher, D. V., and Petersen, O. H.(1993) Cell 74, 661-668). To investigate whether the apical pole of acinar cells contains Ca2+ stores which are relatively more sensitive to Ins(1,4,5)P3 than those in basolateral areas, we studied Ca2+ handling by Ca2+ stores in individual streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilized cells using the low affinity Ca2+ indicator Magfura-2 and an in situ imaging technique. The uptake of Ca2+ by intracellular Ca2+ stores was ATP-dependent. A steady-state level was reached within 10 min, and the free Ca2+ concentration inside loaded Ca2+ stores was estimated to be 70 μM. Ins(1,4,5)P3 induced Ca2+ release in a dose-dependent, “quantal” fashion. The kinetics of this release were similar to those reported for suspensions of permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells. Interestingly, the permeabilized acinar cells showed no intercellular variation in Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitivity. Although SLO treatment is known to result in a considerable loss of cytosolic factors, permeabilization did not result in a redistribution of zymogen granules, as judged by electron microscope analysis. These results suggest that Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ stores are unlikely to be redistributed as a result of SLO treatment. The effects of Ins(1,4,5)P3 were therefore subsequently studied at the subcellular level. Detailed analysis demonstrated that no regional differences in Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitivity exist in this permeabilized cell system.

https://openalex.org/W2076177159,"We investigated the kinetics of Ca2+ activation of skeletal muscle contraction elicited by the photolysis of caged Ca2+. Previously we showed that partial extraction of the 18-kDa regulatory light chains (RLCs) of myosin decreased the rate of force development and was subsequently increased by ~20% following reconstitution with RLCs (Potter, J. D., Zhao, J. and Pan, B. S.(1992) FASEB J. 6, A1240). We extend here the RLC-extraction study to the complete removal of the RLCs. The complete removal of RLCs was achieved by a combination of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and EDTA treatment followed by reduction of oxidized sulfydryl groups by dithiothreitol. Under these conditions the complete extraction of RLCs was accompanied by the extraction of endogenous troponin C, resulting in the loss of isometric tension. Steady state force was restored to 65-75% following troponin C reconstitution and increased to 75-85% as a result of RLC reincorporation into the fibers.

These results support our earlier findings that the regulatory light chains of myosin play an important role in the kinetics of cross-bridge cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1970806709,"Abstract In the vertebrate retina, a number of proteins involved in signal transduction are known to be N-terminal acylated with the unusual 14 carbon fatty acids 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6. We have explored possible pathways for producing these fatty acids in the frog retina by incubation in vitro with candidate precursor fatty acids bearing radiolabels, including [3H]14:0, [3H]18:1n-9, [3H]18:2n-6, and [3H]18:3n-3. Rod outer segments were prepared from the radiolabeled retinas for analysis of protein-linked fatty acids, and total lipids were extracted from the remaining retinal pellet. Following saponification of extracted lipids, fatty acid phenacyl esters were prepared and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection by continuous scintillation counting. Transducin, whose α-subunit (G) is known to bear N-terminal acyl chains, was extracted from the rod outer segments and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography to detect radiolabeled proteins. G was also subjected to methanolysis, and the resulting fatty acyl methyl esters were analyzed by HPLC. The identities of HPLC peaks coinciding with unsaturated species of both phenacyl esters and methyl esters were confirmed by reanalyzing them after catalytic hydrogenation. The results showed that 14:1n-9 can be derived in the retina from 18:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 from 18:2n-6, most likely by two rounds of β-oxidation, but that neither is produced in detectable amounts from 14:0. Retroconversion of unsaturated 18 carbon fatty acids to the corresponding 14 carbon species showed specificity, in that 18:3n-3 was not converted to 14 carbon fatty acids in detectable amounts. Myristic acid (14:0), 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 were all incorporated into G. A much less efficient incorporation of 18:1n-9 into G was also observed, but no radiolabeling of G was observed in retinas incubated with 18:3n-3. Thus, retroconversion by limited β-oxidation of longer chain unsaturated fatty acids appears to be the most likely metabolic source of the unusual fatty acids found on the N termini of signal transducing proteins in the retina."

The rate of 3-DAG transport in resealed ghosts was a saturable function of 3-DAG concentration with an apparent Km of 3.2 mM and the Vmax of 3.2 μmol/s/ml. D-Glucose inhibited the 3-DAG flux competitively with an apparent KI of 11 mM. Cytochalasin B inhibited this 3-DAG flux in a dose-dependent manner with an estimated KI of 2.4 × 10-7M. Cytochalasin E had no effect. These findings clearly establish that 3-DAG is a good substrate of GLUT1. UV irradiation of purified GLUT1 in liposomes in the presence of 3-DAG produced a significant covalent incorporation of 3-DAG into GLUT1, and 200 mMD-glucose abolished this 3-DAG incorporation. Analyses of trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of 3-DAG-photolabeled GLUT1 revealed that the cleavage products corresponding to the residues 115-183, 256-300, and 301-451 of the GLUT1 sequence were labeled by 3-DAG, demonstrating that not only the C-terminal half but also the N-terminal half of the transmembrane domain participate in the putative substrate channel formation. 3-DAG may be useful in further identification of the amino acid residues that form the substrate channel of this and other members of the facilitative glucose transporter family.

In tissue culture systems, the minimal promoter of this gene was identified, and regions containing positive and negative regulatory activities were dissected from the upstream 3-kilobase sequence using assays for transient reporter activity.

https://openalex.org/W2024420160,"Using the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, 25-RA, we have demonstrated that lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and endogenously synthesized cholesterol are selectively differentiated with respect to their cellular locations. These cells lack sterol-mediated regulation, spontaneously storing large amounts of esterified cholesterol, which turns over with a half-time of 7.5 h. When [3H]cholesterol was provided to the cells in serum to trace cellular cholesterol, the specific activities of cellular free and esterified cholesterol (6238 ± 273 and 5128 ± 277 cpm/μg, respectively) failed to equilibrate, indicating that bulk cellular free cholesterol is isolated from that participating in the cholesteryl ester cycle. Using [3H]acetate to trace the fate of endogenously synthesized cholesterol, a failure of equilibration was also observed (specific activities of free and esterified cholesterol = 280 ± 37 and 458 ± 8 cpm/μg, respectively). The lower specific activity of the precursor indicates that endogenously synthesized cholesterol is preferentially esterified. When cells radiolabeled with [3H]acetate were post-incubated in the absence of radiolabel, the specific activity of the esterified cholesterol pool remained significantly higher than that of the free cholesterol, suggesting that cholesterol derived from hydrolysis of esterified cholesterol is preferentially re-esterified.

https://openalex.org/W1995628984,"We have discovered that the ability of the tumor suppressor protein p53 to bind to the viral large T antigen (TAg) oncogene product is regulated by divalent cations. Both proteins were purified from an insect cell line infected with the appropriate baculovirus expression vector. In a two-site capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, complex formation between the purified proteins is strictly dependent on the addition of specific concentrations of divalent metal ions, notably zinc, copper, cadmium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. In the presence of zinc the pattern of proteolytic fragments obtained when TAg was subjected to proteolysis by endoproteinase Glu-C (V8) was strikingly different, supporting the idea that a conformational change in TAg associated with ion binding is required for it to complex with p53. Monoclonal antibody analysis provides supporting evidence for a conformational change. When TAg was captured onto an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate coated with PAb 419 as opposed to many other anti-TAg antibodies, complex formation was completely independent of the presence of additional divalent cations. Our results suggest that the ability of p53 and TAg to form a stable complex <i>in vitro</i> is dependent upon a regulatory domain residing in the N terminus of TAg, zinc ions or the binding of a specific monoclonal antibody (PAb 419) provoking a conformational change in TAg that facilitates and supports complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2008404830,"Abstract Increased expression of the protein-tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB-2 occurs frequently in human breast and ovarian cancer and causes transformation in experimental systems. Control of transcription of the erbB-2 gene is an important determinant of receptor expression. Within the human erbB-2 promoter, a 100-base pair (bp) region 5′ to the TATA box enhances transcription 200-fold. Two palindromes present in this 100-bp region are important for both positive and negative transcriptional control. A nuclear palindrome binding protein (PBP) has been purified to near homogeneity using ion-exchange, DNA-affinity, and gel filtration chromatography. PBP is a heterodimer consisting of a 69-kDa α subunit that binds DNA and a 60-kDa β subunit that appears to enhance subunit binding. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that PBP binds to the half-site of each palindrome with the core recognition sequence TGGGAG. By DNA binding specificity and lack of immunological cross-reactivity, PBP is distinct from NF-κB and Ikaros, two proteins with related DNA binding specificities. PBP is proposed to be an important regulator of transcription of the erbB-2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1997483403,"As shown previously, mutants of the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line that resist agonist-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase have elevated levels of a 68-kDa protein (designated p68), suggesting a possible relationship between p68 and the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. In the present study, cDNA cloning and sequencing were used to identify p68 as mouse transketolase. Cells overexpressing p68 exhibited a 17.4-fold increase in transketolase enzymatic activity relative to parental Y1 cells and a 28-fold amplification of the transketolase gene as determined by Southern blot hybridization analysis. Using fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis, the transketolase gene was mapped to mouse chromosome 16B1 and to human chromosome 3p21.2. Transketolase gene amplification was associated with telomeric fusion of the chromosome 16 pair together with the appearance of multiple copies of the transketolase gene throughout a different chromosome. The relationship between overexpression of transketolase and desensitization resistance was evaluated in somatic cell hybrids formed between a desensitization-resistant adrenal cell line and a desensitization-sensitive rat glial cell line. In these hybrids, transketolase overexpression behaved dominantly, whereas desensitization resistance behaved recessively. These results dissociate the desensitization resistance phenotype from overexpression of transketolase and suggest that desensitization resistance may have resulted from disruption of an essential regulatory gene in conjunction with the amplification event."
https://openalex.org/W1999186832,"The p120 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a negative regulator of Ras, which has a central role in signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation. p120 GAP accelerates the conversion of activated Ras-GTP to its inactive form, Ras-GDP, thereby inhibiting mitogenic signaling. To examine potential contributions of p120 N-terminal sequences to regulation of its C-terminal catalytic domain, we constructed deletion mutants lacking defined regions, including the variable hydrophobic region as well as the Src homology 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) domains. These mutant proteins were expressed in infected Sf9 insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses and assayed in vitro for their ability to stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of purified Ras. While deletion of the variable hydrophobic region had no effect on p120 GAP activity, deletion of the entire SH2/SH3/SH2 region severely impaired catalytic activity toward Ras. Deletion of individual SH2 and SH3 domains within this region partially inhibited p120 GAP activity. Moreover, p120 N-terminal sequences enhanced the Ras GTPase-stimulating activity of the neurofibromin GAP-related domain.
