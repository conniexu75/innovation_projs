https://openalex.org/W1587157283,"Abstract Since most previous studies on brain mitochondria have used a relatively crude preparation, a method was developed for preparing a purified mitochondrial fraction from rat brain cerebral cortex utilizing a rapid simple discontinuous Ficoll density gradient procedure. This mitochondrial preparation was shown by electron microscopy and enzymatic assay to be (a) free from contamination by synaptosomes or other membranous fragments and (b) predominantly of neuroglial origin. These mitochondria exhibited good respiratory control and respiratory rates with various substrates (pyruvate g succinate g glutamate g citrate, acetylcarnitine, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, α-glycerophosphate), comparable with other mammalian mitochondria. Pyruvate plus malate was oxidized at rates higher than any of the other substrates tested and consistently showed respiratory control ratios greater than seven. The mitochondria were further characterized with respect to nicotinamide and adenine nucleotide content, and cytochrome complement and content. The ratios of cytochrome b:c1:c:a:a3 were 0.6:0.9:1.7:1:0.6, similar to those observed in other mammalian mitochondria. As has been noted previously with brain preparations, increasing the K+ in the incubation medium caused an increase in the oxygen uptake with all the above substrates (except α-glycerophosphate). This effect was studied in more detail with pyruvate plus malate as substrate. Half-maximal respiration rates were obtained with 10 to 20 mm K+ in both ADP and valinomycin-stimulated mitochondria. The effect of K+ was not directly associated with an activation of electron transport per se, but rather with an increase in the availability of substrate for oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1509553808,"Abstract The heat-stable factor required for fatty acid, hydrocarbon, and drug hydroxylation in a reconstituted liver microsomal enzyme system containing hemoprotein P-450 has been identified as phosphatidylcholine. Synthetically prepared dioleoylglyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine was fully active when substituted for the microsomal factor, as judged by the rate of laurate, hexane, octane, ethylmorphine, or benzphetamine hydroxylation in the presence of TPNH, oxygen, hemoprotein P-450, and TPNH-hemoprotein P-450 reductase. Various acyl derivatives of glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine showed, at their optimal concentrations, the following increasing order of activity with benzphetamine as the substrate: distearoyl; a mixture of 1-monopalmitoyl and 1-monostearoyl; dipalmitoyl; dioleoyl; and a mixture of dilauroyl and monolauroyl. Electron transfer from TPNH to hemoprotein P-450, as determined from the carbon monoxide reduced difference spectrum under anaerobic conditions, was completely dependent upon the presence of microsomal lipid. Stopped flow measurements showed that the rate of electron transfer was biphasic in the presence of the lipid, with a rapid phase largely completed in less than 1 sec and having a first order rate constant of about 100 min-1, followed by a slow phase having a first order rate constant of about 6 min-1, but only the slow rate could be detected in the absence of the lipid. Under similar conditions, but with air as the gas phase, the turnover number (moles of benzphetamine hydroxylated per mole of hemoprotein P-450) was 22 min-1. These results show that the lipid is essential for the enzymatic reduction of hemoprotein P-450 and that only the rapid phase of the reaction is adequate to support the observed rate of substrate hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1985848644,"Mouse lymphoma cells in culture which are killed by adrenal steroids contain specific cortisol receptors that may be involved in the initial events of hormone action. The similarity of these receptors to those in hepatoma tissue culture cells, where adrenal steroids induce tyrosine aminotransferase, suggests that certain aspects of steroid action are similar in the two systems. In three steroid-resistant lymphoma cell populations specific binding was less than in the parent lines, suggesting that conversion to steroid resistance may be associated with changes in specific steroid binding."
https://openalex.org/W1495374061,"A NADH-hydroxypyruvate reductase was located in peroxisomes isolated from spinach leaves. The enzyme was precipitated by between 15 to 23 g of (NH4)2SO4 per 100 ml and had a pH optimum at 6.4. It was also active with NADPH at a pH optimum of 5.1, and the NADH:NADPH ratio of maximum activity was about 13:1. The reductase with either NADH or NADPH was about 4.3-fold more active with hydroxypyruvate than with glyoxylate. Through separation of proteins by electrofocusing, by Sephadex G200 column chromatography, and by starch gel and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was shown that a single peroxisomal protein catalyzed these reactions. The enzymic activity with NADH was not significantly affected by salts, except for nitrate, which was inhibitory. Activity with NADPH was inhibited by salts. A NADPH-glyoxylate reductase was located in the chloroplasts, which were separated from other particles by isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It reduced glyoxylate 16-fold faster than hydroxypyruvate and was highly specific for NADPH. The enzyme was precipitated by between 30 to 45 g of (NH4)2SO4 per 100 ml and had a pH optimum of 6.2. Maximum activity per g of tissue of the chloroplast reductase, as measured with NADPH and glyoxylate, was about 1/20 that of the peroxisomal enzyme measured with NADH and hydroxypyruvate. Peroxisomes may function for disposal of excess reducing equivalents from photosynthesis via a glycolate-glyoxylate shuttle. Excess NADPH formed in the chloroplasts is consumed in the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate, which is then oxidized in the peroxisome. Glyoxylate may return to the chloroplast to complete the cycle or be further metabolized in the peroxisomes. The peroxisomal reductase functions in this latter process for the reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate."

The bacterial reductase, which has higher activity with DPNH than with TPNH, may be replaced by highly purified ferredoxin reductase from spinach, for which TPNH is the preferred cofactor. The unlike an enzyme of similar function occurring in liver microsomes, contains no cytochrome P-450. The enzyme is of high molecular weight (estimated as about 2 x 106 by chromatography on a calibrated agarose column), but appears to dissociate into smaller units in the presence of dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol. Iron was determined by emission spectroscopy to be present in the amount of 4.2 g atoms/2 x 106 g of protein, whereas only traces of FAD and heme were found. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed signals typical of rhombic iron (g = 4.3), a free radical (g = 2.003), and a labile sulfide-containing non-heme iron protein (g = 1.94), with a minor component at 2.03), but the significance of these resonances with respect to the catalytic function of the iron is not yet known. In the presence of rubredoxin, a rubredoxin reductase, and the ω-hydroxylase, the hydroxylation of octane was shown to yield n-octanol in equimolar amount to the amounts of TPNH and molecular oxygen consumed. This stoichiometry corresponds to that expected of a monooxygenase or mixed function oxidase, as follows: RCH3 + O2 + D(T)PNH + H+ → RCH2OH + D(T)PN+ + H2O. In addition to octane, which is the most active substrate, other n-alkanes from C6 to C14, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, dimethylhexane, fatty acids from C6 to C12, and certain glyceride derivatives of fatty acids all undergo hydroxylation as judged by the substrate-dependent disappearance of TPNH in the complete enzyme system. The ω-hydroxylase is extensively inhibited by cyanide and 8-hydroxyquinoline. Cyanide was shown to act as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to laurate and to have a Ki of 3.1 x 10-4m. The Km values of hexanoate, heptanoate, and nonanoate are 2.2 x 10-2m, 5.2 x 10-3m, and 6.9 x 10-4m, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1517274513,"Abstract Enzymic transformation of testosterone to the potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, has been shown by incubation of testosterone-4-14C with microsomal preparations of human neonatal foreskin. The activity was stimulated by NADPH but not by NADH, and the reaction proceeded optimally at pH 5.6. Formation of 5α-androstanediol from 5α-dihydrotestosterone was also shown after longer incubation. Purified nuclear preparations of human skin seemed to possess little or no testosterone 5α-reductase activity, in contrast to similar preparations of rat prostate. The testosterone 5α-reductase in skin microsomes exhibited a Km of 1.1 x 10-6 for testosterone. A number of steroids were found to inhibit the 5α-reduction of testosterone. Among these the most potent inhibitor was progesterone, which was converted into 5α-pregnane-3,20-dione, and competed effectively with testosterone for the active site of the enzyme. The Ki of progesterone was approximately 0.7 x 10-6 m, indicating a slightly greater affinity of this steroid for the 5α-reductase than that of testosterone. Other potent inhibitors tested were androstenedione and deoxycorticosterone, while estradiol, hydrocortisone, and the antiandrogen, testololactone, had no inhibitory effect. The necessary structural characteristics of an effective inhibitor seem to be a Δ4-3-keto structure, a 17β but not 17α substituent, and no modification or other substitutions in the steroid nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1580309617,"Abstract The presence of a nonspecific NADPH-linked aldehyde reductase (alcohol:NADP oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.2) was observed in various areas of bovine brain in vitro. In the midbrain, hypothalamus, and pons, the rate of NADPH oxidation, with p-nitrobenzaldehyde as substrate, was approximately 4.0 nmoles per min per mg of protein; but somewhat lower values were obtained when other regions of the brain were studied. It was found that the enzyme was localized primarily in the soluble supernatant fraction of rat brain homogenates. The enzyme from bovine brain was purified approximately 120-fold and was found to catalyze the reduction of a number of aldehydes, including substituted benzaldehydes, substituted phenylacetaldehydes, and some long chain aliphatic aldehydes. Short chain aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde or propionaldehyde were not reduced by the enzyme. With p-nitrobenzaldehyde as substrate, NADPH, but not NADH, was oxidized by bovine brain aldehyde reductase. The pH optimum for the enzyme was found to be 6.75 for aldehyde reduction, whereas the rate of oxidation of p-hydroxyphenylethanol, with NADP as cosubstrate, was optimal at pH 9.7. Km values for various substrates ranged from 3.7 x 10-6 m to 1.4 x 10-4 m. Km values for various substituted benzaldehydes were correlated with the electropositive nature of the carbonyl carbon atom by the Hammet σ-ρ relationship. Oxidation of NADPH by the partially purified enzyme was inhibited approximately 50% by 0.1 mm concentrations of amytal, phenobarbital, or chlorpromazine. The enzyme activity was not altered, however, by 10 mm pyrazole."

Norepinephrine uniformly depressed all sensitive cells. Acetylcholine caused both muscarinic depression and nicotinic excitation which were antagonized by atropine and dihydro-beta-erythroidine, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that norepinephrine and acetylcholine are directly involved in controlling the release of antidiuretic hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1532760517,"Abstract In the presence of rat liver microsomes and NADPH n-1-octene, n-4-octene and 3-ethyl-2-pentene were converted to the glycols with no trace of epoxides. Increased substitution of ethylenic hydrogen atoms by alkyl groups was found to retard the rate of biological oxidation but to enhance that of epoxidation by perbenzoic acid in chloroform. Microsomes without cofactors hydrolyzed the monosubstituted ethylene oxide more rapidly than the di- or trisubstituted derivatives. The relative rates were in the opposite order of those predicted for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The epoxides were found capable of inhibiting epoxide hydrolase. Incubation of microsomes and NADPH with 1 mm n-1-octene in the presence of 20 mm 4,5-epoxy-n-octane yielded both 1,2-epoxy-n-octane and n-octane-1,2-diol. However, in the presence of 20 mm 1,2-epoxy-n-octane, 1 mm n-4-octene yielded 4,5-epoxy-n-octane but no n-octane-4,5-diol. The complete replacement of n-octane-4,5-diol by 4,5-epoxy-n-octane in the presence of the inhibitor indicates that the epoxide is an obligatory intermediate in the conversion of n-4-octene to the glycol."
https://openalex.org/W1593908950,"Abstract Synthesis of the messenger RNA that codes for tyrosine α-ketoglutarate transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxo-glutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) was blocked by actinomycin and its stability was determined in cultured hepatoma cells by measuring rates of transaminase synthesis. By this criterion the transaminase messenger RNA is degraded with a half-life of 2 to 3 hours in both H-35 and HTC cell lines; this rate is not changed by hydrocortisone. Transaminase synthesis is decelerated by high and low concentrations of actinomycin; high concentrations of this antibiotic block transaminase degradation as well. At low concentrations of actinomycin, transaminase induction by hydrocortisone is blocked but induction by insulin is unaffected for a period of time consistent with messenger stability. Preliminary treatment with hydrocortisone primes the cells to respond to insulin with a rapid increase in enzyme, but preliminary treatment with insulin does not alter the response to hydrocortisone. With the use of experimentally derived rates of degradation of both the transaminase and its messenger RNA, a mathematical model was developed which satisfactorily predicts kinetic behavior of the enzyme level upon addition and withdrawal of inducing hormones. The data are consistent with the conclusion that hydrocortisone acts transcriptionally while insulin acts on some posttranscriptional or translational step in enzyme synthesis. We find no indication of posttranscriptional mechanisms in the steroid-mediated induction. A discussion of the mathematical model used is appended."
https://openalex.org/W2029388560,"Prolonged consumption of ethanol enhances the activities of the hepatic microsomal ethanol oxidizing system and of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, but not of catalase. The oxidase-catalase system is not part of the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system since catalase inhibitors dissociate ethanol oxidation by the two pathways. Enhanced reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity may contribute to liver injury, possibly by favoring lipoperoxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1965892920,"A cell line derived from normal, adult rat liver has been established; the cells are similar to hepatocytes, as shown by electron microscopy. The addition of dexamethasone to the culture medium induced a three- to sixfold increase in the specific activity of tyrosine alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase; this increase was inhibited by the simultaneous addition of cycloheximide or actinomycin D. The latter, when added to cells given prior treatment with dexamethasone, further enhanced the transaminase activity. Contact-inhibited cells showed a lower response to dexamethasone than exponentially growing cells."

https://openalex.org/W1556406069,"Abstract T4 thioredoxin was purified from an extract of Escherichia coli B infected from T4 am 122. The protein was obtained in essentially pure form as judged from ultracentrifugation data, gel electrophoresis, and from the stoichiometry of its reaction with NADPH. The molecular weight was 10,400 as measured by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. This compares with a molecular weight of 11,700 for the host Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Amino acid analyses showed the presence of 88 to 89 amino acid residues including all common amino acids except tryptophan. The composition differs markedly from that of E. coli thioredoxin. In its oxidized form, T4 thioredoxin contains a single disulfide bridge which is reduced by NADPH in the presence of E. coli thioredoxin reductase. The oxidation-reduction potential of the couple T4 thioredoxin-S2/T4 thioredoxin-(SH)2 was -0.23 volt (pH 7.0, 20°), which is a significantly higher value than that of E. coli thioredoxin (-0.26 volt). Two phage mutants which failed to induce T4 thioredoxin activity were isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1543641272,"Abstract Microsomal enzymes of rat liver catalyze the oxidative demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol. Demethylation requires oxygen and both reduced and oxidized pyridine nucleotides. Aerobic incubation of 30,31-14C-4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol with a microsomal preparation depleted of NAD+ and containing an NADPH-generating system yields oxidative attack of substrate but no release of 14CO2. Following incubation, sterols are extracted from the microsomal protein with acetone. Only one oxygenated sterol is formed in high yield. Homogeneity and purity of the new sterol have been established by thin layer chromatography on plates of silica gel. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry have been used to identify the new sterol as 3β-hydroxy-4β-methyl-5α-cholest-7-ene-4α-carboxylic acid. Isolation and identification of the 4α-carboxylic acid demonstrates that the 4α-methyl group of the 4,4-dimethyl sterol may be attacked initially. Furthermore, the rates of 4α-carboxylic acid formation and decarboxylation (NAD+-dependent) are sufficient to account for the over-all rate of demethylation. Demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol and 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol is inhibited similarly by additions of cyanide, cytochrome c, glycolithocholate, and dithiothreitol; prior treatment of the enzyme system with trypsin and heat affected the rates similarly: dietary cholestyramine enhanced the amount of demethylation of each sterol to the same extent. It is clear now that the 4α-methyl group of both sterol substrates is oxidatively attacked; oxidation of each substrate requires the same cofactors; thus, the similar behavior of the enzyme system under the above treatments is consistent with the conclusion that the same enzymic system may catalyze the removal of the 4α-methyl group from both the 4,4-dimethyl and 4α-monomethyl sterol substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1582590535,"Abstract Proof is presented in this paper for the formation of acyclic and cyclic carotenes from phytoene-14C by soluble extracts of plastids obtained from fruit of different genetic selections of the tomato. The carotenes biosynthesized from phytoene-14C and the tomato selections used were the following: (a) cis- and trans-phytofluenes, neurosporene, neolycopene, lycopene, and ζ- and γ-carotenes, red tomato fruit plastids; (b) cis- and trans-phytofluenes, neurosporene, lycopene, and ζ-, δ-, γ-, α-, and β-carotenes, Hi-δ tomato fruit plastids; (c) cis- and trans-phytofluenes, neurosporene, lycopene, γ- and β-carotenes, Hi-β tomato fruit plastids, and (d) cis- and trans-phytofluenes, prolycopene, proneurosporene, lycopene, and β- and ζ-carotenes, Golden Jubilee variety tomato fruit plastids. Experimental evidence for the conversion of lycopene-15,15'-3H to mono- and dicyclic carotenes by a soluble enzyme system obtained from red tomato fruit plastids is also presented in this paper. Proof for the formation of the above carotenes from radioactive phytoene was obtained by cochromatography with authentic nonradioactive carotenes on an alumina chromatographic column. A close correspondence between radioactivity and absorbance for each carotene was observed. Further proof for the formation of acyclic and cyclic carotenes from radioactive phytoene was obtained by gas-liquid chromatography of the hydrogenated products. Coincidence between mass and radioactivity was also observed. The conversion of phytoene to phytofluene by the tomato enzyme systems appears to be dependent upon the presence of NADP, whereas the conversion of the latter compound to lycopene appears to require FAD and Mn++. The formation of lycopene is also increased in the presence of Mg++ and dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W2395683909,"Two possible sources for the carbonate in the calcium carbonate coral skeleton are (a) soluble carbonates from seawater and (b) carbon dioxide produced in metabolism by the living coral tissue. Although radioisotopic tracer experiments have established that carbonate from sea-water is incorporated into the skeleton by many corals1–3, evidence for incorporation of metabolic CO2 into the skeleton is much less direct. Goreau1 found that calcification rates measured by incorporation of radioactive carbonate from seawater were usually lower than those measured by using radioactive calcium; he proposed that the labelled carbonate might be diluted by unlabelled carbonate in coral tissue. In addition, findings that the ratios of 13C to 12C and of 18O to 16O in seawater differ from those in coral skeleton suggest that not all of the skeletal carbonate originates directly from carbonate in seawater4–7. To examine further the possibility that some skeletal carbonate originates from metabolic CO2, I fed 14C-labelled mouse tissue to small individuals of the coral Fungia scutaria, a solitary polyp containing symbiotic algae."

https://openalex.org/W1482593070,"Abstract The kinetic properties of spinach leaf glyoxylic acid reductase have been evaluated. In the presence of pyridine nucleotides, the enzyme catalyzes the reversible reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate and hydroxypyruvate to d(-)-glycerate. The pH optima of the reductive reactions are between 6.0 and 6.5; the pH optima of the oxidative reactions are at 8.9. The enzyme is competitively inhibited by pyruvate, 3-mercaptopyruvate, and 3-fluoropyruvate and noncompetitively inhibited by dihydroxyfumarate. A spectral shift in protein absorbance, from 280 mµ to 270 mµ, is associated with the dihydroxyfumarate inhibition. Ternary rate equations of the enzyme and a degraded form of the enzyme have been calculated and compared. Specific changes in the Michaelis constant for pyridine nucleotides suggest that the degraded form has undergone structural modifications in the pyridine nucleotide binding site. All forms of the enzyme are anion-regulated in the direction of d(-)-glycerate or glycolate formation. Phosphate stimulates hydroxypyruvate reduction at all anion concentrations; chloride, bromide, sulfate, and nitrate stimulate at low concentrations but inhibit at high. The anion effects are pH-dependent and are competitive with hydroxypyruvate or glyoxylate. They are noncompetitive with reduced pyridine nucleotides. Evidence is presented which suggests that a ligand-induced conformational change is important in the functioning of anion effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1579211966,"Abstract The stereochemistry and mechanisms of hydrogen-transfer reactions catalyzed by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase have been investigated. In the presence of specific tritium-labeled pyridine nucleotides, the Pseudomonas transhydrogenase is able to catalyse a direct hydrogen transfer between the reduced and the oxidized pyridine nucleotides. The reduction of DPN+ involved the 4B atom of the TPNH; the 2'-AMP-activated reduction of TPN+ results in the removal of the 4B atom of the pyridine ring of DPNH. The reduced products of the respective reactions all have tritium in the 4B position. The mechanism of transfer involves no exchange of hydrogen with the medium, and this phenomenon is not altered by changes of temperature. The Pseudomonas transhydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of the thionicotinamide nucleotide analogue of DPN with stereospecificity exhibited equivalent to that of the reaction with the natural pyridine nucleotides. Indirect evidence indicates that FAD participates in the hydrogen transfer reaction. Exchange of the hydrogen with the medium can be induced in a 1 m urea medium. Available spectral evidence suggests the possibility that conformational changes of the transhydrogenase occurs in 1 m urea."

Citrate and isocitrate are equally effective as inhibitors of the enzymes. The enzymes are allosterically inhibited by their substrates, α-ketoglutarate and ammonia, in a highly cooperative manner. NADP+, NADPH, and P-enolpyruvate antagonize substrate inhibition. These activators also function as multivalent modulators in releasing the enzyme from inhibition by citrate. Control of the enzyme activity is unidirectionally oriented such that it is the reductive amination that is effectively controlled. The purified glutamic dehydrogenases have a molecular weight of 225,000 daltons. They are susceptible to inactivation by hydrodynamic shear in sucrose density gradients at alkaline pH levels. Inactivation by sedimentation can be prevented by bound activators. Inactivation and dissociation of the enzyme are related phenomena. Synthesis of the glutamic dehydrogenases can be repressed by addition of glucose to the growth medium. Glutamate acts as an inducer. NADP-specific isocitric dehydrogenase present in these fungi responds in the opposite manner to the metabolism of glucose and glutamate."

The experiments reported in this paper indicate that photoinactivation occurs only when the dye is bound to the TPN binding site of the enzyme. Since the photoinactivation is correlated to the specific oxidation of only 2 residues of histidine, it can be assumed that this amino acid is located at the TPN binding site of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. These results are a new application of the technique of active site-specific photooxidation."

https://openalex.org/W1487085712,"An extract of Clostridium sticklandii converts d - and l -ornithine by a number of enzymatic steps to 2-amino-4-ketopentanoic acid. Except for an initial conversion of l - to d -ornithine, all subsequent changes appear to occur at the distal amino group. In the first of these reactions, which requires the participation of vitamin B12 coenzyme, the C5-amino group of d -ornithine moves to C4 to form one of the epimeric forms of the corresponding 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid. The second enzymatic step, which requires the participation of pyridoxal phosphate, most probably entails inversion of the C4-amino group. The resulting 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid has been purified by chromatography on Dowex 50 and studied by nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy, by measurement of optical rotation, and by pH titration. In the third reaction, a pyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenase brings about an oxidative deamination of the amino group at C4 to yield 2-amino-4-ketopentanoic acid. This dehydrogenase has been purified about 44-fold from extracts of C. sticklandii. Both DPN+ and TPN+ can function as hydrogen acceptors. The reaction product has been purified and identified as 2-amino-4-ketopentanoic acid. The enzyme is highly specific for 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid. No cofactors appear to be necessary. Optimum activity is obtained at a pH of about 8.8. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer appears to be slightly inhibitory. The equilibrium strongly favors the oxidized pyridine nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1589517951,"Abstract Crystalline pigeon liver malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.40) catalyzes the slow, magnesium-dependent reduction of oxalacetate and conversion of l-malate to l-lactate in the presence of TPNH and TPN, respectively, with TPN acting in a catalytic manner. Pyruvate reductase activity associated with this enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.5 to 6.8 and a Michaelis constant of 5.52 mm for pyruvate. The activity ratio of oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate, reduction of pyruvate, and reduction of oxalacetate catalyzed by the enzyme is approximately 7.3:0.31:1. Titration of 4 sulfhydryl groups by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) induced a reversible loss of malic enzyme activity and an increase in pyruvate reductase activity, while the oxalacetate reductase activity remained constant. The modified enzyme exhibited a new activity ratio of 0.3:0.6:1. These observations are consistent with both reductases being auxiliary reactions that could be expected from a sequential, ordered mechanism with oxalacetate as the enzyme-bound intermediate in a central complex. It is postulated that alteration of thiol groups led to a reversible blockage of the CO2 step, which was responsible for the observed changes in the diverse activities of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1509211834,"Abstract Guanylates (GTP, GDP, and GMP), short chain acyl-CoA derivatives; ATP, and ADP, were found to be allosteric activators of NAD-specific glutamic dehydrogenases isolated from a unique group of fungi, the Oomycetes. Long chain acyl-CoA derivatives and AMP were very strong inhibitors of the enzyme. Pythium glutamic dehydrogenase, in particular, was shown to be sensitive to control by energy charge. A total of five activators have now been discovered. These are NADP+, P-enolpyruvate, short chain acyl-CoA derivatives, GTP, and ATP. These activators functioned cumulatively to antagonize the effects of the inhibitors, citrate, AMP, and long chain acyl-CoA derivatives. The activators acted as unidirectional stimulants of the biosynthetic reaction, while some of them inhibited the catabolic reaction unidirectionally. These glutamic dehydrogenases are genetically controlled. They are subjected to marked catabolic repression and inducible by glutamate. The substrates (ammonia and α-ketoglutarate) of the biosynthetic reaction are allosteric inhibitors. The activators modulated the enzyme against allosteric inhibition by its substrates. This multivalent control has been explained as a mechanism by which the enzyme effects its biosynthetic and cataboilc roles in amphibolic reactions of the citric acid cycle. A remarkable correlation has been made between lysine biosynthesis and allosteric control mechanisms among members of the Phycomycetes. The distribution of the two pathways of lysine biosynthesis among these simple fungi parallels the only two different forms of allosteric controls of NAD-specific glutamic dehydrogenases elucidated for all major orders of the Phycomycetes studied to date."
https://openalex.org/W1510924013,"Abstract Kinetic studies on Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase yield the following information. In the presence of 5 x 10-4 m 2'-AMP the initial velocity experiments for both the TPNH-(TN)DPN+ (oxidized thionicotinamide DPN) and DPNH-(TN)DPN+ reactions are consistent with a bi bi catalytic reaction mechanism. DPN+ inhibition of the DPNH-(TN)DPN+ reaction is the type expected for this mechanism. When 2'-AMP is not included in the TPNH-(TN)DPN+ system the reaction velocity shows a second order dependence on TPNH, but a first order dependence on (TN)DPN+. The maximum velocity for the TPNH-(TN)DPN+ system is apparently the same in the presence as in the absence of 5 x 10-4 m 2'-AMP. However, in the presence of 5 x 10-4 m 2'-AMP the reaction velocity shows a first order dependence on both substrates. These experiments show that both TPNH and 2'-AMP are activators of the enzyme. In the DPNH-(TN)DPN+ reaction the velocity shows a first order dependence on both substrates and a second order dependence on 2'-AMP. 2'-AMP causes a decrease in the apparent Michaelis constant for DPNH and an increase in the apparent maximum velocity. If the mechanism is assumed to be ping-pong bi bi then the experiments indicate that 2'-AMP increases the rates of steps in the portion of the reaction sequence involving reduction of the enzyme by DPNH. Experiments indicate that TPN+ does not have the same capacity for activation as do TPNH and 2'-AMP. In contrast to DPN+, TPN+ at low concentrations is competitive with DPNH in the DPNH-(TN)DPN+ reaction. Thus failure of the transhydrogenase to catalyze the reaction between DPNH and TPN+ can be explained by the failure of TPN+ to cause full activation, making DPNH a less effective substrate, and also by formation by TPN+ of a dead end complex with enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1530530739,"Abstract Tritium from NADP3H was incorporated into the fatty acids (mainly palmitic acid) synthesized from acetyl and malonyl coenzyme A by purified pigeon and rat liver fatty acid synthetases. The quantity of tritium incorporated into the product was nearly the same from the A and B forms of NADP3H. These compounds were prepared from tritiated isocitric and glutamic acids, respectively. The quantity of radioactivity incorporated into fatty acids per mole of NADPH oxidized was slightly less than half the quantity of radioactivity present per mole of isocitric or glutamic acid. On the assumption that the two types of reduction in fatty acid synthesis (β-ketoacyl-enzyme and α,β-unsaturated acyl-enzyme) proceed stereospecifically, as do all other pyridine nucleotide dehydrogenase reactions, these results indicate that one reduction proceeds by the transfer of hydrogen from the A side of position 4 of the pyridine ring of NADPH, and the other reduction proceeds by transfer from the B side. This deduction was confirmed by the performance of partial reactions with model substrates. When acetoacetyl coenzyme A or S-acetoacetyl-N-acetylcysteamine was reduced to the β-hydroxybutyryl ester with fatty acid synthetase and tritiated NADPH, tritium was incorporated into the product only from the B form of the coenzyme. When S-crotonyl-N-acetylcysteamine was similarly reduced to the butyryl ester, tritium was incorporated into product only from the A form of NADPH. Thus, the reduction of β-ketoacyl-enzyme in fatty acid synthesis results in the transfer of hydrogen from the B side of NADPH, and the reduction of α,β-unsaturated acyl-enzyme results in the transfer of hydrogen from the A side of NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1548753624,"Abstract Tyrosine aminotransferase in adrenalectomized male rat liver was pulse labeled with uniformly labeled 14C-l-leucine. Biopsy samples from livers of control and hormone-treated animals were taken at intervals up to 8 hours following radioactive leucine administration. The specific radioactivity of tyrosine aminotransferase was measured by precipitating the enzyme with rabbit anti-tyrosine aminotransferase antiserum. Under basal conditions the half-time (t½) of tyrosine amino-transferase was determined to be 6.1 hours. This value is about 3½ times slower than inactivation of tyrosine amino-transferase following hormone induction (t½ = 1.7 hours). The apparent half-time of tyrosine aminotransferase during induction with triamcinolone was 11.7 hours. Total soluble liver protein had a t½ of about 75 to 84 hours when determined in a double labeling experiment with 14C-guanido-labeled l-arginine and 3H-l-leucine, respectively. Possible factors responsible for the relatively rapid rate of tyrosine aminotransferase turnover and its apparent alteration during and following hormone administration are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1574548264,"Abstract The reaction catalyzed by purified rat liver cytosol tyrosine aminotransferase (l-tyrosine + 2 oxoglutarate = p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + l-glutamate, EC 2.6.1.5) has been analyzed with regard to product inhibition and combination with each of its rate-limiting substrates by the Hill equation. Glutamate is a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to tyrosine, a linear noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to coenzyme or α-ketoglutarate. p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate is a linear noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to tyrosine or pyridoxal-P but is a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to α-ketoglutarate. These data, considered with replots of slopes and intercepts, indicate a mechanism random in the sense that either coenzyme or Schiff's base of coenzyme and amino acid can add to the apoenzyme. A study of the half-reaction with apoenzyme, pyridoxamine-P, and α-ketoglutarate showed that 90% or more of the complete chemical reaction rate was achieved when freshly isolated apoenzyme was used. The pH dependence of the half-reaction paralleled that of the complete chemical reaction and supports the conclusion that the same protein catalyzes the complete and half-reaction. Furthermore, the magnitude of the half-reaction compared to the complete transamination would dictate that the mechanism does not switch between ping-pong and ordered depending upon the level of substrates available. By use of the Hill equation, the reaction between enzyme and substrates is first order with respect to tyrosine, pyridoxal-P, and α-ketoglutarate. Reduction of the concentration of α-ketoglutarate to a rate-limiting value does not change the order with respect to tyrosine or to pyridoxal-P. Reduction of the concentration of pyridoxal-P, or of tyrosine, or of both of these reactants to rate-limiting levels when the concentration of α-ketoglutarate is varied does not affect the order of the reaction with respect to α-ketoglutarate. Thus, homotropic effects are not manifested by this system."
https://openalex.org/W2054789745,Alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport in hepatoma cells in culture was increased by insulin but not by hydrocortisone. Both of these agents induce tyrosine aminotransferase activity in this system. The apparent increase in alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport and tyrosine aminotransferase activity produced by glucagon is probably caused by insulin contamination. Insulin did not increase transport in this system until after tyrosine aminotransferase activity had reached maximum levels. The mechanisms underlying increased alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport appear to differ from those for tyrosine aminotransferase induction with hydrocortisone despite their close association in previous whole animal experiments.
https://openalex.org/W1599130230,"Abstract Hepatic microsomal TPNH-cytochrome c reductase was purified until it was essentially homogeneous by several criteria. The molecular weight and amino acid composition as well as flavin and cytochrome c-binding properties of the pure enzyme were studied. The particle weight of the enzyme is 81,000, and it contains 1 mole of flavin per 48,000 g of enzyme protein. The enzyme can be inactivated by irradiation with visible light in the presence of 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. The activity is completely restored by addition of FAD or FMN. Titration of the photoinactivated enzyme with FMN reveals that 1 mole of flavin per 40,500 g of protein is required to completely reactivate the enzyme. Kinetic studies of the reactivation process show that it is first order with respect to flavin. At 20° the rate constants are 2.5 x 102 and 1.7 x 104 m-1 sec-1 for FAD and FMN, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters for the activation were also calculated, and they suggest that the apoenzyme is similar energetically to the transition state leading to reactivated holoenzyme. The combined results of amino acid analysis and peptide mapping suggest that the native enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits, each having molecular weights of 40,500. Equilibrium-binding studies show that the dissociation constant for cytochrome c is identical with its Michaelis constant when the equivalent weight of the enzyme is taken as 81,000. No evidence for concentration-dependent dissociation of the enzyme into subunits was found by gel filtration. The Stokes radius of the particle, taken with other molecular parameters, indicated that the axial ratio of the particle is 4.5."

The optimum pH range for the reaction was from 8.1 to 8.5. The Km for UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate was 4.0 x 10-5 m and that for NADPH was 4.9 x 10-5 m. The available data suggest that the enzyme requires a thiol group (or groups) for its activity and contains FAD as the prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1542626936,"Abstract Orally intubated 3H-labeled tryptophan was retained significantly in the stomach and intestine of rats treated with actinomycin D (43%) as compared to controls (13%) 4 hours after intubation. Likewise, smaller amounts of the isotope subsequently appeared in the liver and serum of the drug-treated animals. In contrast, actinomycin had no effect on movement of intraperitoneally injected 3H-tryptophan out of the peritoneal cavity or its subsequent accumulation in the liver. Induction of tryptophan pyrrolase by intraperitoneally or intravenously administered tryptophan was unaffected by concomitant actinomycin D treatment. On the other hand, similar induction of tyrosine transaminase was completely blocked by the drug. When l-tryptophan was administered orally over a range of 5 to 20 mg/100 g, the maximum induction of tyrosine transaminase was obtained at the 5-mg dose with no further enhancement at higher levels. However, with tryptophan pyrrolase, there was a gradual response: no induction after 5 mg, a 3-fold increase at 10 mg, and a 6-fold enhancement at 20 mg. These experiments show that in the rat actinomycin D affects the transport and absorption of dietary metabolites from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore it is important to consider any conclusion drawn from orally administered substrate induction experiments in the light of this action of actinomycin D."

https://openalex.org/W2074454870,Marrow cells derived from C57BL/6 mice form many fewer splenic colonies in irradiated C57BL/6 x C3H F1 hybrid recipients than in irradiated C57BL/6 recipients (repression of colony formation). This effect is reversed by treatment of the hybrid recipients with active antiserum to mouse thymocytes. The repression phenomenon cannot readily be explained in immunological terms; hence the effect of the antilymphocyte serum on this phenomenon may not result from immunosuppression in the usual sense.
