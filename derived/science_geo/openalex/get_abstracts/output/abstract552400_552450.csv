https://openalex.org/W2293240499,"Cellvibrio japonicusis a Gram-negative soil bacterium that is primarily known for its ability to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides through utilization of an extensive repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Several putative chitin-degrading enzymes are also found among these carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as chitinases, chitobiases, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). In this study, we have characterized the chitin-active LPMO,CjLPMO10A, a tri-modular enzyme containing a catalytic family AA10 LPMO module, a family 5 chitin-binding module, and a C-terminal unclassified module of unknown function. Characterization of the latter module revealed tight and specific binding to chitin, thereby unraveling a new family of chitin-binding modules (classified as CBM73). X-ray crystallographic elucidation of theCjLPMO10A catalytic module revealed that the active site of the enzyme combines structural features previously only observed in either cellulose or chitin-active LPMO10s. Analysis of the copper-binding site by EPR showed a signal signature more similar to those observed for cellulose-cleaving LPMOs. The full-length LPMO shows no activity toward cellulose but is able to bind and cleave both α- and β-chitin. Removal of the chitin-binding modules reduced LPMO activity toward α-chitin compared with the full-length enzyme. Interestingly, the full-length enzyme and the individual catalytic LPMO module boosted the activity of an endochitinase equally well, also yielding similar amounts of oxidized products. Finally, gene deletion studies show thatCjLPMO10A is needed byC. japonicusto obtain efficient growth on both purified chitin and crab shell particles."

This interplay between miRNA and their mRNA has been proposed as an important process in cancer development and progression. We have investigated molecular networks impacted by predicted mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) diagnosed with or without metastasis.miRNA and mRNA microarray expression profiles derived from primary ccRCC from patients with (16 samples) or without diagnosed metastasis (22 samples) were used to identify anti-correlated miRNA-mRNA interaction in ccRCC. For this purpose, Ingenuity pathway analysis microRNA Target Filter, which enables prioritization of experimentally validated and predicted mRNA targets was used. By applying an expression pairing tool, the analysis was focused on targets exhibiting altered expression in our analysis, finding miRNAs and their target genes with opposite or same expression. The resulting identified interactions were revalidated by RT-qPCR in another cohort of ccRCC patients. A selection of the predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions was tested by functional analyses using miRNA knockdown and overexpression experiments in renal cancer cell lines.Among the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, we have identified three miRNAs (miR-146a-5p, miR-128a-3p, and miR-17-5p) that were upregulated in primary tumors from patients without metastasis and downregulated in primary tumors from patients with metastasis. We have further identified mRNA targets, which expression were inversely correlated to these 3 miRNAs, and have been previously experimentally demonstrated in cancer setting in humans. Specifically, we showed that CXCL8/IL8, UHRF1, MCM10, and CDKN3 were downregulated and targeted by miR-146a-5p. The interaction between miR-146a-5p and their targets CXCL8 and UHRF1 was validated in cell culture experiments.We identified novel target genes of dysregulated miRNAs, which are involved in the transition from primary RCC without metastases into tumors generating distant metastasis."

This pilot study was conducted to gain in-depth knowledge of children's physical activity behavior during recess using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative GPS and accelerometer measurements with qualitative go-along group interviews and participant observations. Data were collected during three weekdays in a public school in Denmark. Eighty-one children (47 girls) wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X) and GPS (QStarz BT-Q1000xt), sixteen children participated in go-along group interviews, and recess behavior was observed using an ethnographical participant observation approach. All data were analyzed separated systematically answering the Five W Questions. Children were categorized into Low, Middle and High physical activity groups and these groups were predominantly staying in three different locations during recess: school building, schoolyard and field, respectively. Mostly girls were in the building remaining in there because of a perceived lack of attractive outdoor play facilities. The children in the schoolyard were predominantly girls who preferred the schoolyard over the field to avoid the competitive soccer games on the field whereas boys dominated the field playing soccer. Using a mixed-methods approach to investigate children's physical activity behavior during recess helped gain in-depth knowledge that can aid development of future interventions in the school environment."
https://openalex.org/W2265166065,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is central during the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, in which the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) also has an established role. TGF-β is also known to be the strongest inducer of PAI-1. To investigate the link between PAI-1 and TGF-β in fibrotic processes, we evaluated the effect of SK-216, a PAI-1-specific inhibitor, in TGF-β-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. In human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, treatment with TGF-β induced EMT, whereas co-treatment with SK-216 attenuated the occurrence of EMT. The inhibition of TGF-β-induced EMT by SK-216 was also confirmed in the experiment using murine epithelial LA-4 cells. Blocking EMT by SK-216 inhibited TGF-β-induced endogenous production of PAI-1 and TGF-β in A549 cells as well. These effects of SK-216 were not likely mediated by suppressing either Smad or ERK pathways. Using human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells, we demonstrated that SK-216 inhibited TGF-β-dependent differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. We also observed this inhibition by SK-216 in human primary lung fibroblasts. Following these in vitro results, we tested oral administration of SK-216 into mice injected intratracheally with bleomycin. We found that SK-216 reduced the degree of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the link between TGF-β and PAI-1 regarding fibrotic process were not determined, PAI-1 seems to act as a potent downstream effector on the pro-fibrotic property of TGF-β. In addition, inhibition of PAI-1 activity by a PAI-1 inhibitor exerts an antifibrotic effect even in vivo. These data suggest that targeting PAI-1 as a downstream effector of TGF-β could be a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2264500865,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan. Although chemotherapy is the primary treatment for HCC patients, drug resistance often leads to clinical failure. Galectin-1 is a beta-galactoside binding lectin which is up-regulated in HCC patients and promotes tumor growth by mediating cancer cell adhesion, migration and proliferation, but its role in chemoresistance of HCC is poorly understood. In this study we found that galectin-1 is able to lead to chemoresistance against cisplatin treatment, and subsequent inhibition has reversed the effect of cell death in HCC cells. Moreover, galectin-1 was found to induce autophagic flux in HCC cells. Inhibition of autophagy by inhibitors or knockdown of Atg5 cancels galectin-1-induced cisplatin resistance in HCC cells. Increase of mitophagy triggered by galectin-1 was found to reduce the mitochondrial potential loss and apoptosis induced by cisplatin treatment. Finally, using an in situ hepatoma mouse model, we clearly demonstrated that inhibition of galectin-1 by thiodigalactoside could significantly augment the anti-HCC effect of cisplatin. Taken together, our findings offer a new insight into the chemoresistance galectin-1 causes against cisplatin treatment, and points to a potential approach to improve the efficacy of cisplatin in the treatment of HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2290045063,"The MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment) is known as a prognosis factor in older population. We analyzed the prognostic value for one-year mortality of MNA items in older patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy as the basis of a simplified prognostic score.The prospective derivation cohort included 606 patients older than 70 years with an indication of chemotherapy for cancers. The endpoint to predict was one-year mortality. The 18 items of the Full MNA, age, gender, weight loss, cancer origin, TNM, performance status and lymphocyte count were considered to construct the prognostic model. MNA items were analyzed with a backward step-by-step multivariate logistic regression and other items were added in a forward step-by-step regression. External validation was performed on an independent cohort of 229 patients.At one year 266 deaths had occurred. Decreased dietary intake (p = 0.0002), decreased protein-rich food intake (p = 0.025), 3 or more prescribed drugs (p = 0.023), calf circumference <31 cm (p = 0.0002), tumor origin (p<0.0001), metastatic status (p = 0.0007) and lymphocyte count <1500/mm3 (0.029) were found to be associated with 1-year mortality in the final model and were used to construct a prognostic score. The area under curve (AUC) of the score was 0.793, which was higher than the Full MNA AUC (0.706). The AUC of the score in validation cohort (229 subjects, 137 deaths) was 0.698.Key predictors of one-year mortality included cancer cachexia clinical features, comorbidities, the origin and the advanced status of the tumor. The prognostic value of this model combining a subset of MNA items and cancer related items was better than the full MNA, thus providing a simple score to predict 1-year mortality in older patients with an indication of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2254540178,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide poly (CAG) tract located in exon 1 of the huntingtin (Htt) gene leading to progressive neurodegeneration in selected brain regions, and associated functional impairments in motor, cognitive, and psychiatric domains. Since the discovery of the gene mutation that causes the disease, mouse models have been developed by different strategies. Recently, a new model, the zQ175 knock-in (KI) line, was developed in an attempt to have the Htt gene in a context and causing a phenotype that more closely mimics HD in humans. The behavioral phenotype was characterized across the independent laboratories and important features reminiscent of human HD are observed in zQ175 mice. In the current study, we characterized the zQ175 model housed in an academic laboratory under reversed dark-light cycle, including motor function, in vivo longitudinal structural MRI imaging for brain volume, MRS for striatal metabolites, neuropathology, as well as a panel of key disease marker proteins in the striatum at different ages. Our results suggest that homozygous zQ175 mice exhibited significant brain atrophy before the motor deficits and brain metabolite changes. Altered striatal medium spiny neuronal marker, postsynaptic marker protein and complement component C1qC also characterized zQ175 mice. Our results confirmed that the zQ175 KI model is valuable in understanding of HD-like pathophysiology and evaluation of potential therapeutics. Our data also provide suggestions to select appropriate outcome measurements in preclinical studies using the zQ175 mice."
https://openalex.org/W2288503799,"The ClpP protease complex and its regulatory ATPases, ClpC1 and ClpX, inMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) are essential and, therefore, promising drug targets. TheMtbClpP protease consists of two heptameric rings, one composed of ClpP1 and the other of ClpP2 subunits. Formation of the enzymatically active ClpP1P2 complex requires binding of N-blocked dipeptide activators. We have found a new potent activator, benzoyl-leucine-leucine (Bz-LL), that binds with higher affinity and promotes 3-4-fold higher peptidase activity than previous activators. Bz-LL-activated ClpP1P2 specifically stimulates the ATPase activity ofMtbClpC1 and ClpX. The ClpC1P1P2 and ClpXP1P2 complexes exhibit 2-3-fold enhanced ATPase activity, peptide cleavage, and ATP-dependent protein degradation. The crystal structure of ClpP1P2 with bound Bz-LL was determined at a resolution of 3.07 A and with benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu (Z-LL) bound at 2.9 A. Bz-LL was present in all 14 active sites, whereas Z-LL density was not resolved. Surprisingly, Bz-LL adopts opposite orientations in ClpP1 and ClpP2. In ClpP1, Bz-LL binds with the C-terminal leucine side chain in the S1 pocket. One C-terminal oxygen is close to the catalytic serine, whereas the other contacts backbone amides in the oxyanion hole. In ClpP2, Bz-LL binds with the benzoyl group in the S1 pocket, and the peptide hydrogen bonded between parallel β-strands. The ClpP2 axial loops are extended, forming an open axial channel as has been observed with bound ADEP antibiotics. Thus occupancy of the active sites of ClpP allosterically alters sites on the surfaces thereby affecting the association of ClpP1 and ClpP2 rings, interactions with regulatory ATPases, and entry of protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2300529250,"Tau neuronal protein has a central role in neurodegeneration and is implicated in Alzheimer disease development. Abnormal phosphorylation of Tau impairs its interaction with other proteins and is associated with its dysregulation in pathological conditions. Molecular mechanisms leading to hyperphosphorylation of Tau in pathological conditions are unknown. Here, we characterize phosphorylation of Tau by extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK2), a mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) that responds to extracellular signals. Analysis of in vitro phosphorylated Tau by activated recombinant ERK2 with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) reveals phosphorylation of 15 Ser/Thr sites. In vitro phosphorylation of Tau using rat brain extract and subsequent NMR analysis identifies the same sites. Phosphorylation with rat brain extract is known to transform Tau into an Alzheimer disease-like state. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of Tau by ERK2 alone is sufficient to produce the same characteristics. We further investigate the mechanism of ERK2 phosphorylation of Tau. Kinases are known to recognize their protein substrates not only by their specificity for a targeted Ser or Thr phosphorylation site but also by binding to linear-peptide motifs called docking sites.

Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein whose primary sequence is divided into several functional domains: an N-terminal region, a proline-rich domain (PRD), 2The abbreviations used are: PRD, proline rich domain; AD, Alzheimer disease; MTBD, microtubule binding domain; PHF, paired helical filament; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. a microtubule binding domain (MTBD) constituted of partially repeated sequences R1 to R4, and a C-terminal region (see Fig. 1A). Both PRD and MTBD are involved in microtubule stabilizing activity of Tau (1.Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

Results from previous studies indicate that ERK1/2 is able to transform Tau into an AD-like state, but this is mainly documented by the detection of the epitope recognized by the AT8 antibody (19.Drewes G.

To better define the phosphorylation sites involved in the transformation of Tau as present in AD (19.Drewes G. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Döring F. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Goris J. Dorée M. Mandelkow E. Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase transforms tau protein into an Alzheimer-like state.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we used NMR spectroscopy. We observed that 14 out of the 17 S/T sites, which are followed by proline ((S/T)P sites) and likely to be recognized by proline-directed ERK1/2, are phosphorylated by activated recombinant ERK2 in vitro. Another well known in vitro model of Tau hyperphosphorylation is obtained by incubation of Tau with rat brain extracts along with phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (38.Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Six J. Lübke U. Vandermeeren M. Cras P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. The abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein at Ser-202 in Alzheimer disease recapitulates phosphorylation during development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5066-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We compared the phosphorylation pattern of Tau obtained using rat brain extract with that obtained using the in vitro activated recombinant ERK2. A similar pattern of Tau phosphorylation was indeed observed, which strongly suggests that ERK2 is sufficient for hyperphosphorylation of Tau. We then studied the Tau-ERK2 interaction. We mapped the interaction sites of ERK2 along the Tau sequence and identified two docking sites in the MTBD, which is distal to the PRD containing most of the ERK phosphorylated sites of Tau. We, therefore, conclude that Tau and ERK2 form a dynamic complex. Our study indicates that Tau could be the first example of an ERK2 substrate with multiple docking sites. These conclusions expand our view on the potential role of ERK2 in the neurodegeneration pathway in AD involving Tau and shed light on the molecular mechanisms leading to pathological Tau formation. cDNA encoding peptides Tau-(220–240) and Tau-(271–294) were amplified from Tau full-length cDNA by PCR. The cDNA were cloned by a ligation-independent protocol into vector pETNKI-HisSUMO3-LIC (39.Luna-Vargas M.P. Christodoulou E. Alfieri A. van Dijk W.J. Stadnik M. Hibbert R.G. Sahtoe D.D. Clerici M.

The longest isoform of Tau (441 amino acid residues) and the Tau fragments Tau-(165–245) and Tau-(244–372) (K18) were expressed and purified as recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) (New England BioLabs) using pET15b plasmid (Invitrogen) under the control of T7lac promoter. Tau fragments Tau-(220–240) and Tau-(271–294) were expressed as N-terminal fusion with the SUMO protein presenting a N-terminal His tag from a modified pET vector (39.Luna-Vargas M.P.

Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and recombinant protein production induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Isotope labeling was performed using a modified M9 medium containing in addition to the M9 salts, minimum Eagle's medium vitamin mix 1× (Sigma), 1 g of [15N]NH4Cl, 4 g of glucose or 2 g of [13C]glucose and 200 mg of complete medium powder (Celtone Complete Medium, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) per liter of bacterial culture. Briefly, Tau protein, Tau-(165–245) and Tau-(244–372) fragments were purified by first heating the bacterial extract 15 min at 75 °C. Purification consisted of cation exchange chromatography with a sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 (Hitrap SP-Sepharose FF, 5 ml; GE Healthcare) for Tau and Tau-(165–245) and nickel-chelating chromatography for Tau-(244–372) (Hitrap nickel-Sepharose FF, 5 ml; GE Healthcare). Full-length Tau protein and Tau fragments were then buffer-exchanged against ammonium bicarbonate (Hiload 16/60 desalting column, GE Healthcare) for lyophilization. His-SUMO Tau-(220–240) and His-SUMO Tau-(271–294) were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin following the manufacturer's protocols. The fusion proteins were buffer-exchanged using a PD-10 column (G25 resin, cutoff of 7 kDa; GE Healthcare) against NMR buffer. Recombinant His6-tagged p42 MAP kinase (ERK2) from Xenopus laevis was prepared by growing bacteria transformed with a ERK recombinant T7 expression plasmid in LB medium until induction by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside of the protein production for a period of 4 h at 37 °C. His-ERK2 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's protocols. After analysis on SDS-PAGE, the pooled fractions were buffer-exchanged using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) against conservation buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50% glycerol, pH 7.5, and kept frozen at −80 °C. His6-tagged D321N/D324N ERK2 was prepared in the same manner. Activated-ERK2 was prepared as previously described by in vitro incubation with activated MEK (40.Prabakaran S. Everley R.A. Landrieu I.

Biol. 2011; 7: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To label Tau with CF3 attached on its native Cys residues (Cys-291 and Cys-322), 100 μm [15N]Tau or [15N]Tau-(244–372) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate were first thoroughly reduced by incubation for 2 h at 22 °C with 1 mm Tris (hydroxymethyl) phosphine reducing agent. The protein samples were next incubated with 2 mm 2-iodo-N-trifluoroethyl acetamide (EnamineStore) in dimethyl sulfoxide at 22 °C for 3 h. The excess of 2-iodo-N-trifluoroethyl acetamide was removed by desalting. The CF3-[15N]Tau samples were lyophilized. 15N-Labeled recombinant Tau was used as substrate to assay the activity of activated ERK2. 100 μm [15N]Tau or [15N]Tau-(165–245) was incubated with 1 μm ERK2 enzyme at 37 °C for 3 h in 200 μl of phosphorylation buffer 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Complete Inhibitors without EDTA). To identify the phosphorylation sites by NMR spectroscopy 13C,15N-double-labeled Tau was incubated in the same conditions overnight with the activated recombinant ERK2. Enzymatic incubation was terminated by heating the reaction mixture for 15 min at 75 °C followed by centrifugation. The phosphorylation mixture was buffer-exchanged using desalting centrifugal devices (0.5-ml-bed G25 resin, cutoff of 7 kDa, Thermo Scientific Zeba Desalting Columns) against NMR buffer (50 mm deuterated Tris, pH 6.65, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT and 10% D2O). Phosphorylation of the Tau-(165–245) by ERK2 followed the same protocol. For the time course of phosphorylation, 100 μm [15N]Tau was incubated for 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min with 1 μm activated-ERK2 as described above. The reaction was stopped by heating the sample at 75 °C for 15 min. The experiment was repeated three times. The rat brain extract was prepared by homogenizing a brain (∼2 g) in 5 ml of homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 μm okadaic acid (Sigma) supplemented with 20 μg/ml leupeptin and 40 mm Pefabloc (38.Goedert M.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5066-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugation was next performed at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was directly used for its kinase activity. Total protein concentration was estimated to be 7 mg/ml by the Bradford colorimetric assay. The [15N]Tau protein (1–1.5 mg) was dissolved at 10 μm in 2.5 ml of phosphorylation buffer (2 mm ATP, 40 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT complemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μm okadaic acid (Sigma). The phosphorylation reaction was performed at 37 °C for 24 h with 500 μl of brain extract. Enzymatic incubation was terminated by heating the reaction mixture for 15 min at 75 °C followed by centrifugation. Phosphorylation mixture was buffer-exchanged against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate before lyophilization. Phosphorylation of the Tau-(165–245) by rat brain extract kinase activity followed the same protocol. The samples were prepared by solubilizing the lyophilized powder into NMR buffer. Each set of experiment was independently repeated two or three times. Analysis of the phospho-Tau samples by NMR spectroscopy was performed at 293 K or 298 K on Bruker 600-MHz and 900-MHz spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance cryogenic probehead (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Trimethylsilyl propionate was used as the reference (0 ppm). 100 μm [15N]Tau in a volume of 200 μl in 3-mm tubes was sufficient to obtain the two-dimensional 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra with 32 scans. HSQC two-dimensional experiments to map the interaction between Tau protein and recombinant ERK2 were recorded at 293 K on a 900-MHz spectrometer with 64 scans per increment as a complex matrix of 2048 × 416 complex points for 14 × 25 ppm spectral widths in the proton and nitrogen dimensions, respectively. Three-dimensional HNCACB spectra were recorded for 13C,15N-phospho-Tau obtained both with rat brain extract and recombinant ERK2 with a standard Bruker pulse sequence. A three-dimensional HNcaNNH spectrum (41.Weisemann R. Rüterjans H. Bermel W. Three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR techniques for the sequential assignment of NH and 15N resonances in 15N- and 13C-labelled proteins.J. Biomol.

Three-dimensional HNCACB experiments were acquired to confirm the assignment of the Tau residues in 13C,15N-His-SUMO Tau-(220–240) and 13C,15N-His-SUMO Tau-(271–294). For Fluor NMR experiments, the lyophilized CF3-[15N]Tau and CF3-[15N]Tau-(244–372) were suspended in phosphate NMR buffer consisting of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. 50 μm CF3-Tau or CF3-Tau-(244–372) in 200 μl of phosphate NMR buffer were titrated with increasing concentration of His-ERK2 (25, 50, 100, 125, 162, and 220 μm). The one-dimensional 19F spectra were recorded at 293 K with 1024 scans on a Bruker 600MHz Avance NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm CPQCI 19F/1H-13C/15N cryogenic probehead (Bruker). The chemical shifts in one-dimensional 19F spectra were referenced by using the fluor resonance of external Trifluoroacetic acid at −76.55 ppm. Spectra were processed with Bruker TopSpin 3.1 software. Data analysis, peak picking, and calculation of peak volumes were done with Sparky 3.114 software (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). Assignment of resonances of Thr(P)- and Ser(P)-phosphorylated residues is based on the typical Cα and Cβ chemical shifts of these residues (42.Bienkiewicz E.A. Lumb K.J. Random-coil chemical shifts of phosphorylated amino acids.J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ser(P) and Thr(P) resonances were assigned to a specific residues in phospho-Tau primary sequence using as additional information the 15N Cα and Cβ chemical shifts of their N-terminal residues (43.Landrieu I.

Although we have previously shown that TXNIP is strongly induced by glucose, any regulation by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interferon γ (IFNγ) has remained largely unexplored. Moreover, even though this three-cytokine mixture is widely used to mimic type 1 diabetes in vitro, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Interestingly, we have now found that this cytokine mixture increases β-cell TXNIP expression; however, although TNFα had no effect, IL-1β surprisingly down-regulated TXNIP transcription, whereas IFNγ increased TXNIP levels in INS-1 β-cells and primary islets. Human TXNIP promoter analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the IL-1β effect was mediated by inhibition of carbohydrate response element binding protein activity. In contrast, IFNγ increased pro-apoptotic TXNIP post-transcriptionally via induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress, activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and suppression of miR-17, a microRNA that targets and down-regulates TXNIP. In fact, miR-17 knockdown was able to mimic the IFNγ effects on TXNIP, whereas miR-17 overexpression blunted the cytokine effect. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IFNγ each have distinct and in part opposing effects on β-cell TXNIP expression. These findings thereby provide new mechanistic insight into the regulation of TXNIP and β-cell biology and reveal novel links between proinflammatory cytokines, carbohydrate response element binding protein-mediated transcription, and microRNA signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2269172513,"Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) dephosphorylate threonine/serine and tyrosine residues on their substrates. Here we show that DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP6 are involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer stem cell (CSC) regulation. DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP6 are induced during EMT in a PKC pathway signal-mediated EMT model. We show for the first time that the key chromatin-associated kinase PKC-θ directly regulates a subset of DUSP family members. DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP6 globally but differentially co-exist with enhancer and permissive active histone post-translational modifications, suggesting that they play distinct roles in gene regulation in EMT/CSCs. We show that nuclear DUSP4 associates with the key acetyltransferase p300 in the context of the chromatin template and dynamically regulates the interplay between two key phosphorylation marks: the 1834 (active) and 89 (inhibitory) residues central to p300's acetyltransferase activity. Furthermore, knockdown with small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) shows that DUSP4 is required for maintaining H3K27ac, a mark mediated by p300. DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP6 knockdown with siRNAs shows that they participate in the formation of CD44hi/CD24lo/EpCAM+ breast CSCs: DUSP1 knockdown reduces CSC formation, while DUSP4 and DUSP6 knockdown enhance CSC formation. Moreover, DUSP6 is overexpressed in patient-derived HER2+ breast carcinomas compared to benign mammary tissue. Taken together, these findings illustrate novel pleiotropic roles for DUSP family members in EMT and CSC regulation in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2265433712,"We used flow cytometry to determine if there would be a difference in hematology, selected immune functions, and hemocyte pH (pHi), under two different, future ocean acidification scenarios (pH = 7.50, 7.80) compared to current conditions (pH = 8.09) for Chionoecetes bairdi, Tanner crab. Hemocytes were analyzed after adult Tanner crabs were held for two years under continuous exposure to acidified ocean water. Total counts of hemocytes did not vary among control and experimental treatments; however, there were significantly greater number of dead, circulating hemocytes in crabs held at the lowest pH treatment. Phagocytosis of fluorescent microbeads by hemocytes was greatest at the lowest pH treatment. These results suggest that hemocytes were dying, likely by apoptosis, at a rate faster than upregulated phagocytosis was able to remove moribund cells from circulation at the lowest pH. Crab hemolymph pH (pHe) averaged 8.09 and did not vary among pH treatments. There was no significant difference in internal pH (pHi) within hyalinocytes among pH treatments and the mean pHi (7.26) was lower than the mean pHe. In contrast, there were significant differences among treatments in pHi of the semi-granular+granular cells. Control crabs had the highest mean semi-granular+granular pHi compared to the lowest pH treatment. As physiological hemocyte functions changed from ambient conditions, interactions with the number of eggs in the second clutch, percentage of viable eggs, and calcium concentration in the adult crab shell was observed. This suggested that the energetic costs of responding to ocean acidification and maintaining defense mechanisms in Tanner crab may divert energy from other physiological processes, such as reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2293312435,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) displays a high degree of metabolic plasticity to adapt to challenging host environments. Genetic evidence suggests that Mtb relies mainly on fatty acid catabolism in the host. However, Mtb also maintains a functional glycolytic pathway and its role in the cellular metabolism of Mtb has yet to be understood. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the last and rate-limiting step in glycolysis and the Mtb genome harbors one putative pyruvate kinase (pykA, Rv1617). Here we show that pykA encodes an active pyruvate kinase that is allosterically activated by glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Deletion of pykA prevents Mtb growth in the presence of fermentable carbon sources and has a cidal effect in the presence of glucose that correlates with elevated levels of the toxic catabolite methylglyoxal. Growth attenuation was also observed in media containing a combination of short chain fatty acids and glucose and surprisingly, in media containing odd and even chain fatty acids alone. Untargeted high sensitivity metabolomics revealed that inactivation of pyruvate kinase leads to accumulation of phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate), citrate, and aconitate, which was consistent with allosteric inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase by P-enolpyruvate. This metabolic block could be relieved by addition of the α-ketoglutarate precursor glutamate. Taken together, our study identifies an essential role of pyruvate kinase in preventing metabolic block during carbon co-catabolism in Mtb."
https://openalex.org/W2269405010,"Mechanistic pathways linking maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status with gestational length are poorly delineated. This study examined whether inflammation and sleep quality serve as mediators, focusing on the antiinflammatory ω-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n3) and proinflammatory ω-6 arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n6). Pregnant women (n = 135) provided a blood sample and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 20–27 weeks gestation. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid levels were determined by gas chromatography and serum inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein] by electrochemiluminescence using high sensitivity kits. Both higher serum IL-8 (95% CI = 0.10,3.84) and poor sleep (95% CI = 0.03,0.28) served as significant mediators linking lower DHA:AA ratios with shorter gestation. Further, a serial mediation model moving from the DHA:AA ratio → sleep → IL-8 → length of gestation was statistically significant (95% CI = 0.02, 0.79). These relationships remained after adjusting for depressive symptoms, age, BMI, income, race, and smoking. No interactions with race were observed in relation to length of gestation as a continuous variable. However, a significant interaction between race and the DHA:AA ratio in predicting preterm birth was observed (p = 0.049); among African Americans only, odds of preterm birth decreased as DHA:AA increased (p = 0.048). These data support a role for both inflammatory pathways and sleep quality in linking less optimal RBC PUFA status with shorter gestation in African American and European American women and suggest that African-Americans have greater risk for preterm birth in the context of a low DHA:AA ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2254348340,"Background DIALOG+ is a new intervention to make routine community mental health meetings therapeutically effective. It involves a structured assessment of patient concerns and a solution-focused approach to address them. In a randomised controlled trial, DIALOG+ was associated with better subjective quality of life and other outcomes in patients with psychosis, but it was not clear how this was achieved. This study explored the possible mechanisms. Methods This was a mixed-methods process evaluation within a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with patients and clinicians who experienced DIALOG+ and were analysed using thematic analysis. The content of DIALOG+ sessions was recorded and analysed according to (i) the type of actions agreed during sessions and (ii) the domains discussed. The subjective quality of life measure was analysed with mixed-effects models to explore whether the effect of DIALOG+ was limited to life domains that had been addressed in sessions or consistent across all domains. Results Four qualitative themes emerged regarding the mechanisms of DIALOG+: (1) a comprehensive structure; (2) self-reflection; (3) therapeutic self-expression; and (4) empowerment. Patients took responsibility for the majority of actions agreed during sessions (65%). The treatment effect on subjective quality of life was largest for living situation (accommodation and people that the patient lives with) and mental health. Two of these domains were among the three most commonly discussed in DIALOG+ sessions (accommodation, mental health, and physical health). Conclusion DIALOG+ initiates positive, domain-specific change in the areas that are addressed in sessions. It provides a comprehensive and solution-focused structure to routine meetings, encourages self-reflection and expression, and empowers patients. Future research should strengthen and monitor these factors. Trial Registration ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN34757603."
https://openalex.org/W2267939324,"Endometrial cancer, the most common gynecologic malignancy, is a hormonally-regulated disease. Response to progestin therapy positively correlates with hormone receptor expression, in particular progesterone receptor (PR). However, many advanced tumors lose PR expression. We recently reported that the efficacy of progestin therapy can be significantly enhanced by combining progestin with epigenetic modulators, which we term “molecularly enhanced progestin therapy.” What remained unclear was the mechanism of action and if estrogen receptor α (ERα), the principle inducer of PR, is necessary to restore functional expression of PR via molecularly enhanced progestin therapy. Therefore, we modeled advanced endometrial tumors that have lost both ERα and PR expression by generating ERα-null endometrial cancer cell lines. CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to delete ERα at the genomic level. Our data demonstrate that treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) was sufficient to restore functional PR expression, even in cells devoid of ERα. Our studies also revealed that HDACi treatment results in marked downregulation of the oncogene Myc. We established that PR is a negative transcriptional regulator of Myc in endometrial cancer in the presence or absence of ERα, which is in contrast to studies in breast cancer cells. First, estrogen stimulation augmented PR expression and decreased Myc in endometrial cancer cell lines. Second, progesterone increased PR activity yet blunted Myc mRNA and protein expression. Finally, overexpression of PR by adenoviral transduction in ERα-null endometrial cancer cells significantly decreased expression of Myc and Myc-regulated genes. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of endometrial tumors identified an inverse correlation between PR and Myc mRNA levels, with a corresponding inverse correlation between PR and Myc downstream transcriptional targets SRD5A1, CDK2 and CCNB1. Together, these data reveal a previously unanticipated inverse relationship between the tumor suppressor PR and the oncogene Myc in endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2341407636,"It has been predicted that the global temperature will rise in the future, which means crops including sorghum will likely be grown under higher temperatures, and consequently may affect the nutritional properties.The effects of two growth temperatures (OT, day/night 32/21°C; HT 38/21°C) on tannin, phytate, mineral, and in vitro iron availability of raw and cooked grains (as porridge) of six sorghum genotypes were investigated.Tannin content significantly decreased across all sorghum genotypes under high growth temperature (P ≤0.05), while the phytate and mineral contents maintained the same level, increased or decreased significantly, depending on the genotype. The in vitro iron availability in most sorghum genotypes was also significantly reduced under high temperature, except for Ai4, which showed a pronounced increase (P ≤0.05). The cooking process significantly reduced tannin content in all sorghum genotypes (P ≤0.05), while the phytate content and in vitro iron availability were not significantly affected.This research provides some new information on sorghum grain nutritional properties when grown under predicted future higher temperatures, which could be important for humans where sorghum grains are consumed as staple food."

Twenty youth female competitive gymnasts (Age: 12.5 ± 1.67 y) volunteered to participate and were randomly assigned to two independent groups. The experimental plyometric training group (PTG) undertook a six-week plyometric program, involving two additional 45 min PT sessions a week, alongside their HT, while the control group (CG) performed regular HT only. Videography was used (120 Hz) in the sagittal plane to record both groups performing three HVs for both the baseline and post-intervention trials. Furthermore, participants completed a countermovement jump test (CMJ) to assess the effect of PT on functional power. Through the use of Quintic biomechanics software, significant improvements (P < 0.05) were found for the PTG for run-up velocity, take-off velocity, hurdle to board distance, board contact time, table contact time and post-flight time and CMJ height. However, there were no significant improvements on pre-flight time, shoulder angle or hip angle on the vault for the PTG. The CG demonstrated no improvement for all HV measures. A sport-specific PT intervention improved handspring vault performance measures and functional power when added to the habitual training of youth female gymnasts. The additional two hours plyometric training seemingly improved the power generating capacity of movement-specific musculature, which consequently improved aspects of vaulting performance. Future research is required to examine the whether the improvements are as a consequence of the additional volume of sprinting and jumping activities, as a result of the specific PT method or a combination of these factors."

KstR is a highly conserved TetR family transcriptional repressor that regulates a large set of genes responsible for cholesterol catabolism. Many genes in this regulon, includingkstR, are either induced during infection or are essential for survival ofM. tuberculosis in vivo In this study, we identified two ligands for KstR, both of which are CoA thioester cholesterol metabolites with four intact steroid rings. A metabolite in which one of the rings was cleaved was not a ligand. We confirmed the ligand-protein interactions using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and showed that ligand binding strongly inhibited KstR-DNA binding using surface plasmon resonance (IC50for ligand = 25 nm). Crystal structures of the ligand-free form of KstR show variability in the position of the DNA-binding domain. In contrast, structures of KstR·ligand complexes are highly similar to each other and demonstrate a position of the DNA-binding domain that is unfavorable for DNA binding. Comparison of ligand-bound and ligand-free structures identifies residues involved in ligand specificity and reveals a distinctive mechanism by which the ligand-induced conformational change mediates DNA release."

It has been shown that the up-regulation of ID1 is correlated with poor prognosis and the resistance to chemotherapy of human cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we determined for the first time that up-regulating ID1 upon etoposide activation was mediated through AP-1 binding sites within the ID1 promoter and confirmed that ID1 enhanced cell resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. Ablation of c-Jun/c-Fos or ID1 expression enhanced etoposide-mediated apoptosis through increasing activity of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. Moreover, c-Jun/c-Fos and ID1 were positively correlated in human cancers. More importantly, simultaneous high expression of ID1 and c-Jun or c-Fos was correlated with poor survival in cancer patients. Collectively, we demonstrate the importance of c-Jun/c-Fos-ID1 signaling pathway in chemoresistance of esophageal cancer cells and provide considerable insight into understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell biology.

In the study of p53 protecting cells from arsenic caused cell cycle arrest, ID1 is more extensive induced by arsenite in p53+/+ cells rather than p53-deficient cells, which display greater resistance to arsenite-induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis (19.McNeely S.C.

A recent study reported that competitive binding between ID1 and E2F1 to Cdc20 regulates E2F1 degradation and thymidylate synthase expression to promote esophageal cancer chemoresistance. The ID1-E2F1-IGF2 regulatory axis has important implications for cancer prognosis and treatment (12.Li B. Xu W.W. Guan X. Qin Y.R. Law S. Lee N.P. Chan K.T. Tam P.Y. Li Y.Y. Chan K.W. Yuen H.F.

However, the mechanisms of ID1 affecting chemoresistance have yet to be elucidated. The transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a menagerie of dimeric basic region leucine zipper proteins that recognize either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements (5′-TGAG/CTCA-3′) or cAMP response elements (5′-TGACGTCA-3′) (20.Hess J. Angel P. Schorpp-Kistner M. AP-1 subunits: quarrel and harmony among siblings.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a mammalian transcription factor and collectively describes a group of structurally and functionally related members of the Jun protein family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos protein family (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) (20.Hess J.

Recent research demonstrated that the aberrantly high levels of ID1 expression in cancer are often a consequence of transcriptional induction by many proteins that are activated in a constitutive manner in cancer cells and affect chemoresistance (24.Lasorella A.

Bearing in mind the key roles of AP-1 and ID1 in chemoresistance, the transcriptional regulation between ID proteins and AP-1 is of particular interest. In this study, we report that ID1 conferred etoposide chemoresistance through inhibiting caspase 3 activity and PARP cleavage. Ablation of ID1 promoted etoposide-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, c-Jun/c-Fos bound directly to the ID1 promoter region and activated its transcription in vivo. Ectopic expression of c-Jun/c-Fos enhanced ID1 transactivation. Conversely, knockdown of c-Jun/c-Fos inhibited ID1 transactivation. Overexpression of ID1 rescued cells from apoptosis in c-Jun/c-Fos knockdown cells. The expression level of ID1 was positively correlated with c-Jun/c-Fos in human cancers. More importantly, analysis of gene expression profiles of multiple cancer types indicated that high expression of ID1 and c-Jun or c-Fos is correlated with poor survival in cancer patients. These findings suggested that c-Jun/c-Fos was involved in chemosensitivity pathways and contributed to the regulation of ID1 in response to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Human ESCC cell lines (KYSE series) were generous gifts from Dr. Shimada Y (Kyoto University). KYSE30, 140, 180, and 450 cell lines used in this study were originally established from primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples after surgery in ESCC patients, who had not received prior cytotoxic therapy, whereas KYSE150 were from patients who had received cytotoxic therapy previously (27.Shimada Y. Imamura M. Wagata T. Yamaguchi N. Tobe T. Characterization of 21 newly established esophageal cancer cell lines.Cancer. 1992; 69: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Tissue samples from 34 patients with ESCC were used for ID1, c-Jun, and c-Fos mRNA expression analysis, and patients were consecutively recruited at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital (Beijing, China). At recruitment, informed consent was obtained from each subject. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Institute and Hospital. A tissue microarray from 110 patients with ESCC was previously made in our lab (28.Chen H. Ma J. Sunkel B. Luo A. Ding F. Li Y. He H. Zhang S. Xu C. Jin Q. Wang Q. Liu Z.

Full-length cDNA of human ID1 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pLVX. The promoter region of ID1 (−2209 to −163) was cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, designed as ID1-pro-2000. One point mutation was introduced into target site by mutagenesis PCR. The resulting construct was verified by direct sequencing. c-Jun and TAM67 expression plasmids were generated in our laboratory. c-Fos expression plasmids were provided by Dr. Marta Barbara Wisniewska (University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland).

Apoptosis assay was measured using the BD FITC annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were digested with trypsin-EDTA into single-cell suspensions and then collected. The resuspended cells (1 × 105) were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the supernatant, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding solution and transferred into a 5-ml culture tube. Annexin V-FITC (3 μl) was added to the solution and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark, followed by the addition of 400 μl of annexin V binding solution, and propidium iodide (3 μl) was added for flow cytometry. We statistically evaluated experimental results using two independent sample t tests, a one-way analysis of variance test, and Pearson correlation analysis. Survival analysis was performed by PROGgeneV2, a web-based resource combining genomic/clinical database and analysis tools that enable single/multiple gene-based prognostic assessment (32.Goswami C.P. Nakshatri H. PROGgeneV2: enhancements on the existing database.BMC Cancer. 2014; 14: 970Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). All tests of significance were set at p < 0.05. Previous studies indicated that ID1 was commonly up-regulated by chemotherapeutic drug treatment (18.Hernández-Vargas H. Ballestar E. Carmona-Saez P. von Kobbe C. Bañón-Rodríguez I. Esteller M. Moreno-Bueno G. Palacios J. Transcriptional profiling of MCF7 breast cancer cells in response to 5-fluorouracil: relationship with cell cycle changes and apoptosis, and identification of novel targets of p53.Int. J.

Exit from arsenite-induced mitotic arrest is p53 dependent.Environ. Health Perspect. 2006; 114: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible role of ID1 in ESCC, we first analyzed ID1 expression in ESCC tumor tissues and ESCC cell lines KYSE150, KYSE30, KYSE140, KYSE450, KYSE180, and KYSE410. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry results indicated that the expression of ID1 was high in primary ESCC tumors rather than tumor-adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 1, A and B). qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that ID1 was low in KYSE150 and KYSE30 and moderate in KYSE140 and KYSE450 but high in KYSE180 and KYSE410 cells (Fig. 1C). To examine whether therapeutic drug influences ID1 expression, we measured the expression of ID1 in ESCC cells treated with etoposide, and a time-dependent stimulation of endogenous ID1 in different ESCC cell lines was observed (Fig. 1D). These results indicated that ID1 might play an important role in ESCC cell resistance to etoposide. To evaluate the role of ID1 in response to DNA damage, we first measured IC50 values of etoposide in KYSE150, KYSE140, KYSE450, and KYSE180 ESCC cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the IC50 values of KYSE180 and KYSE450 cells were higher than those of KYSE150 and KYSE140 cells, which might be due to increased expression of endogenous ID1. Next, we examined the effect of etoposide on KYSE150 and KYSE450 cells with ectopic expression of ID1. As shown in Fig. 2B, cell viability was significantly increased by overexpression of ID1 in response to etoposide, indicating that overexpression of ID1 enhanced cell resistance to etoposide in esophageal cancer cells. To further study whether ID1 may influence cellular chemoresistance, we measured the cell apoptosis in pLVX and pLVX-ID1 cells treated with etoposide. Overexpression of ID1 significantly reduced etoposide-induced cell apoptosis in KYSE450 cells (Fig. 2C). A previous study showed that ID1 indirectly repressed p53, which promotes chemoresistance in HCT116 cells (19.McNeely S.C. Xu X. Taylor B.F. Zacharias W. McCabe Jr., M.J. States J.C. Exit from arsenite-induced mitotic arrest is p53 dependent.Environ. Health Perspect. 2006; 114: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous report, we also found that p53 was markedly decreased following etoposide treatment in ID1 stable transfectants, which further inhibited caspase 3 activity and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2D). Conversely, silencing of ID1 enhanced etoposide-induced apoptosis in KYSE450 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Taken together, overexpression of ID1 could enhance cell resistance to etoposide, whereas knockdown of ID1 reduced the chemoresistance in ESCC cells. To explore whether the increase of ID1 induced by etoposide was in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, we constructed the promoter of ID1 (2 kb) and transfected KYSE450 cells treated with or without etoposide to examine ID1 transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, etoposide treatment dramatically activated the promoter of ID1 in KYSE450 cells. These data indicated that the increased expression of ID1 was due to the transcriptional activity in response to etoposide and may involve in other transcriptional factors. Previous study revealed that AP-1 regulates responsive promoter via binding to its canonical TGAG/CTCA motif or TGACGTCA boxes located in the promoter regions of the target genes (33.Shaulian E. Karin M. AP-1 as a regulator of cell life and death.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). To further determine the direct regulation of ID1 by AP-1, we first searched for putative AP-1 binding sites on the human ID1 promoter. Remarkably, we identified one potential AP-1 binding site at −919 to −911 bp upstream of the ID1 ATG codon. Moreover, the putative TGACGTCA site is highly conserved among different species (Fig. 3B), suggesting that ID1 might be a direct target gene of c-Jun/c-Fos. To confirm whether the putative AP-1 binding site was involved in transactivation, we next used ID1 promoter reporter constructs containing either wild-type or mutant putative AP-1 binding site. These constructs were cotransfected with or without c-Jun/c-Fos, and then luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 3C, a 5-fold increase of wild-type putative AP-1 binding site cotransfected with c-Jun/c-Fos was observed, but no significant activation of the mutant was found, indicating that c-Jun/c-Fos activates ID1 through the conserved AP-1 binding site. We also observed a 2.5-fold increase of wild-type putative AP-1 binding site treated with etoposide, but no significant activation of the mutant, indicating that etoposide-induced ID1 promoter activation requires this conserved site (Fig. 3D). To further examine whether AP-1 regulates ID1 gene transcription in vivo, we performed a quantitative ChIP assay using samples with or without etoposide treatment and antibodies against c-Jun and c-Fos. The results showed that AP-1 specifically binds the promoter region encompassing the putative conserved AP-1 binding site of the ID1 gene especially after etoposide treatment. In contrast, IgG did not precipitate detectable DNA (Fig. 3E), providing additional evidence to support the active role of c-Jun/c-Fos in ID1 gene transcription in vivo. Recent studies demonstrated that the aberrantly high expression of ID1 in cancers is often a consequence of transcriptional induction by many proteins that are activated in a constitutive manner (25.Ma J.

Our previous study indicated that among the AP-1 family of transcription factors, c-Jun/AP-1 could bind and activate the expression of a series of genes in esophageal cancer cells (34.Luo A. Yu X.

Therefore, we speculated that transcriptional regulation by AP-1 might contribute to the underlying mechanism of ID1 involved in esophageal cancer cells response to etoposide.

It aims to deeply integrate machine intelligence with biological intelligence by connecting machines and living beings via neural interfaces, enhancing strength by combining the biological cognition capability with the machine computational capability. Cyborg intelligence is considered to be a new way to augment living beings with machine intelligence. In this paper, we build rat cyborgs to demonstrate how they can expedite the maze escape task with integration of machine intelligence. We compare the performance of maze solving by computer, by individual rats, and by computer-aided rats (i.e. rat cyborgs). They were asked to find their way from a constant entrance to a constant exit in fourteen diverse mazes. Performance of maze solving was measured by steps, coverage rates, and time spent. The experimental results with six rats and their intelligence-augmented rat cyborgs show that rat cyborgs have the best performance in escaping from mazes. These results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration for cyborg intelligence. In addition, our novel cyborg intelligent system (rat cyborg) has great potential in various applications, such as search and rescue in complex terrains."

The pig is a commonly used large animal model in diabetes research and the present study aimed to refine a model for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in young growing pigs, as well as describing intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in the same age group. The refined porcine OGTT will reflect that used in children and adolescents. Eighteen pigs were obtained one week after weaning and trained for two weeks to bottle-feed glucose solution, mimicking the human OGTT. The pigs subsequently underwent OGTT (1.75 g/kg BW) and IVGTT (0.5 g/kg BW). Blood samples were collected from indwelling vein catheters for measurements of glucose and the diabetes related hormones insulin, glucagon and active glucagon-like peptide-1. The study confirmed that pigs can be trained to bottle-feed glucose dissolved in water and thereby undergo an OGTT more similar to the human standard OGTT than previously described methods in pigs. With the refined method for OGTT, oral intake only consists of glucose and water, which is an advantage over previously described methods in pigs where glucose is given together with feed which will affect glucose absorption. Patterns of hormonal secretion in response to oral and intravenous glucose were similar to those in humans; however, the pigs were more glucose tolerant with lower insulin levels than humans. In translational medicine, this refined OGTT and IVGTT methods provide important tools in diabetes research when pigs are used as models for children and adolescents in diabetes research."
https://openalex.org/W2267894216,"Background Population attributable risk percent (PAR%) is an epidemiological tool that provides an estimate of the percent reduction in total disease burden if that disease could be entirely eliminated among a subpopulation. As such, PAR% is used to efficiently target prevention interventions. Due to significant limitations in current Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) prevention practices and the development of new approaches to prevent CDI, such as vaccination, we determined the PAR% for CDI in various subpopulations in the Medicare 5% random sample. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using the 2009 Medicare 5% random sample. Comorbidities, infections, and healthcare exposures during the 12 months prior to CDI were identified. CDI incidence and PAR% were calculated for each condition/exposure. Easy to identify subpopulations that could be targeted from prevention interventions were identified based on PAR%. Findings There were 1,465,927 Medicare beneficiaries with 9,401 CDI cases for an incidence of 677/100,000 persons. Subpopulations representing less than 15% of the entire population and with a PAR% ≥ 30% were identified. These included deficiency anemia (PAR% = 37.9%), congestive heart failure (PAR% = 30.2%), fluid and electrolyte disorders (PAR% = 29.6%), urinary tract infections (PAR% = 40.5%), pneumonia (PAR% = 35.2%), emergent hospitalization (PAR% = 48.5%) and invasive procedures (PAR% = 38.9%). Stratification by age and hospital exposures indicates hospital exposures are more strongly associated with CDI than age. Significance Small and identifiable subpopulations that account for relatively large proportions of CDI cases in the elderly were identified. These data can be used to target specific subpopulations for CDI prevention interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2252357792,"To assess the diagnostic value of dual energy spectral CT imaging for colorectal cancer grading using the quantitative iodine density measurements in both arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP).81 colorectal cancer patients were divided into two groups based on their pathological findings: a low grade group including well (n = 13) and moderately differentiated cancer (n = 24), and a high grade group including poorly differentiated (n = 42) and signet ring cell cancer (n = 2). Iodine density (ID) in the lesions was derived from the iodine-based material decomposition (MD) image and normalized to that in the psoas muscle to obtain normalized iodine density (NID). The difference in ID and NID between AP and VP was calculated.The ID and NID values of the low grade cancer group were, 14.65 ± 3.38 mg/mL and 1.70 ± 0.33 in AP, and 21.90 ± 3.11 mg/mL and 2.05 ± 0.32 in VP, respectively. The ID and NID values for the high grade cancer group were 20.63 ± 3.72 mg/mL and 2.95 ± 0.72 in AP, and 26.27 ± 3.10mg/mL and 3.51 ± 1.12 in VP, respectively. There was significant difference for ID and NID between the low grade and high grade cancer groups in both AP and VP (all p<0.001). ROC analysis indicated that NID of 1.92 in AP provided 70.3% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in differentiating low grade cancer from high grade cancer.The quantitative measurement of iodine density in AP and VP can provide useful information to differentiate low grade colorectal cancer from high grade colorectal cancer with NID in AP providing the greatest diagnostic value."

We have developed a method based on nonlinear support vector machines to elucidate the interacting residue pairs driving coreceptor usage and provide highly accurate coreceptor usage predictions. Our models utilize centroid-centroid interaction energies from computationally derived structures of the V3-loop:coreceptor complexes as primary features, while additional features based on established rules regarding V3-loop sequences are also investigated.

The present study was planned to discover the protective effect of edible extract of E. fluctuans (AEEF) against Pb toxicity.The cytoprotective role of AEEF was determined on murine hepatocytes employing MTT assay and Hoechst staining. The effects on lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, endogenous redox systems and the transcription levels of apoptotic proteins were studied after incubating the hepatocytes with AEEF (400 μg/ml) + Pb-acetate (6.8 μM). The defensive role of AEEF (100 mg/kg) against Pb-acetate (5 mg/kg) intoxication was measured in mice by in vivo assays. Biochemical, haematological and histological parameters, intracellular Pb burden and redox status were measured.AEEF exhibited a concentration dependent cytoprotective effect against Pb-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Pb-acetate incubation significantly (p < 0.01) altered the extents of ROS production ↑, protein carbonylation ↑, lipid peroxidation ↑, endogenous antioxidant enzymes ↓ and GSH ↓ in vitro. Besides, Pb-acetate significantly (p < 0.01) induced apoptosis in the hepatocytes apparent from the altered expressions of apoptotic proteins viz. Apaf-1 ↑, Bad ↑, Bcl-2 ↓, Cyt C ↑, cleaved caspases↑, Bid ↑ and Fas ↑. However, AEEF (400 μg/ml) could significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) attenuate the Pb-acetate mediated toxic manifestation in vitro. In in vivo assay, Pb-acetate (5 mg/kg) treated mice exhibited significantly (p < 0.01) high intracellular Pb content. A high Pb-burden within the tissues caused significant (p < 0.05-0.01) patho-physiological alterations viz.

The haematological and serum biochemical parameters were significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) different in the Pb-acetate treated mice. Finally, histological assessment imposed significant toxic occurrence within the organs of Pb-intoxicated animals. However, concurrent administration of AEEF (100 mg/kg) could significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) reinstate the Pb-acetate mediated toxicity.Presence of metal chelators and phyto-antioxidants within AEEF would offer overall protection through promoting Pb clearance coupled with restoring redox balance."

However, plant diversity effects on omnivores (feeding on multiple trophic levels) and their trophic and non-trophic interactions are not yet studied because appropriate methods were lacking. A promising approach is the DNA-based analysis of gut contents using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Here, we integrate NGS-based analysis into the framework of a biodiversity experiment where plant taxonomic and functional diversity were manipulated to directly assess environmental interactions involving the omnivorous ground beetle Pterostichus melanarius. Beetle regurgitates were used for NGS-based analysis with universal 18S rDNA primers for eukaryotes. We detected a wide range of taxa with the NGS approach in regurgitates, including organisms representing trophic, phoretic, parasitic, and neutral interactions with P. melanarius. Our findings suggest that the frequency of (i) trophic interactions increased with plant diversity and vegetation cover; (ii) intraguild predation increased with vegetation cover, and (iii) neutral interactions with organisms such as fungi and protists increased with vegetation cover. Experimentally manipulated plant diversity likely affects multitrophic interactions involving omnivorous consumers. Our study therefore shows that trophic and non-trophic interactions can be assessed via NGS to address fundamental questions in biodiversity research."

https://openalex.org/W2262395551,"The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical mechanisms upstream to the corticospinal motor neuron that may be associated with central fatigue and sense of effort during and after a fatigue task. We used two different isometric finger abduction protocols to examine the effects of muscle activation and fatigue the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) of 12 participants. One protocol was intended to assess the effects of muscle activation with minimal fatigue (control) and the other was intended to elicit central fatigue (fatigue). We hypothesized that high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) would hasten recovery from central fatigue and offset a fatigue-induced increase in sense of effort by facilitating the primary motor cortex (M1). Constant force-sensation contractions were used to assess sense of effort associated with muscle contraction. Paired-pulse TMS was used to assess intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) in the active M1 and interhemispheric inhibitory (IHI) was assessed to determine if compensation occurs via the resting M1. These measures were made during and after the muscle contraction protocols. Corticospinal excitability progressively declined with fatigue in the active hemisphere. ICF increased at task failure and ICI was also reduced at task failure with no changes in IHI found. Although fatigue is associated with progressive reductions in corticospinal excitability, compensatory changes in inhibition and facilitation may act within, but not between hemispheres of the M1. rTMS of the SMA following fatigue enhanced recovery of maximal voluntary force and higher levels of ICF were associated with lower sense of effort following stimulation. rTMS of the SMA may have reduced the amount of upstream drive required to maintain motor output, thus contributing to a lower sense of effort and increased rate of recovery of maximal force."

To determine whether the traps indeed have a microbiome that differs, in composition or abundance, from the microbiome in the surrounding environment, we used whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics to describe both the taxonomic and functional diversity of the Ugt microbiome. We collected U. gibba plants from their natural habitat and directly sequenced the metagenome of the Ugt microbiome and its surrounding water. The total predicted number of species in the Ugt was more than 1,100. Using pan-genome fragment recruitment analysis, we were able to identify to the species level of some key Ugt players, such as Pseudomonas monteilii.

We aimed to investigate the molecular basis underlying those differences. We collected 19 duodenal biopsies of children and adults with CD and compared the expression of 38 selected genes between each other and with the observed in 13 non-CD controls matched by age. A Bayesian methodology was used to analyze the differences of gene expression between groups. We found seven genes with a similarly altered expression in children and adults with CD when compared to controls (C2orf74, CCR6, FASLG, JAK2, IL23A, TAGAP and UBE2L3). Differences were observed in 13 genes: six genes being altered only in adults (IL1RL1, CD28, STAT3, TMEM187, VAMP3 and ZFP36L1) and two only in children (TNFSF18 and ICOSLG); and four genes showing a significantly higher alteration in adults (CCR4, IL6, IL18RAP and PLEK) and one in children (C1orf106). This is the first extensive study comparing gene expression in children and adults with CD. Differences in the expression level of several genes were found between groups, being notorious the higher alteration observed in adults. Further research is needed to evaluate the possible genetic influence underlying these changes and the specific functional consequences of the reported differences."

Redox midpoint potential (Em) is a key property of any redox active cofactor in proteins. It regulates biological functions via thermodynamic and kinetic control of electron exchange reactions. Because these reactions must take place in a variety of cellular compartments, both outside and inside the biological membrane, the structures of redox proteins have evolved to meet physicochemical requirements of these various environments to achieve assemblies that secure functionally competent Em values. Within the group of cytochromes, molecular factors that modulate Em include types of heme axial ligation (1.Wallace C.J. Clark-Lewis I. Functional role of heme ligation in cytochrome c.J. Biol.

The α-helix bundle can bind one or two hemes b. In several proteins, an assembly of two b type hemes, each facing different sides of the membrane, supports electron transfer across biological membranes crucial for energy conservation in many systems. Intriguingly, the two hemes differ largely in their redox midpoint potentials (the Em difference, ΔEm_b, is typically in the range of 100 mV); however, the thermodynamic rationale behind the existence of ΔEm_b remains unclear. This is because no general rule for the direction of ΔEm_b with respect to the direction of the electric field generated by the membrane potential or the direction of physiological electron transfer is evident (Fig. 1). The cytochrome b subunit of cytochrome bc1 (mitochondrial complex III) is a well known example of a protein supporting cross-membrane electron transfer by using an assembly of two hemes b, named heme bH and heme bL, where subscripts H and L refer to high and low potential, respectively (for recent reviews see Refs. 11.Xia D.

In living cells, the cross-membrane electron flow from heme bL to heme bH may face the barrier of the membrane potential (Fig. 1a). Thus, the fact that electrons are transferred from the cofactor of lower Em to the cofactor of higher Em provided a basis for a general assumption that ΔEm_b is one of the factors that facilitate cross-membrane electron transfer and perhaps is important in overcoming the barrier of potential (17.Shinkarev V.P.

Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics.4th Ed. Academic Press, Amsterdam2013Google Scholar). However, the contribution of ΔEm_b to the overall electron flow has not been verified experimentally. Prerequisites for such verification are variants of cytochrome bc1 with large changes in the Em of hemes b and, consequently, large changes in ΔEm_b. However, the mutations of cytochrome b tested so far either had a relatively small effect on the Em of hemes b (19.Brasseur G. Sariba A.S. Daldal F.

Here we mutated the native bis-His coordination pattern for heme bL and/or heme bH into the His-Lys pattern, to our knowledge, providing the first His-Lys coordinated hemes b in a transmembrane protein. The hemes remain low spin as in a native enzyme but have markedly elevated Em values and thus effectively modulate ΔEm_b: an increase in the Em of heme bH by 50 mV increased ΔEm_b setting the Em of heme bH above the Em of the quinone pool in the membrane, whereas an increase in the Em of heme bL by 155 mV decreased ΔEm_b to the point that the two hemes b were almost isopotential. This provided an unprecedented set of large changes in ΔEm_b for functional testing. The results offer a new perspective toward understanding the natural engineering of the cross-membrane electron transfer in cytochromes b. Rhodobacter capsulatus and Escherichia coli (HB101, DH5α) were grown in liquid or solid MPYE (mineral-peptone-yeast extract) and LB (Luria Bertani) media, at 30 and 37 °C, respectively, supplemented with appropriate antibiotics as needed. Respiratory growth of R. capsulatus strains was achieved at 30 °C in the dark under semiaerobic conditions. Photosynthetic growth abilities of mutants were tested on MPYE plates using anaerobic jars (GasPakTM EZ Anaerobe Container System; BD Biosciences) at 30 °C under continuous light. The R. capsulatus strains used were: pMTS1/MTRbc1 which overproduces wild-type cytochrome bc1 from the expression vector pMTS1 (contains a copy of petABC operon coding for all three subunits of cytochrome bc1), and MTRbc1 which is a petABC operon deletion background (23.Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Size of the amino acid side chain at position 158 of cytochrome b is critical for an active cytochrome bc1 complex and for photosynthetic growth of Rhodobacter capsulatus.Proc. Natl. Acad.

The mutagenized pMTS1 derivatives were introduced to R. capsulatus MTRbc1 via triparental crosses as described (23.Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F.

Plasmid pPET1 (a derivative of pBR322 containing a wild-type copy of petABC) was used as a template for PCR and in some of the subcloning procedures. Spontaneous Ps+ revertant of the H212N mutant originally described in Ref. 22.Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Reversible redox energy coupling in electron transfer chains.Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar was obtained on MPYE plate containing tetracycline after ∼7 days of cultivation under photosynthetic conditions. The DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid DNA isolated from the revertant strain revealed a single base pair change replacing the mutated Asn into Lys at position 212 of cytochrome b. The XmaI/SfuI fragment containing the reversion (mutation H212K), and no other mutations was exchanged with its counterpart on expression vector pMTS1 carrying the wild-type copy of the petABC operon. Expression of this vector in the MTRbc1 background strain confirmed that cells bearing single mutation H212K display the photosynthetically competent Ps+ phenotype. The Ps+ reversion H212K occurred also in the double mutant A181T/H212N cultivated on MPYE plate containing kanamycin (in this case H212N in the cytochrome b subunit was accompanied by a mutation A181T in cytochrome c1 described originally in Ref. (24.Cieluch E. Pietryga K. Sarewicz M. Osyczka A.

Acta. 2010; 1797: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). Because A181T/H212N, unlike original H212N, contained cytochrome b already equipped with the Strep-tag II attached to its carboxyl end, the plasmid obtained from the revertant of A181T/H212N was used to construct the mutants used in further analysis. First, the XmaI/SfuI fragment containing the reversion (H212K) and the sequence coding for Strep-tag II (ST), and no other mutations were exchanged with its counterpart on expression vector pMTS1 carrying the wild-type copy of the petABC operon. This created pMTS1-ST-H212K. Second, the same XmaI/SfuI fragment was cloned into pPET1 creating pPET1-ST-H212K. Mutation H198K and the double mutation H212K/H198K were constructed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using pPET1-ST (25.Czapla M. Borek A. Sarewicz M. Osyczka A.

After sequencing, XmaI/SfuI fragments of pPET1 plasmids bearing the desired mutations, and no other mutations were exchanged with their wild-type counterparts in pMTS1. This created the plasmids pMTS1-ST-H198K and pMTS1-ST-H212K/H198K. Plasmids pMTS1-ST-H212K, pMTS1-ST-H198K, and pMTS1-ST-H212K/H198K were inserted into R. capsulatus MTRBC1 cells, creating mutants H212K, H198K, and H212K/H198K, respectively. These mutants are listed in Table 1. In each case, the presence of introduced mutations was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA reisolated from the mutated R. capsulatus strains.TABLE 1Selected properties of wild-type and Lys mutantsForm of bc1PhenotypeEm7EPR gz valueRates of hemes b reductionSteady-state activitybLbHbLbH (+antimycin)pH 6pH 7pH 9mVs−1s−1WTPs+−92803.783.44 (3.47)56610511791149 ± 7H212KPs+−861303.783.22/3.15 (3.26)479822121 ± 6H198KPs+65583.223.44 (3.47)3927701506118 ± 5H212K/H198KPs+∼72∼3.2∼3.2 (∼3.24)420706154891 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Chromatophore membranes were isolated from R. capsulatus as described previously (26.Valkova-Valchanova M.B.

The cytochrome bc1 complexes were isolated from detergent-solubilized chromatophores by affinity chromatography using the procedure described previously (27.Czapla M. Borek A. Sarewicz M. Osyczka A.

SDS-PAGE of purified complexes was performed as described before (28.Osyczka A. Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Darrouzet E. Daldal F.

Optical spectra measurements of isolated complexes and determination of protein concentration were performed on UV-2450 Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Cytochrome bc1 samples were suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% (m/m) dodecyl maltoside, and 1 mm EDTA, an appropriate amount of ferricyanide was added to fully oxidize complexes; then solid ascorbate and solid sodium dithionite were added to reduce samples, and spectra were recorded right after oxidation and after each step of reduction. Concentration of cytochrome bc1 was determined as described (26.Valkova-Valchanova M.B. Saribas A.S. Gibney B.R. Dutton P.L. Daldal F.

EPR measurements were performed on Bruker Elexys E580 spectrometer. X-band CW-EPR spectra of hemes were measured at 10 K, using SHQE0511 resonator combined with ESR900 Oxford Instruments cryostat unit, using 1.595 mT modulation amplitude, and 1.543 milliwatt of microwave power. For EPR measurements, cytochrome bc1 samples were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.01% (m/m) dodecyl maltoside, and 1 mm EDTA. Final concentration of cytochrome bc1 in EPR samples was 50 μm. Antimycin A was used in 5-fold molar excess over the concentration of cytochrome bc1. Midpoint potentials of hemes b were determined by dark equilibrium redox titrations on chromatophores according to the method described in Ref. (29.Dutton P.L. Redox potentiometry: determination of midpoint potentials of oxidation-reduction components of biological electron transfer systems.Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Chromatophores were suspended in argon-equilibrated 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA. Immediately before the titration, the following redox mediators were added: 100 μm tetrachlorohydroquinone, 100 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl phenylenediamine (Em7 260 mV), 100 μm 1,2-naphtoquinone-4-sulfonate (Em7 210 mV), 100 μm 1,2-naphtoquinone (Em7 130 mV), 50 μm phenazine methosulfate (Em7 80 mV), 50 μm phenazine ethosulfate (Em7 50 mV), 100 μm duroquinone (Em7 5mV), 30 μm indigotrisulfonate (Em7 = −90 mV), 100 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone (Em7 = −152 mV), 100 μm anthroquinone-2-sulfonate (Em7 = −225 mV), and 100 μm benzyl viologen (Em7 = −374 mV). Dithionite and ferricyanide were used to adjust ambient redox potential. During the titrations, samples of 150–200 μl were taken and transferred to EPR tubes anaerobically and frozen by immersion into cold ethanol. The Em7 values of hemes b were determined by fitting the amplitudes of appropriate EPR gz transitions to the Nernst equation for one-electron couple (for WT, H212K, and H198K) or for two one-electron couples (in case of H212K/H198K mutant). Measurements of flash-induced turnover kinetics of cytochrome bc1 were performed on a home-built double wavelength time-resolved spectrophotometer as described in previous work (24.Cieluch E. Pietryga K. Sarewicz M. Osyczka A. Visualizing changes in electron distribution in coupled chains of cytochrome bc1 by modifying barrier for electron transfer between the FeS cluster and heme c1.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Chromatophores for measurements were suspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 3.5 μm valinomycin, and redox mediators: 7 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, 1 μm phenazine methosulfate, 1 μm phenazine ethosulfate, 5.5 μm 1,2-naphthoquinone, and 5.5 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (valinomycin and redox mediators were added immediately before the measurement). Dithionite and ferricyanide were used to adjust ambient redox potential. Inhibitors antimycin A and myxothiazol were used at final concentration of 7 μm. Transient hemes b reduction kinetics were followed at 560–570 nm (for WT and H198K) or 557–570 nm (for H212K and H212K/H198K). Transient hemes c oxidation and rereduction kinetics were followed at 550–540 nm. Single flash activation measurements were initiated by a short saturating flash (10 μs) from a xenon lamp, and multiple flash activation measurements were initiated by a series of short (10 μs) saturating flashes every 20 ms. In order to measure kinetics in the presence of the membrane potential, valinomycin was omitted. Rates of flash-induced heme b reduction were determined by fitting transient kinetics data to a single exponential equation. Steady-state enzymatic activities of cytochrome bc1 complexes in chromatophores were determined spectroscopically by the decylubiquinol-dependent reduction of bovine heart cytochrome c (Sigma-Aldrich) as described before (23.Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Size of the amino acid side chain at position 158 of cytochrome b is critical for an active cytochrome bc1 complex and for photosynthetic growth of Rhodobacter capsulatus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Conditions used in assays were as follows: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm decylubiquinol, 20 μm oxidized cytochrome c. Errors were calculated as standard deviation of the mean of nine measurements. Chromatophores were treated with KCN (final concentration in sample was 0.5 mm) before experiments. Decylubiquinol was obtained as described (30.Sarewicz M. Dutka M. Pintscher S. Osyczka A. Triplet state of the semiquinone-Rieske cluster as an intermediate of electronic bifurcation catalyzed by cytochrome bc1.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 6388-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Changes in the coordination pattern of heme iron are expected to exert a large influence on the redox properties of hemes (1.Wallace C.J. Clark-Lewis I. Functional role of heme ligation in cytochrome c.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3852-3861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to impose large shifts in Em values of hemes b in cytochrome b, we created three variants in which one of the His ligands to heme iron was replaced by Lys (Lys mutants): single mutants H212K (for heme bH) and H198K (for heme bL) and the double mutant H212K/H198K combining both single mutations (Fig. 2a). The mutated complexes contained all three catalytic subunits, as indicated by the SDS electrophoretic profiles (Fig. 3a). Optical (UV-visible), and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) showed that the mutants contained all redox active cofactors: heme c1, hemes b (bL and bH) and 2Fe-2S cluster (Figs. 2b and 3, b and c). Although the spectral and redox properties of 2Fe-2S and heme c1 remained unchanged in the mutants, the properties of hemes b were modified. We emphasize the results of EPR analysis (Fig. 2b), which in this case is most informative because, unlike UV-visible spectroscopy, it allows for a complete spectral separation of g transitions originating from each of the hemes b: in native enzyme g = 3.78 and 3.44, corresponding to gz transition of heme bL and heme bH, respectively (31.Finnegan M.G. Knaff D.B. Qin H. Gray K.A. Daldal F. Yu L. Yu C.A. Kleis-San Francisco S. Johnson M.K. Axial heme ligation in the cytochrome bc1 complexes of mitochondrial and photosynthetic membranes. A near-infrared magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance study.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutationally imposed changes in ligation pattern resulted in the disappearance of the gz transition of the targeted heme at the position characteristic for a native enzyme with concomitant appearance of new transitions at g = 3.22 and 3.15 (Fig. 2b, black). More specifically, these new transitions replaced g = 3.78 in H198K, g = 3.44 in H212K, and both g = 3.78 and 3.44 in the double mutant H212K/H198K. In general, these shifts reflect a lowering of the symmetry and changes from a highly axial to a more rhombic low spin heme (32.Zoppellaro G. Bren K.L. Ensign A.A. Harbitz E. Kaur R. Hersleth H.-P. Ryde U. Hederstedt L. Andersson K.K. Studies of ferric heme proteins with highly anisotropic/highly axial low spin (S = 1/2) electron paramagnetic resonance signals with bis-histidine and histidine-methionine axial iron coordination.Biopolymers. 2009; 91: 1064-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The new transitions g = 3.22 and 3.15 are assigned to gz transitions of low spin hemes b coordinated by His-Lys. Support for this assignment comes from the differential effect of antimycin, an inhibitor that binds to the Qi site in the proximity of heme bH, and is known to affect the EPR spectrum of heme bH (33.Robertson D.E. Ding H. Chelminski P.R. Slaughter C. Hsu J. Moomaw C. Tokito M. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Hydroubiquinone-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus: definition of a minimal, functional isolated preparation.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Antimycin clearly affects the g = 3.22 and 3.15 of heme bH in H212K and H212K/H198K, whereas in H198K it has a weak or no effect (Fig. 2b, gray). In H212K/H198K, for which both hemes bL and bH contribute to 3.22 and 3.15 transitions, the effect of antimycin is intermediary between the largest and smallest effect seen in H212K and H198K, respectively. Dark equilibrium redox titrations revealed that changing the ligation pattern from bis-His to His-Lys in hemes b leads to a significant increase in their Em values. This increase reaches 50 mV for heme bH in H212K and almost 160 mV for heme bL in H198K (Fig. 4 and Table 1). At the same time, there was no significant change of Em (only ∼10 mV increase was observed in Em for heme bL in H212K or 20 mV decrease of Em for heme bH in H198K) in the heme that was not subject to modification in these mutants. A large increase in the Em of just one heme (bL or bH) effectively modulated ΔEm_b in those mutants (Fig. 2a). In H212K ΔEm_b was increased, and Em of heme bH rose above the Em of quinone pool in the membrane (34.Takamiya K.I. Dutton P.L. Ubiquinone in Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides: some thermodynamic properties.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35.Zhang H. Chobot S.E. Osyczka A.

In H198K ΔEm_b was decreased to the point that both hemes became almost isopotential. In H212K/H198K, both His-Lys ligated hemes showed Em of ∼72 mV. This means that only heme bL elevated its Em. Consequently, the ΔEm_b in this muta"
https://openalex.org/W2252560427,"Polydactyly is one of the most common hereditary congenital limb malformations in chickens and other vertebrates. The zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence (ZRS) is critical for the development of polydactyly. The causative mutation of polydactyly in the Silkie chicken has been mapped to the ZRS; however, the causative mutations of other chicken breeds are yet to be established. To understand whether the same mutation decides the polydactyly phenotype in other chicken breeds, we detected the single-nucleotide polymorphism in 26 different chicken breeds, specifically, 24 Chinese indigenous breeds and 2 European breeds. The mutation was found to have fully penetrated chickens with polydactyly in China, indicating that it is causative for polydactyly in Chinese indigenous chickens. In comparison, the mutation showed no association with polydactyly in Houdan chickens, which originate from France, Europe. Based on the different morphology of polydactyly in Chinese and European breeds, we assumed that the trait might be attributable to different genetic foundations. Therefore, we subsequently performed genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) to locate the region associated with polydactyly. As a result, a ~0.39 Mb genomic region on GGA2p was identified. The region contains six candidate genes, with the causative mutation found in Chinese indigenous breeds also being located in this region. Our results demonstrate that polydactyly in chickens from China and Europe is caused by two independent mutation events that are closely located in the chicken genome."
https://openalex.org/W2267307328,"Teriparatide (TPTD) is an anabolic agent indicated for the treatment of severely osteoporotic patients who are at high risk of fragility fractures. The originally approved duration of TPTD treatment in several regions, including Europe, was 18 months. However, studies of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) showed additional benefit when treatment is continued beyond 18 months, and the drug is currently licenced for 24 months. Improvements in cortical structure at the proximal femur have already been shown in patients given TPTD for 24 months using quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Here, we investigate whether cortical and endocortical trabecular changes differ between an 18- and 24-month treatment.Since an 18- versus 24-month TPTD study using QCT has not been conducted, we studied combined QCT data from four previous clinical trials. Combined femoral QCT data from three 18-month TPTD studies ('18-month group') were compared with data from a fourth 24-month trial ('24-month group'). Cortical parameters were measured over the entire proximal femur which allowed for a comparison of the mean changes as well as a visual comparison of the colour maps of changes after 18 and 24 months TPTD.For both the combined 18-month group and the 24-month group, overall cortical thickness and endocortical trabecular density increased, while overall cortical bone mineral density decreased. While the changes in the 24-month group were of greater magnitude compared to the 18-month group, the differences were only significant for the endocortical trabecular density (ECTD), corrected for age, weight, femoral neck T-score, total hip T-score and the baseline mean ECTD.Although the combination of data from different clinical trials is not optimal, these data support the concept that the duration of TPTD in the 18-24 month phase is of clinical relevance when considering improvement in hip structure."
https://openalex.org/W2281119568,"Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is an inherited multisystem premature aging disorder with characteristic skin and mucosal findings as well as a predisposition to cancer and bone marrow failure. DC arises due to gene mutations associated with the telomerase complex or telomere maintenance, resulting in critically shortened telomeres. The pathogenesis of DC, as well as several congenital bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, converges on the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and subsequent elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Historically, DC patients have had poor outcomes following bone marrow transplantation (BMT), perhaps as a consequence of an underlying DNA hypersensitivity to cytotoxic agents. Previously, we demonstrated an activated DDR and increased ROS, augmented by chemotherapy and radiation, in somatic cells isolated from DC patients with a mutation in the RNA component of telomerase, TERC. The current study was undertaken to determine whether previous findings related to ROS and DDR in TERC patients' cells could be extended to other DC mutations. Of particular interest was whether an antioxidant approach could counter increased ROS and decrease DC pathologies. To test this, we examined lymphocytes from DC patients from different DC mutations (TERT, TINF2, and TERC) for the presence of an active DDR and increased ROS. All DC mutations led to increased steady-state p53 (2-fold to 10-fold) and ROS (1.5-fold to 2-fold). Upon exposure to ionizing radiation (XRT), DC cells increased in both DDR and ROS to a significant degree. Exposing DC cells to hydrogen peroxide also revealed that DC cells maintain a significant oxidant burden compared to controls (1.5-fold to 3-fold). DC cell culture supplemented with N-acetylcysteine, or alternatively grown in low oxygen, afforded significant proliferative benefits (proliferation: maximum 2-fold increase; NAC: 5-fold p53 decrease; low oxygen: maximum 3.5-fold p53 decrease). Together, our data supports a mechanism whereby telomerase deficiency and subsequent shortened telomeres initiate a DDR and create a pro-oxidant environment, especially in cells carrying the TINF2 mutations. Finally, the ameliorative effects of antioxidants in vitro suggest this could translate to therapeutic benefits in DC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2250003255,"Participation in conferences is an important part of every scientific career. Conferences provide an opportunity for a fast dissemination of latest results, discussion and exchange of ideas, and broadening of scientists' collaboration network. The decision to participate in a conference depends on several factors like the location, cost, popularity of keynote speakers, and the scientist's association with the community. Here we discuss and formulate the problem of discovering how a scientist's previous participation affects her/his future participations in the same conference series. We develop a stochastic model to examine scientists' participation patterns in conferences and compare our model with data from six conferences across various scientific fields and communities. Our model shows that the probability for a scientist to participate in a given conference series strongly depends on the balance between the number of participations and non-participations during his/her early connections with the community.

Although POSs are exclusively found in the cytosol, their intracellular fates remain unclear. Our findings indicate that POSs are catabolized via a non-lysosomal glycan degradation pathway that involves a cytosolic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase). Quantitative and structural analyses of POSs revealed that ablation of the ENGase results in the significant accumulation of POSs with a hexasaccharide structure composed of Manα1,2Manα1,3(Manα1,6)Manβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc. In vitro ENGase assays revealed that the presence of an α1,2-linked mannose residue facilitates the hydrolysis of POSs by the ENGase. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses and fluorescent labeling experiments show that such POSs contain one phosphate group at the reducing end. These results indicate that ENGase efficiently hydrolyzes POSs that are larger than Man4GlcNAc2-P, generating GlcNAc-1-P and neutral Gn1-type free oligosaccharides. These results provide insight into important aspects of the generation and degradation of POSs.

https://openalex.org/W2274088384,"Laser refractive surgery for myopia increases the eye’s higher-order wavefront aberrations (HOA’s). However, little is known about the impact of such optical degradation on post-operative image quality (IQ) of these eyes. This study determined the relation between HOA’s and IQ parameters (peak IQ, dioptric focus that maximized IQ and depth of focus) derived from psychophysical (logMAR acuity) and computational (logVSOTF) through-focus curves in 45 subjects (18 to 31yrs) before and 1-month after refractive surgery and in 40 age-matched emmetropic controls. Computationally derived peak IQ and its best focus were negatively correlated with the RMS deviation of all HOA’s (HORMS) (r≥-0.5; p<0.001 for all). Computational depth of focus was positively correlated with HORMS (r≥0.55; p<0.001 for all) and negatively correlated with peak IQ (r≥-0.8; p<0.001 for all). All IQ parameters related to logMAR acuity were poorly correlated with HORMS (r≤|0.16|; p>0.16 for all). Increase in HOA’s after refractive surgery is therefore associated with a decline in peak IQ and a persistence of this sub-standard IQ over a larger dioptric range, vis-à-vis, before surgery and in age-matched controls. This optical deterioration however does not appear to significantly alter psychophysical IQ, suggesting minimal impact of refractive surgery on the subject’s ability to resolve spatial details and their tolerance to blur."
https://openalex.org/W2278836975,"Fluoride is a ubiquitous natural substance that is often used in dental products to prevent dental caries. The biphasic actions of fluoride imply that excessive systemic exposure to fluoride can cause harmful effects on embryonic development in both animal models and humans. However, insufficient information is available on the effects of fluoride on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which is a novel in vitro humanized model for analyzing the embryotoxicities of chemical compounds. Therefore, we investigated the effects of sodium fluoride (NaF) on the proliferation, differentiation and viability of H9 hESCs. For the first time, we showed that 1 mM NaF did not significantly affect the proliferation of hESCs but did disturb the gene expression patterns of hESCs during embryoid body (EB) differentiation. Higher doses of NaF (2 mM and above) markedly decreased the viability and proliferation of hESCs. The mode and underlying mechanism of high-dose NaF-induced cell death were further investigated by assessing the sub-cellular morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase activities, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). High-dose NaF caused the death of hESCs via apoptosis in a caspase-mediated but ROS-independent pathway, coupled with an increase in the phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) levels. Pretreatment with a p-JNK-specific inhibitor (SP600125) could effectively protect hESCs from NaF-induced cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that NaF might interfere with early human embryogenesis by disturbing the specification of the three germ layers as well as osteogenic lineage commitment and that high-dose NaF could cause apoptosis through a JNK-dependent pathway in hESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2412683549,"Small peptides isolated from the venom of the marine snails belonging to the genus Conus have been largely studied because of their therapeutic value. These peptides can be classified in two groups. The largest one is composed by peptides rich in disulfide bonds, and referred to as conotoxins. Despite the importance of conotoxins given their pharmacology value, little is known about the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) enzymes that are required to catalyze their correct folding. To discover the PDIs that may participate in the folding and structural maturation of conotoxins, the transcriptomes of the venom duct of four different species of Conus from the peninsula of Baja California (Mexico) were assembled. Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed for each species and sequenced using a Genome Analyzer Illumina platform. The raw RNA-seq data was converted into transcript sequences using Trinity, a de novo assembler that allows the grouping of reads into contigs without a reference genome. An N50 value of 605 was established as a reference for future assemblies of Conus transcriptomes using this software. Transdecoder was used to extract likely coding sequences from Trinity transcripts, and PDI-specific sequence motif “APWCGHCK” was used to capture potential PDIs. An in silico analysis was performed to characterize the group of PDI protein sequences encoded by the duct-transcriptome of each species. The computational approach entailed a structural homology characterization, based on the presence of functional Thioredoxin-like domains. Four different PDI families were characterized, which are constituted by a total of 41 different gene sequences. The sequences had an average of 65% identity with other PDIs. Using MODELLER 9.14, the homology-based three-dimensional structure prediction of a subset of the sequences reported, showed the expected thioredoxin fold which was confirmed by a “simulated annealing” method."
https://openalex.org/W2407282735,"Phenological traits of plants, such as flowering time, are linked to growth phase transition. Thus, phenological traits often influence other traits through the modification of the duration of growth period. This influence is a nuisance in plant breeding because it hampers genetic evaluation of the influenced traits. Genetic effects on the influenced traits have two components, one that directly affects the traits and one that indirectly affects the traits via the phenological trait. These cannot be distinguished by phenotypic evaluation and ordinary linear regression models. Consequently, if a phenological trait is modified by introgression or editing of the responsible genes, the phenotypes of the influenced traits can change unexpectedly. To uncover the influence of the phenological trait and evaluate the direct genetic effects on the influenced traits, we developed a nonlinear structural equation (NSE) incorporating a nonlinear influence of the phenological trait. We applied the NSE to real data for cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.): days to heading (DH) as a phenological trait and culm length (CL) as the influenced trait. This showed that CL of the cultivars that showed extremely early heading was shortened by the strong influence of DH. In a simulation study, it was shown that the NSE was able to infer the nonlinear influence and direct genetic effects with reasonable accuracy. However, the NSE failed to infer the linear influence in this study. When no influence was simulated, an ordinary bi-trait linear model (OLM) tended to infer the genetic effects more accurately. In such cases, however, by comparing the NSE and OLM using an information criterion, we could assess whether the nonlinear assumption of the NSE was appropriate for the data analyzed. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the NSE in revealing the phenotypic influence of phenological traits."
https://openalex.org/W2271632554,"Stem-cell-based therapies are regarded as promising treatments for neurological disorders, and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a feasible source of clinical application of stem cell. Recent studies have shown that stem cells have a therapeutic potential for use in the treatment of various illnesses through paracrine action. To examine the effects of cell components of ASCs on neural stem cells (NSCs), we treated cell-free extracts of ASCs (CFE-ASCs) containing various components with brain-derived NSCs. To elucidate the effects of CFE-ASCs in NSC proliferation, we treated mouse subventricular zone-derived cultured NSCs with various doses of CFE-ASCs. As a result, CFE-ASCs were found to induce the proliferation of NSCs under conditions of growth factor deprivation in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). CFE-ASCs increase the expression of neuron and astrocyte differentiation markers including Tuj-1 (p<0.05) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (p<0.01) without altering the cell's fate in differentiating NSCs. In addition, treatment with CFE-ASCs induces an increase in neurite numbers (p<0.01) and lengths of NSCs (p<0.05). Furthermore, CFE-ASCs rescue the hydrogen peroxide-induced reduction of NSCs' viability (p<0.05) and neurite branching (p<0.01). Findings from our study indicate that CFE-ASCs support the survival, proliferation and differentiation of NSCs accompanied with neurite outgrowth, suggesting that CFE-ASCs can modulate neurogenesis in the central nervous system."

Chronic Otitis Media with effusion (COME) develops after sustained inflammation and is characterized by secretory middle ear epithelial metaplasia and effusion, most frequently mucoid. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), the most common acute Otitis Media (OM) pathogen, is postulated to promote middle ear epithelial remodeling in the progression of OM from acute to chronic. The goals of this study were to examine histopathological and quantitative proteomic epithelial effects of NTHi challenge in a murine middle ear epithelial cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2258496348,"Objectives Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute pediatric vasculitis of infants and young children with unknown etiology and no specific laboratory-based test to identify. A specific molecular diagnostic test is urgently needed to support the clinical decision of proper medical intervention, preventing subsequent complications of coronary artery aneurysms. We used a simple and low-cost colorimetric sensor array to address the lack of a specific diagnostic test to differentiate KD from febrile control (FC) patients with similar rash/fever illnesses. Study Design Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected for subjects with KD and FCs under standard protocol. After screening using a genetic algorithm, eleven compounds including metalloporphyrins, pH indicators, redox indicators and solvatochromic dye categories, were selected from our chromatic compound library (n = 190) to construct a colorimetric sensor array for diagnosing KD. Quantitative color difference analysis led to a decision-tree-based KD diagnostic algorithm. Results This KD sensing array allowed the identification of 94% of KD subjects (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area under the curve [AUC] 0.981) in the training set (33 KD, 33 FC) and 94% of KD subjects (ROC AUC: 0.873) in the testing set (16 KD, 17 FC). Color difference maps reconstructed from the digital images of the sensing compounds demonstrated distinctive patterns differentiating KD from FC patients. Conclusions The colorimetric sensor array, composed of common used chemical compounds, is an easily accessible, low-cost method to realize the discrimination of subjects with KD from other febrile illness."
https://openalex.org/W2278294641,"Recently, with the development of next generation sequencing (NGS), the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and NGS, namely ChIP-seq, has become a powerful technique to capture potential genomic binding sites of regulatory factors, histone modifications and chromatin accessible regions. For most researchers, additional information including genomic variations on the TF binding site, allele frequency of variation between different populations, variation associated disease, and other neighbour TF binding sites are essential to generate a proper hypothesis or a meaningful conclusion. Many ChIP-seq datasets had been deposited on the public domain to help researchers make new discoveries. However, researches are often intimidated by the complexity of data structure and largeness of data volume. Such information would be more useful if they could be combined or downloaded with ChIP-seq data. To meet such demands, we built a webtool: ePIgenomic ANNOtation tool (ePIANNO, http://epianno.stat.sinica.edu.tw/index.html). ePIANNO is a web server that combines SNP information of populations (1000 Genomes Project) and gene-disease association information of GWAS (NHGRI) with ChIP-seq (hmChIP, ENCODE, and ROADMAP epigenomics) data. ePIANNO has a user-friendly website interface allowing researchers to explore, navigate, and extract data quickly. We use two examples to demonstrate how users could use functions of ePIANNO webserver to explore useful information about TF related genomic variants. Users could use our query functions to search target regions, transcription factors, or annotations. ePIANNO may help users to generate hypothesis or explore potential biological functions for their studies."
https://openalex.org/W2391556666,"Recent studies have provided evidence that depolarization in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ can trigger Ca2+ release from internal stores in a variety of neuron subtypes. Here we examine whether postganglionic sympathetic neurons are able to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores in response to depolarization, independent of Ca2+ influx. We measured changes in cytosolic ΔF/F0 in individual fluo-4 -loaded sympathetic ganglion neurons in response to maintained K+ depolarization in the presence (2 mM) and absence of extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e). Progressive elevations in extracellular [K+]e caused increasing membrane depolarizations that were of similar magnitude in 0 and 2 mM [Ca2+]e. Peak amplitude of ΔF/F0 transients in 2 mM [Ca2+]e increased in a linear fashion as the membrane become more depolarized. Peak elevations of ΔF/F0 in 0 mM [Ca2+]e were ~5-10% of those evoked at the same membrane potential in 2 mM [Ca2+]e and exhibited an inverse U-shaped dependence on voltage. Both the rise and decay of ΔF/F0 transients in 0 mM [Ca2+]e were slower than those of ΔF/F0 transients evoked in 2 mM [Ca2+]e. Rises in ΔF/F0 evoked by high [K+]e in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ were blocked by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, or the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonists 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and xestospongin C, but not by extracellular Cd2+, the dihydropyridine antagonist nifedipine, or by ryanodine at concentrations that caused depletion of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. These results support the notion that postganglionic sympathetic neurons possess the ability to release Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive internal stores in response to membrane depolarization, independent of Ca2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W2261268052,"Male circumcision (MC) has been shown to reduce the risk of male genital diseases. MC is not commonly practiced among Chinese males and little is known about the factors associated with their knowledge of and willingness for MC. This study was to explore the knowledge regarding the foreskin among Chinese males and to identify factors associated with their willingness to undergo circumcision.A total of 237 patients with redundant prepuce/phimosis were interviewed through face-to-face interviews. The items on the questionnaire included: demographics, an objective scale assessing knowledge about the foreskin, willingness to have MC, the attitudes of sexual partners and doctors toward redundant prepuce/phimosis, and the approaches that patients used to acquire knowledge regarding the prepuce. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to identify factors that are associated with willingness to be circumcised (WTC).A total of 212 patients completed the interview. Multivariable logistic regression showed that three factors were significantly associated with WTC: being married (OR = 0.43), perceiving redundant prepuce/phimosis as a disease (OR = 1.93), and if a patient's partner supported MC (OR = 1.39). 58% (n = 122) had received information about the foreskin from another party: 18% (n = 37) from school, 8% (n = 17) from family, 17% (n = 36) from friends, 27% (n = 57) from health care providers. About 4% (n = 8) believed that their partners disliked their redundant prepuce/phimosis. 20% (n = 42) had received doctors' advice to undergo circumcision.Knowledge about the foreskin was low among Chinese males. Our study elucidates the factors associated with WTC and suggests that more education of the population about the foreskin can help improve the recognition of a correctible abnormality and help patients assess the potential role of MC in their health."
https://openalex.org/W2254857449,"Recombination has essential roles in increasing genetic variability within a population and in ensuring successful meiotic events. The objective of this study is to (i) infer the population-scaled recombination rate (ρ), and (ii) identify and characterize regions of increased recombination rate for the domestic cat, Felis silvestris catus. SNPs (n = 701) were genotyped in twenty-two East Asian feral cats (random bred). The SNPs covered ten different chromosomal regions (A1, A2, B3, C2, D1, D2, D4, E2, F2, X) with an average region size of 850 Kb and an average SNP density of 70 SNPs/region. The Bayesian method in the program inferRho was used to infer regional population recombination rates and hotspots localities. The regions exhibited variable population recombination rates and four decisive recombination hotspots were identified on cat chromosome A2, D1, and E2 regions. As a description of the identified hotspots, no correlation was detected between the GC content and the locality of recombination spots, and the hotspots enclosed L2 LINE elements and MIR and tRNA-Lys SINE elements."
