https://openalex.org/W1495409864,"Pain-producing heat is detected by several classes of nociceptive sensory neuron that differ in their thermal response thresholds1,2,3. The cloned capsaicin receptor, also known as the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), is a heat-gated ion channel that has been proposed to mediate responses of small-diameter sensory neurons to moderate (43 °C) thermal stimuli4,5. VR1 is also activated by protons, indicating that it may participate in the detection of noxious thermal and chemical stimuli in vivo. Here we identify a structurally related receptor, VRL-1, that does not respond to capsaicin, acid or moderate heat. Instead, VRL-1 is activated by high temperatures, with a threshold of ∼52 °C. Within sensory ganglia, VRL-1 is most prominently expressed by a subset of medium- to large-diameter neurons, making it a candidate receptor for transducing high-threshold heat responses in this class of cells. VRL-1 transcripts are not restricted to the sensory nervous system, indicating that this channel may be activated by stimuli other than heat. We propose that responses to noxious heat involve these related, but distinct, ion-channel subtypes that together detect a range of stimulus intensities."

In seven affected families, we found six different missense mutations of the 55 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), five of which disrupt conserved extracellular disulfide bonds. Soluble plasma TNFR1 levels in patients were approximately half normal. Leukocytes bearing a C52F mutation showed increased membrane TNFR1 and reduced receptor cleavage following stimulation. We propose that the autoinflammatory phenotype results from impaired downregulation of membrane TNFR1 and diminished shedding of potentially antagonistic soluble receptor. TNFR1-associated periodic syndromes (TRAPS) establish an important class of mutations in TNF receptors. Detailed analysis of one such mutation suggests impaired cytokine receptor clearance as a novel mechanism of disease."

https://openalex.org/W2150796852,"Proper ion channel function often requires specific combinations of pore-forming α and regulatory β subunits, but little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the surface expression of different channel combinations. Our studies of ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) trafficking reveal an essential quality control function for a trafficking motif present in each of the α (Kir6.1/2) and β (SUR1) subunits of the KATP complex. We show that this novel motif for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention/retrieval is required at multiple stages of KATP assembly to restrict surface expression to fully assembled and correctly regulated octameric channels. We conclude that exposure of a three amino acid motif (RKR) can explain how assembly of an ion channel complex is coupled to intracellular trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W1481925502,"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) seems to be the principal mechanism whereby anti-oncogenic therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation effect their responses. Resistance to apoptosis, therefore, is probably a principal mechanism whereby tumors are able to overcome these cancer therapies. The transcription factor NF-κB is activated by chemotherapy and by irradiation in some cancer cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB in vitro leads to enhanced apoptosis in response to a variety of different stimuli. We show here that inhibition of NF-κB through the adenoviral delivery of a modified form of IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB, sensitizes chemoresistant tumors to the apoptotic potential of TNFκ and of the chemotherapeutic compound CPT-11, resulting in tumor regression. These results demonstrate that the activation of NF-κB in response to chemotherapy is a principal mechanism of inducible tumor chemoresistance, and establish the inhibition of NF-κB as a new approach to adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2087062865,"Elevated intracellular Ca2+ triggers inactivation of L-type calcium channels, providing negative Ca2+ feedback in many cells. Ca2+ binding to the main α1C channel subunit has been widely proposed to initiate such Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Here, we find that overexpression of mutant, Ca2+-insensitive calmodulin (CaM) ablates Ca2+-dependent inactivation in a “dominant-negative” manner. This result demonstrates that CaM is the actual Ca2+ sensor for inactivation and suggests that CaM is constitutively tethered to the channel complex. Inactivation is likely to occur via Ca2+-dependent interaction of tethered CaM with an IQ-like motif on the carboxyl tail of α1C. CaM also binds to analogous IQ regions of N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels, suggesting that CaM-mediated effects may be widespread in the calcium channel family."
https://openalex.org/W2122571070,"We have determined two different structures of PcrA DNA helicase complexed with the same single strand tailed DNA duplex, providing snapshots of different steps on the catalytic pathway. One of the structures is of a complex with a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP and is thus a “substrate” complex. The other structure contains a bound sulphate ion that sits in a position equivalent to that occupied by the phosphate ion produced after ATP hydrolysis, thereby mimicking a “product” complex. In both complexes, the protein is monomeric. Large and distinct conformational changes occur on binding DNA and the nucleotide cofactor. Taken together, these structures provide evidence against an “active rolling” model for helicase action but are instead consistent with an “inchworm” mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1513230591,"We measured endogenous cannabinoid release in dorsal striatum of freely moving rats by microdialysis and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Neural activity stimulated the release of anandamide, but not of other endogenous cannabinoids such as 2-arachidonylglycerol. Moreover, anandamide release was increased eightfold over baseline after local administration of the D2-like (D2, D3, D4) dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole, a response that was prevented by the D2-like receptor antagonist raclopride. Administration of the D1-like (D1, D5) receptor agonist SKF38393 had no such effect. These results suggest that functional interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may contribute to striatal signaling. In agreement with this hypothesis, pretreatment with the cannabinoid antagonist SR141716A enhanced the stimulation of motor behavior elicited by systemic administration of quinpirole. The endocannabinoid system therefore may act as an inhibitory feedback mechanism countering dopamine-induced facilitation of motor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2020678193,"Nuclear receptors play critical roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. We report the isolation and functional characterization of a novel transcriptional coactivator, termed steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA). SRA is selective for steroid hormone receptors and mediates transactivation via their amino-terminal activation function. We provide functional and mechanistic evidence that SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid receptor coregulators, functions in the presence of cycloheximide, and SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retain their ability to activate steroid receptor–dependent gene expression. Biochemical fractionation shows that SRA exists in distinct ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains the nuclear receptor coactivator steroid receptor coactivator 1. We suggest that SRA may act to confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by liganded receptors during transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2162082053,"DRB is a classic inhibitor of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Since DRB generally affects class II genes, factors involved in this process must play fundamental roles in pol II elongation. Recently, two elongation factors essential for DRB action were identified, namely DSIF and P-TEFb. Here we describe the identification and purification from HeLa nuclear extract of a third protein factor required for DRB-sensitive transcription. This factor, termed negative elongation factor (NELF), cooperates with DSIF and strongly represses pol II elongation. This repression is reversed by P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the pol II C-terminal domain. NELF is composed of five polypeptides, the smallest of which is identical to RD, a putative RNA-binding protein of unknown function. This study reveals a molecular mechanism for DRB action and a regulatory network of positive and negative elongation factors."

https://openalex.org/W2060137544,"Apart from being a common feature of mental illness, auditory hallucinations provide an intriguing model for the study of internally generated sensory perceptions that are attributed to external sources. Until now, the knowledge about the cortical network that supports such hallucinations has been restricted by methodological limitations. Here, we describe an experiment with paranoid schizophrenic patients whose on- and offset of auditory hallucinations could be monitored within one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. We demonstrate an increase of the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal in Heschl’s gyrus during the patients’ hallucinations. Our results provide direct evidence of the involvement of primary auditory areas in auditory verbal hallucinations and establish novel constraints for psychopathological models."

https://openalex.org/W2082955515,"The zebrafish EGF-CFC gene one-eyed pinhead (oep) is required zygotically for the formation of the ventral neuroectoderm, endoderm, and prechordal plate. Here we report that embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic Oep activity are defective in germ layer formation, organizer development, and the positioning of the anterior-posterior axis. An identical phenotype is displayed by double mutants for the nodal-related genes squint and cyclops. Mutations in oep eliminate the response to Squint and Cyclops overexpression but are suppressed by expression of Activin and activated forms of the type I receptor ActRIB and Smad2. Expression of the murine EGF-CFC gene cripto rescues oep mutants. These results suggest a conserved role for EGF-CFC proteins as essential extracellular cofactors for Nodal signaling during vertebrate development."

https://openalex.org/W2061805545,"Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 occurs during mitosis in diverse eukaryotes and correlates closely with mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation. To better understand the function of H3 phosphorylation in vivo, we created strains of Tetrahymena in which a mutant H3 gene (S10A) was the only gene encoding the major H3 protein. Although both micronuclei and macronuclei contain H3 in typical nucleosomal structures, defects in nuclear divisions were restricted to mitotically dividing micronuclei; macronuclei, which are amitotic, showed no defects. Strains lacking phosphorylated H3 showed abnormal chromosome segregation, resulting in extensive chromosome loss during mitosis. During meiosis, micronuclei underwent abnormal chromosome condensation and failed to faithfully transmit chromosomes. These results demonstrate that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation is causally linked to chromosome condensation and segregation in vivo and is required for proper chromosome dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2034339135,"Following TGFβ receptor–mediated phosphorylation and association with Smad4, Smad2 moves into the nucleus, binds to target promoters in association with DNA-binding cofactors, and recruits coactivators such as p300/CBP to activate transcription. We identified the homeodomain protein TGIF as a Smad2-binding protein and a repressor of transcription. A TGFβ-activated Smad complex can recruit TGIF and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to a Smad target promoter, repressing transcription. Thus, upon entering the nucleus, a Smad2–Smad4 complex may interact with coactivators, forming a transcriptional activation complex, or with TGIF and HDACs, forming a transcriptional repressor complex. Formation of one of these two mutually exclusive complexes is determined by the relative levels of Smad corepressors and coactivators within the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2090910534,"The response properties of cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) were measured while the animals directed their attention either to the position of the neuron's receptive field (RF), to a position away from the RF (focal attention), or to four locations in the visual field (distributed attention). Over the population, varying attentional state had no significant effect on the response to an isolated stimulus within the RF but had a large influence on the facilitatory effects of contextual lines. We propose that the attentional modulation of contextual effects represents a gating of long range horizontal connections within area V1 by feedback connections to V1 and that this gating provides a mechanism for shaping responses under attention to stimulus configuration."
https://openalex.org/W2073342372,"We show here that caspase-8 is required for the death of primary rat neurons induced by an expanded polyglutamine repeat (Q79). Expression of Q79 recruited and activated caspase-8. Inhibition of caspase-8 blocked polyglutamine-induced cell death. Coexpression of Q79 with the caspase inhibitor CrmA, a dominant-negative mutant of FADD (FADD DN), Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL, but not an N-terminally tagged Bcl-xL, prevented the recruitment of caspase-8 and inhibited polyglutamine-induced cell death. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from Huntington's disease (HD) patients but not in those from neurologically unremarkable controls, suggesting the relocation and activation of caspase-8 during the pathogenesis of HD. These results suggest an essential role of caspase-8 in HD-related neural degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2076300945,"The MutL DNA mismatch repair protein has recently been shown to be an ATPase and to belong to an emerging ATPase superfamily that includes DNA topoisomerase II and Hsp90. We report here the crystal structures of a 40 kDa ATPase fragment of E. coli MutL (LN40) complexed with a substrate analog, ADPnP, and with product ADP. More than 60 residues that are disordered in the apoprotein structure become ordered and contribute to both ADPnP binding and dimerization of LN40. Hydrolysis of ATP, signified by subsequent release of the gamma-phosphate, releases two key loops and leads to dissociation of the LN40 dimer. Dimerization of the LN40 region is required for and is the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis by MutL. The ATPase activity of MutL is stimulated by DNA and likely acts as a switch to coordinate DNA mismatch repair."

https://openalex.org/W1999491381,"Rb inhibits progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. It associates with a number of cellular proteins; however, the nature of these interactions and their relative significance in cell cycle regulation are still unclear. We present evidence that Rb must normally interact with the E2F family of transcription factors to arrest cells in G1, and that this arrest results from active transcriptional repression by the Rb–E2F complex, not from inactivation of E2F. Thus, a major role of E2F in cell cycle regulation is assembly of this repressor complex. We demonstrate that active repression by Rb–E2F mediates the G1 arrest triggered by TGFβ, p16INK4a, and contact inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1564649778,"The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses downregulates the cell surface expression of CD4 through a two-step process. First, Nef connects the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 with adaptor protein complexes (AP), thereby inducing the formation of CD4-specific clathrin-coated pits that rapidly endocytose the viral receptor. Second, Nef targets internalized CD4 molecules for degradation. Here we show that Nef accomplishes this second task by acting as a connector between CD4 and the β subunit of COPI coatomers in endosomes. A sequence encompassing a critical acidic dipeptide, located nearby but distinct from the AP-binding determinant of HIV-1 Nef, is responsible for β-COP recruitment and for routing to lysosomes. A novel class of endosomal sorting motif, based on acidic residues, is thus revealed, and β-COP is identified as its downstream partner."
https://openalex.org/W2006002169,"The master CtrA response regulator functions in Caulobacter to repress replication initiation in different phases of the cell cycle. Here, we identify an essential histidine kinase, CckA, that is responsible for CtrA activation by phosphorylation. Although CckA is present throughout the cell cycle, it moves to a cell pole in S phase, and upon cell division it disperses. Removal of the membrane-spanning region of CckA results in loss of polar localization and cell death. We propose that polar CckA functions to activate CtrA just after the initiation of DNA replication, thereby preventing premature reinitiations of chromosome replication. Thus, dynamic changes in cellular location of critical signal proteins provide a novel mechanism for the control of the prokaryote cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2071200330,"In order to determine the distribution and function of the 5-HT5A serotonin receptor subtype, we generated knockout mice lacking the 5-HT5A gene. Comparative autoradiography studies of brains of wild-type (wt) and 5-HT5A knockout (5A-KO) mice revealed the existence of binding sites with high affinity for [125I]LSD that correspond to 5-HT5A receptors and that are concentrated in the olfactory bulb, neocortex, and medial habenula. When exposed to novel environments, the 5A-KO mice displayed increased exploratory activity but no change in anxiety-related behaviors. In addition, the stimulatory effect of LSD on exploratory activity was attenuated in 5A-KO mice. These results suggest that 5-HT5A receptors modulate the activity of neural circuits involved specifically in exploratory behavior and suggest that some of the psychotropic effects of LSD may be mediated by 5-HT5A receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1542222934,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), negative regulators of neural determination in the early embryo, were found to be potent inhibitors of neurogenesis in olfactory epithelium (OE) cultures. BMPs 2, 4 or 7 decreased the number of proliferating progenitor cells and blocked production of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Experiments suggested that this effect was due to an action of BMPs on an early-stage progenitor in the ORN lineage. Further analysis revealed that progenitors exposed to BMPs rapidly (< 2 h) lost MASH1, a transcription factor known to be required for the production of ORNs. This disappearance was due to proteolysis of existing MASH1 protein, but new gene expression was required to trigger it. The data suggest a novel mechanism of BMP action, whereby the induced degradation of an essential transcription factor results in premature termination of a neuronal lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2084886317,"The subcellular targeting of neurotransmitter receptors is vital in controlling polarized information flow in the brain. We show here that metabotropic glutamate receptors are differentially targeted when expressed from defective viral vectors in cultured hippocampal neurons; mGluR1a and mGluR2 are targeted to dendrites and excluded from axons, whereas mGluR7 is targeted to axons and dendrites. Chimeras and deletions revealed that axon exclusion of mGluR2 versus axon targeting of mGluR7 is mediated by their 60 amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. Addition of the mGluR7 C-terminal sequence to mGluR2 or to the unrelated somatodendritic protein telencephalin (tln) induced axon targeting, indicating dominance of the axonal signal. These mGluR sorting signals represent novel plasma membrane axon/dendrite targeting signals."
https://openalex.org/W2142198875,"To assess the role of prefrontal cortex in retrieval and address the controversy about whether prefrontal retrieval operations are engaged only following successful retrieval, we recorded event-related brain potentials during two recognition tests with differing demands on retrieval effort. Both tests included object drawings that were (1) identical to those studied, (2) the same but with altered aspect ratios, and (3) previously unseen. Instructions were to respond “old” only if drawings were not modified (specific test) or regardless of modifications (general test). Frontal potentials were enhanced during the specific relative to the general test for all three types of drawings. We conclude that these potentials reflected differential engagement of strategic retrieval, that this function relied on left prefrontal cortex, and that it was not contingent on successful retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W2088328293,"In NMDA receptor channels, the M2 loop forms the narrow constriction and the cytoplasmic vestibule. The identity of an extracellular vestibule leading toward the constriction remained unresolved. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM), we identified channel-lining residues of the NR1 subunit in the region preceding M1 (preM1), the C-terminal part of M3 (M3C), and the N-terminal part of M4 (M4N). These residues are located on the extracellular side of the constriction and, with one exception, are exposed to the pore independently of channel activation, suggesting that the gate is at the constriction or further cytoplasmic to it. Permeation of Ca2+ ions was decreased by mutations in M3C and M4N, but not by mutations in preM1, suggesting a functionally distinct contribution of the segments to the extracellular vestibule of the NMDA receptor channel."
https://openalex.org/W2043980403,"Inwardly rectifying K+ channels bind intracellular magnesium and polyamines to generate inward rectification. We have examined the architecture of the inner pore of Kir2.1 channels by covalently attaching a constrained number (from one to four) of positively charged moieties of different sizes to the channel. Our results indicate that the inner pore is formed solely by the second transmembrane segment and is unprecedentedly wide. At a position critical for inward rectification (D172), the pore is sufficiently wide to bind three Mg2+ ions or polyamine molecules simultaneously. Single-channel recordings directly demonstrate that partially modified channels exhibit distinct subconductance levels. Such a wide inner pore may greatly facilitate ion permeation and high-affinity binding of multiple pore blockers to generate strong inward rectification."
