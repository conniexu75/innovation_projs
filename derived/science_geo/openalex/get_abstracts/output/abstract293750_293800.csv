https://openalex.org/W1991491867,"Three tests based on fossil data indicate that high rates of extinction recorded in the penultimate (Guadalupian) stage of the Paleozoic era are not artifacts of a poor fossil record. Instead, they represent an abrupt mass extinction that was one of the largest to occur in the past half billion years. The final mass extinction of the era, which took place about 5 million years after the Guadalupian event, remains the most severe biotic crisis of all time. Taxonomic losses in the Late Permian were partitioned among the two crises and the intervening interval, however, and the terminal Permian crisis eliminated only about 80 percent of marine species, not 95 or 96 percent as earlier estimates have suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1975914937,"Clusters of atoms or molecules have been extensively studied by a variety of spectroscopies because of their unusual properties. Experiments with van der Waals clusters of defined sizes are not easily possible because nozzle beam expansions used in their production yield broad size distributions. Moreover, being weakly bound they readily fragment in the commonly used electron impact-ionization mass spectrometer detectors. Here it is shown that light fragile clusters of He, H2, and D2 can be selected and identified nondestructively by diffraction from a transmission grating. The method is universally applicable also to heavier species and well suited for spectroscopic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2051130392,"Direct studies of diradicals, the molecular species hypothesized to be archetypal of chemical bond transformations in many classes of reactions, have been made using femtosecond laser techniques with mass spectrometry in a molecular beam. These studies are aimed at ""freezing"" the diradicals in time and in the course of the reaction. The passage of these species through the transition-state region was observed and the effect of total energy and alkyl substitution on the rates of bond closure and cleavage was examined. The results establish the nature of these intermediates and define their existence during reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1966666382,"A glass network of N atoms with n(1) of the atoms with a coordination number of 1, and m(2) of the atoms with a coordination number of 2 about which the bond-angle constraint is broken, will in general display a stiffness threshold (rigidity percolation threshold) when the average coordination increases to a critical value (r)(c) = 2.4 - 0.4 (n(1) - m(2))/N. Silica and sodium tellurate glasses provide model examples for which this general relation predicts the observed rigidity percolation threshold; this relation predicts the percolation threshold only if one includes broken bond-bending constraints due to bridging oxygen in the former network and nonbridging oxygen in the latter network. The rigidity percolation threshold in (Na(2)O)x,(TeO(2))1-x glasses observed to occur near x approximately 0.18 in tellurium-125 Lamb-MÃ¶ssbauer factor measurments."
https://openalex.org/W2088028613,"Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar can detect storm footprints on the sea. Coastal weather radar from Cape Hatteras provides evidence that the echo-free hole at the footprint core is the result of wave damping by rain. The increased radar cross section of the sea surrounding the echo-free hole results from the divergence of the precipitation-forced downdraft impacting the sea. The footprint boundary is the gust front; its oriention is aligned with the direction of the winds aloft, which are transported down with the downdraft, and its length implies downdraft impact 1 hour earlier at a quasi-stationary impact spot. The steady, localized nature of the storm remains a mystery."

https://openalex.org/W2013412493,"As part of an ongoing research program to synthesize novel pillared layered materials, nickel and cobalt hydroxyacetates were inserted between the layers of amine intercalates of alpha-zirconium phosphate. The structure of the resultant nickel composite, derived from x-ray powder data, was found to consist of a three-tiered layer of nickel atoms bridged by hydroxo and acetato groups. Heating to 420 degrees C converted the hydroxyacetate layers to oxide and imparted ordered magnetic domains to the composite. The phosphate layers appear to act as a template directing the growth of the inserted layers in this class of composite materials."
