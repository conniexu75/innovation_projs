https://openalex.org/W2055677253,"Cell proliferation is a metabolically demanding process. It requires active reprogramming of cellular bioenergetic pathways towards glucose metabolism to support anabolic growth. NF-κB/Rel transcription factors coordinate many of the signals that drive proliferation during immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis, but whether NF-κB regulates the metabolic reprogramming required for cell division during these processes is unknown. Here, we report that NF-κB organizes energy metabolism networks by controlling the balance between the utilization of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. NF-κB inhibition causes cellular reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis under basal conditions and induces necrosis on glucose starvation. The metabolic reorganization that results from NF-κB inhibition overcomes the requirement for tumour suppressor mutation in oncogenic transformation and impairs metabolic adaptation in cancer in vivo. This NF-κB-dependent metabolic pathway involves stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation through upregulation of mitochondrial synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2; ref. ). Our findings identify NF-κB as a physiological regulator of mitochondrial respiration and establish a role for NF-κB in metabolic adaptation in normal cells and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2061165871,"Adipocyte and β-cell dysfunction and macrophage-related chronic inflammation are critical for the development of obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which can be negatively regulated by Tregs. Our previous studies and those of others have shown that activation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors inhibits inflammation in mice. However, whether GABA could modulate high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance has not been explored. Here, we show that although oral treatment with GABA does not affect water and food consumption it inhibits the HFD-induced gain in body weights in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, oral treatment with GABA significantly reduced the concentrations of fasting blood glucose, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in the HFD-fed mice. More importantly, after the onset of obesity and T2DM, oral treatment with GABA inhibited the continual HFD-induced gain in body weights, reduced the concentrations of fasting blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice. In addition, oral treatment with GABA reduced the epididymal fat mass, adipocyte size, and the frequency of macrophage infiltrates in the adipose tissues of HFD-fed mice. Notably, oral treatment with GABA significantly increased the frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in mice. Collectively, our data indicated that activation of peripheral GABA receptors inhibited the HFD-induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and obesity by inhibiting obesity-related inflammation and up-regulating Treg responses in vivo. Given that GABA is safe for human consumption, activators of GABA receptors may be valuable for the prevention of obesity and intervention of T2DM in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2064230819,"In eukaryotic cells, DNA maintenance requires ordered disassembly and re-assembly of chromatin templates. These processes are highly regulated and require extrinsic factors such as chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones. The histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is a large heterodimeric complex with roles in transcription, replication, and repair. FACT promotes and subsequently restricts access to DNA as a result of dynamic nucleosome reorganization. However, until now, there lacked a truly quantitative assessment of the critical contacts mediating FACT function. Here, we demonstrate that FACT binds histones, DNA, and intact nucleosomes at nanomolar concentrations. We also determine roles for the histone tails in free histone and nucleosome binding by FACT. Furthermore, we propose that the conserved acidic C-terminal domain of the FACT subunit Spt16 actively displaces nucleosomal DNA to provide access to the histone octamer. Experiments with tri-nucleosome arrays indicate a possible mode for FACT binding within chromatin. Together, the data reveal that specific FACT subunits synchronize interactions with various target sites on individual nucleosomes to generate a high affinity binding event and promote reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2116834285,"Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1 has provided the first genome of the recently discovered Zetaproteobacteria subdivision. Genome analysis reveals a complete TCA cycle, the ability to fix CO(2), carbon-storage proteins and a sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The latter could facilitate the transport of carbohydrates across the cell membrane and possibly aid in stalk formation, a matrix composed of exopolymers and/or exopolysaccharides, which is used to store oxidized iron minerals outside the cell. Two-component signal transduction system genes, including histidine kinases, GGDEF domain genes, and response regulators containing CheY-like receivers, are abundant and widely distributed across the genome. Most of these are located in close proximity to genes required for cell division, phosphate uptake and transport, exopolymer and heavy metal secretion, flagellar biosynthesis and pilus assembly suggesting that these functions are highly regulated. Similar to many other motile, microaerophilic bacteria, genes encoding aerotaxis as well as antioxidant functionality (e.g., superoxide dismutases and peroxidases) are predicted to sense and respond to oxygen gradients, as would be required to maintain cellular redox balance in the specialized habitat where M. ferrooxydans resides. Comparative genomics with other Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria residing in freshwater and marine environments revealed similar content, synteny, and amino acid similarity of coding sequences potentially involved in Fe(II) oxidation, signal transduction and response regulation, oxygen sensation and detoxification, and heavy metal resistance. This study has provided novel insights into the molecular nature of Zetaproteobacteria."

Synapse formation begins as motor axons approach muscles that are prepatterned in the prospective synaptic region in a manner that depends upon Lrp4, a member of the LDL receptor family, and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Motor axons supply Agrin, which binds Lrp4 and stimulates further MuSK phosphorylation, stabilizing nascent synapses. How Agrin binds Lrp4 and stimulates MuSK kinase activity is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Agrin binds to the N-terminal region of Lrp4, including a subset of the LDLa repeats and the first of four β-propeller domains, which promotes association between Lrp4 and MuSK and stimulates MuSK kinase activity. In addition, we show that Agrin stimulates the formation of a functional complex between Lrp4 and MuSK on the surface of myotubes in the absence of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Lrp4. Further, we demonstrate that the first Ig-like domain in MuSK, which shares homology with the NGF-binding region in Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase (TrKA), is required for MuSK to bind Lrp4. These findings suggest that Lrp4 is a cis-acting ligand for MuSK, whereas Agrin functions as an allosteric and paracrine regulator to promote association between Lrp4 and MuSK.

Conventional receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by ligands presented by adjacent cells in a paracrine manner that bind directly to the receptor, stimulating dimerization and/or rearrangement of the receptor and leading to trans-phosphorylation and kinase activation (14Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 2010; 141: 1117-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Atypical receptor tyrosine kinases, such as MuSK, Ret, and ErbB2, however, are activated by ligands that do not bind directly to the kinase. Instead, ligands bind to a separate component (Lrp4, GFRα, and ErbB3, respectively) that lacks kinase activity, and ligand-binding is relayed to stimulate the kinase (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L.

The paradigms responsible for activation of these unconventional receptor tyrosine kinases, including MuSK, remain unclear (14Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 2010; 141: 1117-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Agrin binds to a region in Lrp4 that includes three of the eight LDLa domains and the first of four β-propeller domains. Moreover, we demonstrate that Agrin stimulates a dramatic increase in association between Lrp4 and MuSK, which requires two additional LDLa repeats and two additional β-propeller domains in Lrp4. In addition, the extracellular region of Lrp4, which binds both Agrin and MuSK, is sufficient to restore Agrin-stimulated MuSK phosphorylation in lrp4 mutant myotubes, demonstrating the formation of a functional signaling complex in the absence of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Lrp4. Further, we demonstrate that a solvent-exposed region in the first immunoglobulin-like domain of MuSK, which is similar to the region in TrkA that binds NGF, is required for MuSK to bind Lrp4, consistent with the idea that Lrp4 functions as a ligand for MuSK. These findings indicate that Lrp4 is a cis-acting ligand for MuSK, whereas Agrin functions as an allosteric regulator to promote association between Lrp4 and MuSK. Human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP)-ecto-Lrp4 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning sequences from the extracellular region of Lrp4 into pcDNA3 (supplemental Table S1) and expressed from transiently transfected COS-7 cells that were grown in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), containing 1 mm CaCl2, at 31–33 °C. The Lrp4 mutant constructs are expressed at their anticipated molecular sizes (supplemental Fig. S1). The media were concentrated 20- to 40-fold using an Amicon ultracentrifugation filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and a constant level of AP activity, corresponding to 5 nm fusion protein, was added to 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY) that were coated with BSA, non-neural Agrin, or neural Agrin (20 μg/ml). Following several washes, the amount of AP-ecto-Lrp4 bound to the plate was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, as described previously (18Woodruff M.L. Theriot J. Burden S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 124: 313-334PubMed Google Scholar). Neural and non-neural Agrin were isolated from Sf9 cells as described previously (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J.

MuSK-Fc fusion proteins were generated by subcloning sequences encoding the extracellular region of MuSK in pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc1 (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Fc, MuSK-Fc or MuSK I96A (0.3 μm) were added to 96-well protein A-coated plates (Thermo Scientific). The amount of Fc fusion protein was determined by Western blotting or ELISA using purified human Fc as a standard. The structures of DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. BaF3 cells expressing MuSK-GFP or Lrp4-mCherry BaF3 cells were grown and analyzed as described previously (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R.

Wild-type and lrp4 mutant muscle cells were grown and allowed to differentiate as described previously (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). MuSK was immunoprecipitated from lrp4 mutant myotubes, treated with 10 nm AP-ecto-Lrp4 and 10 nm Agrin for 8 h, and then MuSK phosphorylation was measured as described previously (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To identify sequences in the extracellular region of Lrp4 that mediate association with Agrin and MuSK, we expressed the extracellular region of Lrp4 (ecto-Lrp4) in mammalian cells and used a solid-phase binding assay to measure association between Agrin and Lrp4. We found that most ecto-Lrp4, expressed by cells grown at 37 °C, was poorly secreted and instead was retained within cells. We reasoned that improper folding might be the cause for poor secretion, so we shifted the cells to 31–33 °C and found that lowering the temperature increased the amount of ecto-Lrp4 found in the media by 10- to 50-fold. As such, we routinely harvested media from cells that were grown at 31–33 °C. We used a solid-phase binding assay to measure binding between human AP-ecto-Lrp4 and Agrin B8, a neural isoform of Agrin (Fig. 1A). As negative controls, we adsorbed either Agrin B0, a non-neural isoform of Agrin that fails to bind Lrp4, or BSA to the plate (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H.

Neuron. 2008; 60: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We found that AP-ecto-Lrp4 bound selectively to neural Agrin (Fig. 1A). The extracellular region of Lrp4, like the LDLR and other Lrp family members, contains LDLa, EGF-like, and β-propeller domains (20Ohazama A. Porntaveetus T. Ota M.S. Herz J. Sharpe P.T. Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2010; 152A: 2974-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the LDLR, the LDLa domains, disulfide-linked calcium-binding repeats, bind ApoB and ApoE together with bound cholesterol (21Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Once the LDLR is internalized and acidified within endosomes, the single β-propeller domain associates with the LDLa repeats, displacing ApoB/E, releasing cholesterol, and allowing the LDLR to recycle to the cell surface (22Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Lrp5 and Lrp6, receptors for Wnts, the β-propeller domains, rather than the LDLa domains, are responsible for ligand binding (24Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 25Bourhis E. Tam C. Franke Y. Bazan J.F. Ernst J. Hwang J. Costa M. Cochran A.G. Hannoush R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9172-9179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine which domains in Lrp4 are responsible for binding neural Agrin, we generated truncated forms of Lrp4 and used the solid-phase binding assay to identify domains in Lrp4 that are necessary and sufficient to bind neural Agrin. Fig. 1 shows that an approximately 50-kDa fragment, composed of LDLa domains 6–8, the first two EGF-like domains, and the first of four β-propeller domains, is necessary and sufficient to bind Agrin (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, the four β-propeller domains alone or the LDLa domains with or without the EGF-like domains were insufficient to bind Agrin (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Although the second through fourth β-propeller domains in Lrp4 are dispensable for Agrin binding, the fourth β-propeller domain in Lrp4 restrains Agrin binding, as deletion of this β-propeller domain caused a 4-fold increase in Agrin binding (Fig. 1). The first β-propeller domain is necessary for Agrin binding (Fig. 1A). We next asked whether the other β-propeller domains, which share 50–60% sequence identity with propeller domain 1, could replace the first β-propeller domain or whether the first β-propeller domain had a unique role in binding Agrin. We substituted β-propeller domain 2, 3, or 4 for β-propeller domain 1 and found that only β-propeller domain 1, together with the LDLa and EGF-like domains, bound neural Agrin (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). These data indicate that β-propeller domain 1 contains sequences that uniquely facilitate Agrin-binding rather than only fulfilling a space-filling function to position the LDLa domains. Binding of Agrin to Lrp4 stimulates MuSK kinase activity (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J.

Neuron. 2008; 60: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In principle, Agrin might stimulate MuSK activity by promoting association between Lrp4 and MuSK, reorienting MuSK without altering binding between Lrp4 and MuSK, or a combination of these mechanisms. To determine whether Agrin alters the association between Lrp4 and MuSK, we measured binding between ecto-Lrp4 and MuSK in the presence or absence of Agrin. We used a solid-phase binding assay in which the extracellular region of MuSK, fused to Fc, was attached to a multi-well plate. In the absence of Agrin, full-length AP-ecto-Lrp4 bound specifically but weakly to MuSK (Fig. 2A). Importantly, simultaneous incubation with neural Agrin led to a selective and substantial increase in binding between full-length ecto-Lrp4 and MuSK (Fig. 2A). In addition, we used a cell aggregation assay to determine whether Agrin stimulated association between Lrp4 and MuSK (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that Lrp4-expressing cells self-associate and coaggregate with MuSK-expressing cells, demonstrating that Lrp4 and MuSK interact (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that the extent of aggregation between Lrp4- and MuSK-expressing cells was substantially increased by treatment with neural Agrin (Fig. 2B). Thus, Agrin increases association between Lrp4 and MuSK, suggesting that MuSK activation is achieved, at least in part, by an increase in association with Lrp4 (see below and “Discussion”). To identify the sequences in Lrp4 that are required for association with MuSK, we deleted LDLa or β-propeller domains from Lrp4 and measured the ability of the truncated forms of Lrp4 to bind MuSK following Agrin stimulation. Fig. 3 shows that the first three LDLa domains and the last β-propeller domain in Lrp4 are dispensable for binding between Lrp4 and MuSK. Indeed, deletion of the fourth β-propeller domain increases binding between Lrp4 and MuSK, suggesting that this β-propeller domain restrains association between Lrp4 and MuSK (Fig. 3). Removal of the penultimate, third β-propeller domain, however, eliminated binding to MuSK (Fig. 3). Moreover, deletion of the fourth LDLa repeat reduced binding to MuSK, and further deletion of the fifth LDLa repeat abolished binding (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the fourth and fifth LDLa repeats as well as the third β-propeller domain, which are not required to bind Agrin (Fig. 2), are critical for Lrp4 to bind MuSK. MuSK contains three Ig-like domains and a single frizzled-like, cysteine-rich domain in the extracellular region (26Jennings C.G. Dyer S.M. Burden S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Previous studies established that the first Ig-like domain in MuSK is required for Agrin to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation (30Zhou H. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Ig-like domains 1 and 2 of the MuSK extracellular region reveals that the first Ig-like domain forms a homodimer mediated by a hydrophobic face, including Leu-83 (28Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutation of Leu-83 prevents Agrin-stimulated MuSK activation, consistent with the idea that formation of a MuSK dimer is necessary for MuSK activation (28Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another region in the first Ig-like domain in MuSK, which is opposite to the hydrophobic face, resembles the NGF-binding region in TrkA, a related receptor tyrosine kinase (28Stiegler A.L.

Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 32Wehrman T. He X. Raab B. Dukipatti A. Blau H. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2007; 53: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Specifically, the first Ig-like domain in MuSK and the second Ig-like domain in TrkA, which binds NGF, contain an additional disulfide bond that is absent from nearly all other Ig-like domains (28Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether this solvent-exposed region in the first Ig-like domain of MuSK was required to associate with Lrp4. To this end, we mutated Ile-96, a solvent-exposed hydrophobic residue adjacent to the unique disulfide bond, and introduced MuSK I96A-GFP, MuSK L83R-GFP, or MuSK-GFP into BaF3 cells. We mixed the MuSK-GFP-expressing cells, which grow as solitary cells in the absence of Lrp4-expressing cells (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), with BaF3 cells expressing Lrp4-mCherry and found that cells expressing wild-type MuSK or MuSK L83R coaggregate with Lrp4-expressing cells, whereas cells expressing MuSK I96A aggregate poorly with Lrp4-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B). These data indicate that the region near the external disulfide bond, including Ile-96, is important for MuSK to bind Lrp4. To quantitate the association between MuSK and Lrp4, we measured binding of AP-ecto-Lrp4 to Fc-ecto-MuSK or Fc-ecto-MuSK I96A by a solid-phase binding assay (Fig. 4C). We found that AP-ecto-Lrp4, treated with neural Agrin, bound well to wild-type MuSK but not to MuSK I96A (Fig. 4C). Further, this association is critical for Agrin to stimulate MuSK in vivo, as Agrin fails to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation in muscle cells expressing MuSK I96A (28Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the comparable region in TrkA binds NGF and because Lrp4 can activate MuSK independently of Agrin (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 4Zhang B. Luo S. Wang Q. Suzuki T. Xiong W.C. Mei L.

Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), these data suggest that Lrp4 acts as a ligand for MuSK. The extracellular region of Lrp4 binds both Agrin and MuSK. To determine whether the extracellular region of Lrp4, devoid of the transmembrane and intracellular regions, is sufficient for Agrin to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation in muscle, we added soluble AP-ecto-Lrp4, together with Agrin, to lrp4 mutant myotubes and measured MuSK phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Lrp4 mutant myotubes express MuSK, but Agrin fails to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Soluble, AP-ecto-Lrp4 restored Agrin responsiveness to lrp4 mutant myotubes, demonstrating the formation of an Agrin-dependent signaling complex, mediated by the extracellular region of Lrp4, on the myotube surface (Fig. 5). Deletion of the fourth β-propeller domain, which increased association between Lrp4 and MuSK (Fig. 3), reduced Agrin-stimulated MuSK phosphorylation by 2-fold (Fig. 5), suggesting that the fourth β-propeller domain contributes to MuSK activation. Further removal of the third β-propeller domain, which prevented binding between Lrp4 and MuSK, blocked Agrin-stimulated MuSK phosphorylation. Together, these findings demonstrate that a soluble form of Lrp4, once activated by neural Agrin, can form a complex with MuSK on the myotube cell surface and stimulate MuSK kinase activity. Our studies reveal that Agrin stimulates association between Lrp4 and MuSK and suggest a model for MuSK activation following Agrin binding to Lrp4. In this model, Lrp4 is in dynamic equilibrium between a “closed” configuration, which is not capable of binding and activating MuSK, and an “open” configuration, which binds MuSK. In the absence of Agrin, Lrp4 has a low probability of adopting the open conformation. This open conformation is not strictly dependent upon Agrin, however, as Lrp4 can activate MuSK in the absence of Agrin, and muscle prepatterning depends upon Lrp4 and MuSK but not Agrin. Agrin, however, shifts the equilibrium to favor the open configuration, promoting binding between Lrp4 and the first Ig-like domain in MuSK, which may reconfigure MuSK and orient the hydrophobic faces of the Ig1-like domain in a favorable arrangement to form MuSK dimers and facilitate trans-phosphorylation of the kinase domains. Structural studies will be required to learn how Agrin-binding reconfigures Lrp4, exposes the MuSK-binding region in Lrp4, and alters the arrangement of MuSK (Fig. 6). Deletion of the fourth β-propeller domain in Lrp4 increased association between Agrin and Lrp4, which likely underlies the increase in Agrin-dependent association between Lrp4 and MuSK. These findings suggest that the fourth β-propeller domain normally restrains binding between Agrin and Lrp4. Deletion of the fourth β-propeller domain in Lrp4, however, reduced Agrin-stimulated MuSK phosphorylation. These findings raise the possibility that the fourth β-propeller domain becomes rearranged following Agrin-binding and facilitates MuSK activation. We show that the extracellular region of Lrp4 is sufficient to restore Agrin-dependent MuSK phosphorylation in lrp4 mutant myotubes. These experiments not only show that an Agrin-Lrp4-MuSK signaling complex can form on the extracellular cell surface of myotubes but demonstrate that the intracellular region of Lrp4 is dispensable for activating MuSK. In this respect and in this context, Lrp4 acts distinctly from LDLR and other Lrps, such as ApoER2, very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), or Lrp5/6, which require their intracellular domains to function in signal transduction (33Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 34Rice D.S. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1005-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 35Nusse R. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The LDLa repeats in the LDLR are necessary and sufficient to bind ApoB and ApoE, apolipoproteins that promote cholesterol uptake (36Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirements for binding these two ligands are distinct, however, because the fourth and fifth LDLa repeats in the LDLR are necessary and sufficient to bind ApoE, whereas all seven LDLa repeats in the LDLR participate in binding ApoB (36Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, Agrin binding to Lrp4 closely resembles ApoE binding to the LDLR because only a subset of LDLa repeats in Lrp4, including the sixth LDLa repeat in Lrp4, the equivalent of the fifth LDLa repeat in the LDLR, is essential for Agrin binding. Nonetheless, unlike LDLR, which requires only the LDLa repeats for ligand-binding, or Lrp5/6, which require only the β-propeller domains to bind Wnt proteins, Lrp4 requires a subset of the LDLa repeats as well as the first β-propeller domain to bind Agrin. Because autoantibodies to Lrp4, which cause myasthenia gravis, inhibit binding between Agrin and Lrp4 (13Higuchi O. Hamuro J. Motomura M. Yamanashi Y. Ann. Neurol. 2011; 69: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that these autoantibodies recognize the C-terminal LDLa repeats or the first β-propeller domain in Lrp4. At the cell surface, the LDLa repeats in the LDLR bind ApoE and ApoB, whereas in endosomes, at low pH, these LDLa repeats associate in an intramolecular manner with the single β-propeller domain, an arrangement that promotes release of ApoE/ApoB and cholesterol from the LDLR (22Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The structures of Lrp4 and the LDLR at neutral pH are not known, but we speculate that binding of Agrin to Lrp4 may reconfigure the architecture of Lrp4 and expose the MuSK-binding region on Lrp4. Previous studies demonstrated that the first Ig-like domain in MuSK is necessary for Agrin to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation (28Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Zhou H. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). One face of this Ig-like domain is hydrophobic and mediates the formation of MuSK dimers, providing an explanation for the importance of the first Ig-like domain in MuSK activation (28Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The experiments described here demonstrate that another solvent-exposed face of this same Ig-like domain is required to bind Lrp4, illustrating a second function for this Ig-like domain. Because a similar region in the second Ig-like domain of TrkA binds NGF (31Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and because Lrp4 binds and activates MuSK (3Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 4Zhang B. Luo S. Wang Q. Suzuki T. Xiong W.C. Mei L. Neuron. 2008; 60: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), Lrp4 may be best described as a ligand for MuSK. As such, Agrin functions as an allosteric regulator by regulating association between Lrp4 and MuSK. Conventional receptor tyrosine kinases bind directly to ligands that are presented by adjacent cells in a paracrine manner. MuSK, however, binds a cis-acting ligand, Lrp4, and the competence of Lrp4 to bind MuSK is regulated by Agrin, acting in a paracrine manner. This relay mechanism, which combines paracrine and autocrine signaling, may represent a novel means for controlling the formation of a signaling complex or might contribute to the formation of other receptor complexes. For example, although Wnts bind independently to Lrp5/6 and Frizzled, bridging the two receptors, Wnt-binding could also reconfigure Lrp5/6 or Frizzled, stimulate their direct association and further stabilize the signaling complex. In the absence of ligand, typical receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor, are autoinhibited. Ligand binding induces a conformational change that facilitates receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domains (37Dawson J.P. Bu Z. Lemmon M.A. Structure. 2007; 15: 942-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this sense, MuSK activation resembles the EGF receptor, as Agrin-binding induces a conformational change in Lrp4 that stimulates association with MuSK. A similar stepwise paradigm may control the activation of Ret and other kinases that are activated by ligands that bind to a separate subunit. Mathematical modeling suggests that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor initiates a stepwise assembly of GFRα and Ret (38Schlee S. Carmillo P. Whitty A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the domains in GFRα and Ret that mediate assembly of a signaling complex and how assembly is regulated by GDNF are poorly understood. Lrp4 is widely expressed in the mouse embryo and required not only for neuromuscular synapse formation but also for digit formation and the development of multiple organs, including lung, kidney, and bone. Hypomorphic mutations in human lrp4, which reduce Lrp4 expression, are responsible for Cenani Lenz syndrome, typified by defects in distal limb development and abnormal kidney differentiation (39Li Y. Pawlik B. Elcioglu N. Aglan M. Kayserili H. Yigit G. Percin F. Goodman F. Nürnberg G. Cenani A. Urquhart J. Chung B.D. Ismail S. Amr K. Aslanger A.D. Becker C. Netzer C. Scambler P. Eyaid W.

The ligands for Lrp4 in other tissues have not been well defined, but Lrp4 binds Dickkopf, Sclerostin, and Wnt modulator in surface ectoderm (WISE), modulators of Wnt and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling (40Ohazama A. Johnson E.B. Ota M.S. Choi H.Y. Choi H.J. Porntaveetus T. Oommen S. Itoh N. Eto K. Gritli-Linde A. Herz J. Sharpe P.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Choi H.Y. Dieckmann M. Herz J. Niemeier A. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and genetic evidence supports the idea that Lrp4 can regulate Wnt and BMP signaling pathways (42Johnson E.B. Steffen D.J. Lynch K.W. Herz J. Genomics. 2006; 88: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although Lrp4 may simply sequester these regulators of Wnt and BMP signaling (41Choi H.Y. Dieckmann M. Herz J. Niemeier A. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), these and other ligands may bind Lrp4 in a manner resembling Agrin or MuSK and induce conformational changes in Lrp4 that allow it to bind additional partners in these tissues. Moreover, because LDLa, EGF-like, and β-propeller domains are present in all Lrp family members, the autoinhibitory and activation mechanisms described here may be shared with other family members.

https://openalex.org/W2042787960,"Traditionally, clinical research studies rely on collecting data with case report forms, which are subsequently entered into a database to create electronic records. Although well established, this method is time-consuming and error-prone. This study compares four electronic data capture (EDC) methods with the conventional approach with respect to duration of data capture and accuracy. It was performed in a West African setting, where clinical trials involve data collection from urban, rural and often remote locations.Three types of commonly available EDC tools were assessed in face-to-face interviews; netbook, PDA, and tablet PC. EDC performance during telephone interviews via mobile phone was evaluated as a fourth method. The Graeco Latin square study design allowed comparison of all four methods to standard paper-based recording followed by data double entry while controlling simultaneously for possible confounding factors such as interview order, interviewer and interviewee. Over a study period of three weeks the error rates decreased considerably for all EDC methods. In the last week of the study the data accuracy for the netbook (5.1%, CI95%: 3.5-7.2%) and the tablet PC (5.2%, CI95%: 3.7-7.4%) was not significantly different from the accuracy of the conventional paper-based method (3.6%, CI95%: 2.2-5.5%), but error rates for the PDA (7.9%, CI95%: 6.0-10.5%) and telephone (6.3%, CI95% 4.6-8.6%) remained significantly higher. While EDC-interviews take slightly longer, data become readily available after download, making EDC more time effective. Free text and date fields were associated with higher error rates than numerical, single select and skip fields.EDC solutions have the potential to produce similar data accuracy compared to paper-based methods. Given the considerable reduction in the time from data collection to database lock, EDC holds the promise to reduce research-associated costs. However, the successful implementation of EDC requires adjustment of work processes and reallocation of resources."
https://openalex.org/W2039224874,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A high prevalence of Campylobacter concisus was previously detected in paediatric CD and adult UC. Currently, the prevalence of C. concisus in adult CD and the preferential colonization sites of Campylobacter species in the human intestine are unknown. In this study, we examined the prevalence of Campylobacter species in biopsies collected from multiple anatomic sites of adult patients with IBD and controls.Three hundred and one biopsies collected from ileum, caecum, descending colon and rectum of 28 patients IBD (15 CD and 13 UC) and 33 controls were studied. Biopsies were used for DNA extraction and detection of Campylobacter species by PCR-sequencing and Campylobacter cultivation.A significantly higher prevalence of C. concisus in colonic biopsies of patients with CD (53%) was detected as compared with the controls (18%). Campylobacter genus-PCR positivity and C. concisus positivity in patients with UC were 85% and 77% respectively, being significantly higher than that in the controls (48% and 36%). C. concisus was more often detected in descending colonic and rectal biopsies from patients with IBD in comparison to the controls. C. concisus was isolated from patients with IBD.The high intestinal prevalence of C. concisus in patients with IBD, particularly in the proximal large intestine, suggests that future studies are needed to investigate the possible involvement of C. concisus in a subgroup of human IBD. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the association between adult CD and C. concisus as well as the first study of the preferential colonization sites of C. concisus in the human intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2104299396,"Protein O-fucosylation is an essential post-translational modification, involved in the folding of target proteins and in the role of these target proteins during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, among other things. Two different enzymes are responsible for this modification, Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 and 2 (POFUT1 and POFUT2, respectively). Both proteins have been characterised biologically and enzymatically but nothing is known at the molecular or structural level. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a catalytically functional POFUT1 in an apo-form and in complex with GDP-fucose and GDP. The enzyme belongs to the GT-B family and is not dependent on manganese for activity. GDP-fucose/GDP is localised in a conserved cavity connected to a large solvent exposed pocket, which we show is the binding site of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats in the extracellular domain of the Notch Receptor. Through both mutational and kinetic studies we have identified which residues are involved in binding and catalysis and have determined that the Arg240 residue is a key catalytic residue. We also propose a novel SN1-like catalytic mechanism with formation of an intimate ion pair, in which the glycosidic bond is cleaved before the nucleophilic attack; and theoretical calculations at a DFT (B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) support this mechanism. Thus, the crystal structure together with our mutagenesis studies explain the molecular mechanism of POFUT1 and provide a new starting point for the design of functional inhibitors to this critical enzyme in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2087968790,"Introduction Dopamine (DA) binds to five receptors (DAR), classified by their ability to increase (D1R-like) or decrease (D2R-like) cAMP. In humans, most DA circulates as dopamine sulfate (DA-S), which can be de-conjugated to bioactive DA by arylsulfatase A (ARSA). The objective was to examine expression of DAR and ARSA in human adipose tissue and determine whether DA regulates prolactin (PRL) and adipokine expression and release. Methods DAR were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting in explants, primary adipocytes and two human adipocyte cell lines, LS14 and SW872. ARSA expression and activity were determined by qPCR and enzymatic assay. PRL expression and release were determined by luciferase reporter and Nb2 bioassay. Analysis of cAMP, cGMP, leptin, adiponectin and interleukin 6 (IL-6) was done by ELISA. Activation of MAPK and PI3 kinase/Akt was determined by Western blotting. Results DAR are variably expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissue and adipocytes during adipogenesis. ARSA activity in adipocyte increases after differentiation. DA at nM concentrations suppresses cAMP, stimulates cGMP, and activates MAPK in adipocytes. Acting via D2R-like receptors, DA and DA-S inhibit PRL gene expression and release. Acting via D1R/D5R receptors, DA suppresses leptin and stimulates adiponectin and IL-6 release. Conclusions This is the first report that human adipocytes express functional DAR and ARSA, suggesting a regulatory role for peripheral DA in adipose functions. We speculate that the propensity of some DAR-activating antipsychotics to increase weight and alter metabolic homeostasis is due, in part, to their direct action on adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2160168027,"Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE or E1) activates ubiquitin via an adenylate intermediate and catalyzes its transfer to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). MLN4924 is an adenosine sulfamate analogue that was identified as a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), another E1 enzyme, by forming a NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct that tightly binds at the active site of NAE, a novel mechanism termed substrate-assisted inhibition (Brownell, J. E., Sintchak, M. D., Gavin, J. M., Liao, H., Bruzzese, F. J., Bump, N. J., Soucy, T. A., Milhollen, M. A., Yang, X., Burkhardt, A. L., Ma, J., Loke, H. K., Lingaraj, T., Wu, D., Hamman, K.

Cell 37, 102-111). In the present study, substrate-assisted inhibition of human UAE (Ube1) by another adenosine sulfamate analogue, 5'-O-sulfamoyl-N(6)-[(1S)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl]-adenosine (Compound I), a nonselective E1 inhibitor, was characterized. Compound I inhibited UAE-dependent ATP-PP(i) exchange activity, caused loss of UAE thioester, and inhibited E1-E2 transthiolation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies on Compound I and its purified ubiquitin adduct demonstrate that the proposed substrate-assisted inhibition via covalent adduct formation is entirely consistent with the three-step ubiquitin activation process and that the adduct is formed via nucleophilic attack of UAE thioester by the sulfamate group of Compound I after completion of step 2. Kinetic and affinity analysis of Compound I, MLN4924, and their purified ubiquitin adducts suggest that both the rate of adduct formation and the affinity between the adduct and E1 contribute to the overall potency. Because all E1s are thought to use a similar mechanism to activate their cognate ubiquitin-like proteins, the substrate-assisted inhibition by adenosine sulfamate analogues represents a promising strategy to develop potent and selective E1 inhibitors that can modulate diverse biological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1971464471,"MicroRNAs (miRs) function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in multiple tumor types. Although miR expression is tightly regulated, the molecular basis of miR regulation is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the influence of the histone demethylase Jumonji/ARID1 B (JARID1B) on miR regulation in breast tumor cells. In MCF-7 cells with stable RNAi-mediated suppression of JARID1B expression we identified altered regulation of multiple miRs including let-7e, a member of the let-7 family of tumor suppressor miRs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated JARID1B binding to the let-7e promoter region as well as removal of the of H3K4me3 histone mark associated with active gene expression. These results suggest that JARID1B epigenetically represses let-7e expression. JARID1B stimulates tumor cell proliferation by promoting the G(1) to S transition. As predicted, suppression of JARID1B resulted in an accumulation of MCF-7 cells in G(1). We confirmed that cyclin D1, which also promotes G(1) progression, is a direct target of let-7e, and we show that cyclin D1 expression is suppressed in JARID1B knockdown cells. Cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle progression were restored following inhibition of let-7e, suggesting that JARID1B repression of let-7e contributes to cyclin D1 expression and JARID1B-mediated cell cycle progression. Our results indicate that the JARID1B demethylase contributes to tumor cell proliferation through the epigenetic repression of a tumor suppressor miR."
https://openalex.org/W2001778010,"Background Osteoarthritis constitutes a major musculoskeletal burden for the aged Australians. Hip and knee replacement surgeries are effective interventions once all conservative therapies to manage the symptoms have been exhausted. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hip and knee replacements in Australia. To our best knowledge, the study is the first attempt to account for the dual nature of hip and knee osteoarthritis in modelling the severities of right and left joints separately. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a discrete-event simulation model that follows up the individuals with osteoarthritis over their lifetimes. The model defines separate attributes for right and left joints and accounts for several repeat replacements. The Australian population with osteoarthritis who were 40 years of age or older in 2003 were followed up until extinct. Intervention effects were modelled by means of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Both hip and knee replacements are highly cost effective (AUD 5,000 per DALY and AUD 12,000 per DALY respectively) under an AUD 50,000/DALY threshold level. The exclusion of cost offsets, and inclusion of future unrelated health care costs in extended years of life, did not change the findings that the interventions are cost-effective (AUD 17,000 per DALY and AUD 26,000 per DALY respectively). However, there was a substantial difference between hip and knee replacements where surgeries administered for hips were more cost-effective than for knees. Conclusions/Significance Both hip and knee replacements are cost-effective interventions to improve the quality of life of people with osteoarthritis. It was also shown that the dual nature of hip and knee OA should be taken into account to provide more accurate estimation on the cost-effectiveness of hip and knee replacements."
https://openalex.org/W2077436822,"Genetic tools have greatly aided in tracing the sources and colonization history of introduced species. However, recurrent introductions and repeated shuffling of populations may have blurred some of the genetic signals left by ancient introductions. Styela plicata is a solitary ascidian distributed worldwide. Although its origin remains unclear, this species is believed to have spread worldwide by travelling on ship's hulls. The goals of this study were to infer the genetic structure and global phylogeography of S. plicata and to look for present-day and historical genetic patterns. Two genetic markers were used: a fragment of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and a fragment of the nuclear gene Adenine Nucleotide Transporter/ADP-ATP Translocase (ANT). A total of 368 individuals for COI and 315 for ANT were sequenced from 17 locations worldwide. The levels of gene diversity were moderate for COI to high for ANT. The Mediterranean populations showed the least diversity and allelic richness for both markers, while the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans had the highest gene and nucleotide diversities. Network and phylogenetic analyses with COI and ANT revealed two groups of alleles separated by 15 and 4 mutational steps, respectively. The existence of different lineages suggested an ancient population split. However, the geographic distributions of these groups did not show any consistent pattern, indicating different phylogeographic histories for each gene. Genetic divergence was significant for many population-pairs irrespective of the geographic distance among them. Stochastic introduction events are reflected in the uneven distribution of COI and ANT allele frequencies and groups among many populations. Our results confirmed that S. plicata has been present in all studied oceans for a long time, and that recurrent colonization events and occasional shuffling among populations have determined the actual genetic structure of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2063315071,"Adult neural precursor cells (NPCs) respond to injury or disease of the CNS by migrating to the site of damage or differentiating locally to replace lost cells. Factors that mediate this injury induced NPC response include chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interferon-γ (IFNγ), which we have shown previously promotes neuronal differentiation. RT-PCR was used to compare expression of chemokines and their receptors in normal adult mouse brain and in cultured NPCs in response to IFNγ and TNFα. Basal expression of many chemokines and their receptors was found in adult brain, predominantly in neurogenic regions, with OB≫SVZ>hippocampus and little or no expression in non-neurogenic regions, such as cortex. Treatment of SVZ-derived NPCs with IFNγ and TNFα (alone and in combination) resulted in significant upregulation of expression of specific chemokines, with CXCL1, CXCL9 and CCL2 most highly upregulated and CCL19 downregulated. Unlike IFNγ, chemokine treatment of NPCs in vitro had little or no effect on survival, proliferation or migration. Neuronal differentiation was promoted by CXCL9, CCL2 and CCL21, while astrocyte and total oligodendrocyte differentiation was not affected. However, IFNγ, CXCL1, CXCL9 and CCL2 promoted oligodendrocyte maturation. Therefore, not only do NPCs express chemokine receptors, they also produce several chemokines, particularly in response to inflammatory mediators. This suggests that autocrine or paracrine production of specific chemokines by NPCs in response to inflammatory mediators may regulate differentiation into mature neural cell types and may alter NPC responsiveness to CNS injury or disease."
https://openalex.org/W2060721366,"As the pentaspan stem cell marker CD133 was shown to bind cholesterol and to localize in plasma membrane protrusions, we investigated a possible function for CD133 in endocytosis. Using the CD133 siRNA knockdown strategy and non-differentiated human colon cancer Caco-2 cells that constitutively over-expressed CD133, we provide for the first time direct evidence for a role of CD133 in the intracellular accumulation of fluorescently labeled extracellular compounds. Assessed using AC133 monoclonal antibody, CD133 knockdown was shown to improve Alexa488-transferrin (Tf) uptake in Caco-2 cells but had no impact on FITC-dextran or FITC-cholera-toxin. Absence of effect of the CD133 knockdown on Tf recycling established a role for CD133 in inhibiting Tf endocytosis rather than in stimulating Tf exocytosis. Use of previously identified inhibitors of known endocytic pathways and the positive impact of CD133 knockdown on cellular uptake of clathrin-endocytosed synthetic lipid nanocapsules supported that CD133 impact on endocytosis was primarily ascribed to the clathrin pathway. Also, cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrine up regulated Tf uptake at greater intensity in the CD133(high) situation than in the CD133(low) situation, thus suggesting a role for cholesterol in the inhibitory effect of CD133 on endocytosis. Interestingly, cell treatment with the AC133 antibody down regulated Tf uptake, thus demonstrating that direct extracellular binding to CD133 could affect endocytosis. Moreover, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy established that down regulation of CD133 improved the accessibility to the TfR from the extracellular space, providing a mechanism by which CD133 inhibited Tf uptake. As Tf is involved in supplying iron to the cell, effects of iron supplementation and deprivation on CD133/AC133 expression were investigated. Both demonstrated a dose-dependent down regulation here discussed to the light of transcriptional and post-transciptional effects. Taken together, these data extend our knowledge of the function of CD133 and underline the interest of further exploring the CD133-Tf-iron network."
https://openalex.org/W2081960629,"Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for the regulation of several signal transduction pathways and biological processes in the living cell. Therefore, the identification of protein phosphorylation sites is crucial to understand cell signaling control at the molecular level. Based on mass spectrometry, recent studies have reported the large-scale mapping of phosphorylation sites in various eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, little is known about the impact of phosphorylation in protozoan parasites. To in depth characterize the phosphoproteome of Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite of the Kinetoplastida class, protein samples from cells at different phases of the metacyclogenesis – differentiation process of the parasites from non-infective epimastigotes to infective metacyclic trypomastigotes - were enriched for phosphopeptides using TiO2 chromatography and analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. In total, 1,671 proteins were identified, including 753 phosphoproteins, containing a total of 2,572 phosphorylation sites. The distribution of phosphorylated residues was 2,162 (84.1%) on serine, 384 (14.9%) on threonine and 26 (1.0%) on tyrosine. Here, we also report several consensus phosphorylation sequence motifs and as some of these conserved groups have enriched biological functions, we can infer the regulation by protein kinases of this functions. To our knowledge, our phosphoproteome is the most comprehensive dataset identified until now for Kinetoplastida species. Here we also were able to extract biological information and infer groups of sites phosphorylated by the same protein kinase. To make our data accessible to the scientific community, we uploaded our study to the data repositories PHOSIDA, Proteome Commons and TriTrypDB enabling researchers to access information about the phosphorylation sites identified here."
https://openalex.org/W2056921322,"Given the polarity dependent effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in facilitating or inhibiting neuronal processing, and tDCS effects on pitch perception, we tested the effects of tDCS on temporal aspects of auditory processing. We aimed to change baseline activity of the auditory cortex using tDCS as to modulate temporal aspects of auditory processing in healthy subjects without hearing impairment. Eleven subjects received 2mA bilateral anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS over auditory cortex in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Subjects were evaluated by the Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT), a test measuring temporal processing abilities in the auditory domain, before and during the stimulation. Statistical analysis revealed a significant interaction effect of time vs. tDCS condition for 4000 Hz and for clicks. Post-hoc tests showed significant differences according to stimulation polarity on RGDT performance: anodal improved 22.5% and cathodal decreased 54.5% subjects' performance, as compared to baseline. For clicks, anodal also increased performance in 29.4% when compared to baseline. tDCS presented polarity-dependent effects on the activity of the auditory cortex, which results in a positive or negative impact in a temporal resolution task performance. These results encourage further studies exploring tDCS in central auditory processing disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2005758409,"The circadian pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) contains a major pacemaker for 24 h rhythms that is synchronized to the external light-dark cycle. In response to a shift in the external cycle, neurons of the SCN resynchronize with different pace. We performed electrical activity recordings of the SCN of rats in vitro following a 6 hour delay of the light-dark cycle and observed a bimodal electrical activity pattern with a shifted and an unshifted component. The shifted component was relatively narrow as compared to the unshifted component (2.2 h and 5.7 h, respectively). Curve fitting and simulations predicted that less than 30% of the neurons contribute to the shifted component and that their phase distribution is small. This prediction was confirmed by electrophysiological recordings of neuronal subpopulations. Only 25% of the neurons exhibited an immediate shift in the phase of the electrical activity rhythms, and the phases of the shifted subpopulations appeared significantly more synchronized as compared to the phases of the unshifted subpopulations (p<0.05). We also performed electrical activity recordings of the SCN following a 9 hour advance of the light-dark cycle. The phase advances induced a large desynchrony among the neurons, but consistent with the delays, only 19% of the neurons peaked at the mid of the new light phase. The data suggest that resetting of the central circadian pacemaker to both delays and advances is brought about by an initial shift of a relatively small group of neurons that becomes highly synchronized following a shift in the external cycle. The high degree of synchronization of the shifted neurons may add to the ability of this group to reset the pacemaker. The large desynchronization observed following advances may contribute to the relative difficulty of the circadian system to respond to advanced light cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1987080368,"Background Cisplatin is a potent anticancer drug, but its clinical application has been limited due to its undesirable physicochemical characteristics and severe side effects. Better drug formulations for cisplatin are highly desired. Methodology/Principal Findings Herein, we have developed a nanoparticle formulation for cisplatin with high encapsulation efficiency and reduced toxicity by using cisplatin-crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) core nanoparticles made from poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-monomethoxy-poly(polyethylene glycol) copolymers (PLGA-mPEG). The nanoparticles have an average diameter of approximately 80 nm measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The encapsulation efficiency of cisplatin in the nanoparticles is up to 72%. Meanwhile, we have also observed a controlled release of cisplatin in a sustained manner and dose-dependent treatment efficacy of cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles against IGROV1-CP cells. Moreover, the median lethal dose (LD50) of the cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles was more than 100 mg/kg by intravenous administration, which was much higher than that of free cisplatin. Conclusion This developed cisplatin-loaded nanoparticle is a promising formulation for the delivery of cisplatin, which will be an effective therapeutic regimen of ovarian cancer without severe side effects and cumulative toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2017543661,"Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) accumulate in mammalian testis during puberty and are essential for fertility. To investigate whether lysophospholipid acyltransferases determine the PUFA composition of testicular phospholipids during pubertal development, we compared their mRNA expression, in vitro activity, and specificity with the lipidomic profile of major phospholipids. The accumulation of PUFAs in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine correlated with an induced lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT)3 mRNA expression, increased microsomal LPAAT3 activity, and shift of LPAAT specificity to PUFA-coenzyme A. LPAAT3 was induced during germ cell maturation, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Accordingly, differentiation of mouse GC-2spd(ts) spermatocytes into spermatides up-regulated LPAAT3 mRNA, increased the amount of polyunsaturated phospholipids, and shifted the specificity for the incorporation of deuterium-labeled docosahexaenoic acid toward phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Stable knockdown of LPAAT3 in GC-2spd(ts) cells significantly decreased microsomal LPAAT3 activity, reduced levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine species, and impaired cell proliferation/survival during geneticin selection. We conclude that the induction of LPAAT3 during germ cell development critically contributes to the accumulation of PUFAs in testicular phospholipids, thereby possibly affecting sperm cell production.—Koeberle, A., Shindou, H., Harayama, T., Yuki, K., Shimizu, T.

https://openalex.org/W2039954793,"We have identified a novel component of the circadian clock that regulates its sensitivity to light at the evening light to dark transition. USP2 (Ubiquitin Specific Protease 2), which de-ubiquitinylates and stabilizes target proteins, is rhythmically expressed in multiple tissues including the SCN. We have developed a knockout model of USP2 and found that exposure to low irradiance light at ZT12 increases phase delays of USP2−/− mice compared to wildtype. We additionally show that USP2b is in a complex with several clock components and regulates the stability and turnover of BMAL1, which in turn alters the expression of several CLOCK/BMAL1 controlled genes. Rhythmic expression of USP2 in the SCN and other tissues offers a new level of control of the clock machinery through de-ubiqutinylation and suggests a role for USP2 during circadian adaptation to environmental day length changes."
https://openalex.org/W1973804607,"MicroRNA-138 is one of the most frequently down-regulated microRNAs in cancer. We recently identified 51 candidate targets of microRNA-138 (Jiang, L., Dai, Y., Liu, X., Wang, C., Wang, A., Chen, Z., Heidbreder, C. E., Kolokythas, A., and Zhou, X. (2011) Hum. Genet. 129, 189-197). Among these candidates, Fos-like antigen 1 (FOSL1) is a member of Fos gene family and is a known proto-oncogene. In this study, we first confirmed the microRNA-138-mediated down-regulation of FOSL1 in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. We then demonstrated the effect of this microRNA-138-FOSL1 regulatory module on downstream genes (homolog of Snail 2 (Snai2) expression and the Snai2-mediated repression of E-cadherin expression), as well as its contributions to tumorigenesis. The microRNA-138-directed recruitment of FOSL1 mRNA to the RNAi-induced silencing complex was confirmed by a ribonucleoprotein-immunoprecipitation assay. Three canonical and three high affinity non-canonical microRNA-138 (miR-138) targeting sites were identified on the FOSL1 mRNA: one in the 5'-UTR, three overlapping sites in the coding sequences, and two overlapping sites in the 3'-UTR. The direct targeting of miR-138 to these sites was confirmed using luciferase reporter gene assays. In summary, we describe an important microRNA regulatory module, which may play an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Our results also provide evidence that microRNAs target both canonical and non-canonical targeting sites located in all areas of the mRNA molecule (e.g. 5'-UTR, coding sequences, and 3'-UTR)."
https://openalex.org/W2078181518,"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae colonizes the ciliated respiratory epithelium of swine, disrupting mucociliary function and inducing chronic inflammation. P97 and P102 family members are major surface proteins of M. hyopneumoniae and play key roles in colonizing cilia via interactions with glycosaminoglycans and mucin. The p102 paralog, mhp683, and homologs in strains from different geographic origins encode a 135-kDa pre-protein (P135) that is cleaved into three fragments identified here as P45(683), P48(683), and P50(683). A peptide sequence (TTKF↓QE) was identified surrounding both cleavage sites in Mhp683. N-terminal sequences of P48(683) and P50(683), determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry, confirmed cleavage after the phenylalanine residue. A similar proteolytic cleavage site was identified by mass spectrometry in another paralog of the P97/P102 family. Trypsin digestion and surface biotinylation studies showed that P45(683), P48(683), and P50(683) reside on the M. hyopneumoniae cell surface. Binding assays of recombinant proteins F1(683)-F5(683), spanning Mhp683, showed saturable and dose-dependent binding to biotinylated heparin that was inhibited by unlabeled heparin, fucoidan, and mucin. F1(683)-F5(683) also bound porcine epithelial cilia, and antisera to F2(683) and F5(683) significantly inhibited cilium binding by M. hyopneumoniae cells. These data suggest that P45(683), P48(683), and P50(683) each display cilium- and proteoglycan-binding sites. Mhp683 is the first characterized glycosaminoglycan-binding member of the P102 family."
https://openalex.org/W2016494021,"Background The California Floristic Province is a biodiversity hotspot, reflecting a complex geologic history, strong selective gradients, and a heterogeneous landscape. These factors have led to high endemic diversity across many lifeforms within this region, including the richest diversity of mygalomorph spiders (tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and kin) in North America. The trapdoor spider genus Aliatypus encompasses twelve described species, eleven of which are endemic to California. Several Aliatypus species show disjunct distributional patterns in California (some are found on both sides of the vast Central Valley), and the genus as a whole occupies an impressive variety of habitats. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected specimens from 89 populations representing all described species. DNA sequence data were collected from seven gene regions, including two newly developed for spider systematics. Bayesian inference (in individual gene tree and species tree approaches) recovered a general “3 clade” structure for the genus (A. gulosus, californicus group, erebus group), with three other phylogenetically isolated species differing slightly in position across different phylogenetic analyses. Because of extremely high intraspecific divergences in mitochondrial COI sequences, the relatively slowly evolving 28S rRNA gene was found to be more useful than mitochondrial data for identification of morphologically indistinguishable immatures. For multiple species spanning the Central Valley, explicit hypothesis testing suggests a lack of monophyly for regional populations (e.g., western Coast Range populations). Phylogenetic evidence clearly shows that syntopy is restricted to distant phylogenetic relatives, consistent with ecological niche conservatism. Conclusions/Significance This study provides fundamental insight into a radiation of trapdoor spiders found in the biodiversity hotspot of California. Species relationships are clarified and undescribed lineages are discovered, with more geographic sampling likely to lead to additional species diversity. These dispersal-limited taxa provide novel insight into the biogeography and Earth history processes of California."
https://openalex.org/W2081972483,"Background Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped plus-strand RNA virus that causes acute hepatitis. The capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) is known to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in ORF2 expressing cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we found that HEV ORF2 activates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). ORF2 stimulates the CHOP promoter mainly through AARE (amino acid response elements) and to a minor extent the ERSE (endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein binds and activates the AARE regulatory sites of the CHOP promoter. ORF2 expression also leads to increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) that in turn initiates the translation of ATF4 mRNA. The pro-apoptotic gene CHOP is an important trigger to initiate endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis. However, the activation of CHOP by ORF2 in this study did not induce apoptosis, nor did BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) translocate to mitochondria. Microarray analysis revealed an ORF2 specific increased expression of chaperones Hsp72, Hsp70B', and co-chaperone Hsp40. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in silico molecular docking analysis suggests that HEV ORF2 interacts with Hsp72. In addition, Hsp72 shows nuclear accumulation in ORF2 expressing cells. Conclusions/Significance These data provide new insight into simultaneously occurring counter-acting effects of HEV ORF2 that may be part of a strategy to prevent host suicide before completion of the viral replication cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2142795151,"The ability of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans to interconvert between budded and hyphal growth states, herein termed the budded-to-hyphal transition (BHT), is important for C. albicans development and virulence. The BHT is under the control of multiple cell signaling pathways that respond to external stimuli, including nutrient availability, high temperature, and pH. Previous studies identified 21 small molecules that could inhibit the C. albicans BHT in response to carbon limitation in Spider media. However, the studies herein show that the BHT inhibitors had varying efficacies in other hyphal-inducing media, reflecting their varying abilities to block signaling pathways associated with the different media. Chemical epistasis analyses suggest that most, but not all, of the BHT inhibitors were acting through either the Efg1 or Cph1 signaling pathways. Notably, the BHT inhibitor clozapine, a FDA-approved drug used to treat atypical schizophrenia by inhibiting G-protein-coupled dopamine receptors in the brain, and several of its functional analogs were shown to act at the level of the Gpr1 G-protein-coupled receptor. These studies are the first step in determining the target and mechanism of action of these BHT inhibitors, which may have therapeutic anti-fungal utility in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2131915038,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have the ability to present antigen and play a critical role in the induction of the acquired immune response. Skin DCs uptake antigen and subsequently migrate to regional draining lymph nodes (LNs), where they activate naive T cells. Here we show that the water/glycerol channel protein aquaporin 7 (AQP7) is expressed on epidermal and dermal DCs and involved in the initiation of primary immune responses. AQP7-deficient DCs showed a decreased cellular uptake of low-molecular-mass compounds (fluorescein isothiocyanate and Lucifer yellow) and high-molecular-mass substances (ovalbumin and dextran), suggesting that AQP7 is involved in antigen uptake. AQP7-deficient DCs also exhibited reduced chemokine-dependent cell migration in comparison to wild-type DCs. Consistent with these in vitro results, AQP7-deficient mice demonstrated a reduced accumulation of antigen-retaining DCs in the LNs after antigen application to the skin, which could be attributed to decreased antigen uptake and migration. Coincidentally, AQP7-deficient mice had impaired antigen-induced sensitization in a contact hypersensitivity model. These observations suggested that AQP7 in skin DCs is primarily involved in antigen uptake and in the subsequent migration of DCs and is responsible for antigen presentation and the promotion of downstream immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1971225682,"Long-lived animals, including social insects, often display seasonal shifts in foraging behavior. Foraging is ultimately a nutrient consumption exercise, but the effect of seasonality per se on changes in foraging behavior, particularly as it relates to nutrient regulation, is poorly understood. Here, we show that field-collected fire ant colonies, returned to the laboratory and maintained under identical photoperiod, temperature, and humidity regimes, and presented with experimental foods that had different protein (p) to carbohydrate (c) ratios, practice summer- and fall-specific foraging behaviors with respect to protein-carbohydrate regulation. Summer colonies increased the amount of food collected as the p:c ratio of their food became increasingly imbalanced, but fall colonies collected similar amounts of food regardless of the p:c ratio of their food. Choice experiments revealed that feeding was non-random, and that both fall and summer ants preferred carbohydrate-biased food. However, ants rarely ate all the food they collected, and their cached or discarded food always contained little carbohydrate relative to protein. From a nutrient regulation strategy, ants consumed most of the carbohydrate they collected, but regulated protein consumption to a similar level, regardless of season. We suggest that varied seasonal food collection behaviors and nutrient regulation strategies may be an adaptation that allows long-lived animals to meet current and future nutrient demands when nutrient-rich foods are abundant (e.g. spring and summer), and to conserve energy and be metabolically more efficient when nutritionally balanced foods are less abundant."
https://openalex.org/W2012970377,"Ionotropic glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are the major mediators of fast synaptic neurotransmission. In this work, we used primary cortical cultures from rats as a model system to study AMPA receptor regulation during in vitro cell maturation and after synaptic activity modifications. The levels of AMPA receptor mRNA and protein, along with the alternative splicing and RNA editing of the AMPA receptor subunit (GluR1-4) mRNAs, were analyzed in immature (DIV5) and mature (DIV26) rat neuronal cultures. We observed an increase in the expression of all four AMPA receptor subunits during in vitro neuronal maturation. This finding might be due to the formation of new synapses between neurons during the development of a complex neuronal network. We also analyzed the effects of stimulation (KCl and glutamate) and inhibition (APV/TTX) on rat mature neuronal cultures (DIV26): stimulation with KCl led to an overall down-regulation of GluR1 and GluR3 AMPA receptor subunits and an up-regulation of the GluR2 subunit. Similarly, glutamate treatment induced a significant down-regulation of GluR1 together with an up-regulation of GluR2. In contrast, the chronic blockade of neuronal activity that resulted from APV/TTX treatment up-regulated GluR1 and GluR3 with a parallel down-regulation of GluR2 and GluR4. RNA editing at the R/G site increased during neuronal cell maturation for all AMPA receptors (from 8–39% at DIV5 to 28–67% at DIV26). Unexpectedly, all the treatments tested induced a marked reduction (ranging from −9% to −52%) of R/G editing levels in mature neurons, primarily for the mRNA flip variant. In summary, we showed that cultured rat cortical neurons are able to vary the stoichiometric ratios of the AMPA receptor subunits and to control post-transcriptional processes to adapt fast synaptic transmission under different environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2037993748,"Background Serine/threonine kinases are involved in gene regulation and signal transduction in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we investigated the role of the serine/threonine kinase Stk in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis. Methodology/Principal Findings We constructed an isogenic stk mutant of a biofilm-forming clinical S. epidermidis isolate. Presence of stk was important for biofilm formation in vitro and virulence in a murine subcutaneous foreign body infection model. Furthermore, the stk mutant exhibited phenotypes indicating an impact of stk on metabolic pathways. Using different constructs for the genetic complementation of the stk mutant strain with full-length Stk or specific Stk domains, we determined that the Stk intracellular kinase domain is important for biofilm formation and regulation of purine metabolism. Site-specific inactivation of the Stk kinase domain led to defective biofilm formation, in further support of the notion that the kinase activity of Stk regulates biofilm formation of S. epidermidis. According to immunological detection of the biofilm exopolysaccharide PIA and real-time PCR of the PIA biosynthesis genes, the impact of stk on biofilm formation is mediated, at least in part, by a strong influence on PIA expression. Conclusions Our study identifies Stk as an important regulator of biofilm formation and virulence of S. epidermidis, with additional involvement in purine metabolism and the bacterial stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2054338638,"The nuclear hormone receptor PPARβ/δ is integral to efficient wound re-epithelialization and implicated in epidermal maturation. However, the mechanism underlying the latter process of epidermal differentiation remains unclear. We showed that ligand-activated PPARβ/δ indirectly stimulated keratinocyte differentiation, requiring de novo gene transcription and protein translation. Using organotypic skin cultures constructed from PPARβ/δ- and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4)-knockdown human keratinocytes, we showed that the expression of ANGPTL4, a PPARβ/δ target gene, is essential for the receptor mediated epidermal differentiation. The pro-differentiation effect of PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516 was also abolished when keratinocytes were co-treated with PPARβ/δ antagonist GSK0660 and similarly in organotypic skin culture incubated with blocking ANGPTL4 monoclonal antibody targeted against the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. Our focused real-time PCR gene expression analysis comparing the skin biopsies from wildtype and ANGPTL4-knockout mice confirmed a consistent down-regulation of numerous genes involved in epidermal differentiation and proliferation in the ANGPTL4-knockout skin. We further showed that the deficiency of ANGPTL4 in human keratinocytes and mice skin have diminished expression of various protein kinase C isotypes and phosphorylated transcriptional factor activator protein-1, which are well-established for their roles in keratinocyte differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that ANGPTL4 stimulated the activation and binding of JUNB and c-JUN to the promoter region of human involucrin and transglutaminase type 1 genes, respectively. Taken together, we showed that PPARβ/δ regulates epidermal maturation via ANGPTL4-mediated signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2053115314,"Background Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague. The two transcriptional regulators, PhoP and RovA, are required for the virulence of Y. pestis through the regulation of various virulence-associated loci. They are the global regulators controlling two distinct large complexes of cellular pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on the LacZ fusion, primer extension, gel mobility shift, and DNase I footprinting assays, RovA is shown to recognize both of the two promoters of its gene in Y. pestis. The autoregulation of RovA appears to be a conserved mechanism shared by Y. pestis and its closely related progenitor, Y. pseudotuberculosis. In Y. pestis, the PhoP regulator responds to low magnesium signals and then negatively controls only one of the two promoters of rovA through PhoP-promoter DNA association. Conclusions/Significance RovA is a direct transcriptional activator for its own gene in Y. pestis, while PhoP recognizes the promoter region of rovA to repress its transcription. The direct regulatory association between PhoP and RovA bridges the PhoP and RovA regulons in Y. pestis."
https://openalex.org/W2013675889,"Leishmania and other parasites display several mechanisms to subvert host immune cell function in order to achieve successful infection. The ATP receptor P2X7, an agonist-gated cation channel widely expressed in macrophages and other cells of the immune system, is also coupled to inflammasome activation, IL-1 beta secretion, production of reactive oxygen species, cell death and the induction of the permeabilization of the plasma membrane to molecules of up to 900 Da. P2X7 receptors can function as an effective microbicidal triggering receptor in macrophages infected with several microorganisms including Mycobacteria tuberculosis, Chlamydia and Leishmania. We have previously shown that its expression is up-regulated in macrophages infected with L. amazonensis and that infected cells also display an increase in P2X7-induced apoptosis and membrane permeabilization to some anionic fluorescent dyes. In an independent study we recently showed that the phenomenon of macrophage membrane permeabilization can involve at least two distinct pathways for cations and anions respectively. Here, we re-addressed the effects of ATP-induced P2X7-associated phenomena in macrophages infected with L. amazonensis and demonstrated that the P2X7-associated dye uptake mechanisms are differentially modulated. While the membrane permeabilization for anionic dyes is up-modulated, as previously described, the uptake of cationic dyes is strongly down-modulated. These results unveil new characteristics of two distinct permeabilization mechanisms associated with P2X7 receptors in macrophages and provide the first evidence indicating that these pathways can be differentially modulated in an immunologically relevant situation. The possible importance of these results to the L. amazonensis escape mechanism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2065105344,"Cognitive and neuroscientific evidence has challenged the widespread view that perception, cognition and action constitute independent, discrete stages. For example, in continuous response trajectories toward a target response location, evidence suggests that a decision on which target to reach for (i.e., the cognition stage) is not reached before the movement starts (i.e., the action stage). As a result, instead of a straight trajectory to the correct target response, movement trajectories may curve toward competing responses or away from inhibited responses. In the present study, we examined response trajectories during a number comparison task. Participants had to decide whether a target number was smaller or larger than 5. They had to respond by moving to a left or a right response location. Replicating previous results, response trajectories were more curved toward the incorrect response location when distance to 5 was small (e.g., target number 4) than when distance to 5 was large (e.g., target number 1). Importantly, we manipulated the response mapping, which allowed us to demonstrate that this response trajectory effect results from the relative amount of evidence for the available responses across time. In this way, the present study stresses the tight coupling of number representations (i.e., cognition) and response related processes (i.e., action) and shows that these stages are not separable in time."
https://openalex.org/W2133796238,"This paper explores the long term development of networks of glia and neurons on patterns of Parylene-C on a SiO2 substrate. We harvested glia and neurons from the Sprague-Dawley (P1–P7) rat hippocampus and utilized an established cell patterning technique in order to investigate cellular migration, over the course of 3 weeks. This work demonstrates that uncontrolled glial mitosis gradually disrupts cellular patterns that are established early during culture. This effect is not attributed to a loss of protein from the Parylene-C surface, as nitrogen levels on the substrate remain stable over 3 weeks. The inclusion of the anti-mitotic cytarabine (Ara-C) in the culture medium moderates glial division and thus, adequately preserves initial glial and neuronal conformity to underlying patterns. Neuronal apoptosis, often associated with the use of Ara-C, is mitigated by the addition of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We believe that with the right combination of glial inhibitors and neuronal promoters, the Parylene-C based cell patterning method can generate structured, active neural networks that can be sustained and investigated over extended periods of time. To our knowledge this is the first report on the concurrent application of Ara-C and BDNF on patterned cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2016809573,"In contrast to the well-characterized T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that induce genes that drive T cell development or polarization of naïve CD4 T cells into the diverse TH1, TH2, TH17 and Treg lineages, it is unclear what signals maintain specific gene expression in mature resting T cells. Resting T cells residing in peripheral lymphoid organs exhibit low-level constitutive signaling. Whereas tonic signals in B cells are known to be critical for survival, the roles of tonic signals in peripheral T cells are unknown. Here we demonstrate that constitutive signals in Jurkat T cell lines are transduced via the adapter molecule LAT and the Ras exchange factor RasGRP1 to maintain expression of TCRα mRNA and surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex. Independent approaches of reducing basal activity through the LAT-diacylglycerol-RasGRP pathway led to reduced constitutive Ras-MEK-ERK signals and decreased TCRα mRNA and surface TCR expression in Jurkat cells. However, loss of TCR expression takes several days in these cell line experiments. In agreement with these in vitro approaches, inducible deletion of Lat in vivo results in reduced TCRα mRNA- and surface TCR- expression in a delayed temporal manner as well. Lastly, we demonstrate that loss of basal LAT-RasGRP signals appears to lead to silencing or repression of TCRα transcription. We postulate that basal LAT-diacylglycerol-RasGRP signals fulfill a regulatory function in peripheral T lymphocytes by maintaining proper gene expression programs."

We have previously found that NOTCH signaling leads to the degradation of JAK3 in B lineage cells, suggesting that NOTCH signaling exerts its biological effect on lymphopoiesis through modulating JAK3 levels. Here, we delineate the biochemical mechanisms involved in NOTCH-induced JAK3 ubiquitination and degradation. NOTCH signaling is known to transcriptionally activate the genes encoding ASB2 (ankyrin-repeat SOCS box containing protein 2) and SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2). We show that not only NOTCH but also ASB2 and SKP2 can promote the ubiquitination and degradation of JAK3. Both ASB2 and SKP2 can interact with JAK3 through different domains; the FERM and pseudo-kinase domains each had high affinities for ASB2, whereas the kinase domain primarily associated with SKP2. ASB2 and SKP2 previously have been shown to associate with each other to bridge the formation of a non-canonical Cullin1 and Cullin5-containing dimeric E3 ligase complex. Interestingly, the R980W mutant of JAK3 exhibited diminished interaction with SKP2 and resistance to NOTCH or ASB2-induced degradation. Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of either Cullin1 or Cullin5, which lack the C terminus responsible for recruiting the E2 enzymes, were able to prevent JAK3 degradation induced by both ASB2/SKP2 and NOTCH signaling. Together, these results suggest that JAK3 ubiquitination involves the non-canonical dimeric E3 ligase complex, and the R980W mutant will serve as an excellent tool for investigating the biological significance of NOTCH-mediated JAK3 turnover.

Vertebrates have four transmembrane NOTCH receptors, NOTCH1–4. Signaling through the NOTCH receptors is triggered by their interaction with Jagged or Delta-like ligands expressed on adjacent cells. Upon binding of membrane-tethered NOTCH ligands to the receptors, proteolytic cleavages occur at the trans-membrane domain of NOTCH receptors, allowing translocation of their intracellular domain (IC) 2The abbreviations used are: ICintracellular domainSOCSsuppressors of cytokine signalingJAK3Janus kinase 3SOCSsuppressors of cytokine signalingRIPAradioimmune precipitation assay bufferSCFSKP1/Cullin1/F-box protein FERM, 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesinDNdominant negative. to the nucleus. The IC domain then interacts with RBP-Jκ transcription factors to activate gene expression through displacement of repressors and recruitment of coactivators such as Mastermind (3Tamura K.

For example, in the thymus, NOTCH promotes T cell development while suppressing B cell differentiation. Conditional disruption of genes encoding NOTCH1 or its DNA binding partner, RBP-Jκ, completely blocked T cell differentiation (10Wilson A. MacDonald H.R. Radtke F. J. Exp.

NOTCH also plays an important role in the formation of marginal zone B cells. Ablation of either the NOTCH2 or RBP-Jκ genes, as well as overexpression of a dominant-negative form of MASTERMIND, led to dramatic reduction in marginal zone B cell production (12Tanigaki K. Han H.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The JAK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK, are essential mediators of cytokine-induced signal transduction and capable of binding to various cell surface receptors. Cytokine binding to their homodimeric or heterodimeric receptors triggers the aggregation of JAKs, which leads to their phosphorylation and activation. Subsequently, JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptors and generate sites for interaction with cytosolic STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs by JAKs. These phosphotyrosine residues on STATs then act as binding sites for their SH2 domains, mediating the dimerization between themselves. Activated STAT dimers then translocate into the nucleus to activate transcription of their target genes. Although Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 are expressed ubiquitously, Jak3 is expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic lineages (17Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3151-3160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Thomis D.C. Berg L.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19O'Shea J.J. Husa M. Li D.

The development of T and B lymphocytes from hematopoietic progenitor cells is strictly dependent on IL-7 signaling and JAK3 associates with γc chain-containing receptors such as IL-7R (20von Freeden-Jeffry U.

In line with this, Jak3-deficient mice have small thymuses with deficits in thymic progenitor cells and severe blockade in B cell development (25Thomis D.C. Gurniak C.B. Tivol E. Sharpe A.H.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 771-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Together, JAK3 is essential for both B and T cell differentiation. On the other hand, excess JAK3 activities have been shown to cause lymphoproliferative diseases (27Cornejo M.G. Kharas M.G. Werneck M.B. Le Bras S. Moore S.A. Ball B. Beylot-Barry M. Rodig S.J.

To precisely modulate cellular responses, JAK proteins are subjected to multiple tiers of regulation through phosphorylation, de-phosphorylation, inhibitor binding, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (28Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 29O'shea J.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2004; 63: ii67-ii71Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several well known regulatory mediators of JAK signaling belong to a family of cytoplasmic suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-containing proteins, including SOCS1–7 proteins and CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-domain-containing protein) (30Wormald S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Expression of these SOCS proteins is transcriptionally activated by signaling from cytokine receptors via the JAK-STAT pathway. These proteins in turn down-regulate cytokine signaling in a negative feedback loop by three distinct mechanisms: inhibition of JAK activities, competition with STATs for binding sites, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cytokine receptors and JAKs. SOCS proteins have been shown to serve as substrate-binding subunits of the ElonginB/C/Cullin5/SOCS (ECS) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and facilitate the ubiquitination of JAK2 (31Ungureanu D. Saharinen P. Junttila I. Hilton D.J. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3316-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 32Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D.

Cell Res. 2011; 21: 754-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whether JAK3 is regulated in a similar manner has not been investigated. Our group has previously shown that activation of endogenous NOTCH receptors accelerates the degradation of endogenous JAK2 and JAK3 in B but not in T lineage cells in a MAPK-dependent manner, demonstrating a link between NOTCH and JAK-STAT signaling pathways (33Nie L. Zhao Y. Wu W. Yang Y.Z. Wang H.C. Sun X.H. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 754-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Nie L. Perry S.S. Zhao Y. Huang J. Kincade P.W. Farrar M.A. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that NOTCH signaling exerts its effect on lymphopoiesis, at least in part, by influencing the stability of JAK3. Indeed, we have shown that constitutive activation of STAT5 cooperates with a NOTCH-resistant E2A mutant to drive B cell differentiation in the thymus (34Nie L. Perry S.S. Zhao Y. Huang J. Kincade P.W. Farrar M.A. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NOTCH-induced protein ubiquitination depends on its ability to activate transcription, which is consistent with the findings that NOTCH signaling stimulates the transcription of genes encoding SKP2 and ASB2 (33Nie L. Zhao Y. Wu W. Yang Y.Z. Wang H.C. Sun X.H. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 754-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.H.

Med. 2005; 202: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although SKP2 is a substrate-binding component of the SKP1/Cullin1/F-box protein (SCF) E3 ligase complexes, ASB2 represents a subgroup of the SOCS superfamily (37Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 923-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). ASB2 has been shown to compete with SOCS1 to interact with Elongins and Cullin5 (33Nie L. Zhao Y. Wu W. Yang Y.Z. Wang H.C. Sun X.H. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 754-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently provided evidence to suggest that ASB2 and SKP2 associate with each other to bridge the formation of non-canonical E3 ligase complexes composed of ElonginB/C/Cullin5 and SKP1-Cullin1 (33Nie L. Zhao Y. Wu W. Yang Y.Z. Wang H.C. Sun X.H. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 754-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although we showed that such complexes are likely responsible for the ubiquitination of JAK2, the molecular details involved in the relationship between JAK2 and the E3 ligase complexes has not been elucidated. The purposes of the current study are to test whether NOTCH-induced JAK3 degradation employs similar non-canonical E3 ligase complexes and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, which will help develop critical reagents for future in vivo studies. We showed that like activated NOTCH1, ASB2 and SKP2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of JAK3. Interestingly, the R980W mutant of JAK3, which displayed diminished affinity for SKP2, was resistant to NOTCH or ASB2/SKP2-induced degradation. Moreover, dominant-negative mutants of either Cullin1 or Cullin5 rescued JAK3 proteins in the presence of activated NOTCH or ASB2/SKP2. Therefore, these results suggest that NOTCH-induced JAK3 ubiquitination involves the non-canonical heterodimeric E3 ligase complex. The Arg-980 residue plays an important role in JAK3 ubiquitination, and thus, the mutant could serve as a valuable tool for investigating the biological function of NOTCH-mediated JAK3 turnover in lymphopoiesis. A retroviral construct expressing HPC4-tagged mouse JAK3 was created by PCR amplification of mouse cDNA with JAK3-specific primers and in-frame insertion downstream of a HPC4 tag in a modified MIGR1 retroviral vector (39Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S. Lee J.Y. Kadesch T. Hardy R.R. Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The R980W mutation in kinase domain of JAK3 was introduced by using two-step PCR to obtain a 930-bp DNA fragment flanked by XhoI and EcoRI sites. This fragment then replaced the wild type XhoI-EcoRI fragment. In addition, HPC4-tagged wild type or mutant JAK3 cDNAs were also cloned into pcDNA3 by transferring the full-length JAK3 with HPC4 tag from the MIGR1 retroviral vector to the pcDNA3 vector. To do so, the 1.4-kb fragment containing N-terminal JAK3 was amplified by PCR using HPC4-JAK3 as a template. Amplified DNA fragments were inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing and then cut out with EcoRI. The EcoRI fragment was cloned into pcDNA3, and the resulting plasmid was partially digested with EcoRI and filled in with the Klenow enzyme, followed by ligation and transformation. Clones whose EcoRI site at the 5′ end of the insert was destroyed by filling in were selected and used for the subsequent step that includes an insertion of a 3.4-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment containing the 3′ portion of the wild type or mutant JAK3 coding sequence and internal ribosome entry site followed by enhanced GFP. These fragments were obtained by complete digestion of JAK3 retroviral constructs with XbaI and partial digestion with EcoRI. JAK3 deletion constructs were created by restriction digestion at appropriate sites and ligation into the pcDNA3 vector or MIGR1 retroviral vector or by PCR amplification of desired fragment using HPC4-JAK3 as a template, followed by insertion into pcDNA3 or MIGR1. Human ASB2 with a 3×FLAG tag was kindly supplied by Dr. Junya Kohroki (Tokyo University of Science), and the deletion constructs were as described (33Nie L. Zhao Y. Wu W. Yang Y.Z. Wang H.C. Sun X.H.

Zhang (Nevada Cancer Institute, Las Vegas, NV). The Myc-tagged NOTCHΔE/pCS2+MT construct was provided generously by Dr. Raphael Kopan (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) (40Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A.

YFP-ubiquitin/pK was kindly supplied by Dr. Scott Plafker (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Monoclonal anti-HPC4 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Charles Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) (41Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-HA (12CA5) tissue culture supernatants were produced from hybridoma cell lines. Monoclonal anti-GFP and rabbit polyclonal anti-SKP2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polycolonal antibodies against STAT5a and phospho-STAT5 were from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (Invitrogen). MG-132 was from Calbiochem. IL-7 was purchased from R&D Systems. NIH3T3 and 293T cells were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate method. NIH3T3 cells were treated with 15% (v/v) glycerol in 1× HBS 3–4 h post transfection to increase transfection efficiency. To constitute the intact JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway, 2 μg of each plasmids expressing IL-7Rα chain and IL-2Rγ chain were included in transfection assays for measuring JAK3 degradation. Typically, 1 μg of HPC4-JAK3 and 0.5 μg of STAT5a were co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells with or without 2 μg of each FLAG-ASB2 and/or SKP2. Alternatively, 1 μg of NΔE was co-transfected. To rescue ASB2 and/or SKP2 or NΔE induced-degradation of JAK3, 3 μg of FLAG-DN-Cullin1 or DN-Cullin5 were included. Twenty-six to thirty hours after transfection, cells were fed with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and 5 ng/ml IL-7 and harvested 1.5 h later. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline), containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 ng/ml leupeptin, 2 ng/ml aprotinin, 2 ng/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF), 1 mm DTT, and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were analyzed using 8.5–9% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitation was usually performed with 5 μg of antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed using 8.5–9% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Wild type or mutant full-length JAK3 (5 μg) were co-transfected into 293T cells with 10 μg of HA-tagged or YFP-tagged ubiquitin along with appropriate constructs followed by the treatment with 5 μm MG-132 for 3–5 h before harvest. Treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors, DTT, and 5 μm MG-132. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-HPC4 or anti-GFP antibodies. The precipitate was analyzed using 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-HPC4 antibodies. We have shown previously that signaling from NOTCH receptors by co-culturing bone marrow-derived mouse primary pro-B cells with OP9 stromal cells expressing Delta-like-1 significantly reduced the levels of JAK3 (34Nie L. Perry S.S. Zhao Y. Huang J. Kincade P.W. Farrar M.A. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism has not been investigated. To do so, we utilized a NOTCH1 mutant, called NΔE, whose extracellular domain is N-terminal truncated and can be activated constitutively in a ligand-independent manner. In addition, NΔE lacks the PEST domain at the C terminus, which mediates the degradation of the intracellular domain, thus resulting in its accumulation in the nucleus (40Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, HPC4-tagged JAK3 with or without an increasing amount of NΔE were introduced into NIH3T3 cells. As controls for transfection efficiency, the cells also received a construct expressing STAT5, whose stability was previously shown to be insensitive of NOTCH (34Nie L. Perry S.S. Zhao Y. Huang J. Kincade P.W. Farrar M.A. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, constructs expressing IL-7Rα and IL-2Rγ were included to facilitate JAK3 phosphorylation upon IL-7 treatment. Twenty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested following incubation with IL-7 for 1.5 h, and immunoblotting was performed to measure the levels of JAK3 and NΔE (Fig. 1A). The doublets detected with the anti-Myc antibody against the tag on NΔE likely represent the full-length NΔE and NICDΔE produced by spontaneous cleavages of the receptor by γ-secretases. Levels of STAT5 served as controls of transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 1A, JAK3 levels dramatically decreased as the levels of NΔE increased. This result could be interpreted to mean that NOTCH signaling accelerates the turnover of JAK3. To determine whether NOTCH stimulates the poly-ubiquitination of JAK3, in vivo ubiquitination assays were performed in 293T cells. HPC4-tagged JAK3 was co-transfected with or without NΔE along with YFP-tagged ubiquitin. Total ubiquitinated proteins were then immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with anti-GFP antibodies. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-HPC4 antibody to detect ubiquitinated JAK3. Expression of NΔE significantly increased the amount of polyubiquitinated JAK3 compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1B). As a negative control, no signal was detected in the sample without HPC4-JAK3 expression. These results revealed that NOTCH significantly enhanced the polyubiquitination of JAK3, suggesting that enhanced ubiquitination of JAK3 stimulated by NOTCH mediates its degradation. NOTCH signaling has been shown to stimulate the transcription of genes encoding ASB2 and SKP2, which are thought to bridge the formation of a dimeric E3 ligase complex (33Nie L. Zhao Y. Wu W. Yang Y.Z. Wang H.C. Sun X.H. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 754-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.H.

Med. 2005; 202: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To test whether ASB2 and SKP2 are involved in JAK3 degradation, similar co-transfection assays were carried out as described for Fig. 1A. Co-transfection of JAK3 with either ASB2 or SKP2 led to an obvious reduction of JAK3 levels, suggesting that both proteins stimulate the turnover of JAK3 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, when both proteins were co-expressed, a greater effect was observed (Fig. 2B). More importantly, incubation with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, for 1.5 h prior to harvest significantly recovered JAK3 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Admittedly, the level of JAK3 did not return to that of cells without ASB2 and SKP2 expression (lane 2). This may be due to a nonspecific toxic effect of MG-132 on cells as the levels of JAK3 in cells transfected with or without ASB2 but both treated with MG-132 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 5) were comparable after normalization with the internal control. This result thus suggests that ASB2 and SKP2-induced JAK3 degradation is proteasome-dependent. Because ASB2 is able to induce the degradation of JAK3, the next logical questions are whether JAK3 physically interacts with ASB2 and which regions in JAK3 mediate the interaction. Therefore, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in 293T cells, where JAK3 and ASB2 were overexpressed. To map the regions in JAK3 that mediate the interaction with ASB2, truncation mutants were generated as diagramed in Fig. 3A. These mutants contain one of the known functional domains, the FERM domain responsible for receptor binding, the pseudo-kinase domain known to regulate JAK function or the kinase domain with catalytic activities (42Saharinen P. Silvennoinen O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47954-47963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 43Yamaoka K. Saharinen P. Pesu M. Holt 3rd, V.E. Silvennoinen O. O'Shea J.J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 253Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In a series of co-IP assays (Fig. 3, B–D), HPC4-tagged full-length or mutant Jak3 were co-transfected with or without FLAG-tagged Asb2. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-FLAG antibody or control IgG in RIPA buffer, which is a stringent condition for protein-protein interaction. The precipitates were immunoblotted with the anti-HPC4 antibody. The results showed that not only the full-length JAK3, but also all three mutants were readily co-precipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody from extracts of ASB2-expressing cells. In contrast, control IgG did not bring down full-length JAK3, demonstrating the specificity of the assays. In addition, we have also created JAK3 mutants lacking one of the functional domains and found that these mutants were capable of association of ASB2, consistent with the observation that multiple ASB2-interacting domains exist in JAK3 (data not shown). We have also replaced the HPC4 tag with the HA tag and obtained the same results, indicating that the interaction was not mediated by the epitope tag (data not shown). To further investigate the interaction between ASB2 and JAK3, we searched for the sequences in ASB2 that are required for interaction with full-length JAK3. Five ASB2 deletion mutants containing either the ankyrin repeats or SOCS box or both were analyzed in co-IP assays by pulling down FLAG-tagged ASB2 and immunoblotting for JAK3 (Fig. 4, A and B). All of these ASB2 mutants were able to co-precipitate with JAK3, suggesting that several regions in ASB2 can mediate the interaction with JAK3. Next, we attempted to define the regions of the ASB2-mediating interaction with different functional domains of JAK3 by using two ASB2 mutants, 1–328 and ΔN, which contain the N-terminal ankyrin repeats and C-terminal SOCS box, respectively. Both constructs lack the region previously shown to be involved in SKP2 interaction (Fig. 4A). They were co-transfected with full-length JAK3 or mutants possessing only the FERM, pseudo-kinase, or kinase domain (Fig. 4, C and D). In comparison with the behavior of full-length JAK3, it appeared that the FERM domain interacted with both 1–328 and ΔN, whereas the pseudo-kinase domain did not associate with ΔN. More interestingly, the kinase domain interacted very poorly with 1–328 and did not bind ΔN. As both constructs lack the region necessary for SKP2 interaction, and the kinase domain is capable of interacting with full-length ASB2 (Fig. 3D), it raises a possibility that the association of the kinase domain with ASB2 depends on SKP2. To aid future in vivo studies of the biological significance of NOTCH-induced JAK3 degradation and to further understand the biochemical mechanism underlying JAK3 ubiquitination, we sought to create JAK3 point mutants that are re"

Numerous functional aspects of 11β-HSD-1 have been understood thanks to the availability at the Worldwide Protein Data Bank of a number of X-ray structures of the enzyme either alone or in complex with inhibitors, and to several experimental data. However at present, a complete description of the dynamic behaviour of 11β-HSD-1 upon substrate binding is missing. To this aim we firstly docked cortisone into the catalytic site of 11β-HSD-1 (both wild type and Y177A mutant), and then we used steered molecular dynamics and metadynamics to simulate its undocking. This methodology helped shedding light at molecular level on the complex relationship between the enzyme and its natural substrate. In particular, the work highlights a) the reason behind the functional dimerisation of 11β-HSD-1, b) the key role of Y177 in the cortisone binding event, c) the fine tuning of the active site degree of solvation, and d) the role of the S228-P237 loop in ligand recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1987109128,"Background Automated time-lapse microscopy can visualize proliferation of large numbers of individual cells, enabling accurate measurement of the frequency of cell division and the duration of interphase and mitosis. However, extraction of quantitative information by manual inspection of time-lapse movies is too time-consuming to be useful for analysis of large experiments. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present an automated time-series approach that can measure changes in the duration of mitosis and interphase in individual cells expressing fluorescent histone 2B. The approach requires analysis of only 2 features, nuclear area and average intensity. Compared to supervised learning approaches, this method reduces processing time and does not require generation of training data sets. We demonstrate that this method is as sensitive as manual analysis in identifying small changes in interphase or mitotic duration induced by drug or siRNA treatment. Conclusions/Significance This approach should facilitate automated analysis of high-throughput time-lapse data sets to identify small molecules or gene products that influence timing of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2087417607,"Chromatin structure regulates the dynamics of the recognition and repair of DNA double strand breaks; open chromatin enhances the recruitment of DNA damage response factors, while compact chromatin is refractory to the assembly of radiation-induced repair foci. MU2, an orthologue of human MDC1, a scaffold for ionizing radiation-induced repair foci, is a widely distributed chromosomal protein in Drosophila melanogaster that moves to DNA repair foci after irradiation. Here we show using yeast 2 hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation that MU2 binds the chromoshadow domain of the heterochromatin protein HP1 in untreated cells. We asked what role HP1 plays in the formation of repair foci and cell cycle control in response to DNA damage. After irradiation repair foci form in heterochromatin but are shunted to the edge of heterochromatic regions an HP1-dependent manner, suggesting compartmentalized repair. Hydroxyurea-induced repair foci that form at collapsed replication forks, however, remain in the heterochromatic compartment. HP1a depletion in irradiated imaginal disc cells increases apoptosis and disrupts G2/M arrest. Further, cells irradiated in mitosis produced more and brighter repair foci than to cells irradiated during interphase. Thus, the interplay between MU2 and HP1a is dynamic and may be different in euchromatin and heterochromatin during DNA break recognition and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2013458634,"The aim of our work is to furnish enzymes with polymerization ability by creating fusion constructs with the polymerizable protein, flagellin, the main component of bacterial flagellar filaments. The D3 domain of flagellin, exposed on the surface of flagellar filaments, is formed by the hypervariable central portion of the polypeptide chain. D3 is not essential for filament formation. The concept in this project is to replace the D3 domain with suitable monomeric enzymes without adversely affecting polymerization ability, and to assemble these chimeric flagellins into tubular nanostructures. To test the feasibility of this approach, xylanase A (XynA) from B. subtilis was chosen as a model enzyme for insertion into the central part of flagellin. With the help of genetic engineering, a fusion construct was created in which the D3 domain was replaced by XynA. The flagellin-XynA chimera exhibited catalytic activity as well as polymerization ability. These results demonstrate that polymerization ability can be introduced into various proteins, and building blocks for rationally designed assembly of filamentous nanostructures can be created."
https://openalex.org/W2075098891,"Risk is a ubiquitous feature of the environment for most organisms, who must often choose between a small and certain reward and a larger but less certain reward. To study choice behavior under risk in a genetically well characterized species, we trained mice (C57BL/6) on a discrete trial, concurrent-choice task in which they must choose between two levers. Pressing one lever (safe choice) is always followed by a small reward. Pressing the other lever (risky choice) is followed by a larger reward, but only on some of the trials. The overall payoff is the same on both levers. When mice were not food deprived, they were indifferent to risk, choosing both levers with equal probability regardless of the level of risk. In contrast, following food or water deprivation, mice earning 10% sucrose solution were risk-averse, though the addition of alcohol to the sucrose solution dose-dependently reduced risk aversion, even before the mice became intoxicated. Our results falsify the budget rule in optimal foraging theory often used to explain behavior under risk. Instead, they suggest that the overall demand or desired amount for a particular reward determines risk preference. Changes in motivational state or reward identity affect risk preference by changing demand. Any manipulation that increases the demand for a reward also increases risk aversion, by selectively increasing the frequency of safe choices without affecting frequency of risky choices."
https://openalex.org/W2122389316,"We compared the Ca(2+) responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) between mouse endothelial cells derived from large-sized arteries, aortas (aortic ECs), and small-sized arteries, mesenteric arteries (MAECs). Application of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) caused an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in both cell types. The [Ca(2+)](i) rises diminished in the presence of U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, or Xestospongin C (XeC), an inhibitor for inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors. Removal of Ca(2+) from the bath also decreased the [Ca(2+)](i) rises in response to H(2)O(2). In addition, treatment of endothelial cells with H(2)O(2) reduced the [Ca(2+)](i) responses to subsequent challenge of ATP. The decreased [Ca(2+)](i) responses to ATP were resulted from a pre-depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores by H(2)O(2). Interestingly, we also found that Ca(2+) store depletion was more sensitive to H(2)O(2) treatment in endothelial cells of mesenteric arteries than those of aortas. Hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XO) was also found to induce [Ca(2+)](i) rises in both types of endothelial cells, the effect of which was mediated by superoxide anions and H(2)O(2) but not by hydroxyl radical. H(2)O(2) contribution in HX-XO-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rises were more significant in endothelial cells from mesenteric arteries than those from aortas. In summary, H(2)O(2) could induce store Ca(2+) release via phospholipase C-IP(3) pathway in endothelial cells. Resultant emptying of intracellular Ca(2+) stores contributed to the reduced [Ca(2+)](i) responses to subsequent ATP challenge. The [Ca(2+)](i) responses were more sensitive to H(2)O(2) in endothelial cells of small-sized arteries than those of large-sized arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2126811467,"The transmission of parasites and pathogens among vertebrates often depends on host population size, host species diversity, and the extent of crowding among potential hosts, but little is known about how these variables apply to most vector-borne pathogens such as the arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses). Buggy Creek virus (BCRV; Togaviridae: Alphavirus) is an RNA arbovirus transmitted by the swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) to the cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and the introduced house sparrow (Passer domesticus) that has recently invaded swallow nesting colonies. The virus has little impact on cliff swallows, but house sparrows are seriously affected by BCRV. For house sparrows occupying swallow nesting colonies in western Nebraska, USA, the prevalence of BCRV in nestling sparrows increased with sparrow colony size at a site but decreased with the number of cliff swallows present. If one nestling in a nest was infected with the virus, there was a greater likelihood that one or more of its nest-mates would also be infected than nestlings chosen at random. The closer a nest was to another nest containing infected nestlings, the greater the likelihood that some of the nestlings in the focal nest would be BCRV-positive. These results illustrate that BCRV represents a cost of coloniality for a vertebrate host (the house sparrow), perhaps the first such demonstration for an arbovirus, and that virus infection is spatially clustered within nests and within colonies. The decreased incidence of BCRV in sparrows as cliff swallows at a site increased reflects the “dilution effect,” in which virus transmission is reduced when a vector switches to feeding on a less competent vertebrate host."
https://openalex.org/W2142717894,"Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) serves as an important RhoGTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) protein that terminates active RhoA signaling in human cancers. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1 depends not only on RhoGAP activity, but also relies on proper focal adhesion localization through its interaction with tensin family proteins. Recently, there are reports showing that DLC1 can also be found in the nucleus; however, the existence and the relative tumor suppressive activity of nuclear DLC1 have never been clearly addressed.We herein provide new evidence that DLC1 protein, which predominantly associated with focal adhesions and localized in cytosol, dynamically shuttled between cytoplasm and nucleus. Treatment of cells with nuclear export blocker, Leptomycin B (LMB), retained DLC1 in the nucleus. To understand the nuclear entry of DLC1, we identified amino acids 600-700 of DLC1 as a novel region that is important for its nuclear localization. The tumor suppressive activity of nuclear DLC1 was directly assessed by employing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) fusion variant of DLC1 (NLS-DLC1) with preferential nuclear localization. In SMMC-7721 HCC cells, expression of NLS-DLC1 failed to suppress colony formation and actin stress fiber formation in vitro. The abrogated tumor suppressive activity of nuclear DLC1 was demonstrated for the first time in vivo by subcutaneously injecting p53(-/-) RasV12 hepatoblasts with stable NLS-DLC1 expression in nude mice. The injected hepatoblasts with NLS-DLC1 expression effectively formed tumors when compared with the non-nuclear targeted DLC1.Our study identified a novel region responsible for the nuclear entry of DLC1 and demonstrated the functional difference of DLC1 in different cellular compartments both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1993919323,"Codon bias in the genome of an organism influences its phenome by changing the speed and efficiency of mRNA translation and hence protein abundance. We hypothesized that differences in codon bias, either between-species differences in orthologous genes, or within-species differences between genes, may play an evolutionary role. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the genome-wide codon bias in six species that occupy vital positions in the Eukaryotic Tree of Life. We acquired the entire protein coding sequences for these organisms, computed the codon bias for all genes in each organism and explored the output for relationships between codon bias and protein function, both within- and between-lineages. We discovered five notable coordinated patterns, with extreme codon bias most pronounced in traits considered highly characteristic of a given lineage. Firstly, the Homo sapiens genome had stronger codon bias for DNA-binding transcription factors than the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, whereas the opposite was true for ribosomal proteins – perhaps underscoring transcriptional regulation in the origin of complexity. Secondly, both mammalian species examined possessed extreme codon bias in genes relating to hair – a tissue unique to mammals. Thirdly, Arabidopsis thaliana showed extreme codon bias in genes implicated in cell wall formation and chloroplast function – which are unique to plants. Fourthly, Gallus gallus possessed strong codon bias in a subset of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins – perhaps reflecting the enhanced bioenergetic efficiency in birds that co-evolved with flight. And lastly, the G. gallus genome had extreme codon bias for the Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor – which may help to explain their spontaneous recovery from deafness. We propose that extreme codon bias in groups of genes that encode functionally related proteins has a pathway-level energetic explanation."
https://openalex.org/W1965000937,"Organelle transport in eukaryotes employs both microtubule and actin tracks to deliver cargo effectively to their destinations, but the question of how the two systems cooperate is still largely unanswered. Recently, in vitro studies revealed that the actin-based processive motor myosin V also binds to, and diffuses along microtubules. This biophysical trick enables cells to exploit both tracks for the same transport process without switching motors. The detailed mechanisms underlying this behavior remain to be solved. By means of single molecule Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRFM), we show here that electrostatic tethering between the positively charged loop 2 and the negatively charged C-terminal E-hooks of microtubules is dispensable. Furthermore, our data indicate that in addition to charge-charge interactions, other interaction forces such as non-ionic attraction might account for myosin V diffusion. These findings provide evidence for a novel way of myosin tethering to microtubules that does not interfere with other E-hook-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2091460902,"Mast cells are known to play a pivotal role in allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis by releasing granules containing histamine, LTC4, and other preformed chemical mediators. Previous reports have demonstrated that IKK2 (also called IKKβ), a central intracellular component of NF-κB activation pathways, plays a critical role in IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells and anaphylaxis in mice. In this study, we show that protein levels of tumor suppressor p53 are up-regulated upon IgE-mediated activation in mast cells and lack of p53 results in enhanced responses in both early and late phase anaphylaxis. p53 inhibits not only the catalytic activity of IKK2 presumably through the modulation of glycosylation but also p65 (RelA)-mediated transactivation. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that p53 functions as a negative regulator in mast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984302038,"Pro-coagulant membrane microvesicles (MV) derived from platelets and leukocytes are shed into the circulation following receptor-mediated activation, cell-cell interaction, and apoptosis. Platelets are sentinel markers of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Experiments were designed to evaluate the time course and mechanism of direct interactions between platelets and leukocytes following acute activation of TLR4 by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Blood from age-matched male and female wild type (WT) and TLR4 gene deleted (dTLR4) mice was incubated with ultra-pure E. coli LPS (500 ng/ml) for up to one hour. At designated periods, leukocyte antigen positive platelets, platelet antigen positive leukocytes and cell-derived MV were quantified by flow cytometry. Numbers of platelet- or leukocyte-derived MV did not increase within one hour following in vitro exposure of blood to LPS. However, with LPS stimulation numbers of platelets staining positive for both platelet- and leukocyte-specific antigens increased in blood derived from WT but not dTLR4 mice. This effect was blocked by inhibition of TLR4 signaling mediated by My88 and TRIF. Seven days after a single intravenous injection of LPS (500 ng/mouse or 20 ng/gm body wt) to WT mice, none of the platelets stained for leukocyte antigen. However, granulocytes, monocytes and apoptotic bodies stained positive for platelet antigens.Within one hour of exposure to LPS, leukocytes exchange surface antigens with platelets through TLR4 activation. In vivo, leukocyte expression of platelet antigen is retained after a single exposure to LPS following turn over of the platelet pool. Acute expression of leukocyte antigen on platelets within one hour of exposure to LPS and the sustained expression of platelet antigen on leukocytes following a single acute exposure to LPS in vivo explains, in part, associations of platelets and leukocytes in response to bacterial infection and changes in thrombotic propensity of the blood."
