https://openalex.org/W990450420,"Hanzlik et al. (1) observed the glycogenic action of propylene glycol in rats, and Lindberg (2) has isolated its phosphorylated ester from sea urchin eggs. The latter worker has subsequently demonstrat’ed the presence of 1 ,%propanediol phosphate (PDP) in other t’issues (3). Rudney (4, 5) has suggested that PDP might be an intermediate in the conversion of acetone to “formate” and Cz fragment, while Sakami and Lafaye (6) have suggested that PDP is an intermediate in Ohe metabolism of acetone and a precursor of a 3-carbon compound of the glycolytic cycle. Reports from this laboratory have suggested an alternative pathway of 3-carbon compounds of the glycolytic cycle (7, 8). It appeared to us that PDP might be an intermediate in the alternative pathway suggested by experiments in which slices of heart ventricle anabolizing lactic acid were not inhibited by a concentrat’ion of fluoride sufficient to inhibit enolase. Further, it occurred to us, in view of the recent observations of Harting (9), t,hat PDP might react in the same enzyme systems that normally oxidize cY-glycerophosphate, provided the primary alcohol group is not essential for cr-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity. The work reported here demonstrates the oxidation of PDP by a-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and the removal of the end-product of this oxidation by a further oxidation by addition of a heart muscle extract (10). It has been found that a crystalline preparation of n-glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase will replace the heart’ muscle extract. The data suggest a new series of reactions by which the carbon of PDP might be diverted into pyruvic acid of the glycolytic cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2097266962,"In several recent publications (14) it has been reported that dietary aminopterin produces a marked decrease in rat liver choline oxidase activity as measured by the whole homogenate technique. A simple folic acid deficiency, however, has been shown to produce only slight changes in the activity of this enzyme (5). It was probable that a simple folic acid deficiency did not deplete the tissues of folic (and folinic) acid to a great enough extent to produce much change in the activity of the whole homogenate. If only minute amounts of a folic acid cofactor were needed by the enzyme, a whole liver homogenate, even from deficient animals, might contain enough of the cofactor to maintain the normal activity of the enzyme. The choline oxidase system of rat liver has been shown to be located in the mitochondrial fraction of liver (6-S). Therefore, the authors felt that, if the mitochondria were isolated, washed, and thus freed of extraneous folic acid, folinic acid, or cofactor containing either of these in bound form, the effects of a simple folic acid deficiency could be demonstrated more clearly. In the present investigation not only the effect of a simple folic acid deficiency on the choline oxidase of isolated mitochondria has been studied, but also a comparison has been made with the effects on the mitochondrial activity of the enzyme produced by feeding aminopterin to rats. In order to complement the enzyme results, and to study the correlation of the eneyme activity with folic acid and folinic acid’ concentration in the tissues, all of the samples used for the enzyme determinations were assayed microbiologically for both folic acid and folinic acid. In the course of these"

https://openalex.org/W2346210971,"Snell et al. (1) have shown that LactobaciZZus bulguricus strain Gere A grows in a medium containing lactose or other p-galactosides as the carbon source, but does not grow initially in a medium containing galactose or glucose or mixtures of the two. Only after prolonged incubation with these monosaccharides, and presumably through adaptation, can this microorganism utilize galactose or glucose for growth. The carbohydrate metabolism of microorganisms giving evidence of utilizing lactose by some other means than through hydrolysis is of interest in connection with the mechanisms of “direct” utilization of disaccharides (2, 3) and may perhaps lend information concerning the general biochemical problem of lactose metabolism. Accordingly, the purpose of this report is to describe certain aspects of the metabolism of L. bulgaricus Gere A with particular reference to lactose and its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose."

https://openalex.org/W1598284187,"It has been known for some years that the body fat content of vitamin BB-deficient rats is lower than that of comparable control animals (1). Pair-feeding techniques have demonstrated that this phenomenon is not the result of inanition (2, 3). Carter and Phizackerley (3) have recently reported that a deficiency of pyridoxine in rats maintained on a low fat diet involved a lowering of the total lipide content of the body and a diminution of the neutral fat content of the liver. If 20 per cent margarine was included in the basal diet, the total body lipide was restored to normal in the pyridoxine-deficient animals. Other than reports on the body fat content there are no recorded data on the over-all body composition of the vitamin BG-deficient rat. In the present paper, observations are reported on the total crude fatty acid, protein, and water content of carcasses of vitamin Bs-deficient rats and of their comparable pair-fed controls. To determine the specificity of the effects of vitamin Ba deficiency on carcass composition, similar determinations were made on thiaminedeficient rats and their pair-fed controls. In view of the observations of Carter and Phizackerley (3) a further study was carried out to ascertain the effect of dietary fat on the total crude fatty acid content of deficient and control animals on two levels of corn oil in the diet."
