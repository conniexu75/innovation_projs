https://openalex.org/W2035880579,"Although long-term potentiation (LTP) has been studied as the mechanism for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, evidence for this hypothesis is still incomplete. The mice with a mutation in the alpha-calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alpha-CaMKII), a synaptic protein enriched in the hippocampus, are appropriate for addressing this issue because the hippocampus of these mice is deficient in LTP but maintains intact postsynaptic mechanisms. These mutant mice exhibit specific learning impairments, an indication that alpha-CaMKII has a prominent role in spatial learning, but that it is not essential for some types of non-spatial learning. The data considerably strengthen the contention that the synaptic changes exhibited in LTP are the basis for spatial memory."

In all cases, omega-Aga-IVA block could be reversed by a brief train of strong depolarizations. There was no overlap between current blocked by omega-Aga-IVA and the fractions blocked by dihydropyridines and omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not all current resistant to dihydropyridines and omega-conotoxin was blocked by omega-Aga-IVA. The results suggest that omega-Aga-IVA is highly selective for P-type channels and that many central neurons and some peripheral neurons possess substantial P-type current."

https://openalex.org/W1983635763,"N-type calcium channels are ω-conotoxin (ω-CgTx)-sensitive, voltage-dependent ion channels involved in the control of neurotransmitter release from neurons. Multiple subtypes of voltage-dependent calcium channel complexes exist, and it is the α1 subunit of the complex that forms the pore through which calcium enters the cell. The primary structures of human neuronal calcium channel α1B subunits were deduced by the characterization of overlapping complementary DNAs. Two forms (α1B-1 and α1B-2) were identified in human neuroblastoma (IMR32) cells and in the central nervous system, but not in skeletal muscle or aorta tissues. The α1B-1 subunit directs the recombinant expression of N-type calcium channel activity when it is transiently co-expressed with human neuronal β2 and α2b subunits in mammalian HEK293 cells. The recombinant channel was irreversibly blocked by ω-CgTx but was insensitive to dihydropyridines. The α1B-1α2bβ2-transfected cells displayed a single class of saturable, high-affinity (dissociation constant = 55 pM) ω-CgTx binding sites. Co-expression of the β2 subunit was necessary for N-type channel activity, whereas the α2b subunit appeared to modulate the expression of the channel. The heterogeneity of α1b subunits, along with the heterogeneity of α2 and β subunits, is consistent with multiple, biophysically distinct N-type calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1990602082,"The concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium (Ca2+) increases in various stimulated cells in a wave (Ca2+ wave) and in periodic transients (Ca2+ oscillations). These phenomena are explained by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from separate intracellular stores, but decisive evidence is lacking. A monoclonal antibody to the IP3 receptor inhibited both IICR and CICR upon injection of IP3 and Ca2+ into hamster eggs, respectively. The antibody completely blocked sperm-induced Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ oscillations. The results indicate that Ca2+ release in fertilized hamster eggs is mediated solely by the IP3 receptor, and Ca(2+)-sensitized IICR, but not CICR, generates Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1977130958,"We have localized a cell type-specific silencer element in the SCG10 gene by deletion analysis. This neural-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) selectively represses SCG10 expression in nonneuronal cells and tissues. The NRSE contains a 21 bp region with striking homology to a sequence present in a silencer domain of the rat type II sodium channel (NaII), another neuron-specific gene. We have identified a sequence-specific protein(s) that binds the SCG10 NRSE, as well as the homologous element in the NaII gene. A point mutation in the NRSE that abolishes binding of this neural-restrictive silencer-binding factor (NRSBF) in vitro also eliminates silencing activity in vivo. NRSBF is present in nuclear extracts from nonneuronal cells but not in extracts from neuronal cells, suggesting that the neuron-specific expression of SCG10 reflects, at least in part, the absence or inactivity of this protein. These data identify the NRSE as a potentially general DNA element for the control of neuron-specific gene expression in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1679419992,"Two peaks of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activator activity are resolved upon ion exchange chromatography of cytosolic extracts from epidermal growth factor-stimulated A431 cells. Two forms of the activator (1 and 2) have been purified from these peaks, using chromatography on Q-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, hydroxylapatite, ATP-agarose, Sephacryl S-300, Mono S, and Mono Q. The two preparations each contained one major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 46 or 45 kDa, respectively, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Evidence identifying the MAP kinase activators as the 46- and 45-kDa proteins is presented. Using inactive mutants of MAP kinase as potential substrates, it was found that each preparation of MAP kinase activator catalyzes phosphorylation of the regulatory residues, threonine 188 and tyrosine 190, of Xenopus MAP kinase. These results support the concept that the MAP kinase activators are protein kinases. These MAP kinase kinases demonstrate an apparent high degree of specificity toward the native conformation of MAP kinase, although slow autophosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein on serine and threonine residues is detected as well."
https://openalex.org/W2004361024,"Lethargic (lh/lh) mice, which function as an animal model of absence seizures, have spontaneous seizures that have behavioral and electrographic features and anticonvulsant sensitivity similar to those of human absence seizures. Antagonists of the γ-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) receptor suppressed these seizures in lethargic mice, whereas agonists of GABAB receptors exacerbated them. Furthermore, GABAB receptor binding and synaptically evoked GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate responses were selectively increased in lh/lh mice. Therefore, enhanced GABAB receptor-mediated synaptic responses may underlie absence seizures in lh/lh mice, and GABAB receptor antagonists hold promise as anticonvulsants for absence seizures."

https://openalex.org/W1995865634,"Neural-specific expression of a sodium channel mini-gene has been shown to be mediated by a 28 bp silencer element, RE1, located in the 5' flanking region of the gene. This element is active exclusively in cell lines that do not express the endogenous brain type II sodium channel gene, including fibroblast, skeletal muscle, and certain neuronal cell lines. All of these non-type II expressing cells contain RE1-binding complexes. On the basis of mutational analysis and in vivo ""repressor trap"" experiments, we propose that cell-specific RE1-binding proteins are responsible, at least in part, for restricting expression of the type II sodium channel gene to specific neurons in the vertebrate nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1505669099,"Rab proteins are membrane-bound prenylated GTP-binding proteins required for the targeted movement of membrane vesicles from one organelle to another. In the current paper we have characterized and purified an enzyme that attaches geranylgeranyl residues to Rab proteins that bear the COOH-terminal sequence Cys-X-Cys (such as Rab3A) and Cys-Cys (such as Rab1A). This enzyme is designated Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GG transferase). At high salt concentrations, Rab GG transferase from rat brain cytosol separates into two components, designated A and B, both of which are required for activity. We purified Component B to apparent homogeneity and found that it contains two peptides of 60 and 38 kDa. The purified Rab GG transferase did not attach geranylgeranyl to p21H-ras-CVLL, which is prenylated by a GG transferase of the CAAX type that resembles the CAAX farnesyltransferase. Rab GG transferase was strongly inhibited by Zn2+, a cation that is absolutely required by farnesyltransferase. The Rab GG transferase was also inhibited by NaCl concentrations in excess of 100 mM. Together with previous data, the current findings indicate that mammalian cells possess at least three protein prenyltransferases (CAAX farnesyltransferase, CAAX GG transferase, and Rab GG transferase) that are specific for different classes of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins and other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2070676751,"Sodium channels are the major proteins that underlie excitability in nerve, heart, and skeletal muscle. Chemical reaction rate theory was used to analyze the blockage of single wild-type and mutant sodium channels by cadmium ions. The affinity of cadmium for the native tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant cardiac channel was much higher than its affinity for the TTX-sensitive skeletal muscle isoform of the channel (microliters). Mutation of Tyr401 to Cys, the corresponding residue in the cardiac sequence, rendered microliters highly susceptible to cadmium blockage but resistant to TTX. The binding site was localized approximately 20% of the distance down the electrical field, thus defining the position of a critical residue within the sodium channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W1670027677,"High molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in which proteolytic activity was inactivated (diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-uPA), its amino-terminal fragment (ATF, amino acids (aa) 1-143), and fucosylated and defucosylated growth factor domains (GFD, aa 4-43) were tested for growth-promoting effects and binding in human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells and U-937 lymphoma cells. DFP-uPA, ATF, and both the fucosylated and defucosylated GFD were capable of competing with 125I-ATF for binding to both SaOS-2 and U-937 cells. DFP-uPA, ATF, and fucosylated GFD were also mitogenic in SaOS-2 cells and increased cell numbers. However, defucosylated GFD was nonmitogenic in SaOS-2 cells and did not stimulate cell proliferation, even though it bound to these cells in a manner equivalent to the fucosylated GFD. A nonglycosylated high molecular weight uPA expressed and purified from Escherichia coli inhibited 125I-ATF binding to SaOS-2 cells but was also nonmitogenic. No mitogenic activity was observed in U-937 cells treated with the uPA forms capable of eliciting a mitogenic response in SaOS-2 cells. Proteolytically prepared kringle domain (aa 47-135) and low molecular weight uPA (aa 144-411) did not compete for 125I-ATF binding and did not elicit any mitogenic response in either of the cell lines tested. In addition, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which has been shown to be homologous to uPA in its growth factor domain and is also fucosylated, did not inhibit 125I-ATF binding nor elicit any mitogenic response. These results demonstrate that the GFD, implicated in binding to the uPA receptor, is also responsible for growth factor like activity in SaOS-2 cells and that the fucosylation at Thr18 within this domain may serve as a molecular trigger in eliciting this response."
https://openalex.org/W2077464172,"The technique of whole-genome polymerase chain reaction was used to study the DNA binding properties of the product of the wt1 gene. The zinc finger region of this gene is alternatively spliced such that the major transcript encodes a protein with three extra amino acids between the third and fourth fingers. The minor form of the protein binds specifically to DNA. It is now shown that the major form of wt1 messenger RNA encodes a protein that binds to DNA with a specificity that differs from that of the minor form. Therefore, alternative splicing within the DNA binding domain of a transcription factor can generate proteins with distinct DNA binding specificities and probably different physiological targets."
https://openalex.org/W1559776259,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid Type A (GABAA) receptors are the major sites of synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. These receptors are thought to be pentameric complexes of homologous transmembrane glycoproteins. Molecular cloning has revealed a multiplicity of different GABAA receptor subunits divided into five classes, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and rho, based on sequence homology. Within the proposed major intracellular domain of these subunits, there are numerous potential consensus sites for protein phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases. We have used purified fusion proteins of the major intracellular domain of GABAA receptor subunits produced in Escherichia coli to examine the phosphorylation of these subunits by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). The purified fusion protein of the intracellular domain of the beta 1 subunit was an excellent substrate for both PKA and PKC. PKA and PKC phosphorylated the beta 1 subunit fusion protein on serine residues on a single tryptic phosphopeptide. Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 409 in the intracellular domain of the beta 1 subunit to an alanine residue eliminated the phosphorylation of the beta 1 subunit fusion protein by both protein kinases. The purified fusion proteins of the major intracellular domain of the gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits of the GABAA receptor were rapidly and stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKC but not by PKA. The phosphorylation of the gamma 2S subunit occurred on serine residues on a single tryptic phosphopeptide. Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 327 of the gamma 2S subunit fusion protein to an alanine residue eliminated the phosphorylation of the gamma 2S fusion protein by PKC. The gamma 2L subunit is an alternatively spliced form of the gamma 2S subunit that differs by the insertion of 8 amino acids (LLRMFSFK) within the major intracellular domain of the gamma 2S subunit. The PKC phosphorylation of the gamma 2L subunit occurred on serine residues on two tryptic phosphopeptides. Site-specific mutagenesis of serine 343 within the 8-amino acid insert to an alanine residue eliminated the PKC phosphorylation of the novel site in the gamma 2L subunit. No phosphorylation of a purified fusion protein of the major intracellular loop of the alpha 1 subunit was observed with either PKA or PKC. These results identify the specific amino acid residues within GABAA receptor subunits that are phosphorylated by PKA and PKC and suggest that protein phosphorylation of these sites may be important in regulating GABAA receptor function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2144126683,"We have studied the early development of chicken embryo sensory neurons in culture before they become dependent on neurotrophic factors for survival. During this period, they undergo a distinct change in morphology:initially they have small, spindle-shaped, phase-dark cell bodies, which become spherical and phase bright and extend long neurites. Although this maturational change occurs in isolated cells grown in chemically defined medium, it is accelerated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-3 and is retarded by antisense oligonucleotides that inhibit expression of the common, low affinity neurotrophic factor receptor (gp75NGFR) and by antisense BDNF oligonucleotides. We conclude that neurotrophic factors play a role in the earliest stages of sensory neuron development and suggest that they operate by an autocrine mechanism at this time."
https://openalex.org/W1529873450,"Based upon its recently cloned nucleotide sequence, the human platelet thrombin receptor is thought to be formed by a single polypeptide chain with seven transmembrane domains and an extracellular N terminus that can be cleaved by thrombin. As yet, however, little is known from studies of the receptor protein itself. To obtain such information, we have prepared monoclonal antibodies against a peptide corresponding to receptor residues Ser42 through Phe55, the domain immediately distal to the site of cleavage by thrombin. By flow cytometry, all of the antibodies reacted with the thrombin-responsive megakaryoblastic CHRF-288 and HEL cell lines, but not with the T-lymphoid Sup-T1 cell line. Functionally, the antibodies inhibited platelet responses to alpha-thrombin, gamma-thrombin, and trypsin, but had no effect on platelet activation by ADP, epinephrine, or the thromboxane analog U46619. Radioiodinated antibody bound to approximately 1,800 sites/platelet, a value similar to the reported number of moderate affinity thrombin binding sites per platelet. On Western blots, the antibodies recognized a 66-kDa protein in platelet, HEL, and CHRF-288 membranes. The discrepancy between this apparent size and the predicted mass of the receptor suggests that, as with other G protein-coupled receptors, one or more of the potential sites for N-linked glycosylation have been utilized. Therefore, these results suggest that: 1) the cloned thrombin receptor is involved in a broad range of platelet responses to thrombin, as well as gamma-thrombin and trypsin; 2) as predicted, the N terminus of the receptor is accessible on the platelet surface; 3) the moderate affinity thrombin binding site noted in earlier studies may be the receptor; 4) potentially as much as one third of the mass of the receptor is carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W2141949285,"Associative long-term synaptic depression (LTD) was investigated utilizing negatively correlated activity patterns in the medial and lateral perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus in anesthetized rats. Normally only nonassociative, or heterosynaptic, LTD is elicited in naive pathways. We report here, however, that associative LTD in the lateral path is readily induced after being “primed” by a brief period of lateral path synaptic activity at a 9 rhythm frequency (5 Hz). Priming of associative LTD lasts at least 2 hr and is not seen following priming activity at non-θ frequencies (1 and 15 Hz). N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation is critical for establishing the priming effect, but not for the subsequent induction of the associative LTD. These data suggest that 9 rhythm activity in the dentate gyrus may predispose the system to a specific form of synaptic plasticity, associative LTD."
https://openalex.org/W1571425954,"Abstract Two classes of mutations were identified in the degS and degU regulatory genes of Bacillus subtilis, leading either to deficiency of degradative enzyme synthesis (degS or degU mutations) or to a pleiotropic phenotype which includes overproduction of degradative enzymes and the loss of genetic competence (degS(Hy) or degU(Hy) mutations). We have shown previously that the DegS protein kinase and the DegU response regulator form a signal transduction system in B. subtilis. We now demonstrate that the DegS protein kinase also acts as a DegU phosphatase. We present evidence that the DegU response regulator has two active conformations: a phosphorylated form which is necessary for degradative enzyme synthesis and a nonphosphorylated form required for expression of genetic competence. The degU146-encoded response regulator, allowing expression of genetic competence, has been purified and seems to be modified within the putative phosphorylation site (D56----N) since it is no longer phosphorylated by DegS. Both the degU146 mutation as well as the degS220 mutation, which essentially abolishes DegS protein kinase activity, lead to deficiency of degradative enzyme synthesis, indicating the requirement of phosphorylated DegU for the expression of this phenotype. We also purified the degU32(Hy)-encoded protein and showed that this response regulator is phosphorylated by the DegS protein kinase in vitro. In addition, the phosphorylated form of the degU32(Hy)-encoded protein presented a strongly increased stability as compared with the wild type DegU protein, thus leading to hyperproduction of degradative enzymes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1595498439,"The effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) activity were assessed in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Both NGF and EGF induced a rapid activation of PtdIns 3-kinase as assessed by a dramatic rise in growth factor-induced PtdIns 3-kinase activity found in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. The intracellular levels of two of the lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), also rose dramatically, exhibiting time courses very similar to the appearance of PtdIns 3-kinase in immunoprecipitates. The activation of PtdIns 3-kinase is, therefore, a common event in the signal transduction processes elicited by growth factors stimulating distinct cellular end points in PC12 cells, namely the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation and EGF-stimulated mitogenesis. Thus the intracellular products of this enzyme may function in early biochemical events that are common components of the pathways controlling both differentiation and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1490364597,"An initial step in the replication of simian virus (SV40) DNA is the ATP-dependent formation of a double hexamer of the SV40 large tumor (T) antigen at the SV40 DNA replication origin. In the absence of DNA, T antigen assembled into hexamers in the presence of magnesium and ATP. Hexameric T antigen was stable and could be isolated by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The ATPase activities of hexameric and monomeric T antigen isolated from parallel glycerol gradients were identical. However, while monomeric T antigen was active in the ATP-dependent binding, untwisting, unwinding, and replication of SV40 origin-containing DNA, hexameric T antigen was inactive in these reactions. Isolated hexamers incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of ATP remained intact, but dissociated into monomers when incubated at 37 degrees C in the absence of ATP. This dissociation restored the activity of these preparations in the DNA replication reaction, indicating that hexameric T antigen is not permanently inactivated but merely assembled into a nonproductive structure. We propose that the two hexamers of T antigen at the SV40 origin assemble around the DNA from monomer T antigen in solution. This complex untwists the DNA at the origin, melting specific DNA sequences. The resulting single-stranded regions may be utilized by the T antigen helicase activity to initiate DNA unwinding bidirectionally from the origin."
https://openalex.org/W1491134337,"Abstract The crystal structure of wheat germ agglutinin isolectin 1 (WGA1) complexed with a tryptic sialoglycopeptide fragment (T-5) from its erythrocyte receptor glycophorin A, which contains the O-linked tetrasaccharide NeuNAc-alpha 2,3-Gal-beta 1,3-(alpha 2,6-NeuNAc) Gal-NAc-alpha 1-O-Thr, has been determined by molecular replacement techniques and refined at 2.0-A resolution (R = 18.1%). The structure reveals that association between WGA1 dimers, composed of two identical four-domain (A-D) monomers, and T-5 is asymmetric and involves sialic acid binding at three nonequivalent aromatic residue-rich sites. Two independent binding modes are observed. In the dominant (major) binding mode, the two highest affinity sites are utilized to cross-link neighboring crystallographically related WGA1 dimers. The branched tetrasaccharide has an extended rigid conformation, and its terminal alpha 2,6-NeuNAc and alpha 2,3-NeuNAc residues occupy specificity sites in domains B1 (monomer 1) and C2 (monomer 2) on opposing dimers, respectively. This asymmetric selection of binding sites leads to infinite open-ended arrays of interlinked lectin molecules. In the subsidiary minor binding mode, only the terminal alpha 2,6-NeuNAc, anchored to the aromatic residue-rich binding site in domain A2, is clearly visible. The remaining portion of T-5 is disordered. This structure presents the first evidence for NeuNAc binding in the aromatic residue-rich sites of domains A and C and suggests a preference of WGA for alpha 2,6-linked NeuNAc. Moreover, the unusual asymmetric WGA1-tetrasaccharide association, involving domain binding sites that differ in their binding affinities for NeuNAc, offers explanations for the widely observed cooperative cell binding behavior of WGA."

Although increases in the intracellular concentration of magnesium ions inhibit the L-type calcium current in heart cells, magnesium-adenosine triphosphate complexes (MgATP) would be expected to increase the current by promoting channel phosphorylation. Rapid increases in the intracellular concentration of MgATP induced by flash photolysis of caged magnesium or caged ATP resulted in enhanced calcium current. The increase in calcium current was not prevented by blocking phosphorylation, revealing a previously unrecognized direct regulatory action of the magnesium-nucleotide complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091615524,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the maturation and survival of sympathetic neurons, but the mechanisms controlling expression of the NGF receptor in developing neuroblasts have not been defined. MAH cells, an immortalized sympathoadrenal progenitor cell line, did not respond to NGF and expressed neither low-affinity NGF receptor (p75) nor p140trk messenger RNAs. Depolarizing concentrations of potassium chloride, but none of a variety of growth factors, induced expression of p140trk but not p75 messenger RNA. A functional response to NGF was acquired by MAH cells under these conditions, suggesting that expression of p75 is not essential for this response. Depolarization also permitted a relatively high proportion of MAH cells to develop and survive as neurons in fibroblast growth factor and NGF. These data establish a relation between electrical activity and neurotrophic factor responsiveness in developing neurons, which may operate in the functioning of the mature nervous system as well."
https://openalex.org/W1485452517,"A number of protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) (PTPases) have been shown to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor in vitro; however, it is not known whether any individual PTPase has specificity for certain phosphotyrosine residues of the receptor that regulate its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. We evaluated the deactivation of the insulin receptor kinase by three candidate enzymes that are expressed in insulin-sensitive rat tissues, including the receptor-like PTPases LAR and LRP, and the intracellular enzyme, PTPase1B. Purified insulin receptors were activated by insulin and receptor dephosphorylation, and kinase activity was quantitated after incubation with recombinant PTPases from an Escherichia coli expression system. When related to the level of overall receptor dephosphorylation, LAR deactivated the receptor kinase 3.1 and 2.1 times more rapidly than either PTPase1B or LRP, respectively (p less than 0.03). To assess whether these effects were associated with preferential dephosphorylation of the regulatory (Tyr-1150) domain of the receptor beta-subunit, we performed tryptic mapping of the insulin receptor beta-subunit after dephosphorylation by PTPases. Relative to the rate of initial loss of 32P from receptor C-terminal sites, LAR dephosphorylated the Tris-phosphorylated Tyr-1150 domain 3.5 and 3.7 times more rapidly than either PTPase1B or LRP, respectively (p less than 0.01). The accelerated deactivation of the insulin receptor kinase by LAR and its relative preference for regulatory phosphotyrosine residues further support a potential role for this transmembrane PTPase in the physiological regulation of insulin receptors in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487399858,"JC virus is a neurotropic virus that causes the demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in humans. In order to understand the neurotropic nature of this virus, we examined the binding of nuclear proteins to the viral regulatory region. A close association of nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) and Jun protein binding sites was found. These binding sites were either adjacent or overlapped each other. Depending on the order of binding, there was some interference of binding of the NF-1 protein by Jun even at a non-Jun binding site. This suggests that there may be a direct interaction between these proteins. Examination of the regulatory region of a number of genes expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems revealed that many of these genes apparently have adjacent NF-1 and activator protein binding sites immediately upstream from the mRNA start site. Since it had been demonstrated that nuclear proteins from brain and non-brain cells could interact with these sites, it is probable that the NF-1- and Jun-related proteins which interact at these sites are involved in the basal activity of these genes. It appears that adjacent binding sites for NF-1 and Jun immediately upstream from the mRNA start site may be a characteristic of many genes expressed in the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1524268866,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of cells expressing the human EGF receptor (EGFr) results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. EGF treatment of cells expressing a tyrosine kinase-inactive EGFr failed to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous substrates in response to EGF; however, the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase did occur. This observation indicates that MAP kinase is activated in response to a signal other than the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFr. Because EGF does not stimulate cells expressing the inactive EGFr to proliferate, phosphorylation of MAP kinase may not be sufficient for the EGF-dependent mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1506060840,"The Rieske 2Fe2S center from Bacillus PS3, a Gram-positive thermophilic eubacterium, has been studied by EPR spectroscopy. Its redox midpoint potential at pH 7.0 was determined to be +165 +/- 10 mV and was found to decrease with an apparent slope of -80 mV/pH unit above pH 7.9. The Qo-site inhibitor stigmatellin induced spectral changes analogous to those reported for Rieske centers from mitochondria and chloroplasts. The redox midpoint potential of the PS3 Rieske cluster was not affected by stigmatellin. The orientation of the g tensor was similar to other Rieske centers (gz and gy are oriented parallel, gx is oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane). The shape of the EPR spectrum of the Rieske cluster from PS3 changed as a function of the redox state of the menaquinone (MK) pool. This permitted the redox midpoint potential of the MK pool to be determined in the membrane. Values of -60 +/- 20 mV at pH 7.0 and of -130 +/- 20 mV at pH 8.0 were obtained. The results are compared with already published data from other Rieske centers. It is proposed that all Rieske centers that function in electron transport chains using MK as pool quinone show common features that distinguish them from Rieske centers operating in ubiquinone- or plastoquinone-based electron transfer chains."
https://openalex.org/W1597355731,"The isolation and characterization of the rat genomic clone encoding the cholesterogenic enzyme farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase is reported. The gene is localized on a 15-kilobase (kb) genomic fragment, spans approximately 12 kb and contains eight exons. Sequences containing from 3.9 kb to 132 base pairs (bp) of the putative promoter were joined to the coding region of the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The CAT activities or CAT mRNA levels of the hybrid genes were determined following either transient transfections into human hepatoma HepG2 cells or stable transfections into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The transient transfections identified a 319-bp fragment that was required for a 4-fold induction in the absence of sterols. Sequence analysis of this region showed it contained five potential copies of the sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) (Smith, J.R., Osborne, T.F., Brown, M.S., Goldstein, J.L., and Gil, G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18480-18487) previously identified in the promoters of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and low density lipoprotein receptor genes. Further mutational and deletion analysis of the FPP synthase promoter-CAT constructs followed by stable transfection and primer extension of the CAT mRNA levels indicated that these potential SRE-1 regulatory elements were not involved in the sterol-mediated transcriptional regulation of the gene. Our analyses have identified a 115-bp region that is required for the transcriptional induction of FPP synthase in the absence of sterols. These results suggest that the FPP synthase gene may be regulated at the transcriptional level by a different mechanism than other sterol regulated genes."

To determine whether the nucleosomes associated with the progeny molecules resulted from displacement of parental histones during replication followed by reassembly, the replication reactions were performed in the presence of control templates. It was observed that the progeny genomes resulting from the replication of chromatin templates retained a nucleosomal structure, whereas the progeny of the control DNA molecules were not assembled into chromatin. Additional experiments, involving direct addition of histones to the replication reaction mixtures, confirmed that the control templates were not sequestered in some form which made them unavailable for nucleosome assembly. Thus, our data demonstrate that parental nucleosomes remain associated with the replicating molecules and are transferred to the progeny molecules without displacement into solution. We propose a simple model in which nucleosomes ahead of the fork are transferred intact to the newly synthesized daughter duplexes."
https://openalex.org/W1586713446,"To study the importance of a rigid copper site for the structure and function of azurin, a mutant with a reduced number of internal hydrogen bonds around the copper has been prepared and characterized. To this purpose, the previously cloned azu gene from Alcaligenes denitrificans (Hoitink, C. W. G., Woudt, L. P., Turenhout, J. C. M., Van de Kamp, M., and Canters, G. W. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 90, 15-20) was expressed in Escherichia coli and an isolation and purification procedure for the azurin was developed. The azurin obtained after heterologous expression in E. coli appears spectroscopically indistinguishable from azurin derived from A. denitrificans. The hydrogen bonding network around the copper site was altered by replacing Asn47 by a leucine by means of site-directed mutagenesis. Asn47 is a conserved residue in all blue copper proteins of which the primary structure has been reported. Characterization of the mutant protein with UV-visible, electron spin resonance, and NMR spectroscopy, and comparison with the wild type azurin revealed that the structure of the copper site as well as the overall structure of the protein have been largely retained. The redox activity as measured by the electron self-exchange rate appears not to have changed either. However, the mutant differs from the wild type azurin with respect to stability and midpoint potential. Midpoint potentials of mutant and wild type azurin amount to 396 and 286 mV, respectively. The difference is due to sizable entropic and enthalpic contributions which to a large extent cancel. Possible explanations for the outcome of these experiments are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1552381471,"The virally encoded origin binding protein (OBP) of herpes simplex virus (HSV) is required for viral DNA synthesis. OBP binds at the replication origin to initimultienzyme replication complex (Challberg, M. D., and Kelly, T. J. (1989) Annu Rev. Biochem. 58, 671-717), OBP binds to two sites at the replication origin. The sequence-specific interaction of OBP with each binding site is localized to the major groove, and in both HSV origins the two interaction surfaces are in phase, aligned on the same face of the helix (Hazuda, D. J., Perry, H. C., Naylor, A. M., and McClements, W. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 24621-24625). Using native gel electrophoresis, we now demonstrate that OBP binding to the origin is highly cooperative and that cooperativity requires the putative NH2-terminal leucine zipper. Neither the phase nor orientation of the binding sites affect cooperativity, suggesting that the interaction promotes wrapping of origin DNA around the OBP multimer. A comparison of OBP DNase I footprints with the DNase I footprints of a truncated protein defective in cooperativity demonstrates that the interaction between OBPs bound at sites I and II affects the conformation of the intervening DNA, particularly when the phase or orientation of the two sites is different from wild type. OBP may elicit a unique nucleoprotein structure which facilitates unwinding of the origin and/or assembly of the replication complex. We also demonstrate that OBP can exchange binding sites, forming interduplex complexes. This property may be important for reinitiation of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2134873867,"Addition of arachidonic acid or 5-phenyl-4-pentenylhydroperoxide to manganese-prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (Mn-PGH synthase) produced a species with an absorbance maximum at 418 nm. This maximum is distinct from those of resting enzyme (372 and 468 nm) or reduced enzyme (434 nm). The formation of the 418 nm-absorbing species was observed immediately after the addition of hydroperoxide to enzyme but only after a 10-s lag period following addition of arachidonate. Mn-PGH synthase exhibited a peroxidase activity that was 0.8% that of Fe-PGH synthase. Addition of peroxidase reducing substrates to the oxidized form of Mn-PGH synthase diminished the absorbance at 418 nm. In the case of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylphenylenediamine, reduction of the 418 nm-absorbing species was accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 610 nm due to the oxidized form of the amine. Thus, the spectral and chemical properties of the 418 nm-absorbing species are consistent with its existence as a higher oxidation state of Mn-PGH synthase. Kinetic analysis indicated that formation of the higher oxidation state preceded or was coincident with oxygenation of the fatty acid substrate, eicosa-11,14-dienoic acid. The cyclooxygenase activity of Mn-PGH synthase was inhibited by the combination of glutathione and human plasma glutathione peroxidase at a glutathione peroxidase concentration 227-fold lower than the concentration that inhibited Fe-PGH synthase. The results suggest that Mn-PGH synthase forms a higher oxidation state following reaction with hydroperoxides added exogenously or generated endogenously from polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates. This higher oxidation state functions in the peroxidase catalytic cycle of Mn-PGH synthase, and its formation appears to be essential for activation of the cyclooxygenase catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1553060266,"Protein ubiquitination has been implicated in ATP-dependent protein turnover and in a number of biological processes in eukaryotic cells. The ubiquitination activating enzyme, E1, and ubiquitin carrier protein, E2, are two essential enzymes in the protein ubiquitination machinery. Using purified E1 and E2 from rabbit reticulocytes and various protein kinases, which include cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and protein tyrosine kinase, we demonstrated that E1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, with a stoichiometry of 0.65 mol of phosphate/mol of E1, and one of the E2 isoforms, E2(32kDa), is phosphorylated by protein tyrosine kinase to 2 eq of phosphate/mol of protein. Phosphorylation of E1 causes a 2-fold enhancement of its activity as monitored by ubiquitin-dependent ATP in equilibrium PPi exchange. When 1 eq of phosphate was incorporated into E2(32kDa), a 2.4-fold activation was also observed for its activity to catalyze the ubiquitination of histone H2A. The regulatory significance of this finding is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1590172087,"Two types of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors have been described: high affinity (class I) and low affinity (class II). Biological responses to NGF are thought to be mediated by class I receptors, whereas the role of class II receptors is less clear. While some neuronal cells express both receptor types, only class II receptors have been detected on glial cells. Two glial cell lines, peripheral Schwannoma D6P2T and central 33B glioma cells, were employed to investigate the properties of class II receptors in the absence of class I receptors. These cell lines were found to express NGF receptors identified as class II by a low nanomolar dissociation constant, rapid dissociation kinetics at 4 degrees C, and trypsin sensitivity. The receptor was found to bind brain-derived neurotrophic factor with similar affinity as NGF. The responsible binding molecule appeared in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a heterogeneously glycosylated protein of 60-80 kDa with a tendency to aggregate. All receptor bands affinity-labeled with radioiodinated NGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-p75NGFR antibody, but not with anti-p140prototrk antiserum. In these cells, which express p75NGFR as only NGF receptor, a time- and temperature-dependent appearance of a nondisplaceable, trypsin-resistant, acid wash-stable ligand fraction, followed by an increase of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radiolabel in the medium was observed. This sequestration resembled receptor-mediated internalization with subsequent degradation of NGF. Whether this ligand processing indicates a functional role of p75NGFR in glial cells remains to be shown."
https://openalex.org/W1513368550,"Mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) catalyzes the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of retinoic acid. There exists a family of ADH isozymes encoded by unique genes, and it is unclear which isozymes are most important for regulation of retinoic acid synthesis during differentiation or development. A region in the human ADH3 promoter from -328 to -272 base pairs was shown previously to function as a retinoic acid response element (RARE), prompting an hypothesis for a positive feedback mechanism controlling retinoic acid synthesis (Duester, G., Shean, M. L., McBride, M. S., and Stewart, M. J. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 1638-1646). The ADH3 RARE contains three direct AGGTCA repeats which constitute the critical nucleotides of RAREs present in other genes. We dissected the ADH3 RARE and determined that receptor binding as well as transactivation are dependent upon only the two downstream AGGTCA motifs separated by 5 base pairs, a structure noticed previously for a RARE in the promoter for the retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR beta) gene. ADH3 and RAR beta RAREs functioned similarly in transfection assays, suggesting that the feedback mechanisms controlling ADH3 and RAR beta utilize a common RARE. We also found that the normal functioning of the ADH3 RARE was abrogated by thyroid hormone receptor in the presence of thyroid hormone. A negative thyroid hormone response element in the human ADH3 promoter was found to colocalize with the RARE. Since ADH production in rat liver is known to be repressed by thyroid hormone, these findings suggest that human ADH production may also be subject to thyroid hormone repression and that the mechanism involves an interference with retinoic acid induction."
https://openalex.org/W1556500380,"A permeabilized rat adipocyte model was developed which permitted an examination of: 1) insulin receptor autophosphorylation, 2) phosphorylation of a putative insulin receptor substrate of 160 kDa, pp160, and 3) the dephosphorylation reactions associated with each of these phosphoproteins. Rat adipocytes, preincubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h, were exposed to insulin (10(-7) M) at the time of digitonin permeabilization. Phosphorylation of pp160 and autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor increased as a function of Mn2+ concentration in the media with near maximum responses at 10 mM. Maximum response was at least as large as the intact cell response to 10(-7) M insulin. In contrast, magnesium did not increase phosphorylation of pp160 although an increase in receptor autophosphorylation was observed. Autophosphorylation was preserved at digitonin concentrations of 20-100 micrograms/ml, but pp160 phosphorylation was negligible beyond 40 micrograms/ml. Our previous work demonstrated that the insulin receptor was associated with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity in permeabilized adipocytes (Mooney, R., and Anderson, D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6850-6857). The current permeabilized adipocyte model made possible an examination of the effects of phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, including several divalent metal cations (Zn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+), vanadate, and molybdate on both net phosphorylation of pp160 and autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Zn2+ at 100 microM, Ni2+ at 1 mM, and Co2+ at 1 or 5 mM increased insulin-dependent phosphorylation of pp160 at least 5-fold and autophosphorylation 2-fold. At higher concentrations of Zn2+ (1 mM) and Ni2+ (5 mM), however, no increase in phosphorylation of pp160 was observed and autophosphorylation was inhibited. Vanadate (1 mM) and molybdate (100 microM) increased insulin-dependent phosphorylation of pp160 by 3-fold when tested separately and 7-fold in combination. Insulin receptor autophosphorylation was increased 50% by each and 3-fold when the agents were combined. Dephosphorylation of pp160 and the insulin receptor was analyzed directly by permeabilizing prelabeled insulin-treated adipocytes in the presence of EDTA (10 mM). Dephosphorylation of pp160 was especially rapid with a t1/2 of approximately 10 s. The t1/2 for the insulin receptor was 37 s. Zn2+ at 1 mM (a concentration that inhibited the insulin receptor kinase) was a strong inhibitor of dephosphorylation, prolonging the rate of pp160 dephosphorylation more than 12-fold and insulin receptor dephosphorylation 3-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1554760150,"Proton translocation in spheroplasts from Escherichia coli has been studied in two mutants, one of which expresses cytochrome o and the other cytochrome d as the terminal oxidase. Using the O2 pulse method, the H+/e- ratio of proton translocation associated with cytochrome o was confirmed to be near 2 at neutral pH, but was found to decrease considerably when the medium pH was raised above 8. At high pH there was an increase in H+/OH- permeability of the cell membrane, but this was not sufficient to explain the decline in proton ejection. The pH effect was confined to cytochrome o-linked activity. It was not present when cytochrome d generated the electrochemical proton gradient. This makes it improbable that the Na+/H+ antiporter is responsible. The most likely explanation for our finding is that there is a slip in the proton-pumping mechanism of cytochrome o at high pH."
https://openalex.org/W1495102483,"An endopeptidase was purified to homogeneity from the cell extracts of Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 (a human oral spirochete) by a procedure that comprised dialysis, anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), hydroxylapatite FPLC, immobilized metal affinity FPLC, FPLC chromatofocusing, and two consecutive gel permeation FPLC steps. The enzyme is a 62-kDa protein with an isoelectric point of 6.5-7.0. Experiments with enzyme inhibitors suggest that this enzyme is a metallopeptidase and that its activity is not dependent on sulfhydryl or serine residues. The enzyme is active on furylacryloyl-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ala (FALGPA; pH optimum near 6.25), bradykinin (Bk), and several Bk-related peptides. In FALGPA, the cleavage site is the Leu-Gly bond. An imino acid is absolutely necessary in position P'2. The shortest hydrolyzed peptide was FALGPA, the hydrolysis of which is strongly and competitively inhibited by Bk (Ki = 5.0 microM). The pyrophosphate ion and phosphoramidon also inhibited the hydrolysis of FALGPA. The enzyme does not hydrolyze all typical synthetic collagenase substrates, Azocoll, Azocasein, or Type I and Type IV collagens, or any other proteins tested. In Bk-related peptides, the hydrolyzed bond was Phe5-Ser6. Since a Bk antagonist and a Bk-potentiating pentapeptide also were good substrates, it is possible that the enzyme hydrolyzes Bks and related peptides only because of the coincidental, specific amino acid sequence of those substrates. A proposal is made that since a substantial portion of the amino acid sequence of FALGPA is present in collagen (and additionally acknowledging that the furylacryloyl residue structurally resembles that of proline), the natural substrates of this enzyme may be small, soluble collagen fragments produced by other enzymes from periodontal connective tissue, and that such peptides are important for the nutrition and pathogenicity of T. denticola."
https://openalex.org/W1861421567,"The transit peptide of the lumenal 33-kDa oxygen-evolving polypeptide (OEE1) is capable of directing the import and targeting of the foreign protein dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to the thylakoid lumen. The import results from the first part of this study indicate that methotrexate cannot block the import or intraorganellar targeting of OEE1-DHFR in chloroplasts in contrast to that reported for the import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV)-DHFR in mitochondria. These results suggest that the fusion of the OEE1 transit sequence to DHFR affected the protein's methotrexate binding properties. We further examined and compared the transport characteristics of a number of carboxyl-terminal truncated native chloroplast precursors to determine whether carboxyl domains contribute to the import and intraorganellar targeting mechanism of these proteins. The plastid precursors chosen for this study are targeted to one of the following chloroplast compartments: the stroma, the thylakoid membrane, and the lumen. In most cases, removal of carboxyl domains had a dramatic effect on one or more stages of the translocation pathway, such as import, processing, and intraorganellar targeting. The effects of carboxyl deletions varied from precursor to precursor and were dependent on the extent of the deletion. These combined results suggest that carboxyl domains in the mature part of the proteins can influence the function of the transit peptide, and as a result play an important role in determining the import and targeting competence of chloroplast precursors."

https://openalex.org/W1647638823,"The purpose of this study was to determine how RI alpha, the R subunit of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase, is regulated in rabbit ovarian follicles in response to the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge. When soluble extracts from rabbit preovulatory follicles and 7-day-old corpora lutea were photoaffinity-labeled with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP, 3-fold more RI alpha was detected in corpora lutea than in follicles. Based on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, both type I holoenzyme and free RI alpha increased during luteinization. Western blot analysis of soluble extracts obtained from follicles and corpora lutea at various time points after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection revealed a 6-10-fold increase in RI alpha protein by 5 h after hCG injection. However, based on Northern blot analysis and solution hybridization/RNase protection assays, this increase in RI alpha protein was not due to an increase in RI alpha mRNA. These results suggested that RI alpha subunit levels were post-transcriptionally regulated. Half-life determinations indicated a 2.1-fold increase in the stability of RI alpha when follicles were incubated in the presence of hCG. The effect of hCG on the stability of RI alpha could also be mimicked by forskolin, thus suggesting that a rise in cAMP levels in follicles during the luteinizing hormone surge plays a role in RI alpha subunit stability. We conclude that RI alpha protein is stabilized in follicles by hCG treatment and the consequent rise in follicular cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1499993621,"Abstract Association of gelsolin with actin filament subunits was investigated by the decrease of the fluorescence intensity of a 7-nitro-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) label covalently linked to gelsolin. The rate constant of this reaction was found to be 4 x 10(3) M-1 s-1. Binding of NBD-labeled gelsolin to monomeric actin proceeds at a similar low rate. The rate of association of gelsolin that was unmodified to actin filament subunits was estimated too. Unmodified gelsolin was added to a mixture of actin filaments and actin-DNase I complex. The fractions of gelsolin that bound to actin filament subunits or to actin-DNase I complex depended on the relative rates of these two competing reactions. In this way it was possible to estimate the rate constant of association of unmodified gelsolin with actin filament subunits (2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1). Thus, gelsolin associates with actin filament subunits at a rate that is considerably slower than diffusion-controlled and similar to the rate of binding of gelsolin to monomeric actin."
