Lee et al. grew wafer-scale single-crystal films of hBN by feeding the precursors into molten gold films on tungsten substrates. The low solubility of boron and nitrogen in gold caused micrometer-scale grains of hBN to form that coalesced into single crystals. These films in turn supported the growth of epitaxial wafer-scale films of graphene and tungsten disulfide. Science , this issue p. 817"
https://openalex.org/W2901030934,"Inorganic-biological hybrid systems have potential to be sustainable, efficient, and versatile chemical synthesis platforms by integrating the light-harvesting properties of semiconductors with the synthetic potential of biological cells. We have developed a modular bioinorganic hybrid platform that consists of highly efficient light-harvesting indium phosphide nanoparticles and genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a workhorse microorganism in biomanufacturing. The yeast harvests photogenerated electrons from the illuminated nanoparticles and uses them for the cytosolic regeneration of redox cofactors. This process enables the decoupling of biosynthesis and cofactor regeneration, facilitating a carbon- and energy-efficient production of the metabolite shikimic acid, a common precursor for several drugs and fine chemicals. Our work provides a platform for the rational design of biohybrids for efficient biomanufacturing processes with higher complexity and functionality."

However, most of these studies are not in the context of native membrane. Chorev et al. released intact membrane complexes directly from native lipid membrane vesicles into a mass spectrometer. They analyzed components of the Escherichia coli inner and outer membranes and the bovine mitochondrial inner membrane. For several identified complexes, they found a stoichiometry that differs from published results and, in some cases, confirmed interactions that could not be characterized structurally.

This enzyme binds to sites of oxidative DNA damage and initiates DNA base excision repair. Visnes et al. developed a small-molecule drug that acts as a potent and selective active-site inhibitor that stops OGG1 from recognizing its DNA substrate (see the Perspective by Samson). The drug inhibited DNA repair and modified OGG1 chromatin dynamics, which resulted in the inhibition of proinflammatory pathway genes. The drug was well tolerated by mice and suppressed lipopolysaccharide- and tumor necrosis factor–α–mediated neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs. Science , this issue p. 834 ; see also p. 748"

However, the presence of nitrogen in both rings can trip up this process. Hilton et al. report a versatile alternative process in which phosphorus takes the place of the metal. The phosphorus binds successively to both rings at the sites opposite the nitrogen, and treatment with acidic ethanol then pushes them off, bound to each other. Theory implicates a five-coordinate phosphorus intermediate that kinetically favors coupling of the two nitrogen-bearing rings over reactions of the other all-carbon substituents.

The dynamics of the electronic structure in such transitions can be monitored using, for example, time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Nicholson et al. observed a photoinduced metal-insulator transition in indium nanowires on a silicon surface. They monitored both the physics and the chemistry of the system after the initial photoexcitation and correlated the closing of the electronic bandgap with the rearrangement of chemical bonds. The results showcase the wealth of information that time-resolved tools can reveal about the dynamics of complex systems. Science , this issue p. 821"

https://openalex.org/W2901946995,"Aberrant Notch signaling is implicated in several cancers, including breast cancer. However, the mechanistic details of the specific receptors and function of ligand-mediated Notch signaling that promote breast cancer remains elusive. In our studies we show that DLL1, a Notch signaling ligand, is significantly overexpressed in ERα+ luminal breast cancer. Intriguingly, DLL1 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in ERα+ luminal breast cancer, but not in other subtypes of breast cancer. In addition, this effect is specific to DLL1, as other Notch ligands (DLL3, JAGGED1, and JAGGED2) do not influence the clinical outcome of ERα+ patients. Genetic studies show that DLL1-mediated Notch signaling in breast cancer is important for tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cancer stem cell function. Consistent with prognostic clinical data, we found the tumor-promoting function of DLL1 is exclusive to ERα+ luminal breast cancer, as loss of DLL1 inhibits both tumor growth and lung metastasis of luminal breast cancer. Importantly, we find that estrogen signaling stabilizes DLL1 protein by preventing its proteasomal and lysososmal degradations. Moreover, estrogen inhibits ubiquitination of DLL1. Together, our results highlight an unexpected and novel subtype-specific function of DLL1 in promoting luminal breast cancer that is regulated by estrogen signaling. Our studies also emphasize the critical role of assessing subtype-specific mechanisms driving tumor growth and metastasis to generate effective subtype-specific therapeutics."

The aroma, flavor and pharmaceutical value of Ocimum species is a significance of its essential oil, which contains most of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. A large number of plants have been studied for characterization and identification of terpene synthase genes, involved in terpenoids biosynthesis. The goal of this study is to discover and identify the putative functional terpene synthase genes in O. sanctum. HMMER search was performed by using a set of 13 well sequenced and annotated plant genomes including the newly sequenced genome of O. sanctum with Pfam-A database locally, using HMMER 3.0 hmmsearch for the two Pfam domains (PF01397 and PF03936). Using this search method 81 putative terpene synthases genes (OsaTPS) were identified in O. sanctum; the study further reveals 47 OsaTPS were putatively functional genes, 19 partial OsaTPS, and 15 OsaTPS as probably pseudogenes. All these identified OsaTPS genes were compared with other plant species, and phylogenetic analysis reveals the subfamily classification of OsaTPS in TPS-a, -b, -c, -e, -f and TPS-g subfamilies clusters. This genome-wide identification of OsaTPS genes, their phylogenetic analysis and secondary metabolite pathway mapping predictions together provide a comprehensive understanding of the TPS gene family in Ocimum sanctum and offer opportunities for the characterization and functional validation of numbers of terpene synthase genes."

https://openalex.org/W2901891401,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of feeding licuri cake to lambs on the sensory characteristics, physicochemical characteristics and fatty acid (FA) profile of meat from lambs. Forty-four crossbred Santa Ines lambs (21.2 ± 2.70 kg body weight; 6 months old) were housed in individual pens and fed 4 experimental diets, containing 0, 8, 16 or 24% licuri cake (DM basis). The averages concentrations of ash (11.4), pH (5.82), lightness (38.1), cooking loss (26.8) or shear-force resistance (2.48) of lamb meat were not affected by the licuri cake diets. However, there was a linear decrease (P < 0.01) of redness and chroma indexes, lipid and protein contents, whereas the moisture content of the meat (P < 0.001) increased linearly due to the inclusion of licuri cake in lambs’ diets. The licuri cake inclusion in the lambs feed linearly increased (P < 0.05) the fatty acids concentrations of C12:0, C17:0, C20:0, C20:1, C18:3, C20:3, C20:4 and ΣPUFA/ΣMUFA ratio, Σω–3 and atherogenicity index (AI). However, C18:1 cis, C20:2, C20:5, ΣMUFA, ΣMUFA/ΣSFA and Σω–6:Σω–3 ratios in the longissimus lumborum of lambs linearly decreased by licuri cake inclusion. There was a quadratic increase (P < 0.05) on C14:0 (maximum point 4.94 g/100 g FAME to 14.5% licuri inclusion), C16:1 (maximum point 8.59 g/100 g FAME to 10.7% licuri inclusion) and enzymatic activities of Δ9-desaturase C16 (maximum point 27.5 g/100 g FAME to 10.6% licuri inclusion) in the longissimus lumborum of lambs fed due to increased concentrations of licuri cake. However, there was a quadratic decrease (P = 0.04) in ΣPUFA/ΣSFA ratio with minimum concentration of 0.63 g/100 g FAME to 11.1% inclusion. The inclusion of licuri cake in the lambs diet did not change (P > 0.05) the concentrations of SFA C10:0, C15:0, C16:0, C18:0, C14:1, MUFA C18:1 trans, PUFA C18:2 cis, CLA, total sum of ΣSFA and ΣPUFA, desirable fatty acids (DFA), hypocholesterolemic:hypercholesterolemic index, and elongase and Δ9-desaturase C18 enzymes. Licuri cake in the lamb diet improved (P < 0.05) meat aroma, flavor and overall acceptance by consumers. Licuri cake inclusion in the diet of lambs improves sensory attributes of meat and the meat fatty acid profile becomes nutritionally healthier for the human diet because do not affect major FA of meat; however, the growth performance of finishing lambs is reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2901504466,"Peru is one of the world’s leading fishing nations and its seafood industry relies on the trade of a vast variety of aquatic resources, playing a key role in the country’s socio-economic development. DNA barcoding has become of paramount importance for systematics, conservation, and seafood traceability, complementing or even surpassing conventional identification methods when target organisms show similar morphology during the early life stages, have recently diverged, or have undergone processing. Aiming to increase our knowledge of the species diversity available across the Peruvian supply chain (from fish landing sites to markets and restaurants), we applied full and mini-barcoding approaches targeting three mitochondrial genes (COI, 16S, and 12S) and the control region to identify samples purchased at retailers from six departments along the north-central Peruvian coast. DNA barcodes from 131 samples were assigned to 55 species (plus five genus-level taxa) comprising 47 families, 24 orders, and six classes including Actinopterygii (45.03%), Chondrichthyes (36.64%), Bivalvia (6.87%), Cephalopoda (6.11%), Malacostraca (3.82%), and Gastropoda (1.53%). The identified samples included commercially important pelagic (anchovy, bonito, dolphinfish) and demersal (hake, smooth-hound, Peruvian rock seabass, croaker) fish species. Our results unveiled the marketing of protected and threatened species such as whale shark, Atlantic white marlin, smooth hammerhead (some specimens collected during closed season), shortfin mako, and pelagic thresher sharks. A total of 35 samples (26.72%) were mislabeled, including tilapia labeled as wild marine fish, dolphinfish and hake labeled as grouper, and different shark species sold as “smooth-hounds”. The present study highlights the necessity of implementing traceability and monitoring programs along the entire seafood supply chain using molecular tools to enhance sustainability efforts and ensure consumer choice."

In the present study acetone and hydroethanol extracts of P. phillyreifolius were evaluated for their cytotoxicity and antioxidant effects using in vitro (TPC, ABTS, DPPH, FRAP, ORAC) and in cellulo (MTT, DCFH-DA, RT-qPCR) assays. Major compounds were evaluated using UPLC–QTOF–MS. MTT cell viability assay showed low cytotoxicity of extracts towards human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line. Both extracts were rich in polyphenols (mainly ellagitannins) and showed high antioxidant potential and intracellular ROS decreasing effect. Preconditioning of HEK293 cells with extracts influenced gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, however ROS level decreasing effect was more related to their capacity to scavenge free radicals and with their reducing power. Strong antioxidant activity of extracts as well as the presence of geraniin supports the use of P. phillyreifolius in traditional medicine."

However, the treatment of HRR-proficient EOC with PARP inhibitors remains challenging. The objective of this study was to determine whether the combination of triapine (ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor), cediranib (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and the PARP inhibitor olaparib synergized against BRCA wild-type and HRR-proficient EOC in xenograft mouse models. In addition, the mechanisms by which cediranib augmented the efficacy of triapine and olaparib were investigated. BRCA-wild type and PARP inhibitor-resistant EOC cell lines were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into nude mice or injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into SCID-Beige mice. Mice were then treated i.p. with olaparib, cediranib, triapine, various double and triple combinations. The volume of s.c tumor in nude mice and the abdominal circumference of SCID-Beige mice were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment to delay tumor growth and prolong the survival time of mice. In both xenograft mouse models, the combination of triapine, olaparib and cediranib resulted in marked suppression of BRCA-wild type EOC growth and significant prolongation of the survival time of mice, with efficacy greater than any double combinations and single drugs. Furthermore, we identified that cediranib abrogated pro-survival and anti-apoptotic AKT signaling, thereby enhancing the efficacy of triapine and olaparib against BRCA-wild type EOC cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a proof-of-principle approach and the combination regiment holds promise in treating BRCA-wild type and PARP inhibitor-resistant EOC."

The Stroke Investigative Research and Education Network works collaboratively with stroke survivors and individuals serving as community controls to comprehensively characterize the genomic, sociocultural, economic and behavioral risk factors for stroke in SSA. Purpose In this paper, we aim to: i) explore the attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to stroke in Ghana and Nigeria using the process of qualitative description; and ii) propose actions for future research and community-based participation and education. Methods Stroke survivors, their caregivers, health care professionals, and community representatives and faith-based leaders participated in one of twenty-six focus groups, which qualitatively explored community beliefs, attitudes and practices related to stroke in Ghana and Nigeria. Arthur Kleinman’s Explanatory Model of Illness and the Social Ecological Model guided the questions and/or thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We hereby describe our focus group methods and analyses of qualitative data, as well as the findings and suggestions for improving stroke outcomes. Results and discussion The major findings illustrate the fears, causes, chief problems, treatment, and recommendations related to stroke through the views of the participants, as well as recommendations for working effectively with the SIREN communities. Findings are compared to SIREN quantitative data and other qualitative studies in Africa. As far as we are aware, this is the first paper to qualitatively explore and contrast community beliefs, attitudes, and practices among stroke survivors and their caregivers, community and faith-based leaders, and health professionals in multiple communities within Nigeria and Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2901379597,"Background Detection of ossification areas of hand bones in X-ray images is an important task, e.g. as a preprocessing step in automated bone age estimation. Deep neural networks have emerged recently as de facto standard detection methods, but their drawback is the need of large annotated datasets. Finetuning pre-trained networks is a viable alternative, but it is not clear a priori if training with small annotated datasets will be successful, as it depends on the problem at hand. In this paper, we show that pre-trained networks can be utilized to produce an effective detector of ossification areas in pediatric X-ray images of hands. Methods and findings A publicly available Faster R-CNN network, pre-trained on the COCO dataset, was utilized and finetuned with 240 manually annotated radiographs from the RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge, which comprises over 14.000 pediatric radiographs. The validation is done on another 89 radiographs from the dataset and the performance is measured by Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To understand the effect of the data size on the pre-trained network, subsampling was applied to the training data and the training was repeated. Additionally, the network was trained from scratch without any pre-trained weights. Finally, to understand whether the trained model could be useful, we compared the inference of the network to an annotation of an expert radiologist. The finetuned network was able to achieve an average precision (mAP@0.5IoU) of 92.92 ± 1.93. Apart from the wrist region, all ossification areas were able to benefit from more data. In contrast, the network trained from scratch was not able to produce any correct results. When compared to the annotations of the expert radiologist, the network was able to localize the regions quite well, as the F1-Score was on average 91.85 ± 1.06. Conclusions By finetuning a pre-trained deep neural network, with 240 annotated radiographs, we were able to successfully detect ossification areas in prediatric hand radiographs."
https://openalex.org/W2901735002,"How plants defend themselves from microbial infection is one of the most critical issues for sustainable crop production. Some TGA transcription factors belonging to bZIP superfamily can regulate disease resistance through NPR1-mediated immunity mechanisms in Arabidopsis. Here, we examined biological roles of OsTGA2 (grouped into the same subclade as Arabidopsis TGAs) in bacterial leaf blight resistance. Transcriptional level of OsTGA2 was accumulated after treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and Xathomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo), a bacterium causing serious blight of rice. OsTGA2 formed homo- and hetero-dimer with OsTGA3 and OsTGA5 and interacted with rice NPR1 homologs 1 (NH1) in rice. Results of quadruple 9-mer protein-binding microarray analysis indicated that OsTGA2 could bind to TGACGT DNA sequence. Overexpression of OsTGA2 increased resistance of rice to bacterial leaf blight, although overexpression of OsTGA3 resulted in disease symptoms similar to wild type plant upon Xoo infection. Overexpression of OsTGA2 enhanced the expression of defense related genes containing TGA binding cis-element in the promoter such as AP2/EREBP 129, ERD1, and HOP1. These results suggest that OsTGA2 can directly regulate the expression of defense related genes and increase the resistance of rice against bacterial leaf blight disease."
https://openalex.org/W2900776236,"Several ultra-sensitive methods for T790M in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have been developed for lung cancer. The correlation between mutation-allele frequency (MAF) cut-off, drug responsiveness, and outcome prediction is an unmet needs and not fully addressed. An innovative combination of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to proof of concept for monitoring cfDNA T790M in EGFR-mutant patients. Mutant enrichment by PNA was optimized and the detection limit was evaluated through serial dilutions. The cut-off value was identified by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis utilizing serial sampled plasmas of patients from EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) pretreatment to progressive-disease (PD). Results, comparisons, and objective response rate (ORR) were analyzed in 103 patients' tumor and cfDNA T790M, with 20 of them receiving an additional COBAS test. The detection limit was 0.1% MAF. The cut-off for PD and imminent PD was 15% and 5% with an ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 and 0.82 in 2 ml plasma. Detection sensitivity of cfDNA T790M was 67.4% and overall concordance was 78.6%. ORR was similar in T790M-positive cfDNA (69.6%) and tumor samples (70.6%) treated with osimertinib. Among 65 T790M-positive tumors, 15 were negative in cfDNA (23.1%). Seven of 38 T790M-positive cfDNA samples were negative in the tumors (18.4%). PNA-MALDI-TOF MS had a higher detection rate than COBAS. In conclusion, identification of T790M cut-off value in cfDNA improves cancer managements. We provide a strategy for optimizing testing utility, flexibility, quality, and cost in the clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2900805646,"The implementation of Computerised Physician Order Entry (CPOE) and Clinical Decision Support (CDS) has been found to have some unintended consequences. The aim of this study is to explore pharmacists and physicians perceptions of their interprofessional communication in the context of the technology and whether electronic messaging and CDS has an impact on this.This qualitative study was conducted in two acute hospitals: the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT) and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTH). UHBFT use an established locally developed CPOE system that can facilitate pharmacist-physician communication with the ability to assign a message directly to an electronic prescription. In contrast, GSTH use a more recently implemented commercial system where such communication is not possible. Focus groups were conducted with pharmacists and physicians of varying grades at both hospitals. Focus group data were transcribed and analysed thematically using deductive and inductive approaches, facilitated by NVivo 10.Three prominent themes emerged during the study: increased communication load; impaired decision-making; and improved workflow. CPOE and CDS were found to increase the communication load for the pharmacist owing to a reduced ability to amend electronic prescriptions, new types of prescribing errors, and the provision of technical advice relating to the use of the system. Decision-making was found to be affected, owing to the difficulties faced by pharmacists and physicians when trying to determine the context of prescribing decisions and knowledge of the patient. The capability to communicate electronically facilitated a non-interruptive workflow, which was found to be beneficial for staff time, coordination of work and for limiting distractions.The increased communication load for the pharmacist, and consequent workload for the physician, has the potential to impact on the quality and coordination of care in the hospital setting. The ability to communicate electronically has some benefits, but functions need to be designed to facilitate collaborative working, and for this to be optimised through interprofessional training."

Adult patients admitted to R.D. Kandou General Hospital with presumed CNS infection were enrolled. Cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and throat swab samples were collected and tested using molecular, serological, and virus isolation assays. A confirmed viral etiology was established in three and a probable/possible in 11 out of 74 patients. The most common was herpes simplex virus 1 (7/74, 9.5%), followed by Epstein-Barr virus (2/74, 2.7%), cytomegalovirus (1/74, 1.4%), enterovirus D68 (1/74, 1.4%), rhinovirus A (1/74, 1.4%), dengue virus (1/64, 1.6%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (1/64, 1.6%). There were 20 fatal cases (27.0%) during hospitalization in which eight were associated with viral causes. We identified herpes simplex virus 1 as the most common cause of CNS infection among adults in North Sulawesi with most of the cases remaining undiagnosed. Our study highlights the challenges in establishing the etiology of viral CNS infections and the importance of using a wide range of molecular and serological detection methods to identify CNS viruses."

The effect of hot air treatment (HAT 40°C, 48 h) and 1.0% chitosan coating on the change of organic acids and the related gene expression of citric acid synthesis and degradation in ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) fruit during cold storage have been studied. The results showed that citric acid was the main organic acid in fruit, the trend change of citric acid content was consistent with total organic acids and titratable acidity (TA) content, which decreased with the prolongation of storage time, hot air treatment significantly promoted but chitosan coating treatment significantly delayed citric acid degradation in Ponkan fruit. Hot air treatment could induced CitAco2/3, CitIDH2/3, CitGAD4, CitACLs, CitPEPCKs and CitFBPases expression during fruit storage period, but had no significant effect on CitGSs expression, The enhanced expression of degradation-related genes was closely related to the degradation of citric acid. The expressions of CitAco3, CitGAD4 CitACLα2/β, CitPEPCKs and CitFBPases were inhibited, which leading to the degradation rate of citric acid was slowed by chitosan coating during storage. These results showed that the degradation of citric acid in fruit was regulated by ATP citrate lyase (ACL) pathway and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2901023718,"Background Congenital scoliosis (CS) may lead to more serious pulmonary complications compared with idiopathic scoliosis after spinal fusion surgery. However, little has been reported about postoperative pulmonary complication events in patients with CS after spinal fusion surgery. Objective To investigate the incidence of and predictive factors of postoperative pulmonary complications following posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery for the treatment of CS. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 174 patients with CS (128 females and 46 males, mean age 16.4 years) treated with posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery between January 2012 and April 2017. We extracted demographic, medical history, and clinical data, and investigated the major predictive factors for postoperative pulmonary complications by logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curves analyses. Results A total of 26 (14.9%) patients developed postoperative pulmonary complications, consisting of pleural effusion (10.9%), pneumonia (6.9%), pneumothorax (1.1%), atelectasis (2.3%), hypoxemia (6.3%), and respiratory failure (1.1%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the predictive factors for postoperative pulmonary complications were age > 18.1 years (P = 0.039), a Cobb angle of > 77° (P = 0.011), operation time of > 430 min (P = 0.032), and blood transfusion volume > 1500 ml (P = 0.015). Conclusions Postoperative pulmonary complications are among the main complications following posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery in patients with CS. Such patients aged >18.1 years, with Cobb angles > 77°, operation times > 430 min, and/or blood transfusion volume of > 1500 ml may be more likely to develop postoperative pulmonary complications."
https://openalex.org/W2900553871,"The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is considered one of the oldest and largest living organisms on Earth. Notwithstanding, given the difficulty of monitoring its fruits and seeds in the field, the development of P. oceanica during its sexual recruitment is not completely understood. We studied the stages of development of P. oceanica seeds from their dispersion in the fruit interior to their settlement in sediment through histological, ultrastructural and mesocosm experiments. P. oceanica sexual recruitment can be divided into three main stages that focus on maximising photosynthesis and anchoring the seedlings to the sediment. In the first stage (fruit dispersion), seeds perform photosynthesis while being transported inside the fruit along the sea surface. In the second stage (seed adhesion), seeds develop adhesive microscopic hairs that cover the primary and secondary roots and favour seed adhesion to the substrate. In the last stage (seedling anchorage), roots attach the seedlings to the substrate by orienting them towards the direction of light to maximise photosynthesis. The adaptations observed in P. oceanica are similar to those in other seagrasses with non-dormant seeds and fruits with membranous pericarps, such as Thalassia sp. and Enhalus sp. These common strategies suggest a convergent evolution in such seagrasses in terms of sexual recruitment. Understanding the sexual recruitment of habitat-forming species such as seagrasses is necessary to adequately manage the ecosystems that they inhabit."
https://openalex.org/W2900849173,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in the elderly. This study was a nation-wide population-based retrospective cohort study of the National Health Insurance System-Senior Database (NHIS-SD). In this study, a total of 75,856 subjects were identified and selected from among 251,593 individuals aged ≥ 65 years who underwent health screening at least once between 2009 and 2012 and who had no history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The subjects of this study were followed-up until 2013 to identify the total mortality and the cause-specific mortality of 6 groups divided according to BMI. The hazard ratio (HR) by reference group (23 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2) of each group was calculated. A significant increase in the HR with a decreased BMI was observed in the group with a BMI < 23 kg/m2, whereas the HR in the group with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 was not significantly different than that of the reference group (23 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2). This pattern was also seen in the subgroup analyses in relation to age, smoking history, alcohol use, exercise level, and socioeconomic status. In this study, we found that a low BMI was a risk factor for death in the elderly and that no significant difference in mortality was seen in the elderly with a BMI of 25 or over. In terms of an optimal BMI in the elderly, it is important to maintain an appropriately healthy range of BMI with the aim of preventing weight loss."

The aim was to better understand people’s information needs by starting with what they do not know, discovered through their own questions, rather than starting with what we know about T2DM and subsequently finding ways to communicate that information to people affected by or at risk of the disease. One hundred and sixty-four questions were collected from 120 patients attending outpatient diabetes clinics and 300 questions from 100 members of the public through the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. Twenty-three general and diabetes-specific topics and five phases of disease progression were identified; these were used to manually categorize the questions. Analyses were performed to determine which topics, if any, were significant predictors of a question’s being asked by a patient or the public, and similarly for questions from a woman or a man. Further analysis identified the individual topics that were assigned significantly more often to the crowdsourced or clinic questions. These were Causes (CI: [-0.07, -0.03], p < .001), Risk Factors ([-0.08, -0.03], p < .001), Prevention ([-0.06, -0.02], p < .001), Diagnosis ([-0.05, -0.02], p < .001), and Distribution of a Disease in a Population ([-0.05,-0.01], p = .0016) for the crowdsourced questions and Treatment ([0.03, 0.01], p = .0019), Disease Complications ([0.02, 0.07], p < .001), and Psychosocial ([0.05, 0.1], p < .001) for the clinic questions. No highly significant gender-specific topics emerged in our study, but questions about Weight were more likely to come from women and Psychosocial questions from men. There were significantly more crowdsourced questions about the time Prior to any Diagnosis ([(-0.11, -0.04], p = .0013) and significantly more clinic questions about Health Maintenance and Prevention after diagnosis ([0.07. 0.17], p < .001). A descriptive analysis pointed to the value provided by the specificity of questions, their potential to disclose emotions behind questions, and the as-yet unrecognized information needs they can reveal. Large-scale collection of questions from patients across the spectrum of T2DM progression and from the public–a significant percentage of whom are likely to be as yet undiagnosed–is expected to yield further valuable insights."
https://openalex.org/W2901099425,"Background Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen with no approved therapeutics and only limited diagnostics available. To address this gap, six mouse single-chain antibodies (scFvs) to ZIKV envelope (E) protein were isolated rapidly and efficiently from a ribosome-displayed antibody library constructed from the spleens of five immunized mice. Methodology/Results In this report, we have generated a panel of mouse scFvs to ZIKV E protein using ribosome display. The six scFvs demonstrated no cross-reactivity with DENV2 NGC envelope protein, suggesting specificity for ZIKV E protein. These scFvs showed differences in their affinity: two (scFv45-3, scFv63-1) of them were dominant after four rounds of panning, and showed higher affinity (an apparent Kd values from 19 to 27 nM) than the other four (scFv5-1, scFv7-2, scFv38-1, and scFv51-2). All six scFvs showed ZIKV-neutralizing activity in the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay and their neutralizing activity was positively correlated with their affinities. Conclusions/Significance The scFvs (45–3 and 63–1) with highest affinity may have dual utility as diagnostics capable of recognizing ZIKV E subtypes and may be further developed to treat ZIKV infection. Our approach has the added advantage of generating Fc receptor-deficient antibodies, minimizing concern of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2901807276,"The lack of awareness regarding rabies amongst rural primary care health staff and their adverse practices towards the management of dog-bite wounds is a major contributor to the high incidence of rabies infection and subsequent human mortality in India. A Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey was carried out involving 54 nursing and non-nursing staff working in 18 rural Primary Health centres and sub-centres around Baramati town of Pune district in Western India. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess factors that influenced knowledge of rabies and practices towards management of dog-bite related wounds. The more experienced and better-educated workers were found to have a good awareness of rabies (OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.0-12.1) and good practices towards dog-bite wound management (OR 5.6, 95%CI 1.2-27.0). Surprisingly, non-nursing staff were significantly more knowledgeable about rabies (OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.0-12.3), but their practices towards dog-bite wound management were inadequate (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.04-0.8) compared to the nursing staff. It is recommended that a mandatory training module for primary care health staff be developed and implemented to improve their knowledge regarding rabies and management of dog-bite wounds to reduce the incidence of human rabies in rural India."
https://openalex.org/W2901242485,"TGFβ promotes podocyte hypertrophy and expression of matrix proteins in fibrotic kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are hyperactive in response to TGFβ in various renal diseases. Deptor is a component of mTOR complexes and a constitutive inhibitor of their activities. We identified that deptor downregulation by TGFβ maintains hyperactive mTOR in podocytes. To unravel the mechanism, we found that TGFβ -initiated noncanonical signaling controls deptor inhibition. Pharmacological inhibitor of PI 3 kinase, Ly 294002 and pan Akt kinase inhibitor MK 2206 prevented the TGFβ induced downregulation of deptor, resulting in suppression of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. However, specific isoform of Akt involved in this process is not known. We identified Akt2 as predominant isoform expressed in kidney cortex, glomeruli and podocytes. TGFβ time-dependently increased the activating phosphorylation of Akt2. Expression of dominant negative PI 3 kinase and its signaling inhibitor PTEN blocked Akt2 phosphorylation by TGFβ. Inhibition of Akt2 using a phospho-deficient mutant that inactivates its kinase activity, as well as siRNA against the kinase markedly diminished TGFβ -mediated deptor suppression, its association with mTOR and activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Importantly, inhibition of Akt2 blocked TGFβ -induced podocyte hypertrophy and expression of the matrix protein fibronectin. This inhibition was reversed by the downregulation of deptor. Interestingly, we detected increased phosphorylation of Akt2 concomitant with TGFβ expression in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Thus, our data identify previously unrecognized Akt2 kinase as a driver of TGFβ induced deptor downregulation and sustained mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that deptor downstream of Akt2 contributes to podocyte hypertrophy and matrix protein expression found in glomerulosclerosis in different renal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2901307841,"Low levels of household access to basic environmental health assets (EHAs)-including technologies such as clean cookstoves and bed nets or infrastructure such as piped water and electricity-in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are known to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. This low access persists despite decades of promotion of many low-cost, life-saving technologies, and is particularly pronounced among poor households. This study aims to characterize variation in access to EHAs among LMIC households as a function of wealth, as defined by ownership of various assets.Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 41 low- and middle-income countries were used to assess household-level access to the following EHAs: 1) improved water supply; 2) piped water supply; 3) improved sanitation; 4) modern cooking fuels; 5) electricity; and 6) bed nets. For comparison, we included access to mobile phones, which is considered a highly successful technology in terms of its penetration into poor households within LMICs. Ownership levels were compared across country-specific wealth quintiles constructed from household assets using bivariate analysis and multivariable linear regression models.Access to EHAs was low among the households in the bottom three quintiles of wealth. Access to piped water, modern cooking fuels, electricity and improved sanitation, for example, were all below 50% for households in the bottom three wealth quintiles. Access to certain EHAs such as improved water supply and bed nets increased only slowly with concomitant increases in wealth, while gaps in access to other EHAs varied to a greater degree by wealth quintile. For example, disparities in access between the richest and poorest quintiles were greatest for electricity and improved sanitation. Rural households in all wealth quintiles had much lower levels of access to EHAs, except for bed nets, relative to urban households.The findings of this study provide a basis for understanding how EHAs are distributed among poor households in LMICs, elucidate where inequalities in access are particularly pronounced, and point to a need for strategies that better reach the poor, if the global environmental burden of disease is to be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2901439308,"Studies have found reduced myopia progression with multifocal contact lenses, albeit with an unclear mechanism behind their protective effect. It is hypothesized that the induced myopic defocus of the addition zones of the multifocal contact lenses leads to choroidal thickening and therefore inhibits eye growth. In the current study, the effect of the optical design of multifocal contact lenses on choroidal thickness was investigated. Eighteen myopic participants wore four different contact lenses ((1) single-vision lenses corrected for distance, (2) single-vision lenses with +2.50 D full-field defocus, (3) Multifocal center-distance design, (4) Multifocal center-near design, both with addition power +2.50 D) for 30 min each on their right eye. Automated analysis of the macular choroidal thickness and vitreous chamber depth were performed before and after the wear of each of the contact lenses. Peripheral refraction profiles in primary gaze were obtained using eccentric photorefraction prior to contact lens wear. Choroidal thickness and vitreous chamber depth showed no significant differences to baseline with any of the contact lenses (all p > 0.05). Choroidal thickness increased by +2.1 ± 11.1 μm with the Multifocal center-distance design, by +2.0 ± 11.1 μm with the full-field defocus lens, followed by the Multifocal center-near design with +1.6 ± 11.3 μm and the single-vision contact lens correcting for distance with +0.9 ± 11.2 μm. Multifocal contact lenses have no significant influence on choroidal thickness after short-term wear. Therefore, changes in choroidal thickness might not be the main contributor to the protective effect of multifocal contact lenses in myopia control."
https://openalex.org/W2901869469,"Studies of fruit tree water relations often require data on water potentials of fruit. However, this is sometimes difficult because the fruit stalks are not sufficiently long for use in a pressure bomb. Also, because fruit xylem function is often lost during maturation. In the absence of significant turgor, the osmotic potential of the expressed juice is a useful proxy for a fruit’s water potential. The osmotic potential of most fleshy fruit is determined largely by the concentration of soluble carbohydrates and this can be quantified by osmometry. Soluble solids may also be quantified by refractometry. Compared with osmometry, refractometry is markedly less expensive and also much faster. Hence, it is better suited to high-throughput analyses. The objective of this study was to establish relationships between the osmotic potentials of juices expressed from sweet cherries and sour cherries, grapes and plums as determined using a vapor pressure osmometer and their soluble solids concentrations as determined using a refractometer. The data reveal close relationships within all these species. Except for plums, the relationships between species were almost identical. This is due to similarity among cultivars and species in the relative abundances of the same set of major osmolytes—i.e. the carbohydrates glucose, fructose and sorbitol and the potassium salts of the organic acids malate or tartrate. For plums, the relationship between osmotic potential and soluble solids concentration was slightly displaced. Our findings indicate osmotic potentials may be reliably predicted from soluble solids concentrations determined by refractometry."
https://openalex.org/W2900661354,"By means of biofeedback, neuromotor control can be modified. Recent biofeedback experiments have used the power of the electromyogram of one muscle in different frequency bands to control a two-dimensional cursor. However, the human body usually requires coherent activation of multiple muscles to achieve daily life tasks. Additionally, electromyography (EMG) instrumentation has remained the same for decades, and might not be the most suitable to measure coherent activations from pennated muscles according to recent experiments by von Tscharner and colleagues. In this study, we propose the development of a multichannel current-based EMG amplifier to use intermuscular coherence as the control feature of a visual biofeedback system. The system was used in a leg extension protocol to voluntarily increase intermuscular coherence between the vastii muscles. Results from ten subjects show that it is possible to increase intermuscular coherence through visual biofeedback. Such a system can have applications in endurance training and rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2901049738,"The shortage of skilled healthcare workers in Sub-Saharan Africa is aggravated by their emigration to high resource countries. There is evidence that a small number of healthcare workers return to their home countries. It is important to understand the factors that influence decisions to return in order to develop appropriate strategies to attract more back. This study sought to investigate the perspectives of healthcare workers who returned to Botswana after working in the diaspora. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 8 healthcare workers. Using the thematic analysis method we developed a thematic index to code the data. The main reasons for returning were family ties and missing home whilst the key reasons for emigration were concerns about the quality of health care, lack of professional progression opportunities and feeling under-valued. Difficulties reintegrating into the Botswana health care system are a potential push factors for those who return. Policies that aim to attract back healthcare workers should address professional progression, reintegration and improvement of the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2901338719,"We aimed to describe the development of an inference model for computer-aided diagnosis of lung nodules that could provide valid reasoning for any inferences, thereby improving the interpretability and performance of the system. An automatic construction method was used that considered explanation adequacy and inference accuracy. In addition, we evaluated the usefulness of prior experts' (radiologists') knowledge while constructing the models. In total, 179 patients with lung nodules were included and divided into 79 and 100 cases for training and test data, respectively. F-measure and accuracy were used to assess explanation adequacy and inference accuracy, respectively. For F-measure, reasons were defined as proper subsets of Evidence that had a strong influence on the inference result. The inference models were automatically constructed using the Bayesian network and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, selecting only those models that met the predefined criteria. During model constructions, we examined the effect of including radiologist's knowledge in the initial Bayesian network models. Performance of the best models in terms of F-measure, accuracy, and evaluation metric were as follows: 0.411, 72.0%, and 0.566, respectively, with prior knowledge, and 0.274, 65.0%, and 0.462, respectively, without prior knowledge. The best models with prior knowledge were then subjectively and independently evaluated by two radiologists using a 5-point scale, with 5, 3, and 1 representing beneficial, appropriate, and detrimental, respectively. The average scores by the two radiologists were 3.97 and 3.76 for the test data, indicating that the proposed computer-aided diagnosis system was acceptable to them. In conclusion, the proposed method incorporating radiologists' knowledge could help in eliminating radiologists' distrust of computer-aided diagnosis and improving its performance."
https://openalex.org/W2950511721,"Macaque RFHV and LCV are close homologs of human KSHV and EBV, respectively. No experimental model of RFHV has been developed due to the lack of a source of culturable infectious virus. Screening of macaques at the Washington National Primate Research Center detected RFHV in saliva of SIV-infected macaques from previous vaccine studies. A pilot experimental infection of two naïve juvenile pig-tailed macaques was initiated by inoculation of saliva from SIV-infected pig-tailed and cynomolgus macaque donors, which contained high levels of DNA (> 10(6) genomes/ml) of the respective species-specific RFHV strain. Both juvenile recipients developed SIV and RFHV infections with RFHV DNA detected transiently in saliva and/or PBMC around week 16 post-infection. One juvenile macaque was infected with the homologous RFHVMn from whole saliva of a pig-tailed donor, which had been inoculated into the cheek pouch. This animal became immunosuppressed, developing simian AIDS and was euthanized 23 weeks after inoculation. The levels of RFHV DNA in saliva and PBMC remained below the level of detection after week 17, showing no reactivation of the RFHVMn infection during the rapid development of AIDS. The other juvenile macaque was infected with the heterologous RFHVMf from i.v. inoculation of purified virions from saliva of a cynomolgus donor. The juvenile recipient remained immunocompetent, developing high levels of persistent anti-RFHV and -SIV antibodies. After the initial presence of RFHVMf DNA in saliva and PBMC decreased to undetectable levels by week 19, all attempts to reactivate the infection through additional inoculations, experimental infection with purified SRV-2 or SIV, or immunosuppressive treatments with cyclosporine or dexamethasone were unsuccessful. An heterologous LCV transmission was also detected in this recipient, characterized by continual high levels of LCVMf DNA from the cynomolgus donor in both saliva (> 10(6) genomes/ml) and PBMC (> 10(4) genomes/million cells), coupled with high levels of anti-LCV antibodies. The macaque was sacrificed 209 weeks after the initial inoculation. Low levels of LCVMf DNA were detected in salivary glands, tonsils and other lymphoid organs, while RFHVMf DNA was below the level of detection. These results show successful co-transmission of RFHV and LCV from saliva and demonstrate differential lytic activation of the different gammaherpesvirus lineages due to presumed differences in biology and tropism and control by the host immune system. Although this initial pilot transmission study utilized only two macaques, it provides the first evidence for experimental transmission of the macaque homolog of KSHV, setting the stage for larger transmission studies to examine the differential activation of rhadinovirus and lymphocryptovirus infections and the pathological effects of immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2884078128,"Models for human running performances of various complexities and underlying principles have been proposed, often combining data from world record performances and bio-energetic facts of human physiology. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel, minimal and universal model for human running performance that employs a relative metabolic power scale. The main component is a self-consistency relation for the time dependent maximal power output. The analytic approach presented here is the first to derive the observed logarithmic scaling between world (and other) record running speeds and times from basic principles of metabolic power supply. Our hypothesis is that various female and male record performances (world, national) and also personal best performances of individual runners for distances from 800m to the marathon are excellently described by this model. Indeed, we confirm this hypothesis with mean errors of (often much) less than 1%. The model defines endurance in a way that demonstrates symmetry between long and short racing events that are separated by a characteristic time scale comparable to the time over which a runner can sustain maximal oxygen uptake. As an application of our model, we derive personalized characteristic race speeds for different durations and distances."

Our sample consisted of 35 JOAG-affected individuals from three families, 16 unrelated patients with the MYOC p.Cys433Arg variant and 16 unaffected individuals. Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR; nine short tandem repeats were genotyped through automated electrophoresis and three single nucleotide polymorphisms through Sanger sequencing. The determination of haplotypes was performed using Arlequin software and age estimation was performed using DMLE+ 2.3 and BDMC21 softwares. Four markers constituted the haplotypes associated with the p.Cys433Arg variant. The software DMLE+2.3 predicted an age of 43 generations for this variant with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 28 to 76 generations (560–1520 years) and BDMC21 predicted an age of 59 generations (1180 years) (95% CI: 40 to 100)."

The maximum endurance time (MET) for two-handed truck pulling tasks has been rarely discussed in the literature. The objectives of this study were to explore the development of muscular fatigue when performing two-handed pulling task and to establish models to predict the MET. A simulated pallet truck pulling experiment was conducted. Sixteen healthy adults including eight females and eight males participated. The participants pulled a handle simulating that of a pallet truck using two hands until they could not pull any longer under two postures. The forces applied for females and males were 139.65 N and 170.03 N, respectively. The maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) of the pulling strength both before and after the simulated pull were measured. After each trial, both the MET and subjective ratings of muscular fatigue on body segments were recorded. The results showed that posture significantly affected MVC of pull both before and after the trial. It was found that foot/shank of the front leg had higher subjective ratings of muscular fatigue than the other body segments. The MET equations employing both power and logarithmic functions were developed to predict the MET of the two-handed pulling tasks. Predictive models established in this study may be used to assess the MET for two-handed pulling tasks."

Our empirical results further show that women not in severely underrepresented situations benefit from the same network structure as men."

The main independent variable was gender. Multivariable GEE logistic regression models were fit for binary outcomes, adjusted for age, income, education, and recent opioid use. Descriptive analyses were performed for partners' HIV status, substance use, sex risk behaviors, and awareness of PrEP for a subset of participants.At baseline, 50% (147/296) reported being in a partnership, and of those, 35% were in a serodiscordant partnership. After adjustment, women had significantly higher odds of being partnered compared to men (aOR = 3.12; 95% CI: 1.77, 5.51), but there were no significant gender differences in the odds of being in a serodiscordant partnership (aOR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.27, 1.24). Among a sub-sample of participants queried (n = 56), 25% were aware of PrEP for prevention of sexual HIV transmission and 14% for prevention of injection-related transmission.Although half of our sample were partnered and one third of these partnerships were serodiscordant, PrEP awareness was low. Substantial opportunities for HIV prevention exist among PLWH who have ever injected drugs in Russia and their HIV-negative partners. Given the high proportion of HIV-negative partners among this ART-naïve sample, efforts to address the associated inherent risks, such as couples-based interventions, are needed to increase condom use, PrEP awareness, or uptake of other HIV-prevention modalities (e.g., ART for the HIV-positive partner)."

Facial expression represents the most powerful mean to convey important information on emotional and cognitive states during interactions with others.

In particular, we evaluate the modulation of several Heart Rate Variability indices, collected during the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, accounting for test difficulty (derived from a Rasch analysis), test performances, demographic and psychological characteristics of the participants. The main idea is that emotion recognition is associated with the Autonomic Nervous System and, as a consequence, with the Heart Rate Variability. The principal goal of our study was to explore the complexity of the collected measures and their possible interactions by applying a class of flexible models, i.e., the latent class mixed models. Actually, this modelling strategy allows for the identification of clusters of subjects characterized by similar longitudinal trajectories. Both univariate and multivariate latent class mixed models were used. In fact, while the interpretation of the Heart Rate Variability indices is very difficult when considered individually, a joint evaluation provides a better description of the Autonomic Nervous System state."

We compared survival and noninvasive assays of radiation-induced lung damage, namely respiratory rate and metrics derived from thoracic cone-beam CTs, between the two sets of mice. We report two main results. First, the presence of a transverse 1.5 T field during irradiation had no impact on survival of C57L/J mice. Second, there was a small but statistically significant effect on noninvasive assays of radiation-induced lung damage. These results provide critical safety data for the clinical introduction of MRI-guided radiation therapy systems."
https://openalex.org/W2900682645,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease which is widely diagnosed using (colour fundus) images. Efficiency and accuracy are critical in diagnosing DR as lack of timely intervention can lead to irreversible visual impairment. In this paper, we examine strategies for scrutinizing images which affect diagnostic performance of medical practitioners via an eye-tracking study. A total of 56 subjects with 0 to 18 years of experience participated in the study. Every subject was asked to detect DR from 40 images. The findings indicate that practitioners use mainly two types of strategies characterized by either higher dwell duration or longer track length. The main findings of the study are that higher dwell-based strategy led to higher average accuracy (> 85%) in diagnosis, irrespective of the expertise of practitioner; whereas, the average obtained accuracy with a long-track length-based strategy was dependent on the expertise of the practitioner. In the second part of the paper, we use the experimental findings to recommend a scanning strategy for fast and accurate diagnosis of DR that can be potentially used by image readers. This is derived by combining the eye-tracking gaze maps of medical experts in a novel manner based on a set of rules. This strategy requires scrutiny of images in a manner which is consistent with spatial preferences found in human perception in general and in the domain of fundus images in particular. The Levenshtein distance-based assessment of gaze patterns also establish the effectiveness of the derived scanning pattern and is thus recommended for image readers."

In every stage race, competitive cyclists perform an experiment of sorts to discover who can most efficiently turn dietary energy sources into maximal power output on the bike. More broadly, we're all interested in diet because abundant evidence shows that diet has major effects on human health and resistance to rampant diseases associated with aging, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Advice on what constitutes a healthy diet is more prevalent and more inconsistent than ever. For this special issue, we checked in with the experts. On the question of how much fat we should eat, recommendations have swung from one extreme to the other. We consulted with a group of scientists representing different sides in the debate over the proportion of fat in a healthy diet and, importantly, which particular fats are most healthful. We share our meals with trillions of bacteria in the digestive system, so a promising and emerging area of investigation explores how diet influences our give-and-take interaction with gut symbionts. It's not just what you eat but when you eat it, and periods of fasting have some remarkable benefits. A pervasive theme is that much of the disagreement and confusion reflects a lack of solid scientific studies on humans. Clearly, many more well-designed studies are needed to determine the best diet for people, and how that varies with activity, at different life stages and for different individuals. And individual needs can be extreme—a cyclist at the top of the sport recorded massive carbohydrate loading before an intense stage, eating the equivalent of 85 slices of bread!

It was the same officer who had taken my mugshot. I had woken from an uncomfortable sleep, my body draped across three chairs in the police station holding room, my arms pulled inside my shirt in a futile attempt to keep warm. I peeked at the clock: 3:13 a.m. My body ached so much that I couldn't focus on his words. Methodically, he ran through the intake form. “Are you feeling hopeless or have nothing to look forward to?” I blinked back a new round of tears, slowly understanding that he was asking me whether I intended to commit suicide while I was held in jail.

> “Healthy coping mechanisms … felt like luxuries that I could not afford.” 

Five years into a Ph.D. program and separated from my husband—a decision I had made—I was unable to right myself from a deep depression and had just been arrested for driving while intoxicated. My husband and I had started our Ph.D. programs at the same time. We were older than our classmates, which increased the pressure to succeed, and managing the workload put a major strain on our relationship. If we allowed anything other than work to be our top priority, even temporarily, we were overcome by guilt. We stopped making time to go camping or take regular vacations. I felt neglected and seemed to want more from him than he could provide. Although we both wanted to start a family at some point, it was not the “right time.” We would always have time for our relationship later, we thought.

We were wrong. The tiny crack of disconnect widened. After 4 years as Ph.D. students, we went our own ways.

I struggled to continue on my Ph.D. journey alone. My isolation increased as friends graduated and left the area. Social media reminded me of the things I hadn't yet accomplished and sometimes felt I was too old to ever realize: a permanent job, a home, a family of my own—the American dream. Healthy coping mechanisms—such as going to the gym, joining a sports team, or simply sitting with my intense disappointment and fear about the future—felt like luxuries that I could not afford. Instead, my new normal became drinking after a hard day—which was just about every day. I knew my family had a history of alcoholism that had blighted my mother's childhood, but I did not think my mode of dealing with stress was self-destructive.

No, that's not true. I knew I was unhappy. I knew that waking up hungover with little recollection of the night before meant a day of work lost. Nevertheless, I did not care, as long as drinking brought momentary relief. I told myself that I was drinking as a way to cope with feeling left behind in life, but really, I was self-medicating to stop feeling anything at all.

It ended with a wrecked car and an arrest. Fortunately, no one was physically harmed, but they could have been. After a year of court proceedings, I am now 4 months into a year of probation, which includes thrice-daily breathalyzer tests, bimonthly urinalyses, courses at Mothers Against Drunk Driving, fines, fees, and more shame than I ever thought possible. At first, it all seemed unfair. I did not think I had a problem, and I fought tooth and nail against the punishments.

But after hearing from a mother who lost her daughter because of a drunk driver, I finally faced up to my part in everything that happened. I had made the decision to pursue a Ph.D. I had made the decision to leave my husband. And I had made the decision to drink and drive. Now, I needed to make the decision to get my life back on track. I got my drinking under control. Somewhat miraculously, I just successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis, which brings a mixture of pride, relief, and regret that it cost me so much.

For others who are precariously close to the edge of their own self-destructive whirlpool, perhaps my story can serve as a cautionary tale. Life does not stop while you are in graduate school. Graduate school is a part of life. You have to take care of yourself and find healthy ways to cope. You have to pay attention.
