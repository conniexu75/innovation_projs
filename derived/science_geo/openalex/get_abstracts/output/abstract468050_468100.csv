https://openalex.org/W2078346039,"Training with a multitasking video game is shown to improve cognitive control abilities that decline with age, revealing the plasticity of the ageing brain; these behavioural improvements were accompanied by underlying neural changes that predicted the training-induced boost in sustained attention and enhanced multitasking performance 6 months later. Our ability to multitask and our capacity for cognitive control decline linearly as we age. A new study shows that cognitive training can help repair this decline. In older adults aged between 60 and 85 who trained at home by playing NeuroRacer, a custom-designed 3D video game, both multitasking and cognitive control improved, with effects persisting for six months. The benefits of this training extended to untrained cognitive functions such as sustained attention and working memory. These findings suggest that the ageing brain may be more robustly plastic than previously thought, allowing for cognitive enhancement using appropriately designed strategies. Cognitive control is defined by a set of neural processes that allow us to interact with our complex environment in a goal-directed manner1. Humans regularly challenge these control processes when attempting to simultaneously accomplish multiple goals (multitasking), generating interference as the result of fundamental information processing limitations2. It is clear that multitasking behaviour has become ubiquitous in today’s technologically dense world3, and substantial evidence has accrued regarding multitasking difficulties and cognitive control deficits in our ageing population4. Here we show that multitasking performance, as assessed with a custom-designed three-dimensional video game (NeuroRacer), exhibits a linear age-related decline from 20 to 79 years of age. By playing an adaptive version of NeuroRacer in multitasking training mode, older adults (60 to 85 years old) reduced multitasking costs compared to both an active control group and a no-contact control group, attaining levels beyond those achieved by untrained 20-year-old participants, with gains persisting for 6 months. Furthermore, age-related deficits in neural signatures of cognitive control, as measured with electroencephalography, were remediated by multitasking training (enhanced midline frontal theta power and frontal–posterior theta coherence). Critically, this training resulted in performance benefits that extended to untrained cognitive control abilities (enhanced sustained attention and working memory), with an increase in midline frontal theta power predicting the training-induced boost in sustained attention and preservation of multitasking improvement 6 months later. These findings highlight the robust plasticity of the prefrontal cognitive control system in the ageing brain, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of how a custom-designed video game can be used to assess cognitive abilities across the lifespan, evaluate underlying neural mechanisms, and serve as a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement."

https://openalex.org/W2003431221,"The reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is a requisite transformation for life. Although it is widely appreciated that the iron-rich cofactors of nitrogenase enzymes facilitate this transformation, how they do so remains poorly understood. A central element of debate has been the exact site or sites of N2 coordination and reduction. In synthetic inorganic chemistry, an early emphasis was placed on molybdenum because it was thought to be an essential element of nitrogenases and because it had been established that well-defined molybdenum model complexes could mediate the stoichiometric conversion of N2 to NH3 (ref. 9). This chemical transformation can be performed in a catalytic fashion by two well-defined molecular systems that feature molybdenum centres. However, it is now thought that iron is the only transition metal essential to all nitrogenases, and recent biochemical and spectroscopic data have implicated iron instead of molybdenum as the site of N2 binding in the FeMo-cofactor. Here we describe a tris(phosphine)borane-supported iron complex that catalyses the reduction of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, and in which more than 40 per cent of the proton and reducing equivalents are delivered to N2. Our results indicate that a single iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates generated during catalytic NH3 formation. Geometric tunability at iron imparted by a flexible iron-boron interaction in our model system seems to be important for efficient catalysis. We propose that the interstitial carbon atom recently assigned in the nitrogenase cofactor may have a similar role, perhaps by enabling a single iron site to mediate the enzymatic catalysis through a flexible iron-carbon interaction."

However, the ubiquitin ligases responsible for catalysing ubiquitin chains that surround intracellular bacteria are poorly understood. The parkin protein is a ubiquitin ligase with a well-established role in mitophagy, and mutations in the parkin gene (PARK2) lead to increased susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease. Surprisingly, genetic polymorphisms in the PARK2 regulatory region are also associated with increased susceptibility to intracellular bacterial pathogens in humans, including Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, but the function of parkin in immunity has remained unexplored. Here we show that parkin has a role in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy of M. tuberculosis. Both parkin-deficient mice and flies are sensitive to various intracellular bacterial infections, indicating parkin has a conserved role in metazoan innate defence. Moreover, our work reveals an unexpected functional link between mitophagy and infectious disease. Mutations in the ubiquitin ligase parkin are associated with increased susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease; parkin is already known to have a role in mitophagy and this work identifies a new innate immunity role for parkin in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy of intracellular bacterial pathogens. The ubiquitin ligase parkin is required for ubiquitination and for mitophagy — the type of autophagy involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. This study demonstrates that parkin also acts in innate immune defence, marking Mycobacterium tuberculosis-containing phagosomes with ubiquitin chains and targeting them for xenophagy, the autophagic degradation process that deals with intracellular bacterial pathogens. The fact that parkin regulates a common cellular program for the quality control of endogenous mitochondria (self) and the eradication of harmful bacterial pathogens (non-self) is intriguing in light of the presumed evolutionary origin of mitochondria from a bacterial endosymbiont."

https://openalex.org/W2086361102,"The ability to design proteins with high affinity and selectivity for any given small molecule is a rigorous test of our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein-small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2090336802,"Evolution is typically thought to proceed through divergence of genes, proteins and ultimately phenotypes. However, similar traits might also evolve convergently in unrelated taxa owing to similar selection pressures. Adaptive phenotypic convergence is widespread in nature, and recent results from several genes have suggested that this phenomenon is powerful enough to also drive recurrent evolution at the sequence level. Where homoplasious substitutions do occur these have long been considered the result of neutral processes. However, recent studies have demonstrated that adaptive convergent sequence evolution can be detected in vertebrates using statistical methods that model parallel evolution, although the extent to which sequence convergence between genera occurs across genomes is unknown. Here we analyse genomic sequence data in mammals that have independently evolved echolocation and show that convergence is not a rare process restricted to several loci but is instead widespread, continuously distributed and commonly driven by natural selection acting on a small number of sites per locus. Systematic analyses of convergent sequence evolution in 805,053 amino acids within 2,326 orthologous coding gene sequences compared across 22 mammals (including four newly sequenced bat genomes) revealed signatures consistent with convergence in nearly 200 loci. Strong and significant support for convergence among bats and the bottlenose dolphin was seen in numerous genes linked to hearing or deafness, consistent with an involvement in echolocation. Unexpectedly, we also found convergence in many genes linked to vision: the convergent signal of many sensory genes was robustly correlated with the strength of natural selection. This first attempt to detect genome-wide convergent sequence evolution across divergent taxa reveals the phenomenon to be much more pervasive than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2009441850,"The theoretically proven security of quantum key distribution (QKD) could revolutionise how information exchange is protected in the future. Several field tests of QKD have proven it to be a reliable technology for cryptographic key exchange and have demonstrated nodal networks of point-to-point links. However, so far no convincing answer has been given to the question of how to extend the scope of QKD beyond niche applications in dedicated high security networks. Here we show that adopting simple and cost-effective telecommunication technologies to form a quantum access network can greatly expand the number of users in quantum networks and therefore vastly broaden their appeal. We are able to demonstrate that a high-speed single-photon detector positioned at a network node can be shared between up to 64 users for exchanging secret keys with the node, thereby significantly reducing the hardware requirements for each user added to the network. This point-to-multipoint architecture removes one of the main obstacles restricting the widespread application of QKD. It presents a viable method for realising multi-user QKD networks with resource efficiency and brings QKD closer to becoming the first widespread technology based on quantum physics."

https://openalex.org/W2050345976,"In fibrotic liver, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is constantly expressed in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and acts downstream of TGF-β to modulate extracellular matrix production. Distinct from other cell types in which Smad signaling plays major role in regulating CTGF production, TGF-β stimulated CTGF expression in activated HSCs is only in part dependent on Smad3. Other signaling molecules like MAPKs and PI3Ks may also participate in this process, and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be clarified. In this study, we report involvement of Stat3 activation in modulating CTGF production upon TGF-β challenge in activated HSCs. Stat3 is phosphorylated via JAK1 and acts as a critical ALK5 (activin receptor-like kinase 5) downstream signaling molecule to mediate CTGF expression. This process requires de novo gene transcription and is additionally modulated by MEK1/2, JNK, and PI3K pathways. Cell-specific knockdown of Smad3 partially decreases CTGF production, whereas it has no significant influence on Stat3 activation. The total CTGF production induced by TGF-β in activated HSCs is therefore, to a large extent, dependent on the balance and integration of the canonical Smad3 and Stat3 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2157106675,"Oxidation of retinol via retinaldehyde results in the formation of the essential morphogen all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Previous studies have identified critical roles in the regulation of embryonic ATRA levels for retinol, retinaldehyde, and ATRA-oxidizing enzymes; however, the contribution of retinaldehyde reductases to ATRA metabolism is not completely understood. Herein, we investigate the role of the retinaldehyde reductase Dhrs3 in embryonic retinoid metabolism using a Dhrs3-deficient mouse. Lack of DHRS3 leads to a 40% increase in the levels of ATRA and a 60% and 55% decrease in the levels of retinol and retinyl esters, respectively, in Dhrs3(-/-) embryos compared to wild-type littermates. Furthermore, accumulation of excess ATRA is accompanied by a compensatory 30-50% reduction in the expression of ATRA synthetic genes and a 120% increase in the expression of the ATRA catabolic enzyme Cyp26a1 in Dhrs3(-/-) embryos vs. controls. Excess ATRA also leads to alterations (40-80%) in the expression of several developmentally important ATRA target genes. Consequently, Dhrs3(-/-) embryos die late in gestation and display defects in cardiac outflow tract formation, atrial and ventricular septation, skeletal development, and palatogenesis. These data demonstrate that the reduction of retinaldehyde by DHRS3 is critical for preventing formation of excess ATRA during embryonic development."

In contrast to the fact that Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC recognizes the replication origin in a sequence-specific manner, metazoan ORC has not exhibited strict sequence-specificity for DNA binding. Here we report that human ORC binds preferentially to G-quadruplex (G4)-preferable G-rich RNA or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). We mapped the G-rich RNA-binding domain in the ORC1 subunit, in a region adjacent to its ATPase domain. This domain itself has an ability to preferentially recognize G4-preferable sequences of ssDNA. Furthermore, we found, by structure modeling, that the G-rich RNA-binding domain is similar to the N-terminal portion of AdoMet_MTase domain of mammalian DNA methyltransferase 1. Therefore, in contrast with the binding to double-stranded DNA, human ORC has an apparent sequence preference with respect to its RNA/ssDNA binding.

https://openalex.org/W2015969693,"Interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair involves proteins whose mutation results in the disorder Fanconi anaemia: here gene knockdown studies in mice show that the absence of HELQ, a protein previously implicated in ICL repair, compromises germ cell development and results in tumour predisposition due to defective recombination at damaged replication forks. The poorly characterized 3′–5′ superfamily 2 helicase HELQ has been implicated in the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), a type of DNA damage that is principally repaired by proteins whose mutation causes Fanconi anaemia. Simon Boulton and colleagues report the generation of a HELQ-deficient mouse. They find that the absence of the helicase compromises germ cell development and results in tumour predisposition. At the molecular level, HELQ interacts with BCDX2, a complex involved in homologous repair, and thereby facilitates recombination at damaged replication forks. Collectively, these findings point to a critical role for HELQ in replication-coupled DNA repair, germ cell maintenance and tumour avoidance. Repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) requires the coordinated action of the intra-S-phase checkpoint and the Fanconi anaemia pathway, which promote ICL incision, translesion synthesis and homologous recombination (reviewed in refs 1, 2). Previous studies have implicated the 3′–5′ superfamily 2 helicase HELQ in ICL repair in Drosophila melanogaster (MUS301 (ref. 3)) and Caenorhabditis elegans (HELQ-1 (ref. 4)). Although in vitro analysis suggests that HELQ preferentially unwinds synthetic replication fork substrates with 3′ single-stranded DNA overhangs and also disrupts protein–DNA interactions while translocating along DNA5,6, little is known regarding its functions in mammalian organisms. Here we report that HELQ helicase-deficient mice exhibit subfertility, germ cell attrition, ICL sensitivity and tumour predisposition, with Helq heterozygous mice exhibiting a similar, albeit less severe, phenotype than the null, indicative of haploinsufficiency. We establish that HELQ interacts directly with the RAD51 paralogue complex BCDX2 and functions in parallel to the Fanconi anaemia pathway to promote efficient homologous recombination at damaged replication forks. Thus, our results reveal a critical role for HELQ in replication-coupled DNA repair, germ cell maintenance and tumour suppression in mammals."

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which endogenous IL-1β alters glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the spinal dorsal horn in rats with neuropathic pain induced by ligation of the L5 spinal nerve. We demonstrated that endogenous IL-1β in neuropathic rats enhances glutamate release from the primary afferent terminals and non-NMDA glutamate receptor activities in postsynaptic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) is a mediator used by IL-1β to enhance non-NMDA glutamate receptor activities in postsynaptic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Presynaptic NMDA receptors are effector receptors used by the endogenous IL-1β to enhance glutamate release from the primary afferents in neuropathic rats.

The purpose of these studies was to examine previously unexplored interactions between COX-2 induction and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4) signaling pathway in murine RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). DHA dose (IC50=18 μM)- and time-dependently reduced COX-2 expression, without affecting COX-1. DHA (25 μM for 24 h) decreased LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis by 81%, primarily through reducing COX-2 (60%), as well as down-regulating microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (46%), but independently of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. FFA4 knockdown abrogated DHA effects on COX-2 induction, PGE2 production, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene expression. In the presence of inhibitors of eicosanoid metabolism via COX-2, 12/15-lipoxygenase and CYP450s (rofecoxib (1 μM), PD146176 (2 μM), or MS-PPOH (20 μM)), DHA was still effective in attenuating COX-2 induction. Moreover, Toll-like receptor 4 signaling via Akt/JNK phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation was repressed by DHA-activated FFA4 coupling with β-arrestin 2, which was reversed by FFA4 knockdown. These data support DHA modulation of COX-2 expression and activity, in part, via FFA4, which provides a new mechanistic explanation for some of the anti-inflammatory effects of DHA.—Li, X., Yu, Y., Funk, C.

During oxidative stress, however, the Cys-SOH moiety can react with H2O2 to form Cys sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H), resulting in inactivation. The propensity to hyperoxidize varies greatly among human Prxs. Mitochondrial Prx3 is the most resistant to inactivation, but the molecular basis for this property is unknown. A panel of chimeras and Cys variants of Prx2 and Prx3 were treated with H2O2 and analyzed by rapid chemical quench and time-resolved electrospray ionization-TOF mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W2099700384,"Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are a family of peptides with multiple functions in staphylococcal pathogenesis. To gain insight into the structural features affecting PSM functions, we analyzed an alanine substitution library of PSMα3, a strongly cytolytic and proinflammatory PSM of Staphylococcus aureus with a significant contribution to S. aureus virulence. Lysine residues were essential for both receptor-dependent proinflammatory and receptor-independent cytolytic activities. Both phenotypes also required additional structural features, with the C terminus being crucial for receptor activation. Biofilm formation was affected mostly by hydrophobic amino acid positions, suggesting that the capacity to disrupt hydrophobic interactions is responsible for the effect of PSMs on biofilm structure. Antimicrobial activity, absent from natural PSMα3, could be created by the exchange of large hydrophobic side chains, indicating that PSMα3 has evolved to exhibit cytolytic rather than antimicrobial activity. In addition to gaining insight into the structure-function relationship in PSMs, our study identifies nontoxic PSMα3 derivatives for active vaccination strategies and lays the foundation for future efforts aimed to understand the biological role of PSM recognition by innate host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2159214521,"Under inflammatory conditions and in the matrix of the cumulus-oocyte complex, the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) becomes decorated covalently with heavy chains (HCs) of the serum glycoprotein inter-α-inhibitor (IαI). This alters the functional properties of the HA as well as its structural role within extracellular matrices. The covalent transfer of HCs from IαI to HA is catalyzed by TSG-6 (tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6), but TSG-6 is also known as a HA cross-linker that induces condensation of the HA matrix. Here, we investigate the interplay of these two distinct functions of TSG-6 by studying the ternary interactions of IαI and TSG-6 with well defined films of end-grafted HA chains. We demonstrate that TSG-6-mediated cross-linking of HA films is impaired in the presence of IαI and that this effect suppresses the TSG-6-mediated enhancement of HA binding to CD44-positive cells. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of TSG-6 and IαI in the presence of HA gives rise to two types of complexes that independently promote the covalent transfer of heavy chains to HA. One type of complex interacts very weakly with HA and is likely to correspond to the previously reported covalent HC·TSG-6 complexes. The other type of complex is novel and binds stably but noncovalently to HA. Prolonged incubation with TSG-6 and IαI leads to HA films that contain, in addition to covalently HA-bound HCs, several tightly but noncovalently bound molecular species. These findings have important implications for understanding how the biological activities of TSG-6 are regulated, such that the presence or absence of IαI will dictate its function."
https://openalex.org/W2040558882,"Abnormal osteoclast formation and osteolysis are the hallmarks of multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the AKT pathway was up-regulated in primary bone marrow monocytes (BMM) from patients with MM, which resulted in sustained high expression of the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) in osteoclast precursors. The up-regulation of RANK expression and osteoclast formation in the MM BMM cultures was blocked by AKT inhibition. Conditioned media from MM cell cultures activated AKT and increased RANK expression and osteoclast formation in BMM cultures. Inhibiting AKT in cultured MM cells decreased their growth and ability to promote osteoclast formation. Of clinical significance, systemic administration of the AKT inhibitor LY294002 blocked the formation of tumor tissues in the bone marrow cavity and essentially abolished the MM-induced osteoclast formation and osteolysis in SCID mice. The level of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein was up-regulated in the BMM cultures from multiple myeloma patients. Adenoviral overexpression of ATF4 activated RANK expression in osteoclast precursors.

https://openalex.org/W1975928359,"Changes in bone remodeling induced by pharmacological and genetic manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) signaling in osteoblasts support a role of sympathetic nerves in the regulation of bone remodeling. However, the contribution of endogenous sympathetic outflow and nerve-derived norepinephrine (NE) to bone remodeling under pathophysiological conditions remains unclear. We show here that differentiated osteoblasts, like neurons, express the norepinephrine transporter (NET), exhibit specific NE uptake activity via NET and can catabolize, but not generate, NE. Pharmacological blockade of NE transport by reboxetine induced bone loss in WT mice. Similarly, lack of NE reuptake in norepinephrine transporter (Net)-deficient mice led to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption, resulting in suboptimal peak bone mass and mechanical properties associated with low sympathetic outflow and high plasma NE levels. Last, daily sympathetic activation induced by mild chronic stress was unable to induce bone loss, unless NET activity was blocked. These findings indicate that the control of endogenous NE release and reuptake by presynaptic neurons and osteoblasts is an important component of the complex homeostatic machinery by which the sympathetic nervous system controls bone remodeling. These findings also suggest that drugs antagonizing NET activity, used for the treatment of hyperactivity disorders, may have deleterious effects on bone accrual."
https://openalex.org/W1975343234,"Ras association domain family (RASSF) 6 is a member of the C-terminal RASSF proteins such as RASSF1A and RASSF3. RASSF6 is involved in apoptosis in various cells under miscellaneous conditions, but it remains to be clarified how RASSF6 exerts tumor-suppressive roles. We reported previously that RASSF3 facilitates the degradation of MDM2, a major E3 ligase of p53, and stabilizes p53 to function as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we demonstrate that RASSF6 overexpression induces G1/S arrest in p53-positive cells. Its depletion prevents UV- and VP-16-induced apoptosis and G1/S arrest in HCT116 and U2OS cells. RASSF6-induced apoptosis partially depends on p53. RASSF6 binds MDM2 and facilitates its ubiquitination. RASSF6 depletion blocks the increase of p53 in response to UV exposure and up-regulation of p53 target genes. RASSF6 depletion delays DNA repair in UV- and VP-16-treated cells and increases polyploid cells after VP-16 treatment. These findings indicate that RASSF6 stabilizes p53, regulates apoptosis and the cell cycle, and functions as a tumor suppressor. Together with the previous reports regarding RASSF1A and RASSF3, the stabilization of p53 may be the common function of the C-terminal RASSF proteins."

More recently, IGFBP-6 was found to promote the migration of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells in an IGF-independent manner, and MAPK pathways were involved in this process. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of these IGF-independent migratory actions of IGFBP-6 are largely unknown. Here, we report that prohibitin-2 (PHB2), a single-span membrane protein, is a key regulator of IGFBP-6-induced RMS cell migration. PHB2 and IGFBP-6 co-localize on the RMS cell surface, and they specifically interact, as demonstrated by affinity chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, biosensor analysis, and confocal microscopy.

In addition, IGFBP-6 indirectly increases PHB2 tyrosine phosphorylation on RMS membranes. Importantly, PHB2 knockdown completely abolished IGFBP-6-mediated RMS cell migration.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) 2The abbreviations used are: RMS, rhabdomyosarcoma; ERMS and ARMS, embryonal and alveolar RMS, respectively; PHB, prohibitin; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; mIGFBP-6, mutant IGFBP-6 (P93A/L94A/L97A/L98A); SFM, serum-free medium; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. arises from primitive skeletal myoblasts and is the most common soft tissue malignancy of childhood and adolescence. Embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) are the two principal subtypes of RMS. ERMS mainly affects children less than 10 years old (1.Visser M. Sijmons C. Bras J. Arceci R.J. Godfried M. Valentijn L.J. Voûte P.A. Baas F. Allelotype of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma.Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas ARMS is predominantly found in adolescents and young adults, is more aggressive, and has a poorer prognosis (2.Barr F.G. Gene fusions involving PAX and FOX family members in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II has been implicated as an autocrine growth factor for RMS and plays an important role in its development and progression (3.Bach L.A. IGFBP-6 five years on; not so “forgotten”?.Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2005; 15: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). IGF actions are modulated by a family of six high affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). Of these, IGFBP-6 is distinctive for its ∼50-fold higher binding affinity for IGF-II over IGF-I, and it inhibits IGF-II actions but has little effect on IGF-I (3.Bach L.A. IGFBP-6 five years on; not so “forgotten”?.Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2005; 15: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This specificity makes IGFBP-6 an attractive potential therapeutic candidate for IGF-II-dependent pediatric malignancies, such as RMS, where it may be possible to inhibit IGF-II in the tumor environment with minimal effect on IGF-I-induced normal growth. However, IGFBP-6 also promotes RMS cell migration by an IGF-independent mechanism that involves MAPK pathway activation (4.Fu P. Liang G.J. Khot S.S. Phan R. Bach L.A.

Prohibitins (PHB1 and PHB2) are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed proteins. They are primarily found in mitochondria but are also present in several other cellular compartments, including the cytosol, nucleus, and plasma membrane (6.Mishra S. Murphy L.C. Nyomba B.L.

The role and therapeutic potential of prohibitin in disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). They have diverse functions. For example, PHB1 and PHB2 form large ring complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane and function as chaperone proteins that stabilize mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and maintain mitochondrial integrity (8.Osman C.

Tavernarakis N. Prohibitin and mitochondrial biology.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 394-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, PHBs serve as transcriptional regulators, thereby repressing cell proliferation (10.Wang S. Faller D.V. Roles of prohibitin in growth control and tumor suppression in human cancers.Transl. Oncogenomics. 2008; 3: 23-37PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic PHB1 plays an important role in Ras-mediated epithelial cell migration (11.Rajalingam K. Rudel T. Ras-Raf signaling needs prohibitin.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1503-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas cytoplasmic PHB2 has been linked to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling, thereby modulating skeletal muscle differentiation (12.Héron-Milhavet L. Mamaeva D. Rochat A. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Akt2 is implicated in skeletal muscle differentiation and specifically binds Prohibitin2/REA.J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 214: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell surface PHB1·PHB2 complexes interact with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein (13.Emerson V. Holtkotte D. Pfeiffer T. Wang I.H. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Bosch V. Identification of the cellular prohibitin 1/prohibitin 2 heterodimer as an interaction partner of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein.J.

Vi polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi targets the prohibitin family of molecules in intestinal epithelial cells and suppresses early inflammatory responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17492-17497Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), with the latter interaction resulting in suppression of early inflammatory responses. Plasma membrane PHB2 has also been identified as a receptor for insect dengue serotype 2 (15.Kuadkitkan A. Wikan N. Fongsaran C. Smith D.R. Identification and characterization of prohibitin as a receptor protein mediating DENV-2 entry into insect cells.Virology. 2010; 406: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether there is a native mammalian ligand for cell surface PHBs. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of PHB2 as a binding partner of IGFBP-6 on the RMS cell surface. IGFBP-6 indirectly increases its tyrosine phosphorylation, and PHB2 knockdown completely prevents IGFBP-6-induced RMS cell migration. These results suggest that PHB2 plays a key role in this IGF-independent action of IGFBP-6. Human Rh30 cells, derived from an alveolar RMS, and RD cells, derived from an embryonal RMS, were obtained from ATCC. The Mem-Per membrane protein extraction kit and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate were from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Sequencing grade trypsin was from Promega.

Disposable PD-10 desalting columns, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody, the CM5 chip, and the amine coupling kit were from GE Healthcare. Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen (Melbourne, Australia). Polycarbonate membranes (12-μm pores) were from Neuro Probe, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). SeeBlue Plus2 molecular weight markers were obtained from Invitrogen. Rh30 and RD cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 and DMEM, respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were serum-starved in serum-free RPMI 1640 or DMEM (SFM) containing 0.05% BSA at 37 °C for 16 h, followed by incubation with SFM with or without IGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) for various times as described. RD cells (20 175-cm2 flasks) were detached with PBS (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA. Cell membrane proteins were extracted using the Mem-Per membrane protein extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. An mIGFBP-6 affinity column was prepared using 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 and 5 mg of recombinant mIGFBP-6. The mIGFBP-6 affinity column was loaded with isolated membrane proteins diluted with column binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was washed with column binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 m and then 1 m NaCl in column binding buffer, followed by 0.5 m acetic acid. Eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining bands from the acetic acid eluate were cut out and washed extensively with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and then ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1:1) prior to drying. Sequencing grade trypsin (5 μl) was added directly at 40 °C for 4 h. Tryptic peptides were then mixed with α-cyano-2,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid matrix and dried. Samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and spectra were analyzed using the Mascot search engine (Matrixscience) against the SwissProt protein database. Total RNA was extracted from RD cells using TRIzol followed by DNase I digestion. RNA (10 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase. The PHB2 cDNA was amplified, and 5′ NcoI and 3′ EcoRI sites were introduced by PCR (94 °C for 3 min; 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s or 60 or 68 °C for 30 s, depending on the primer pair; 72 °C for 30 s; and then extension at 72 °C for 10 min). Primers (5′-TCAGCCATGGCCCAGAACTTGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGGGTGATCAGCTGTGAGGC-3′) were used to generate a 474-bp 5′-PHB2 cDNA, and primers (5′-TGTGGTGGCCAAGTTCAATGC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGAATTCTTGGTGACTAGGCTCATTTC-3′) were used to obtain a 496-bp 3′-PHB2 cDNA. These PCR products were digested by NcoI/BclI and BclI/EcoRI, respectively, and ligated into the pProExHTb expression vector in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag. The PCR product was sequenced to confirm that it was correct. Expression and Ni-NTA chromatographic purification of recombinant His6-tagged IGFBP-6, mIGFBP-6, and N- and C-domains of IGFBP-6 have been described previously (5.Fu P. Thompson J.A. Bach L.A. Promotion of cancer cell migration. An insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-independent action of IGF-binding protein-6.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22298-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following purification, recombinant proteins were dialyzed against RPMI 1640 and stored in aliquots (1–2 μg/ml) at −80 °C. The PHB2 expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109, and expression was induced with 1.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4–5 h. Recombinant PHB2 was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and eluted with 200 mm imidazole, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The protein was refolded by dialysis against 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant IGFBP-6, mIGFBP-6, and RNase (1 mg) were mixed with sulfo-NHS-biotin (2.5- and 20-fold molar excess), respectively, at room temperature for 1 h, followed by desalting. Biotinylated proteins (4.5 μm) were incubated with Rh30 cells (10-cm dish, 80% confluent) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with streptavidin-agarose (50 μl) at 4 °C for 2 h. Biotin solution (250 μl, 2 mm) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Beads were washed five times with 250 μl of TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl), and bound proteins were eluted with sample loading dye (2% SDS), followed by SDS-10% PAGE and PHB2 or PHB1 Western blotting. Recombinant IGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (200 ng) was incubated with recombinant PHB2 (300 ng) at room temperature for 3 h. PHB2 antibody or IgG (2.5 μg), protein A-Sepharose, and protein G-agarose beads (15 μl each) were added for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of TBS, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample loading buffer for 5 min, followed by IGFBP-6 Western blotting. To detect PHB phosphorylation, Rh30 cells were incubated with mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. After preclearance of cell lysates with protein A/G bead mixture (60 μl), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or IgG (3 μg) was added with protein A/G beads (60 μl) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted as above prior to PHB2 or PHB1 Western blotting. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed using the Biacore T100. Recombinant PHB2 in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using the manufacturer's amine coupling kit, followed by blocking with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 6.0). The increase in signal of recombinant PHB2 was 1784 response units. The control flow cell was activated and blocked the same way. IGFBP-6, mIGFBP-6, or isolated N- and C-domains of IGFBP-6 (8–512 nm) in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant p20 (GE Healthcare)) were passed over control and PHB2 flow cells at 10 μl/min for 70 s at 25 °C. Following injection, dissociation was evaluated by passing HBS-EP buffer alone over the chip at 10 μl/min for 10 min. After each run, the chip was regenerated with 0.045% SDS for 30 s. Data were processed using BIAevaluation software (version 1.1.1). Rh30 or RD cells from four 10-cm dishes each were incubated with IGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and surface-biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in 0.25% DMSO/PBS) at 4 °C for 40 min. Cells were then incubated with RPMI or DMEM at 4 °C for 10 min, followed by a 20-ml cold PBS wash. Cell lysates (3 mg) were incubated with 160 μl of streptavidin-agarose (50%) in TBS containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors for 3 h. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of cold TBS (pH 7.4). Biotinylated cell surface proteins were eluted with sample loading buffer containing DTT and analyzed by phosphotyrosine, PHB2, and PHB1 Western blotting. Band intensities were quantitated using ImageJ software (version 1.47). PHB2 (5 μg) was incubated with WT or mIGFBP-6 (5 μg) in 20 μl of Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2 with or without 100 μm ATP, for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation of N-ezrin (5 μg) by the EGF receptor (1.62 units) was used as a positive control as described previously (16.McRobert E.A. Gallicchio M. Jerums G. Cooper M.E. Bach L.A. The amino-terminal domains of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins bind advanced glycation end products, an interaction that may play a role in the development of diabetic complications.J.

The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling, and the products were analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE and phosphotyrosine Western blotting. Rh30 cells were detached and incubated with biotinylated IGFBP-6 or RNase (50 μg/ml) in 200 μl of PBS at 4 °C for 20 min and then with anti-PHB2 antiserum (150 μl, 1:100) at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. After PBS washing (1.5 ml), cells were incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) and Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin (1:100) in 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h and then stained with DAPI (600 nm) for 1 min. Cells were washed with 1.5 ml of PBS and examined using a Nikon Alr confocal microscope with a ×40 water lens. Confocal images were generated using Fuji ImageJA 1.45b. Human PHB-2 siRNAs SMARTpool and an On-TARGETplus non-targeting siRNA 1 were used for knockdown experiments. PHB2 or control siRNA (final concentration 300 nm) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in 100 μl of serum-free RPMI medium with 0.05% BSA and 5.3 μl of DharmaFECT3 transfection reagent. Rh30 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates) were grown for 24 h and then incubated for 72 h at 37 °C with the siRNA mixture diluted with 400 μl of fresh 10% serum-containing RPMI. Western blotting and cell migration assays were then performed. Rh30 cell migration studies were performed using a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described previously (4.Fu P. Liang G.J. Khot S.S. Phan R. Bach L.A.

WT or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) or IGF-II (100 ng/ml) in SFM was added to the bottom wells of the chamber. Polycarbonate filters (12-μm pore size, coated with gelatin (100 μg/ml) in 10 mm acetic acid at room temperature for 30 min) were placed over the bottom wells, and Rh30 cells (5.6 × 104 cells/well) in SFM were seeded in the top wells. After 24 h, the filter was removed, fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet, 50% methanol solution for 20 min. Membranes were washed in water to remove excess dye and unbound cells and mounted on glass slides. Three random fields/well were photographed, and migrating cells were counted using ImageJ software (version 1.44o). Each data point represents 4–6 replicates. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. of 3–5 independent experiments, as indicated. Data were log-transformed to stabilize variance if required and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test to compare individual treatments. We previously reported that IGFBP-6 induces RMS cell migration in an IGF-independent manner (4.Fu P. Liang G.J. Khot S.S. Phan R. Bach L.A.

To identify membrane proteins that interact with IGFBP-6, we carried out a large scale preparation of RD membrane proteins, and IGFBP-6-binding membrane proteins were isolated using an mIGFBP-6 (a mutant of IGFBP-6 that does not bind IGFs) affinity column. A 35 kDa Coomassie Blue-stained band was isolated and subjected to tryptic peptide mapping followed by mass spectrometry. Six peptides corresponding to sequences within PHB2 (17.Strausberg R.L.

Furthermore, a 3-fold excess of unlabeled mIGFBP-6 competed for the interaction between biotinylated mIGFBP-6 and PHB2. In contrast, PHB1 was not found in the pulled down fraction (not shown). These results suggest that IGFBP-6 physically interacts with PHB2 and that the interaction is reversible. Recombinant human PHB2 was next expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1B). Co-immunoprecipitation using recombinant IGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 and PHB2 was performed. The PHB2 antibody, but not control IgG, successfully pulled down PHB2·IGFBP-6 and PHB2·mIGFBP-6 complexes (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of the IGFBP-6/PHB2 interaction was characterized by surface plasmon resonance. Both WT and mIGFBP-6 bound to immobilized PHB2 in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, D and E). Calculated KD values for the interactions were 9.0 ± 1.0 nm for IGFBP-6 and 10.2 ± 0.5 nm for mIGFBP-6. In contrast, immobilized PHB-2 did not bind to unrelated proteins, including 500 nm BSA or γ-globulin (not shown). IGFBP-6 shares a three-domain structure with the other IGFBPs, and the structured N- and C-domains are involved in binding to IGFs and other biomolecules. To further analyze the PHB2 interaction with IGFBP-6, we prepared recombinant N- and C-domains of IGFBP-6 as described previously (5.Fu P. Thompson J.A. Bach L.A. Promotion of cancer cell migration.

Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The isolated C-domain of IGFBP-6 bound PHB2 with a KD of 68.8 ± 10.2 nm (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the N-domain of IGFBP-6 did not bind (Fig. 2B). To determine whether PHB2 is located on RMS cell membranes, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and then pulled down using streptavidin-agarose beads. Western blotting showed that both PHB2 and PHB1 were found in the pulled-down fraction of RD (Fig. 3A) and Rh30 cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that both PHB2 and PHB1 are located on RMS cell membranes. Importantly, incubation of biotinylated IGFBP-6 with Rh30 cells resulted in its co-localization with membrane-associated PHB2 (Fig. 3C). PHB phosphorylation may contribute to its biological actions (19.Mishra S. Ande S.R. Nyomba B.L. The role of prohibitin in cell signaling.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3937-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Rh30 cells were incubated with mIGFBP-6 for 20 min, after which cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a phosphotyrosine antibody followed by PHB2 Western blotting. This showed that mIGFBP-6 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB2 in Rh30 cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PHB1 was not pulled down (not shown), indicating that it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in these cells. Furthermore, PHB2 was not Ser/Thr-phosphorylated in the absence or presence of mIGFBP-6 (not shown). These results suggest that mIGFBP-6 specifically increases PHB2 tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. To further investigate if IGFBP-6 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB2 on RMS cell surfaces, cells were treated with IGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) for 20 min, and cell surface biotinylation was performed, followed by streptavidin-agarose pull-down, SDS-10% PAGE, and then phosphotyrosine, PHB2, and PHB1 Western blotting. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB2, but not PHB1, was increased by IGFBP-6 on both RD and Rh30 cell surfaces, whereas it had no effect on PHB2 or PHB1 abundance (Fig. 4, B and C). After correcting for total PHB2, IGFBP-6 significantly increased phosphorylation 2.5 ± 0.5- and 1.4 ± 0.2-fold, respectively, in Rh30 and RD cells (p = 0.04 for each). In vitro assays using purified proteins were next performed to determine whether IGFBP-6 directly stimulates PHB2 phosphorylation. Although the EGF receptor stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin as described previously (16.McRobert E.A. Gallicchio M. Jerums G. Cooper M.E. Bach L.A.

We have previously described a human monoclonal antibody called KM33 that blocks these interactions as well as cellular uptake by LRP-expressing cells. To unambiguously identify the apparent “hot spot” on FVIII to which this antibody binds, we have employed hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The results showed that KM33 protects FVIII regions 2091–2104 and 2157–2162 from hydrogen-deuterium exchange. These comprise the two C1 domain spikes 2092–2093 and 2158–2159. Spike 2092–2093 has been demonstrated recently to contribute to assembly with lipid membranes with low phosphatidylserine (PS) content. Therefore, spike 2158–2159 might serve a similar role. This was assessed by replacement of Arg-2159 for Asn, which introduces a motif for N-linked glycosylation. Binding studies revealed that the purified, glycosylated R2159N variant had lost its interaction with antibody KM33 but retained substantial binding to von Willebrand factor and LRP. Cellular uptake of the R2159N variant was reduced both by LRP-expressing U87-MG cells and by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. FVIII activity was virtually normal on membranes containing 15% PS but reduced at low PS content. These findings suggest that the C1 domain spikes 2092–2093 and 2158–2159 together modulate FVIII membrane assembly by a subtle, PS-dependent mechanism.

Because amyloid precursor protein is predominantly expressed by neurons and deposition of Aβ aggregates in the human brain is highly correlated with the Aβ released at axonal terminals, we focused our investigation of BACE1 localization on the neuritic region. We show that BACE1 was not only enriched in the late Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and early endosomes but also in both axons and dendrites. BACE1 was colocalized with the presynaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin, indicating the presence of BACE1 in synapses. Because the excessive release of Aβ from synapses is attributable to an increase in amyloid deposition, we further explored whether the presence of BACE1 in synapses was regulated by reticulon 3 (RTN3), a protein identified previously as a negative regulator of BACE1. We found that RTN3 is not only localized in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in neuritic regions where no endoplasmic reticulum-shaping proteins are detected, implicating additional functions of RTN3 in neurons. Coexpression of RTN3 with BACE1 in cultured neurons was sufficient to reduce colocalization of BACE1 with synaptophysin. This reduction correlated with decreased anterograde transport of BACE1 in axons in response to overexpressed RTN3. Our results in this study suggest that altered RTN3 levels can impact the axonal transport of BACE1 and demonstrate that reducing axonal transport of BACE1 in axons is a viable strategy for decreasing BACE1 in axonal terminals and, perhaps, reducing amyloid deposition.Background: Axonal transport of BACE1 and the regulation of BACE1 synaptic localization remain to be fully characterized.Results: Colocalization of BACE1 with synaptophysin was reduced by overexpression of RTN3.

Its basic form comprises a single molybdopterin (MPT) unit, which binds a molybdenum ion bearing three oxygen ligands via a dithiolene function, thus forming Mo-MPT. In bacteria, this form is modified to form the bis-MPT guanine dinucleotide cofactor with two MPT units coordinated at one molybdenum atom, which additionally contains GMPs bound to the terminal phosphate group of the MPTs (bis-MGD). The MobA protein catalyzes the nucleotide addition to MPT, but the mechanism of the biosynthesis of the bis-MGD cofactor has remained enigmatic. We have established an in vitro system for studying bis-MGD assembly using purified compounds. Quantification of the MPT/molybdenum and molybdenum/phosphorus ratios, time-dependent assays for MPT and MGD detection, and determination of the numbers and lengths of Mo–S and Mo–O bonds by X-ray absorption spectroscopy enabled identification of a novel bis-Mo-MPT intermediate on MobA prior to nucleotide attachment.

https://openalex.org/W2013796020,"Ricin inhibits protein synthesis by depurinating the α-sarcin/ricin loop (SRL). Ricin holotoxin does not inhibit translation unless the disulfide bond between the A (RTA) and B (RTB) subunits is reduced. Ricin holotoxin did not bind ribosomes or depurinate them but could depurinate free RNA. When RTA is separated from RTB, arginine residues located at the interface are exposed to the solvent. Because this positively charged region, but not the active site, is blocked by RTB, we mutated arginine residues at or near the interface of RTB to determine if they are critical for ribosome binding. These variants were structurally similar to wild type RTA but could not bind ribosomes. Their K(m) values and catalytic rates (k(cat)) for an SRL mimic RNA were similar to those of wild type, indicating that their activity was not altered. However, they showed an up to 5-fold increase in K(m) and up to 38-fold decrease in kcat toward ribosomes. These results suggest that the stalk binding stimulates the catalysis of ribosome depurination by RTA. The mutated arginines have side chains behind the active site cleft, indicating that the ribosome binding surface of RTA is on the opposite side of the surface that interacts with the SRL. We propose that stalk binding stimulates the catalysis of ribosome depurination by orienting the active site of RTA toward the SRL and thereby allows docking of the target adenine into the active site. This model may apply to the translation factors that interact with the stalk."

The functionally characterized GNATs have been shown to catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to the amine of a wide range of substrates, including small molecules and proteins. GNATs are prevalent and implicated in a myriad of aspects of eukaryotic and prokaryotic physiology, but functions of many GNATs remain unknown. In this work, we used a multi-pronged approach of x-ray crystallography and biochemical characterization to elucidate the sequence-structure-function relationship of the GNAT superfamily member PA4794 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We determined that PA4794 acetylates the Nε amine of a C-terminal lysine residue of a peptide, suggesting it is a protein acetyltransferase specific for a C-terminal lysine of a substrate protein or proteins. Furthermore, we identified a number of molecules, including cephalosporin antibiotics, which are inhibitors of PA4794 and bind in its substrate-binding site. Often, these molecules mimic the conformation of the acetylated peptide product. We have determined structures of PA4794 in the apo-form, in complexes with Ac-CoA, CoA, several antibiotics and other small molecules, and a ternary complex with the products of the reaction: CoA and acetylated peptide. Also, we analyzed PA4794 mutants to identify residues important for substrate binding and catalysis."

Peptides and proteins are chemically grafted onto these hydrophilic materials to facilitate adhesion and direct phenotype of entrapped cells. However, the presentation of a single or small number of peptides does not represent the complexity of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) of bony tissues. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete ECM that can be harvested and deposited on various substrata to promote osteogenic differentiation. In this study, we hypothesized that the presentation of engineered cell-secreted ECM on microbeads suspended in alginate hydrogels would promote cell adhesion and enhance osteogenic differentiation of undifferentiated MSCs without chemical incorporation of cell-adhesive peptides. Human MSCs entrapped in alginate hydrogels loaded with ECM-coated beads showed increased interaction with beads, when compared with cells suspended in hydrogels containing uncoated blank (BLK) beads. MSCs entrapped in ECM gels exhibited increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression of osteogenic genes in vitro compared with hydrogels modified with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-containing peptides. Transplantation of MSCs into an ectopic site resulted in significant increases in blood vessel density for ECM hydrogels when compared with the BLK or RGD gels. Furthermore, we observed comparable levels of bone formation at 6 wk with ECM and RGD hydrogels. These findings demonstrate that engineered ECM can be deployed in a minimally invasive manner to direct the formation of bony tissue. This strategy may provide an alternative to the engraftment of proteins or peptides onto the polymer backbone of hydrogels for directing cellular behavior.—Bhat, A., Hoch, A. I., Decaris, M.

Because both RACK1 and vimentin have been linked to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), we investigated whether this pathway regulated invasion. RACK1 depletion reduced invasion responses, and this was associated with attenuated activation of FAK. Knockdown of vimentin significantly decreased levels of phosphorylated and total FAK. Treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of FAK dose-dependently reduced invasion, indicating a crucial role for FAK activity during invasion. Because RACK1 and vimentin were both up-regulated with sphingosine 1-phosphate treatment, required for invasion, and regulated FAK, we tested whether they complexed together.

In addition, RACK1, vimentin, and FAK formed an intermolecular complex in invading endothelial cultures in three dimensions in response to stimulation by sphingosine 1-phosphate and growth factors. Moreover, depletion of RACK1 decreased the association of vimentin and FAK, suggesting that RACK1 was required for stabilizing vimentin-FAK interactions during sprouting.

We identified a longer splice variant of ubiquitin specific protease (USP) 2-69 as a novel molecule that modulates pathways implicated in metabolic disorders. Expression levels of aP2/FABP4 and PAI-1/SERPINE1 genes were increased by 4-and 1.8-fold, respectively, after short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of the USP2 gene, and such expression was alleviated by overexpression of USP2-69 in human myeloid cell lines. Supernatants derived from USP2-KD cells induced IL6 (~ 6-fold) and SAA3 (~ 15-fold) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to suggest the anti-inflammatory properties of USP2. In addition, we observed a 30% decrease in the number of macrophages in mesenteric adipose tissue derived from USP2-69 transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet for 14 wk compared with that in their C57BL/6 littermates (P<0.01), which was consistent with a ~40% decrease in transcription of aP2 and PAI-1.

https://openalex.org/W1970628327,"The sodium ion-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na(+)-NQR) from the pathogen Vibrio cholerae exploits the free energy liberated during oxidation of NADH with ubiquinone to pump sodium ions across the cytoplasmic membrane. The Na(+)-NQR consists of four membrane-bound subunits NqrBCDE and the peripheral NqrF and NqrA subunits. NqrA binds ubiquinone-8 as well as quinones with shorter prenyl chains (ubiquinone-1 and ubiquinone-2). Here we show that the quinone derivative 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB), a known inhibitor of the bc1 and b6f complexes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts, also inhibits quinone reduction by the Na(+)-NQR in a mixed inhibition mode. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching and saturation transfer difference NMR experiments in the presence of Na(+)-NQR inhibitor (DBMIB or 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide) indicate that two quinone analog ligands are bound simultaneously by the NqrA subunit with very similar interaction constants as observed with the holoenzyme complex. We conclude that the catalytic site of quinone reduction is located on NqrA. The two ligands bind to an extended binding pocket in direct vicinity to each other as demonstrated by interligand Overhauser effects between ubiquinone-1 and DBMIB or 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, respectively. We propose that a similar spatially close arrangement of the native quinone substrates is also operational in vivo, enhancing the catalytic efficiency during the final electron transfer steps in the Na(+)-NQR."

The carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) can engage in both cis-homophilic (parallel) oligomerization and trans-homophilic (anti-parallel) binding. In this study, we establish that the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain has a propensity to form cis-dimers via the transmembrane-embedded 432GXXXG436 motif and that this basal state is overcome when activated calmodulin binds to the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain. Although mutation of the 432GXXXG436 motif reduced CEACAM1 oligomerization, it did not affect surface localization of the receptor or influence CEACAM1-dependent cellular invasion by the pathogenic Neisseria. The mutation did, however, have a striking effect on CEACAM1-dependent cellular aggregation, increasing both the kinetics of cell-cell association and the size of cellular aggregates formed. CEACAM1 association with tyrosine kinase c-Src and tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 was not affected by the 432GXXXG436 mutation, consistent with their association with the monomeric form of wild type CEACAM1.

Cell adhesion is a fundamental activity required for the correct functioning of virtually every process in the multicellular organism. Despite this central role, the molecular events that govern intercellular binding and translate this event to intracellular signals with the potential to control cellular growth, differentiation, and development often remain only superficially defined. An emerging appreciation that the misregulation of individual cell adhesion molecules can contribute to pathologies as disparate as cancer, inflammation, pathogenic infections, and autoimmune disease (1.Okegawa T.

Pol. 2004; 51: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) has revealed the complexity of cell adhesion molecule signal integration and prompted an intense effort to understand what governs physical binding and how these molecular events elicit a cellular response. The carcinoembryonic antigen gene family represents a large but well defined subgroup within the immunoglobulin superfamily, one of the largest and most diverse families of proteins in the body (2.Beauchemin N.

Remarkably, however, studies by various groups suggest that CEACAM1 may exert either inhibitory or activating functions on the cell (23.Gray-Owen S.D. Blumberg R.S. CEACAM1: contact-dependent control of immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). One plausible explanation is that different oligomeric states of CEACAM1 may recruit different effectors to elicit opposing signaling responses (24.Obrink B. Sawa H. Scheffrahn I. Singer B.B. Sigmundsson K. Sundberg U. Heymann R. Beauchemin N. Weng G. Ram P. Iyengar R. Computational analysis of isoform-specific signal regulation by CEACAM1-A cell adhesion molecule expressed in PC12 cells.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to trans-intercellular (antiparallel) binding, CEACAM1 has been shown to self-associate into oligomers of two or more monomers together in cis (parallel) fashion (25.Hunter I. Sawa H. Edlund M. Obrink B. Evidence for regulated dimerization of cell-cell adhesion molecule (C-CAM) in epithelial cells.Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On rat epithelial cells, surface-expressed CEACAM1 has been shown to exist as either a monomer or noncovalently linked dimer (25.Hunter I. Sawa H. Edlund M. Obrink B. Evidence for regulated dimerization of cell-cell adhesion molecule (C-CAM) in epithelial cells.Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although no experimental evidence yet supports a difference in function of monomeric versus cis-dimeric human CEACAM1, work by Obrink and co-workers (26.Müller M.M. Klaile E. Vorontsova O. Singer B.B. Obrink B. Homophilic adhesion and CEACAM1-S regulate dimerization of CEACAM1-L and recruitment of SHP-2 and c-Src.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggested that the tyrosine phosphatases tended to associate with dimeric CEACAM1-L, whereas the tyrosine kinase c-Src displayed no obvious preference for dimeric versus monomeric CEACAM1-L. Given the differential function of these effector proteins, the balance between monomeric and dimeric forms of CEACAM1 may result in different, even apparently contradictory, cellular responses. Early studies with isolated rat liver plasma membrane suggest that CEACAM1 dimerization may be controlled by calcium-loaded calmodulin binding to CEACAM1. This postulate arises from both an observation that the calcium ionophore ionomycin causes a transient increase in the CEACAM1 monomer-dimer ratio (25.Hunter I. Sawa H. Edlund M. Obrink B. Evidence for regulated dimerization of cell-cell adhesion molecule (C-CAM) in epithelial cells.Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and separate biophysical studies revealing a calmodulin-binding site within synthetic peptides based upon the sequence of naturally occurring CEACAM1 splice variants with both the long (L) and short (S) cytoplasmic domains (27.Edlund M. Obrink B. Evidence for calmodulin binding to the cytoplasmic domains of two C-CAM isoforms.FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Such observations suggest a means by which CEACAM1 oligomers may be disassociated; yet they do not consider what motivates CEACAM1 dimerization, and there remains no appreciation as to what effect this transition has on the behavior of a cell. A lack of understanding regarding how cell adhesion molecule oligomerization influences the outcome of cell-cell binding is currently the greatest hurdle to understanding their function in health and disease. In this study, we used in vitro cellular experiments to demonstrate that human CEACAM1 naturally exists as a dimer due to the presence of membrane-buried glycine residues that self-assemble to promote the cis-homodimerization. Our data suggest that, upon cellular activation, calcium-loaded calmodulin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 and promotes its dissociation into monomers. This effect has direct implications for cell-cell communications, as we establish that monomeric CEACAM1 promotes intercellular binding and that the long cytoplasmic domain then allows intracellular recruitment of cytoplasmic effectors that control the cellular response. These findings provide a molecular level context for recent work demonstrating that forced monomers of CEACAM1–4S reduced anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo (28.Lawson E.L. Mills D.R. Brilliant K.E. Hixson D.C. The transmembrane domain of CEACAM1–4S is a determinant of anchorage independent growth and tumorigenicity.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29606Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and they provide a new paradigm by which to understand how fluctuations in the oligomeric state of CEACAM1 can control intercellular adhesion and mediate its effect on cell growth and differentiation. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The rabbit CEACAM-specific polyclonal antiserum and normal rabbit serum were from Dako (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The CEACAM pan-specific D14HD11 antibody was from Genovac GmbH (Freiburg, Germany). The anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2, and anti c-Src antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HRP- and fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The stably transfected HeLa cell line expressing defined recombinant CEACAM1 (HeLa-CEACAM1–4L) was described previously (29.Gray-Owen S.D. Dehio C. Haude A. Grunert F. Meyer T.F. CD66 carcinoembryonic antigens mediate interactions between Opa-expressing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and human polymorphonuclear phagocytes.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HeLa-CEACAM1–4L and the parental HeLa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 4 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Plasmids containing CEACAM1 in pRC/CMV were generously provided by Wolfgang Zimmermann (Munich, Germany). cDNAs were amplified via PCR (5′ primers contained a Kozak sequence, GCCACCATG, for protein expression) and subcloned into pMSCV Puro retroviral expression vector (Clontech). The variants of human CEACAM1–4L, CEACAM1–4S (CEACAM1 with short cytoplasmic domain) and truncated CEACAM1 (CEACAM1 lacking the complete cytoplasmic domain) were amplified from CEACAM1–4L originally cloned into the pRC/CMV vector (30.Kuroki M. Arakawa F. Matsuo Y. Oikawa S. Misumi Y. Nakazato H. Matsuoka Y. Molecular cloning of nonspecific cross-reacting antigens in human granulocytes.J. Biol.

The R43S/Q44L-CEACAM1–4L variant was generated from the pMSCV-Puro-CEACAM1 by PCR splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) (31.Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. Gene splicing by overlap extension: tailor-made genes using the polymerase chain reaction.BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The G432L/G436L-CEACAM1–4L variant was generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide primers used to create amino acid substitutions at positions 432 and 436 of the transmembrane domain of CEACAM1–4L are shown in supplemental Table S1. For introducing mutations, CEACAM1–4L was amplified by PCR from pMSCV-Puro-CEACAM1–4L using a forward primer and a reverse primer containing the desired mutations. CEACAM1–4L with appropriate mutation was amplified and cloned into pMSCV-Puro vector using restriction sites XhoI and EcoRI. The pEYFP-tagged CEACAM1 variants were constructed by cloning CEACAM1 variants into the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). c-Myc-tagged CEACAM1–4L was constructed by PCR addition of the c-Myc protein-derived peptide sequence to the C terminus of CEACAM1–4L using a 3′-edge primer containing the c-Myc sequence and an EcoRI restriction enzyme site and then cloned into pMSCV Puro vector. Primers used for generation of recombinant CEACAM1 alleles are listed in supplemental Table S1. For transient transfection-based assays, the HeLa cell lines were transfected with the indicated CEACAM1 alleles using FuGENE 6 according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains constitutively expressing either no Opa protein (N302) or the CEACAM-specific Opa52 (N309) were derived from a N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 mutant that does not express pili (32.Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. Variable opacity (Opa) outer membrane proteins account for the cell tropisms displayed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae for human leukocytes and epithelial cells.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and were graciously provided by Prof. T. F. Meyer (Max-Planck-Institut für Infektionsbiologie, Berlin, Germany). N. gonorrhoeae were grown from frozen stocks on 1% (v/v) IsoVitaleXTM (BBLTM, BD Biosciences)-supplemented GC agar (Difco) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. Gonococcal strains were subcultured daily using a binocular microscope to select desired colony opacity phenotype, and Opa protein expression was routinely confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Prior to cross-linking, cells from a low (<50%) confluence culture dish were resuspended using trypsin/EDTA, which does not cleave surface CEACAM1, and then washed twice in PBS supplemented with 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 (PBS/Mg/Ca) by pelleting and resuspension. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate (DSP) at 500 μm or at the indicated concentrations. After gentle agitation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with the addition of Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a final concentration of 100 mm. Cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, before immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation studies. Cells were occasionally visually observed and counted before and after cross-linking to ensure no aggregation of the suspended cells had occurred. In a pulldown experiment, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a c-Myc- and/or pEYFP-tagged CEACAM1–4L using FuGENE 6 as per the manufacturer's instruction. After cells were cross-linked as described previously, cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer. c-Myc-containing proteins were recovered from lysates using anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, Babco, Berkeley, CA). Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis with anti-YFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total cell lysates were probed with mouse CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody (D14DH11, Genovac GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) as described previously (29.Gray-Owen S.D. Dehio C. Haude A. Grunert F. Meyer T.F. CD66 carcinoembryonic antigens mediate interactions between Opa-expressing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and human polymorphonuclear phagocytes.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For all immunoblot analyses, antigen-specific primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and then developed using ECL Plus chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray film. Unless otherwise noted, HeLa cells transfected with the indicated CEACAM1 mutant constructs were incubated in PBS/Mg/Ca with 1 μm ionomycin (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) or 50 μm N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W-7) (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for various periods of time, the ionophore or W-7 was removed, and the cells were cross-linked as described. For depletion of intracellular calcium, HeLa-CEACAM1–4L cells were incubated with 3 mm EGTA (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min before exposure to ionomycin or other treatments. Stably transfected HeLa-CEACAM1–4L cells and transiently transfected HeLa cells (5 × 105) with pEYFP-tagged CEACAM1 mutants were collected in PBS containing 2% FBS (v/v) and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Surface CEACAM1 was stained with the CEACAM-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) D14HD11 (20 μg/ml) diluted in 3% FCS/PBS for 1 h on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab′)2. Background fluorescence was determined using isotype-matched Ig. For the intracellular staining of CEACAM1, cells were treated with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences), and stained with 20 μg/ml CEACAM-specific mAb D14HD11 followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab′)2 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), all diluted in Perm/Wash buffer. A minimum of 1 × 104 gated cells from each sample was analyzed using FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The membrane-impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) was added to cross-linked samples at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After gentle agitation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with the addition of Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a final concentration of 100 mm. Cells were washed twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Following washing, cells were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 10 mm H2O2). Biotinylated surface proteins were pulled down using streptavidin-agarose (Sigma), and SDS-PAGE immunoblots of nonreduced or reduced pellets were probed to detect CEACAM1 dimers and monomers using mAb against CEACAM1 (D14HD11; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). HeLa-CEACAM1–4L cells were treated with the indicated amounts of ionomycin or W-7 for various periods of time. After cells were cross-linked as described, cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer. Calmodulin was immunoprecipitated from lysates with a mAb antibody specific for calmodulin (EP799Y; Abcam). Recovered proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for CEACAM1 (D14HD11). Potential sites of CEACAM1 TMD self-interaction were identified via simulation with the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) searching of helix interactions (CHI) software suite, as described previously (33.Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brünger A.T. Computational searching and mutagenesis suggest a structure for the pentameric transmembrane domain of phospholamban.Nat. Struct.

Version 1.2 of the crystallography and NMR system.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Briefly, two identical α-helices were generated from the primary sequence of the CEACAM1 TMD (residues 429–451, inclusive), and dimers with either a right-handed or left-handed crossing angle was created. Helix-helix interactions were searched in a parallel orientation. Rotation angles from 0 to 360° were searched in steps of 45°, and molecular dynamics simulation, simulated annealing, and energy minimization were carried out for each step. Energy-minimized dimers were grouped into clusters of at least 10 structures with a cutoff of mean square deviation of 1 Å. The average structure of each cluster was calculated and refined by energy minimization. All simulations were conducted in vacuum (dielectric constant Z = 1) to mimic the low dielectric constant of the membrane core. Fluorescence anisotropy microscopy (FAIM) for the detection of FRET between like fluorescent proteins (homo-FRET) was performed on an LSM710 NLO confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) equipped with a Chameleon Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent). Cells were imaged in RPMI at room temperature using a 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective lens and pixel dwell time of 12.61 μs. These images were collected from the bottom of the cell at the glass coverslip because this position provides a relatively flat field of the plasma membrane. Aside from focal adhesions, this ventral cell surface was not generally attached to the glass because most of the membrane surface was freely accessible to soluble fluorescent dyes administered to the culture medium (data not shown), and these cells were not polarized, so CEACAM1 and other receptors were distributed along both dorsal and ventral cell surfaces. mVenus and Yellow (YFP) fluorescent protein excitation was achieved with the femtosecond laser set to 950 nm (36.Rizzo M.A. Springer G.

We evaluated the beneficial effects of RAS inhibition on β-cell function under glucotoxic conditions. Human islets from 13 donors were cultured in 5.5 mM (controls) or 16.7 mM glucose [high glucose (HG)] for 4 d with or without losartan (5 μM), a selective AT1Rblocker, and/or U73122 (2 μM), a selective PLC inhibitor, during the last 2 d. HG induced RAS activation with overexpression of AT1R (P<0.05) and angiotensinogen (P< 0.001) mRNAs. HG increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (P< 0.001) such as GRP78, sXBP1, and ATF4 mRNAs and Grp78 protein levels (P<0.01). HG also decreased reticular calcium concentration (P<0.0001) and modified protein expressions of ER calcium pumps with reduction of SERCA2b (P<0.01) and increase of IP3R2 (P<0.05). Losartan prevented these deleterious effects and was associated with improved insulin secretion despite HG exposure. AT1R activation triggers the PLC-IP3-calcium pathway. Losartan prevented the increase of PLC β1 and γ1 protein levels induced by HG (P<0.05). U73122 reproduced all the protective effects of losartan. AT1R blockade protects human islets from the deleterious effects of glucose through inhibition of the PLC-IP3-calcium pathway.—Madec, A-M., Cassel, R., Dubois, S., Ducreux, S., Vial, G., Chauvin, M.-A., Mesnier, A., Chikh, K., Bosco, D., Rieusset, J., Van Coppenolle, F., Thivolet, C., Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, protects human islets from glucotoxicity through the phospholipase C pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2032746619,"Mammalian eIF3 is composed of 13 subunits and is the largest eukaryotic initiation factor. eIF3 plays a key role in protein biosynthesis. However, it is not fully understood how different subunits contribute to the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex. Whether eIF3 is essential for embryonic development and homeostasis is also not known. Here, we show that eIF3m null embryos are lethal at the peri-implantation stage. Compound heterozygotes (eIF3m(flox)(/-)) or FABP4-Cre-mediated conditional knock-out mice are lethal at mid-gestation stages. Although the heterozygotes are viable, they show markedly reduced organ size and diminished body weight. Acute ablation of eIF3m in adult mouse liver leads to rapidly decreased body weight and death within 2 weeks; these effects are correlated with a severe decline of protein biogenesis in the liver. Protein analyses reveal that eIF3m deficiency significantly impairs the integrity of the eIF3 complex due to down-regulation of multiple other subunits. Two of the subunits, eIF3f and eIF3h, are stabilized by eIF3m through subcomplex formation. Therefore, eIF3m is required for the structural integrity and translation initiation function of eIF3. Furthermore, not only is eIF3m an essential gene, but its expression level is also important for mouse embryonic development and the control of organ size."
https://openalex.org/W2170665574,"Grb2-associated regulator of Erk/MAPK1 (GAREM) is an adaptor molecule in the EGF-mediated signaling pathway. GAREM is expressed ubiquitously in human organs and cultured cells. Two GAREM homologues are encoded by the human genome. Therefore, previously identified GAREM is named GAREM1. Here we characterized a new subtype of GAREM, GAREM2, that is specifically expressed in the mouse, rat, and human brain. Three GAREM2 tyrosines (Tyr-102, Tyr-429, and Tyr-551) are phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation and are necessary for binding to Grb2. Furthermore, GAREM2 and Shp2 regulate Erk activity in EGF-stimulated cells. These characteristics are similar to those of GAREM1. GAREM2 is expressed in some neuroblastoma cell lines and is also tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound to Grb2 after treatment with EGF. Eventually, GAREM2 regulates Erk activation in the presence of EGF or insulin like growth factor 1. GAREM2 also regulates insulin-like growth factor 1-induced neuronal differentiation of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Although the structure and function of both GAREM subtypes are similar, GAREM1 is recruited into the nucleus and GAREM2 is not. Nuclear localization of GAREM1 might be controlled by a GAREM1-specific nuclear localization sequence and 14-3-3ε binding. The N-terminal 20 amino acids of GAREM1 make up its nuclear localization sequence that is also a 14-3-3ε binding site. The GAREM family is a new class of adaptor molecules with subtype-specific biological functions."

The role of PRP4 kinase in cancer is also yet to be fully elucidated. Attaining specific and potent PRP4 inhibitors would greatly facilitate the study of PRP4 biological function and its validation as a credible cancer target. In this report, we verified the requirement of enzymatic activity of PRP4 in regulating cancer cell growth and identified an array of potential novel substrates through orthogonal proteomics approaches. The ensuing effort in structural biology unveiled for the first time unique features of PRP4 kinase domain and its potential mode of interaction with a low molecular weight inhibitor. These results provide new and important information for further exploration of PRP4 kinase function in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1968943736,"Post-translational modifications are important functional determinants for intermediate filament (IF) proteins. Phosphorylation of IF proteins regulates filament organization, solubility, and cell-protective functions. Most known IF protein phosphorylation sites are serines localized in the variable ""head"" and ""tail"" domain regions. By contrast, little is known about site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation or its implications on IF protein function. We used available proteomic data from large scale studies to narrow down potential phospho-tyrosine sites on the simple epithelial IF protein keratin 8 (K8). Validation of the predicted sites using a pan-phosphotyrosine and a site-specific antibody, which we generated, revealed that the highly conserved Tyr-267 in the K8 ""rod"" domain was basally phosphorylated. The charge at this site was critically important, as demonstrated by altered filament organization of site-directed mutants, Y267F and Y267D, the latter exhibiting significantly diminished solubility. Pharmacological inhibition of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B increased K8 Tyr-267 phosphorylation, decreased solubility, and increased K8 filament bundling, whereas PTP1B overexpression had the opposite effects. Furthermore, there was significant co-localization between K8 and a ""substrate-trapping"" mutant of PTP1B (D181A). Because K8 Tyr-267 is conserved in many IFs (QYE motif), we tested the effect of the paralogous Tyr in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is mutated in Alexander disease (Y242D). Similar to K8, Y242D GFAP exhibited highly irregular filament organization and diminished solubility. Our results implicate the rod domain QYE motif tyrosine as an important determinant of IF assembly and solubility properties that can be dynamically modulated by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2014906242,"Lysine carbamylation, a post-translational modification, facilitates metal coordination for specific enzymatic activities. We have determined structures of the vertebrate dihydropyrimidinase from Tetraodon nigroviridis (TnDhp) in various states: the apoenzyme as well as two forms of the holoenzyme with one and two metals at the catalytic site. The essential active-site structural requirements have been identified for the possible existence of four metal-mediated stages of lysine carbamylation. Only one metal is sufficient for stabilizing lysine carbamylation; however, the post-translational lysine carbamylation facilitates additional metal coordination for the regulation of specific enzymatic activities through controlling the conformations of two dynamic loops, Ala(69)-Arg(74) and Met(158)-Met(165), located in the tunnel for the substrate entrance. The substrate/product tunnel is in the ""open form"" in the apo-TnDhp, in the ""intermediate state"" in the monometal TnDhp, and in the ""closed form"" in the dimetal TnDhp structure, respectively. Structural comparison also suggests that the C-terminal tail plays a role in the enzymatic function through interactions with the Ala(69)-Arg(74) dynamic loop. In addition, the structures of the dimetal TnDhp in complexes with hydantoin, N-carbamyl-β-alanine, and N-carbamyl-β-amino isobutyrate as well as apo-TnDhp in complex with a product analog, N-(2-acetamido)-iminodiacetic acid, have been determined.

The aims of this study were to investigate the roles of α1-M1 domain residues in receptor gating, etomidate modulation, and etomidate binding interactions in functional α1β2γ2L GABAA receptors in native membranes. We applied the substituted cysteine accessibility method to a series of 13 single-residue cysteine-substituted mutations in the α1-M1 domain near α1Met-236. In each mutant channel, sensitivity to GABA and etomidate and the effects and rates of pCMBS modification with and without GABA were quantified electrophysiologically. We also tested proximity to bound etomidate at each accessible cysteine by testing if etomidate blocks sulfhydryl modification. Additional biochemical studies were performed on channels harboring the α1M236C mutation. Results were compared with in silico etomidate docking calculations in a homology model of the β2-M3/α1-M1 interfacial pocket. Female Xenopus laevis were housed in a veterinary-supervised environment in accordance with local and federal guidelines. Frogs were anesthetized by immersion in 0.2% tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to minilaparotomy to harvest oocytes. R-(+)-Etomidate was obtained from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH). The clinical preparation in 35% propylene glycol was diluted directly into buffer. Propylene glycol at the resulting concentrations has no effect on GABAA receptor function (10Rüsch D. Zhong H. Forman S.A. Gating allosterism at a single class of etomidate sites on α1β2γ2L GABAA receptors accounts for both direct activation and agonist modulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20982-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Picrotoxin (PTX) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved (2 mm) in electrophysiology buffer. Alphaxalone was purchased from MP Biomedical (Solon, OH) and prepared as a stock solution in DMSO. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt (pCMBS), methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). Salts and buffers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. cDNAs for human GABAA receptor α1, β2, and γ2L subunits were cloned into pCDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen). Mutations in cDNA were created with oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange kits (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Clones from each mutagenesis reaction were subjected to DNA sequencing through the entire cDNA region to confirm the presence of the mutation and absence of stray mutations. Messenger RNA synthesis and Xenopus oocyte expression were performed as described previously (15Stewart D. Desai R. Cheng Q. Liu A. Forman S.A. Tryptophan mutations at azi-etomidate photo-incorporation sites on α1 or β2 subunits enhance GABAA receptor gating and reduce etomidate modulation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C) in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Peak current responses to varying GABA concentrations (range from 0.1 μm to 30 mm), alone or co-applied with 3.2 μm etomidate, were measured in Xenopus oocytes (n ≥ 3) using two-microelectrode voltage clamp electrophysiology, as described previously (29Rüsch D. Forman S.A. Classic benzodiazepines modulate the open-close equilibrium in α1β2γ2L γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors.Anesthesiology. 2005; 102: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GABA applications were from 5 to 20 s, depending on the time to reach steady-state peak current. Normalizing GABA responses at maximal GABA (1–30 mm) were recorded every second or third sweep. Picrotoxin-sensitive leak was measured using 2 mm PTX, followed by >5-min washout and a maximal GABA response test. Etomidate (3–10 μm) or alphaxalone (2 μm) was used as a gating enhancer together with maximal GABA to estimate GABA efficacy. Oocyte currents were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz (model OC-725B, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), digitized at 1–2 kHz (Digidata 1200, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and recorded digitally (pClamp 7, Molecular Devices). Maximally GABA-activated receptors were used for control (reference) pCMBS modification, and etomidate concentrations in protection studies were at least 2 times EC50 for direct activation (30–100 μm), establishing occupation of >90% of etomidate sites. The pCMBS concentration used for each mutant channel was chosen so that control modification was complete after 40–60 s of pCMBS exposure. Oocytes were repetitively stimulated with GABA pulses every 5 min until at least three sequential current responses were constant (±5%). For modification, oocytes were exposed to pCMBS (alone, with GABA, or with GABA plus etomidate) for 5, 10, or 20 s followed by a 5-min ND96 wash. A GABA response test, when appropriate, was repeated prior to the next pCMBS modification, and up to 15 (but usually fewer than 10) modification test cycles were repeated in each oocyte. For modification rate analysis, peak currents were normalized to a pre- or postmodification control and plotted against cumulative pCMBS exposure in units of s × mm. Normalized data were fitted to single exponential functions to determine the apparent modification rate constant in M−1 s−1. HEK293 cell maintenance and transfection for functional studies were performed as described previously (15Stewart D. Desai R. Cheng Q. Liu A. Forman S.A. Tryptophan mutations at azi-etomidate photo-incorporation sites on α1 or β2 subunits enhance GABAA receptor gating and reduce etomidate modulation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Current recordings from excised outside-out membrane patches were performed at −50 mV and room temperature (21–23 °C) as described by Scheller and Forman (30Scheller M. Forman S.A. Coupled and uncoupled gating and desensitization effects by pore domain mutations in GABAA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8411-8421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currents were stimulated using pulses of GABA delivered via a multibarrel superfusion pipette coupled to piezo-electric elements that switched solutions in under 1 ms. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz for off-line analysis. HEK293T cells at 30–40% confluence were co-transfected using CaPO4 precipitation (31Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. A new technique for the assay of infectivity of human adenovirus 5 DNA.Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6488) Google Scholar) with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant α1, β2, and γ2L. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed twice in PBS and again pelleted. The pellet was homogenized at 11,000 rpm for 30 s in PBS using an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany). The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and repelleted twice and then resuspended in PBS. Aliquots of membrane suspension were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent (MMTS or MTSEA) or with buffer as a control. For protection experiments, membranes were preincubated for 10 min with 200 μm etomidate, which remained present during MTSEA incubation. To remove sulfhydryl reagents (and etomidate), the membrane pellets (in both the MTSEA and the control groups) were resuspended with PBS buffer and repelleted four times (25,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Membrane suspensions were diluted into assay buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 135 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA; 0.5 ml final volume) with 1 nm [3H]flunitrazepam (85.2 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was measured by including 7.5 μm flurazepam. Etomidate modulation was tested at 0.1–100 μm. Multiple (n = 6) samples were suction-filtered on GF/B glass fiber filters. Filters were washed two times with 3 ml of assay buffer and transferred to scintillation vials with 2.5 ml of scintillation fluid (Ecolume, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) for counting. Analyses for agonist concentration responses, etomidate-induced left shift, and allosteric co-agonist model fitting followed our approach described elsewhere (15Stewart D. Desai R. Cheng Q. Liu A. Forman S.A. Tryptophan mutations at azi-etomidate photo-incorporation sites on α1 or β2 subunits enhance GABAA receptor gating and reduce etomidate modulation.Mol.

Peak GABA-stimulated currents were normalized to maximal GABA responses, and GABA concentration-response data for individual oocytes in the absence and presence of etomidate were fitted with logistic functions using non-linear least squares (Graphpad Prism version 5), IAgonist=Imax−Imin1+10(log(EC50)−log[Agonist])×nH+Imin(eq.1) where EC50 is the half-maximal activating concentration and nH is Hill slope. EC50 shift ratios were calculated from the difference in log(GABA EC50) values (Δlog(EC50)) measured in the presence of 3.2 μm etomidate versus control. Etomidate-dependent direct activation of receptors was analyzed similarly. PTX-sensitive leak currents (IPTX) normalized to ImaxGABA were used to estimate basal open probability (Po). GABA efficacy was estimated based on enhancement of maximal GABA responses by etomidate or alphaxalone (32Desai R. Ruesch D. Forman S.A. γ-amino butyric acid type A receptor mutations at β2N265 alter etomidate efficacy while preserving basal and agonist-dependent activity.Anesthesiology. 2009; 111: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Estimated Po was calculated using average IPTX/ImaxGABA and IGABA+Enhancer/ImaxGABA values.

Po=11+L0(1+[GABA]/KG1+[GABA]/cKG)2(1+[ETO]/KE1+[ETO]/dKE)2(eq.3) L0 in Equation 3 is a dimensionless basal equilibrium gating variable, approximately Po−1. KG and KE are equilibrium dissociation constants for GABA and etomidate binding to inactive receptors, and c and d are dimensionless parameters representing the respective ratios of dissociation constants in open versus inactive receptors. The agonist efficacies of GABA and etomidate are inversely related to c2 and d2, respectively. Analysis of patch macrocurrents for activation, desensitization, and deactivation kinetics was performed as described previously (32Desai R. Ruesch D. Forman S.A. γ-amino butyric acid type A receptor mutations at β2N265 alter etomidate efficacy while preserving basal and agonist-dependent activity.Anesthesiology. 2009; 111: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using non-linear least squares fits to Equation 4 and F-tests at p = 0.99 (Clampfit version 8.0, Molecular Devices) to choose the best number of exponents. I(t)=A1×exp(−t/τ1)+A2×exp(−t/τ2) +A3×exp(−t/τ3)+C(eq.4) All activation traces were best fit with a single exponent, whereas desensitization and deactivation were consistently fitted with two exponents. A model of the α1β3γ2 GABAA receptor was constructed using the structure of the pentameric ion channel homolog GLIC from Protein Data Bank entry 3P50 as described (33Chiara D.C. Jayakar S.S. Zhou X. Zhang X. Savechenkov P.Y. Bruzik K.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B.

No substitutions were near the etomidate binding sites. The model was placed within a simulated membrane force field and minimized with the photoreactive etomidate analog azietomidate placed in the etomidate binding interfaces, consistent with photolabeling results (13Li G.D.

https://openalex.org/W2071649098,"Fatty alcohols play a variety of biological roles in all kingdoms of life. Fatty acyl reductase (FAR) enzymes catalyze the reduction of fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) or fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein substrates to primary fatty alcohols. FAR enzymes have distinct substrate specificities with regard to chain length and degree of saturation. FAR5 (At3g44550) and FAR8 (At3g44560) from Arabidopsis thaliana are 85% identical at the amino acid level and are of equal length, but they possess distinct specificities for 18:0 or 16:0 acyl chain length, respectively. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a heterologous expression system to assess FAR substrate specificity determinants. We identified individual amino acids that affect protein levels or 16:0-CoA versus 18:0-CoA specificity by expressing in yeast FAR5 and FAR8 domain-swap chimeras and site-specific mutants. We found that a threonine at position 347 and a serine at position 363 were important for high FAR5 and FAR8 protein accumulation in yeast and thus are likely important for protein folding and stability. Amino acids at positions 355 and 377 were important for dictating 16:0-CoA versus 18:0-CoA chain length specificity. Simultaneously converting alanine 355 and valine 377 of FAR5 to the corresponding FAR8 residues, leucine and methionine, respectively, almost fully converted FAR5 specificity from 18:0-CoA to 16:0-CoA. The reciprocal amino acid conversions, L355A and M377V, made in the active FAR8-S363P mutant background converted its specificity from 16:0-CoA to 18:0-CoA. This study is an important advancement in the engineering of highly active FAR proteins with desired specificities for the production of fatty alcohols with industrial value."

With this perspective, we were especially interested in the idea that, in addition to protein secretion, the exosome-driven intercellular transmission of AARS mRNAs is a genetic communication that brings new functions to the targeted recipient. In addition, we were interested in finding at least one AARS mRNA variant that encoded a novel appended domain, but had ablated at least part of the core enzyme needed for catalysis. We infer that such a variant would have to be redirected to an alternative function. In this connection, a splice variant of human GlnRS was reported to be associated with some cancers (18.Lukk M.

Thus, we were also motivated to search in exosomes for mRNA encoding GlnRSΔiABD and, if successful, to see whether its appearance could be regulated. Jurkat T cells were grown and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. Human CD3ϵ monoclonal antibody (clone UCHT1) was obtained from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). For activation, culture flasks were coated with 1 μg/ml CD3ϵ antibody in PBS or PBS alone at 37 °C overnight. The flasks were washed once with PBS before use. Jurkat cells suspended in culture medium, which consisted of exosome-free medium cleaned by overnight centrifugation at 100,000 × g (Hitachi CP100, Hitachinaka, Ibaraki, Japan), were added to the CD3ϵ antibody-coated flask for activation or to a PBS-coated flask as a control. After incubation for 6 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. Exosomes were purified from the collected medium by differential centrifugation as described previously (21.Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.in: Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006Google Scholar). Briefly, medium was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C followed by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. Exosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with PBS and then resuspended in PBS. The protein content in the purified exosomes was quantified by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The cellular or exosomal RNA was isolated by the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells or exosomes were lysed in the RLT buffer and added with 3.5 volumes of 100% ethanol before passing through the RNeasy mini spin column. The subsequent steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed by TURBO DNase (Invitrogen). To confirm that the extracted RNA was from inside the exosomes, Jurkat exosomes were pretreated with 0.1 μg/μl RNase A (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, RNase A was inactivated by 0.4 μg/μl proteinase K (Bioline, London, UK) for 20 min at 37 °C before RNA purification. As a control for RNase activity, 5 μg of cellular RNA were included. Polyribosomal mRNA was isolated from Jurkat T cells according to the protocol described by del Prete et al. (22.del Prete M.J. Vernal R. Dolznig H. Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Isolation of polysome-bound mRNA from solid tissues amenable for RT-PCR and profiling experiments.RNA. 2007; 13: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were firstly lysed in RLN lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to which was added 0.5% IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 mm dithiothreitol, 500 units/ml RNase inhibitor (ABI Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, 650 μg/ml heparin, and 10 mm proteinase inhibitor. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was layered onto a linear sucrose gradient (10–40% sucrose (w/v) supplemented with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5 mg/ml heparin) and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm (Hitachi CP100) for 6 h at 4 °C. Fourteen fractions (500 μl) were collected. For each fraction, absorbance at 260 nm was determined and plotted. To remove heparin, RNAs in these fractions were then precipitated with 2 m lithium chloride at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the RNA pellet was washed twice with 70% ice-cold ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in RNase-free water. Proteins were separated from RNAs using the RNeasy kit. All human tissue poly(A)+ RNAs were obtained from Clontech (catalog numbers: 636102, 636106,636170, 636591, 636128, 636105, 636113, 636119, 636121, 636101, 636118, 636146, 636125, 636162, and 636120). Total RNA of human Jurkat T, Raji B, THP-1, IMR-32, MCF-7, or MDA-MB-231 cells was extracted with the PureLinkTM RNA mini kit (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from RNA samples using a SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer. The PCR reactions were performed using the SYBR Green master mix (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and with the optimized primer pairs (supplemental Table 1) on a ViiATM 7 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies). The thermal cycling steps were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and then 45 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The data were analyzed using the ViiATM 7 RUO software (Life Technologies). For tissue distribution analysis, mRNA expression of QRS1 or GlnRSΔiABD was normalized to two housekeeping genes, RPL9 and RPS11. For analysis of RNA levels in exosomes, U6 snRNA was employed for normalization (17.Zhu H. Fan G.C. Extracellular/circulating microRNAs and their potential role in cardiovascular disease.Am. J. Cardiovasc. Dis. 2011; 1: 138-149PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the copy numbers of QRS1 and GlnRSΔiABD mRNAs in the samples, the standard curve method was employed. Briefly, cDNAs encoding QRS1 or GlnRSΔiABD were cloned into a pET21a vector and confirmed by sequencing. The constructs were quantified with NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific). The standard curves were constructed using 10, 50, 102, 103, 104, and 105 copies of QRS1 or GlnRSΔiABD as the templates in qPCR reactions, which were run in parallel with the samples. (Copy numbers were calculated using the URI Genomics and Sequencing Center dsDNA copy number calculator.) The standard curves were plotted as cycle threshold (Ct) values versus the logarithm of copy number. The copy number of QRS1 or of GlnRSΔiABD mRNAs in the samples was extrapolated from the standard curve. Total proteins were extracted from Jurkat cells with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA. To release exosomal proteins, exosomes were mixed with 1:1 2× SDS loading buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were separately stained with a monoclonal antibody targeted to TSG101 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) a polyclonal antibody to Bip (Abcam), or a polyclonal antibody to Alix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The cDNA encoding GlnRSΔiABD was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector and confirmed by sequencing. The TnT® T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The empty vector pcDNA3.1 was included as a negative control. After the reaction, 1% of product was subjected to Western blot analysis with a mouse anti-QRS1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam). As part of our ongoing investigations of novel functions of tRNA synthetases, we chose Jurkat cells in part because they can be studied in both a quiescent and an activated (by CD3 stimulation) state. Following standard protocols with differential centrifugation methods, about 20 μg of exosomes were purified from 100 ml of culture medium of 108 Jurkat cells. For evaluation of the purity, a sample of the exosomes was subjected to Western blot analysis to detect components known to be markers for exosomes. We also tested for contamination from the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1). This analysis showed clearly the presence of exosomal markers TSG101 (Fig. 1A) and Alix (Fig. 1B) and the absence of the Bip marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1C) (21.Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.in: Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M.

Let-7 microRNA family is selectively secreted into the extracellular environment via exosomes in a metastatic gastric cancer cell line.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). To start our search for mRNAs encoding for AARSs in exosomes from Jurkat cells, we first investigated exosomal RNA from Jurkat cells. In contrast to added cellular RNA, which was degraded by RNase, there was no difference between control and RNase-treated exosomes (Fig. 1D), suggesting that exosomal RNA was protected within the exosomes. Then, we used qRT-PCR to annotate the number of cycles above the background threshold (Ct) that is needed to detect a specific mRNA. U6 snRNA, an RNA commonly found in exosomes, was used as a positive marker and was easily detected. As expected, expression of U6 snRNA in the cellular RNA was relatively stable upon activation (Ct for quiescent = 26.7 ± 0.1 versus 26.2 ± 0.2 for activated) and in exosomal RNA (Ct for quiescent 24.6 ± 0.1 versus 23.8 ± 0.2 in activated) (Fig. 1E). To search for a negative control, we also checked the expression levels of six other housekeeping genes (Fig. 1E). Importantly, of these six genes, β-2 microglobulin (B2M) had a similar level of expression as U6 snRNA inside the cell. In contrast, B2M mRNA was not detected in the exosomes. Thus, exosomal RNAs appear not to be contaminated by cellular RNAs. We also investigated the expression level of IL-2 mRNA in quiescent and activated Jurkat cells and in exosomes. As expected (24.Ledbetter J.A. Gentry L.E. June C.H. Rabinovitch P.S. Purchio A.F. Stimulation of T cells through the CD3/T-cell receptor complex: role of cytoplasmic calcium, protein kinase C translocation, and phosphorylation of pp60c-src in the activation pathway.Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), IL-2 mRNA was up-regulated after activation (Ct value changed from 39.3 ± 0.4 to 34.2 ± 0.8). In contrast, after 45 cycles of qPCR, IL-2 mRNA was not detected in exosomal RNA samples from either quiescent or activated Jurkat cells (Fig. 1E). Next, we investigated the presence of mRNAs encoding 15 different cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases. These included mRNAs for alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS, ARS1), ArgRS (RRS1), AsnRS (NRS1), AspRS (DRS1), CysRS (CRS1), GlnRS (QRS1), Glu-ProRS (EPRS), GlyRS (GRS1), HisRS (HRS1), IleRS (IRS1), MetRS (MRS1), SerRS (SRS1), ThrRS (TRS1), ValRS (VRS1), and TyrRS (YRS1). (The mRNAs encoding cytoplasmic histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HRS1), cytoplasmic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS1), and mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (NRS2) were annotated in exosomes extruded from two mast cell lines (MC/9 and HMC-1) (14.Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8867) Google Scholar, 25.Mathivanan S. Simpson R.J. ExoCarta: A compendium of exosomal proteins and RNA.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 4997-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Our work also showed the presence of HRS1 in exosomes from Jurkat cells.) The primers used for this analysis are listed in supplemental Table 1. (The average length of the coding sequences for 15 AARS genes was around 2400 bp. The average distance between two pairs of primers for each AARS mRNA was 1050 bp.) To assure and validate that we covered a large portion of the mRNA, these primers were designed to detect exon junctions at two well separated regions of the mRNAs. In most cases, two pairs of primers were used for confirmation. Because in this and other work (20.Xu Z. Wei Z. Zhou J.J. Ye F. Lo W.S. Wang F. Lau C.F. Wu J. Nangle L.A. Chiang K.P. Yang X.L. Zhang M. Schimmel P. Internally deleted human tRNA synthetase suggests evolutionary pressure for repurposing.Structure. 2012; 20: 1470-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) we found that the abundance of splice variants (such as those that might contain an internal deletion) was less than 1% of that of the full-length mRNAs, the primers essentially yield Ct values that monitor the amount of the full mRNA. The mRNAs for all 15 cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases were found in both whole cell lysates and exosomal fractions. The Ct values for the whole cells lysates were in the range of Ct = 23.1–29.4. For the exosomes, the Ct values ranged from 29.9 to 40.9. Thus, Ct values for the exosomal mRNAs for the cytoplasmic AARSs suggest a level that is about 1% or less of that found in whole cells (23.1 versus 29.9, for example, is a difference of 26.8 = 111.4 (Fig. 1F)). The data were further analyzed, with normalization to control cellular or exosomal RNA, to evaluate regulation upon Jurkat cell activation. For either cellular or exosomal RNAs, expression levels of 15 cytoplasmic AARS genes were not altered (after activation) in a statistically significant way as compared with the controls (Fig. 1G). As mentioned in a recent publication on HisRSΔCD (20.Xu Z. Wei Z. Zhou J.J. Ye F. Lo W.S. Wang F. Lau C.F. Wu J. Nangle L.A. Chiang K.P. Yang X.L. Zhang M. Schimmel P. Internally deleted human tRNA synthetase suggests evolutionary pressure for repurposing.Structure. 2012; 20: 1470-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), an amplification-based transcriptome sequencing method was developed for the discovery of splicing variants of mRNAs for AARSs. Because of a prior study indicating an association of a specific splice variant (designated as GlnRSΔiABD) of GlnRS mRNA with cancer (19.Griffith M. Griffith O.L. Mwenifumbo J. Goya R. Morrissy A.S. Morin R.D. Corbett R. Tang M.J. Hou Y.C. Pugh T.J. Robertson G. Chittaranjan S. Ally A. Asano J.K. Chan S.Y. Li H.I. McDonald H. Teague K. Zhao Y. Zeng T. Delaney A. Hirst M. Morin G.B. Jones S.J. Tai I.T. Marra M.A. Alternative expression analysis by RNA sequencing.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), first reported in a prostate cancer cell line, we were particularly interested in screening for the presence of this variant (Fig. 2). The splice variant mRNA skips exon 23 and results in deletion of a region encoding a 42-amino acid segment in the ABD that is needed for recognition of the anticodon of tRNAGln (26.Perona J.J. Rould M.A. Steitz T.A. Structural basis for transfer RNA aminoacylation by Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8758-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Based on the location of the exon-skipping event, we designed a pair of GlnRSΔiABD mRNA-specific primers that do not amplify mRNA for QRS1 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, GlnRSΔiABD was found in the exosomal RNA of both quiescent and activated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, two splicing variants of SerRS expressed in the cell were not detected in the exosomal RNA (Fig. 2D). To support the conclusion that the exosomal RNA preparation was not contaminated by cellular RNA, we reconfirmed the presence of U6 snRNA and absence of mRNA encoding B2M and IL-2. A qRT-PCR analysis was used to determine the levels of the transcripts for QRS1 and GlnRSΔiABD. The levels of mRNAs for QRS1 and GlnRSΔiABD were not significantly changed after activation of Jurkat cells (copy number = 6170.8 ± 1672.9 and 8124.6 ± 2167.9 and copy number = 1256.1 ± 462.0 and 1898.9 ± 314.2, respectively, for mRNAs of QRS1 and GlnRSΔiABD). In contrast, transcripts for GlnRSΔiABD were most clearly enhanced in the exosomes from activated Jurkat cells (copy number = 120.2 ± 21.7 versus 249.7 ± 69.1 (p = 0.1, quiescent versus activated) for QRS and copy number = 27.3 ± 6.6 versus 82.0 ± 12.6 for GlnRSΔiABD (p = 0.009) (Fig. 2E)). These results prompted us to investigate the expression of mRNA for GlnRSΔiABD in additional cell types. Across 15 tissues and seven cell lines, expression levels of mRNAs for QRS1 were not significantly different. In contrast, for the mRNA for GlnRSΔiABD, the expression level in Jurkat T, THP-1 monocyte, macrophage, and MDA-MB-231 cells stood out from the panel of the others (>3 median) (Fig. 2F). The expression level of GlnRSΔiABD mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the more advanced and invasive MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with MCF-7 cells. We next investigated the potential for translation of the GlnRSΔiABD mRNA. First, we used specific PCR primers to identify the mRNA for endogenous GlnRSΔiABD in polyribosomal RNA. Using sucrose gradient centrifugation to separate polyribosomes, we were able by RT-PCR to identify the GlnRSΔiABD mRNA in the polyribosome but not free RNA fractions, which was similar to the result with QRS1 mRNA (Fig. 2G). We then constructed a recombinant cDNA gene for the GlnRSΔiABD mRNA detected in exosomes. The idea was to test whether the mRNA could be translated into a stable protein. First, we used the rabbit reticulocyte-coupled transcription-translation system (27.Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. An efficient mRNA-dependent translation system from reticulocyte lysates.Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar, 28.King R.W. Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Expression cloning in the test tube.Science. 1997; 277: 973-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2H, a protein product of the expected size for GlnRSΔiABD was easily detected. This result showed that exosomal mRNA for GlnRSΔiABD is active for translation. It also demonstrated that the GlnRSΔiABD-encoded protein is internally deleted in a way that allows it to fold into a stable structure. Next, we transfected HEK 293T cells with the vector encoding the GlnRSΔiABD gene. Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blot methods. As shown in Fig. 2I, proteins corresponding in size to endogenous QRS1 and GlnRSΔiABD were easily detected. These results further support the conclusion that the exosomal mRNA sequences for tRNA synthetases and their splice variants are functional in protein synthesis. Given the expansion of tRNA synthetase functions into areas of biology beyond translation, the question of whether exosome-mediated export of their mRNAs could play a role in the distribution of synthetase-derived information was of some interest. Genetic material consisting of mRNA was first identified in exosomes extruded from two human mast cell lines (MC/9 and HMC-1) (14.Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8867) Google Scholar). Significantly, the exosome mRNA from these mast cell lines was functional in both in vitro and in vivo translation assays (14.Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8867) Google Scholar). Although several components of the translational apparatus, such as ribosomal proteins and elongation factors, were also found in the exosomes (29.Mathivanan S. Ji H. Simpson R.J. Exosomes: extracellular organelles important in intercellular communication.J. Proteomics. 2010; 73: 1907-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), no evidence supported the presence of rRNAs (14.Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8867) Google Scholar). The absence of rRNAs suggests that translation is not actively taking place in exosomes. Thus, although tRNA synthetases are essential components of the translation apparatus, the capture of their mRNAs is not for translation nor to implement translation in exosomes. In that connection, several recent studies document a regulatory role for specific mRNAs, which is distinct from a role in translation (30.Leygue E. Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA1): unusual bifaceted gene products with suspected relevance to breast cancer.Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2007; 5: e006Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31.Wadler C.S. Vanderpool C.K.

The presence of mRNAs for specific proteins in exosomes and the discovery of microRNAs in exosomes have enlarged the perspective for how RNAs can play a role in genetic exchange between cells. In that connection, recent work by Montecalvo et al. (33.Montecalvo A. Larregina A.T. Shufesky W.J. Stolz D.B. Sullivan M.L. Karlsson J.M. Baty C.J. Gibson G.A. Erdos G. Wang Z. Milosevic J.

Mechanism of transfer of functional microRNAs between mouse dendritic cells via exosomes.Blood. 2012; 119: 756-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) has reinforced the concept of the functional significance of exosome-based export of RNAs. Our work shows that most, if not all, mRNAs encoding human cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases, and the mRNA for a specific splice variant, are captured by exosomes. Interestingly, the absence of detectable mRNA in exosomes for B2M and IL-2 (even when expression of IL-2 was up-regulated (Fig. 1E)) highlights a mechanism for mRNA selection that is yet to be understood. However, the observation that the relative abundance of the exosomal GlnRSΔiABD mRNA splice variant was regulated by an external stimulus (for activating Jurkat cells (Fig. 2E)) shows that the selection mechanism is sensitive to specific exogenous signals. In addition, the abundance of the GlnRSΔiABD mRNA variant was tissue-specific (Fig. 2F), suggesting that parameters determining cell type also play a role in mRNA selection. Thus, exosomes provide a versatile format for selection and distribution of tRNA synthetase-derived genetic information. Also, the observation that an mRNA encoding a catalytically impaired splice variant is packaged by exosomes further highlights the potential for the broad reach of alternative noncatalytic forms of tRNA synthetases into areas of biology that are outside of translation.

https://openalex.org/W2005818521,"SNX26, a brain-enriched RhoGAP, plays a key role in dendritic arborization during early neuronal development in the neocortex. In mature neurons, it is localized to dendritic spines, but little is known about its role in later stages of development. Our results show that SNX26 interacts with PSD-95 in dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons, and as a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42, it decreased the F-actin content in COS-7 cells and in dendritic spines of neurons. Overexpression of SNX26 resulted in a GTPase-activating protein activity-dependent decrease in total protrusions and spine density together with dramatic inhibition of filopodia-to-spine transformations. Such effects of SNX26 were largely rescued by a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42. Consistently, an shRNA-mediated knockdown of SNX26 significantly increased total protrusions and spine density, resulting in an increase in thin or stubby type spines at the expense of the mushroom spine type. Moreover, endogenous expression of SNX26 was shown to be bi-directionally modulated by neuronal activity. Therefore, we propose that in addition to its key role in neuronal development, SNX26 also has a role in the activity-dependent structural change of dendritic spines in mature neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2074143935,"Homologous recombination (HR) is a key process in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) that can initiate cancer or cell death. Human Bloom's syndrome RecQ-family DNA helicase (BLM) exerts complex activities to promote DSB repair while avoiding illegitimate HR. The oligomeric assembly state of BLM has been a key unresolved aspect of its activities. In this study we assessed the structure and oligomeric state of BLM, in the absence and presence of key HR-intermediate DNA structures, by using single-molecule visualization (electron microscopic and atomic force microscopic single-particle analysis) and solution biophysical (dynamic light scattering, kinetic and equilibrium binding) techniques. Besides full-length BLM, we used a previously characterized truncated construct (BLM(642-1290)) as a monomeric control. Contrary to previous models proposing a ring-forming oligomer, we found the majority of BLM molecules to be monomeric in all examined conditions. However, BLM showed a tendency to form dimers when bound to branched HR intermediates. Our results suggest that HR activities requiring single-stranded DNA translocation are performed by monomeric BLM, while complex DNA structures encountered and dissolved by BLM in later stages of HR induce partial oligomerization of the helicase."
https://openalex.org/W1987650272,"Oxidative stress can lead to T cell hyporesponsiveness. A reducing micromilieu (e.g. provided by dendritic cells) can rescue T cells from such oxidant-induced dysfunction. However, the reducing effects on proteins leading to restored T cell activation remained unknown. One key molecule of T cell activation is the actin-remodeling protein cofilin, which is dephosphorylated on serine 3 upon T cell costimulation and has an essential role in formation of mature immune synapses between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Cofilin is spatiotemporally regulated; at the plasma membrane, it can be inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Here, we show by NMR spectroscopy that a reducing milieu led to structural changes in the cofilin molecule predominantly located on the protein surface. They overlapped with the PIP2- but not actin-binding sites. Accordingly, reduction of cofilin had no effect on F-actin binding and depolymerization and did not influence the cofilin phosphorylation state. However, it did prevent inhibition of cofilin activity through PIP2. Therefore, a reducing milieu may generate an additional pool of active cofilin at the plasma membrane. Consistently, in-flow microscopy revealed increased actin dynamics in the immune synapse of untransformed human T cells under reducing conditions. Altogether, we introduce a novel mechanism of redox regulation: reduction of the actin-remodeling protein cofilin renders it insensitive to PIP2 inhibition, resulting in enhanced actin dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2057981216,"Myopodin is an actin-binding protein that promotes cancer cell migration in response to serum stimulation and is associated with invasive tumor development. To determine whether enhanced migration reflects changes in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to examine the composition and morphology of filamentous actin structures in mock-transduced cells vs. stably transduced PC3 cells expressing human myopodin isoforms, and the chemokinetic response of cells was quantified using transwell assays. The same approaches were used to analyze the effects of external migration stimuli, actin polymerization inhibitors or deletion of the isoform-specific amino- and/or carboxy termini on cell migration and actin bundle formation. Results indicate that the termini of the myopodin isoforms differentially alter the formation of morphologically distinct F-actin networks that also differ in their myosin and myopodin staining patterns. Furthermore, enhanced cell migration was reduced by > 50% when actin bundle formation was impaired by myopodin-truncation, low concentrations of an actin polymerization inhibitor, or in the absence of an external migration stimulus. Human myopodin isoforms are therefore potent regulators of stress fiber formation, inducing the formation of biochemically and morphologically distinct F-actin networks in the cell body whose presence directly correlates with increased cell migration.—Kai, F., Duncan, R., Prostate cancer cell migration induced by myopodin isoforms is associated with formation of morphologically and biochemically distinct actin networks.

https://openalex.org/W2062800616,"In vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIδ2 (CaMKIIδ2) activates non-receptor tyrosine kinases and EGF receptor, with a Src family kinase as a required intermediate. siRNA-mediated suppression of Fyn, a Src family kinase, inhibited VSM cell motility. Simultaneous suppression of both Fyn and CaMKIIδ2 was non-additive, suggesting coordinated regulation of cell motility. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that CaMKIIδ2 and Fyn selectively (compared with Src) co-localized with the Golgi in quiescent cultured VSM cells. Stimulation with PDGF resulted in a rapid (<5 min) partial redistribution and co-localization of both kinases in peripheral membrane regions. Furthermore, CaMKIIδ2 and Fyn selectively (compared with Src) co-immunoprecipitated, suggesting a physical interaction in a signaling complex. Stimulation of VSM cells with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, resulted in activation of CaMKIIδ2 and Fyn and disruption of the complex. Pretreatment with KN-93, a pharmacological inhibitor of CaMKII, prevented activation-dependent disruption of CaMKIIδ2 and Fyn, implicating CaMKIIδ2 as an upstream mediator of Fyn. Overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII resulted in the dephosphorylation of Fyn at Tyr-527, which is required for Fyn activation. Taken together, these data demonstrate a dynamic interaction between CaMKIIδ2 and Fyn in VSM cells and indicate a mechanism by which CaMKIIδ2 and Fyn may coordinately regulate VSM cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W1993303177,"In the 1960s, I developed methods for directly visualizing DNA and DNA-protein complexes using an electron microscope. This made it possible to examine the shape of DNA and to visualize proteins as they fold and loop DNA. Early applications included the first visualization of true nucleosomes and linkers and the demonstration that repeating tracts of adenines can cause a curvature in DNA. The binding of DNA repair proteins, including p53 and BRCA2, has been visualized at three- and four-way junctions in DNA. The trombone model of DNA replication was directly verified, and the looping of DNA at telomeres was discovered."
