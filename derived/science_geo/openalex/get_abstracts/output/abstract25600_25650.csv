https://openalex.org/W1564232667,"We have obtained the complete coding sequence of the large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of human cartilage (aggrecan) from a combination of cDNA and genomic exon sequencing. We screened a human costal chondrocyte cDNA library, using rat aggrecan cDNA probes, and obtained three nonoverlapping clones totaling 6.2 kilobases in length. These clones were sequenced, and the sequence of the gaps between clones was obtained from genomic exon fragments and polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA. The composite sequence is 7137 nucleotides long, encoding 2316 amino acids. The human and rat aggrecan amino acid sequences are about 75% identical, with domains ranging from 100% to about 60% of conserved amino acids. The human sequence contains two regions of highly conserved repeats not found in rat aggrecan: 11 repeats of a hexameric sequence in the keratan sulfate attachment domain, E-E-P-(S,F)-P-S; and a 19-amino acid sequence reiterated 19 times, in the CS-1 portion of the serine-glycine-containing region. There are at least three forms of aggrecan transcripts, generated by alternative exon usage, and the form reported here is the shortest and also the most prevalent, lacking both the epidermal growth factor-like domain, and the complement regulatory protein-like sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1588317987,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase accelerates otherwise slow, rate-limiting isomerization steps during folding of proteins in vitro, but is not yet securely identified with any specific physiologic role. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase and the cyclosporin A (CsA)-binding protein cyclophilin are identical, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug CsA in vitro. To establish a possible physiologic role of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase, we have studied the folding of procollagen I in suspended chick embryo tendon fibroblasts. Folding of procollagen I is slowed by CsA: the time needed for 50% of the molecules to reach a completely helical confirmation is 8.5 min in the absence and 13.5 min in the presence of 5 microM CsA; and the calculated products, k x K, of the rate constant (k) and the equilibrium constant (K) of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization are 2.10 and 1.30 s-1, respectively. In contrast, folding of purified collagen III in vitro is unaffected by CsA. In cultured human fibroblasts, CsA caused posttranslational overmodification (hydroxylation of lysine 32.1 versus 22.1%) and increased intracellular degradation (18.7 versus 12.5%), and hence decreased production (10.2 versus 13.2% of total protein synthesis) of collagens I and III, indicating that procollagen folding is slowed by CsA also in human fibroblasts. We conclude that peptidyl-prolyl cis-transisomerase (and hence cyclophilin) accelerates protein folding in living cells. Furthermore, the CsA-induced changes in collagen metabolism are reminiscent of those observed in several variants of osteogenesis imperfecta caused by structural abnormalities in the pro-collagen chains which impair helix formation."

https://openalex.org/W1574288427,"The deduced amino acid sequence of the cardiac sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger has a region which could represent a calmodulin binding site. As calmodulin binding regions of proteins often have an autoinhibitory role, a synthetic peptide with this sequence was tested for functional effects on Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity. The peptide inhibits the Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake (KI approximately 1.5 microM) and the Nao(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux of sarcolemmal vesicles in a noncompetitive manner with respect to both Na+ and Ca2+. The peptide is also a potent inhibitor (KI approximately 0.1 microM) of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange current of excised sarcolemmal patches. The binding site for the peptide on the exchanger is on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. The exchanger inhibitory peptide binds calmodulin with a moderately high affinity. From the characteristics of the inhibition of the exchange of sarcolemmal vesicles, we deduce that only inside-out sarcolemmal vesicles participate in the usual Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange assay. This contrasts with the common assumption that both inside-out and right-side-out vesicles exhibit exchange activity."
https://openalex.org/W1487722493,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, recessive mutations at the OPI1 locus result in constitutively derepressed expression of inositol 1-phosphate synthase, the product of the INO1 gene. Many of the other enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis are also expressed at high derepressed levels in opi1 mutants. Thus, the OPI1 gene is believed to encode a negative regulator that is required to repress a whole subset of structural genes encoding for phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes. In this study, the OPI1 gene was mapped to chromosome VIII and cloned. When transformed into an opi1 mutant, the cloned DNA was capable of complementing the mutant phenotype and restoring correct regulation to the INO1 structural gene. Construction of two opi1 disruption alleles and subsequent genetic analysis of strains bearing these alleles confirmed that the cloned DNA was homologous to the genomic OPI1 locus. Furthermore, the OPI1 gene was found to be nonessential to the organism since mutants bearing the null allele were viable and exhibited a phenotype similar to that of previously isolated opi1 mutants. Similar to other opi1 mutants, the opi1 disruption mutants accumulated INO1 mRNA constitutively to a level 2-3-fold higher than that observed in wild-type cells. The cloned OPI1 gene was sequenced, and translation of the open reading frame predicted a protein composed of 404 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 40,036. The predicted Opi1 protein contained a well defined heptad repeat of leucine residues that has been observed in other regulatory proteins. In addition, the predicted protein contained polyglutamine residue stretches which have also been reported in yeast genes having regulatory functions. Sequencing of opi1 mutant alleles, isolated after chemical mutagenesis, revealed that several were the result of a chain termination mutation located within the largest polyglutamine residue stretch."
https://openalex.org/W1575798933,"Starch gel electrophoresis of homogenates from human stomach mucosa resolves three alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) forms: the anodic chi-ADH (class III), the cathodic gamma-ADH (class I), and a new form of slow cathodic mobility that has not been previously characterized. In this work, we describe the purification in three chromatographic steps and the physical and kinetic characterization of this new human alcohol dehydrogenase, which we have named sigma-ADH. The enzyme exhibits the general physicochemical features (Mr, zinc content, subunit Mr, cofactor preference) of all mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. The kinetic studies show a high Km value (41 mM) and a high kcat value (280 min-1) for ethanol at pH 7.5. The Km decreases as the alcohol increases its chain length. The aldehydes are better substrates than the corresponding alcohols, with m-nitrobenzaldehyde being the best substrate examined. sigma-ADH is strongly inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole, but with a Ki (10 microM) still higher than that for a class I isoenzyme. These properties suggest that sigma-ADH is a class II isoenzyme, different from pi-ADH and similar to that previously described by us in rat stomach. At the high ethanol concentrations in stomach after drinking, sigma-ADH is probably the ADH form with the largest contribution to human gastric ethanol metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1520890133,"Regulation of plasminogen activation by plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is a critical feature of many biological processes. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces PAI-1 mRNA and protein in several types of cultured cells, including Hep G2 cells. The present study was performed to define mechanisms by which PAI-1 gene expression is regulated by TGF-beta. Nuclear run-on assays performed on Hep G2 cells stimulated with TGF-beta for 6 h showed a 3.8-fold increase in PAI-1 gene transcription. TGF-beta increased the half-life of PAI-1 mRNA in Hep G2 cells 2.5-fold over control values. To characterize transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, we constructed chimeric genes containing PAI-1 5'-flanking DNA fused upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in the vector pSVOCAT and transfected Hep G2 cells. Promoter deletion analysis demonstrated that sequences between -791 and -328 and -328 to -186 base pairs upstream of the PAI-1 gene cap site contain TGF-beta responsive elements that conferred TGF-beta inducibility in an orientation and position-independent manner. Further characterization of the larger TGF-beta-inducible enhancer (-791 to -328) located a TGF-beta-inducible element at nucleotides -791 to -546 upstream of the PAI-1 gene cap site. These results demonstrate that PAI-1 gene regulation by TGF-beta in Hep G2 cells is mediated both at a transcriptional level by two specific inducible elements, as well as by post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1640153047,"Uncleaved signal-anchor sequences of membrane proteins inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum initiate the translocation of either the amino-terminal or the carboxyl-terminal polypeptide segment across the bilayer. Which topology is acquired is not determined by the apolar segment of the signal but rather by the hydrophilic sequences flanking it. To study the role of charged residues in determining the membrane topology, the insertion of mutants of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1, a single-spanning protein with a cytoplasmic amino terminus, was analyzed in transfected COS-7 cells. When the charged amino acids flanking the hydrophobic signal were mutated to residues of opposite charge, half the polypeptides inserted with the inverted orientation. When, in addition, the amino-terminal domain of the mutant protein was truncated, approximately 90% of the polypeptides acquired the inverted topology. The transmembrane orientation appears to be primarily determined by the charges flanking the signal sequence but is modulated by the domains to be translocated."
https://openalex.org/W1511532334,"We previously showed that the 5'-flanking region of the malic enzyme (ME) gene contains a cis-regulatory element (-281 to -261) that binds thyroid hormone receptors and confers triiodothyronine (T3) inducibility of transcription to the ME promoter (Petty, K.J., Desvergne, B., Mitsuhashi, T., and Nikodem, V. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7395-7400). In this report, we have used deletion and mutation analyses of the ME thyroid hormone response element (TRE) to evaluate the roles of several subregions of TRE in T3 binding and transactivation. ME TRE was shown to act as an enhancer conferring T3 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter thymidine kinase. Although T3 treatment induced the promoter activity, the absence of hormone resulted in repression as measured by the level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in the NIH 3T3 transient expression system in the presence of overexpressed receptor. The degree of repression was similar to the degree of T3 induction observed for the same TRE mutants. Mutation and deletion analyses indicated that the functional TRE is comprised of discrete regions that are not contiguous, with a dominant role of a cluster of G residues and an AGGACA sequence. Both functions, induction and repression of transcription, correlated with receptor binding to the ME TRE as determined by competition binding assays using wild type and mutated TRE as competitors."
https://openalex.org/W1542738455,"Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (Spd/Spm acetyltransferase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of polyamines. This enzyme is highly inducible by several stimuli, including the natural polyamines and their structural analogues. To investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the control of this enzyme a cDNA which codes for an active human Spd/Spm acetyltransferase has been isolated from a random primed cDNA library constructed from mRNA of a polyamine analogue treated large cell lung carcinoma line, NCI H157. The 972-base pair cDNA was identified using a 32-fold degenerate, 20-base oligomer probe to a 7-amino acid polypeptide sequence derived from the purified protein. The cDNA has a 513-base open reading frame that codes for a protein of 171 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 20,023. In vitro translation studies demonstrated the protein product of this cDNA to be a biologically active enzyme. The cDNA recognizes a 1.5-kilobase transcript in human cells which is highly induced in the human large cell lung carcinoma NCI H157 line following treatment with the polyamine analogue. The unusually high expression of Spd/Spm acetyltransferase mRNA by the NCI H157 cells in response to treatment does not appear to be a result of an amplification of the Spd/Spm acetyltransferase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1563672361,"A 2.7-kilobase fragment of DNA from Oerskovia xanthineolytica containing the gene for a beta-1,3-glucanase has been isolated and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. The sequence was found to contain two large open reading frames. Purification of the mature native enzyme and subsequent amino-terminal sequencing defined the glucanase gene in one reading frame which potentially encodes a protein of 548 amino acids. We have expressed this glucanase gene in Escherichia coli under control of the lacUV5 promoter and found the product to be secreted into the periplasm as a mature enzyme of about the same molecular weight as that of the native protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified to near homogeneity by a single step of high performance liquid chromatography. The ability of the recombinant enzyme to digest beta-glucan substrates and to lyse viable yeast cells was found to be indistinguishable from that of the native protein. Deletion of the cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal 117 amino acids of the enzyme, which also contain two duplicated segments, abolished the lytic activity but did not significantly affect the glucanase function of the protein. The possible involvement of this domain in interaction with the yeast cell wall is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526965567,"Abstract Digital imaging fluorescence microscopy was used to study the effect of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) on the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of single rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Within minutes of the addition of TBHP, individual hepatocytes displayed one or more peaks of increased [Ca2+]i that promptly returned to the prestimulation level. This was followed by a slower increase of [Ca2+]i that reached a plateau of 696 +/- 260 nM (basal 194 +/- nM) after 20 min. Another rise in [Ca2+]i, abrupt and much larger, preceded the death of the cells after about 45 min. Pretreatment of the hepatocytes with deferoxamine, a ferric iron chelator, or the addition of the antioxidants N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine or catechol prevented the loss of viability. Neither the number of hepatocytes displaying the initial [Ca2+]i transients nor the magnitude of these oscillations was affected by deferoxamine, N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenyl-enediamine, or catechol. However, both the plateau phase and the abrupt rise in [Ca2+]i were prevented. Treatment of the hepatocytes with TBHP in a low calcium buffer (less than 2 microM Ca2+) reduced or abolished the initial [Ca2+]i transients and eliminated both the plateau phase and abrupt rise in [Ca2+]i. The onset of cell death was delayed by 10 min in the low calcium medium. Addition of 3.5 mM EGTA to the cultures lowered the basal calcium concentration, prevented both the initial [Ca2+]i spikes and the delayed changes, and further prolonged the onset of cell death. These data indicate that the killing of the cultured hepatocytes by TBHP can be dissociated from changes in intracellular calcium homeostasis. An influx of extracellular Ca2+ ions may aggravate somewhat the mechanisms of cell injury by an oxidative stress and accelerate the time of onset of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1669303234,"The kinetics of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to receptors on HeLa cells were investigated. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of 22,000 high affinity receptors (Kd = 0.12 nM) and 25,000 low affinity receptors per cell (Kd = 9.2 nM). The kinetic analysis of EGF binding to high affinity receptors was performed with cells pretreated with the monoclonal antibody 2E9, which prevents specifically EGF binding to low affinity receptors. The study of EGF binding to only low affinity receptors was performed with cells pretreated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which induces a conversion of high affinity receptors to low affinity receptors. This kinetic analysis of EGF binding to HeLa cells revealed the presence of three types of receptors. High affinity receptors were found to consist of one receptor type (type I) with a kinetic association constant (kass) of 6.2 x 10(5) M-1.s-1 and a kinetic dissociation constant (kdis) of 3.5 x 10(-4) s-1. The low affinity receptors were found to consist of two kinetic distinguishable sites: type II or fast sites with kass = 3.3 x 10(6) M-1.s-1 and kdis = 8.1 x 10(-3) s-1 and the type III or slow sites with kass = 3.2 x 10(4) M-1.s-1 and kdis = 1.6 x 10(-4) s-1. The regulatory mechanism which may determine the EGF binding characteristics is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2151605966,"The interaction of diacylglycerols, primarily 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycerol (1,2-DLG), with egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers was studied by NMR spectroscopy and other physical techniques. In the low proportions used (less than or equal to 20 mol % with respect to total lipid), 1,2-DLG formed bilayers with PC with no hexagonal phase separation, as assessed by light, polarizing and electron microscopy, and 31P and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 13C-carbonyl chemical shift of 90% [13C]carbonyl 1,2-DLG was monitored in small unilamellar vesicles as a function of relative DLG content (1.5-20%) and temperature (10-55 degrees C). The chemically inequivalent sn-1 and sn-2 carbonyls gave a single, narrow resonance in vesicles, in contrast to neat 1,2-DLG and 1,2-DLG in organic solvents, whose spectra showed two well-separated carbonyl resonances. The chemical shift of 1,2-DLG in PC shows that the carbonyl groups are proximal to the aqueous interface, necessitating orientation of the DLG molecule along the normal to the bilayer. Both carbonyl groups are H-bonded to H2O, but the secondary ester (sn-2) carbonyl is relatively more hydrated than the primary ester (sn-1) carbonyl. The 13C-carbonyl chemical shift data further suggest that the interfacial conformation resembles that of crystalline and liquid crystalline lamellar 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine and certain PCs, in which the glycerol backbone is perpendicular to the bilayer plane. This conformation is different from that of crystalline 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycerol, in which the glycerol backbone is parallel to the bilayer plane. Between 1.5 and 8% DLG in vesicles, the chemical shift of the 1,2-DLG carbonyl at a given temperature was constant. However, above 8% DLG the chemical shift at each temperature increased with increasing DLG concentration, suggesting increased hydration at higher DLG content. At low temperatures 13C NMR spectra of vesicles with the highest proportions of 1,2-DLG studied (15 and 20%) showed two DLG carbonyl resonances, which most likely represent 1,2-DLG on outer and inner leaflets of the vesicle bilayer. The two peaks collapsed into a single resonance by 38 degrees C, at which temperature the two environments equilibrate with a rate constant of approximately 60 s-1 (t1/2 approximately 10 ms). Thus, transbilayer movement of DLG is extremely fast compared with phospholipids. In vesicles the 1,3-isomer of DLG exhibited a narrow carbonyl peak slightly downfield from that of 1,2-DLG. Acyl chain migration from 1,2-DLG to 1,3-DLG was monitored directly in the vesicle by time-dependent NMR measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1573614933,"A full-length cDNA clone for GTP cyclohydrolase I, the first enzyme of the tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthetic pathway, was isolated and characterized. Synthetic oligonucleotides, constructed according to selected amino acid sequences of purified GTP cyclohydrolase I, were used to screen a rat liver cDNA library. Four clones were isolated, and the length of the longest cDNA insert was 1024 base pairs. The identity of the cDNA was confirmed by amino acid sequence data for eight fragments obtained by lysyl endopeptidase digestion of the purified protein. The coding region encoded a protein of 241 amino acid residues, but the NH2 terminus of the protein contained 11 additional amino acid residues not present in the purified protein. RNA blot analysis showed a single mRNA species of 1.2 kilobases in rat liver. A characteristic feature of the deduced amino acid sequence of GTP cyclohydrolase I was the presence of sequences similar to those proposed for the phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II and growth-associated histone H1 kinase. Furthermore, significant similarity was found to the highly conserved sequences of dihydrofolate reductases, which are known to be involved in the binding of the pterin group of dihydrofolate to the reductases. This region in GTP cyclohydrolase I may be assigned to the binding site of tetrahydrobiopterin, one of the inhibitors of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1501647424,"The Ca2(+)-dependent regulation of the erythroid membrane cytoskeleton was investigated. The low-salt extract of erythroid membranes, which is mainly composed of spectrin, protein 4.1, and actin, confers a Ca2+ sensitivity on its interaction with F-actin. This Ca2+ sensitivity is fortified by calmodulin and antagonized by trifluoperazine, a potent calmodulin inhibitor. Additionally, calmodulin is detected in the low-salt extract. These results suggest that calmodulin is the sole Ca2(+)-sensitive factor in the low-salt extract. The main target of calmodulin in the erythroid membrane cytoskeleton was further examined. Under native conditions, calmodulin forms a stable and equivalent complex with protein 4.1 as determined by calmodulin affinity chromatography, cross-linking experiments, and fluorescence binding assays with an apparent Kd of 5.5 x 10(-7) M irrespective of the free Ca2+ concentration. Domain mapping with chymotryptic digestion reveals that the calmodulin-binding site resides within the N-terminal 30-kDa fragment of protein 4.1. In contrast, the interaction of calmodulin with spectrin is unexpectedly weak (Kd = 1.2 x 10(-4) M). Given the content of calmodulin in erythrocytes (2-5 microM), these results imply that the major target for calmodulin in the erythroid membrane cytoskeleton is protein 4.1. Low- and high-shear viscometry and binding assays reveal that an equivalent complex of calmodulin with protein 4.1 regulates the spectrin/actin interaction in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner. At a low Ca2+ concentration, protein 4.1 potentiates the actin cross-linking and the actin binding activities of spectrin. At a high Ca2+ concentration, the protein 4.1-potentiated actin cross-linking activity but not the actin binding activity of spectrin is suppressed by Ca2+/calmodulin. The Ca2(+)-dependent regulation of the spectrin/protein 4.1/calmodulin/actin interaction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1944609274,"Retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of 3T3 adipogenic cell lines. In this report, the steady-state levels of several adipose-specific mRNAs were studied in mature adipocytes treated with RA. Northern blot analysis showed that, following a 24-h exposure of 3T3-F442A adipocytic cultures to RA (10 microM), there was a 4-5-fold decrease of adipsin mRNA level. In contrast, actin, adipocyte P2, lipoprotein lipase, and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were unchanged during the same interval. The rate of adipsin and actin gene transcription, assessed by nuclear run-on assays, remained unchanged in adipocytes exposed to RA. The half-life (t1/2) of adipsin mRNA, determined by pulse-chase with [3H] uridine, was greatly shortened in RA-treated adipocytes (t1/2 approximately 7.3 h) as compared with untreated cells (t1/2 approximately 37.6 h). Conversely, actin mRNA stability was not altered by the drug. These results suggest that RA can specifically down-regulate adipsin expression in adipocytes at a posttranscriptional level without inducing the reversal of adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1589832944,"The interaction of proteins bound to sites widely separated on the genome is a recurrent motif in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic regulatory systems. Lac repressor mediates the formation of loops by the simultaneous interaction of a single protein tetramer with two DNA-binding sites. The DNA-binding properties of a Lac repressor mutant (LacIadi) deficient in the association of protein dimers to tetramers was investigated. The results of quantitative footprint and gel mobility-shift titrations suggest that the wild-type Lac repressor (LacI+) binds cooperatively to two operator sites separated by 11 helical turns on a linear DNA restriction fragment by the formation of a LacIadi binds to this two-site operator non-cooperatively and without formation of a looped complex. These results demonstrate that the dimer-tetramer association of LacI+ is directly responsible for its cooperative binding and its ability to mediate formation of a looped complex. The Iadi mutation disrupts the monomer-dimer as well as eliminating the dimer-tetramer association equilibria while the DNA binding affinity of LacIadi to a single site is unchanged relative to the wild-type protein. These results suggest that DNA binding and dimer-tetramer association are functionally unlinked. The similarity of the DNA-binding properties of LacIadi and Gal repressor, a protein believed to function by mediating the formation of a looped complex, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1541046696,"The peptide hormone erythropoietin is a major regulator of red blood cell production. While red blood cell development has been studied intensively, little is known about the intracellular signaling events that follow the binding of erythropoietin to its receptor on the target cell. We report here that erythropoietin-induced activation of the immediate early gene c-myc requires protein kinase C and that the binding of erythropoietin causes rapid phosphorylation of the major protein kinase C substrate, p80. Our results also argue for modulation of activity of a second signal transduction element in addition to protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1711095524,"Glucose uptake and metabolism in the bloodstream form of the glycosome-containing protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei was measured using 14C-labeled glucose in combination with the silicone oil centrifugation technique in short term (5-60 s) incubations. Glucose rather than glucose analogues was used to study the interrelation between the uptake process and the subsequent metabolic steps. Glucose uptake over the plasma membrane occurred by facilitated diffusion, which limited the overall glycolytic rate at external glucose concentrations (glcout) below 5 mM. At higher glcout another step, either transport over the glycosomal membrane or phosphorylation by hexokinase became rate-limiting. Mathematical modeling assuming that glucose uptake occurs by facilitated diffusion followed by an enzymatic step accurately predicts the experimental data. As predicted by the model, the internal concentration of non-metabolized glucose remains low till glcout = 5 mM and increases at higher external concentrations. In contrast to glucose, glycerol entered the cell by simple diffusion. Externally supplied glycerol did not affect glucose metabolism but externally added glucose interfered with glycerol metabolism in a way that suggests that the rate-limiting step is at the level of glycerol kinase. Our observations suggest that the bloodstream form of T. brucei adapts its glucose transport in a way that gives maximum yield at minimum expense."
https://openalex.org/W1516448862,"Cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase has been shown previously to exhibit both broad substrate and reaction specificity. In addition to cleaving many different 3-hydroxyamino acids to glycine and an aldehyde, the enzyme also catalyzes with several amino acid substrate analogs decarboxylation, transamination, and racemization reactions. To elucidate the relationship of the structure of the substrate to reaction specificity, the interaction of both amino acid and folate substrates and substrate analogs with the enzyme has been studied by three different methods. These methods include investigating the effects of substrates and substrate analogs on the thermal denaturation properties of the enzyme by differential scanning calorimetry, determining the rate of peptide hydrogen exchange with solvent protons, and measuring the optical activity of the active site pyridoxal phosphate. All three methods suggest that the enzyme exists as an equilibrium between and forms. Amino acid substrates enter and leave the active site in the open form, but catalysis occurs in the closed form. The data suggest that the amino acid analogs that undergo alternate reactions, such as racemization and transamination, bind only to the open form of the enzyme and that the alternate reactions occur in the open form. Therefore, one role for forming the closed form of the enzyme is to block side reactions and confer reaction specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1593473776,"The quaternary structure of rat liver cytochrome P-450 within microsomal membranes from 3-methyl-cholanthrene-treated rats was examined by a novel chemical cross-linking-monoclonal antibody approach. Complex formation among the different forms of P-450 was probed by cross-linking of membrane proteins followed by immunopurification with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to P-450c, the major 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible form. Subsequent immunoblot analysis of the immunopurified proteins with this mAb indicated that P-450c formed complexes with other microsomal proteins. Immunoblots with mAbs to different P-450s were carried out to identify the P-450s that were cross-linked to P-450c. This approach detected specific cross-linking of P-450c to P-450 2a. Immunoinhibition experiments suggest that P-450 2a further metabolizes the primary phenols produced by P-450c-catalyzed hydroxylation of benzo[a]pyrene. Complex formation among membrane-bound enzymes has implications for their catalytic efficiency and an approach combining cross-linking and monoclonal antibody-based characterization of cross-linked proteins will be useful for elucidating such membrane protein macrostructures."
https://openalex.org/W1553796597,"We used a cDNA encoding the human pancreatic stone protein (PSP-S), the secretory inhibitor of CaCO3 crystal growth, as a probe for cloning rat PSP-S messenger RNA. Overlapping clones gave a mRNA sequence of 783 nucleotides encoding a preprotein of 165 amino acids including a prepeptide of 21 amino acids. Rat and human PSP-S showed 70% identity, and the mature proteins had the same length. PSP-S mRNA concentration was measured in the pancreas of rats adapted to diets containing 15, 25, or 70% protein. Compared with the 15% protein diet, concentration increased 3 and 12 times with the diets with 25 and 70% protein, respectively, which is 3 times higher than for serine proteases. A complete sequence identity was observed between the rat PSP-S transcript and the reg mRNA described by Terazono et al. (Terazono, K., Yamamoto, H., Takasawa, S., Shiga, K., Yonemura, Y., Tochino, Y., and Okamoto, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2111-2114), which is expressed in regenerating pancreatic islets but not in mature islets. A specific role of the reg protein in islet regeneration was suggested. We found that PSP-S (reg) mRNA concentration was indeed increased in isolated regenerating islets. Yet, a transient increase was also observed in exocrine tissue during the initial phase of regeneration following pancreatectomy or acute pancreatitis, suggesting increased expression during cell dedifferentiation. It is concluded that, in mature pancreas, expression of the reg/PSP-S gene occurs primarily in acinar cells. The gene product, which encodes a secretory protein inhibiting CaCO3 crystal growth in juice, is unlikely to play a specific role in islet regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1497627461,"Matrix vesicles (MV) are microstructures localized to the extracellular matrix of developing hard tissues that induce mineral formation. MV proteins are not well characterized, and little is known of how they interact with the surrounding matrix. However, recent electron microscopic studies indicate that MV interact with matrix proteins in growth plate cartilage. In the studies now reported, procedures developed for dissecting various components from isolated MV led to the discovery that two major vesicle proteins (38 and 46 kDa) are readily released from MV by low ionic strength solutions. These low ionic strength-soluble proteins (LISSP) were shown to be major fragments of the link protein (LP) and hyaluronic acid-binding region (HABR) of matrix proteoglycans: they react immunologically with highly specific monoclonal antibodies to LP and HABR, and the NH2-terminal sequence of the 38-kDa LISSP is essentially identical to residues 40-78 of chicken cartilage LP and that the 46-kDa LISSP represents HABR. Release of both LISSP is enhanced by hyaluronidase treatment, indicating anchorage by a hyaluronate-mediated mechanism. Both LP and HABR are firmly attached to MV in either isotonic or hypertonic solutions. In contrast, our other studies show that dissociation of type II collagen from MV occurs only with hypertonic salts which do not release the LISSP. Thus, strong interactions occur under physiological conditions between MV and both the proteoglycans and collagens, but these take place by different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1560706979,"The product of the fadL gene (FadL) of Escherichia coli is a multifunctional integral outer-membrane protein required for the specific binding and transport of exogenous long-chain fatty acids [C12-C18]. FadL also serves as a receptor for the bacteriophage T2. In order to define regions of functional importance within FadL, the fadL gene has been mutagenized by the insertion of single-stranded hexameric linkers into the unique SalI restriction site that lies towards the 3' end of the gene and into four HpaII restriction sites distributed throughout the coding region. The five insertion mutants were classified into three groups based on their specific growth rates (alpha) in minimal media containing the long-chain fatty acid oleate (C18:1) as a sole carbon and energy source: Oleslow, alpha = 0.035-0.045; Ole +/-, alpha = 0.020-0.035; and Ole-, alpha less than or equal to 0.005 (wild-type, alpha = 0.07-0.10). The hexameric insertion at the SalI site (fadL allele termed S1; insertion after amino acid 410) conferred an Oleslow phenotype and resulted in a reduction of long-chain fatty acid transport (36% the wild-type level). This insertion mutant, however, bound oleic acid at wild-type levels and was fully functional as a receptor for the bacteriophage T2. The modified FadL-S1 protein did not have the heat-modifiable property characteristic of wild-type FadL. Insertions in the four HpaII sites (fadL alleles termed H1, H2, H3, and H5; after amino acids 41, 81, 238, and 389, respectively) resulted in all three classes of mutants. The fadL insertion mutant H5 was defective for long-chain fatty acid transport but bound oleic acid at significant levels. Together with the S1 allele, these data suggest that the carboxyl terminus of FadL is crucial for long-chain fatty acid transport. The insertion mutants H1 and H2 were defective for both oleic acid binding and transport suggesting that the amino terminus of FadL is important for long-chain fatty acid binding and transport. The fadL linker mutant H3 was defective in oleic acid binding yet had significant levels of oleic acid transport. These studies delineated for the first time different regions of the fadL gene that encode domains of FadL implicated in the binding and transport of long-chain fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1593522622,"Two types of cDNAs encoding the H2 subunit of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor had been cloned, differing only by the presence (H2a) or absence (H2b) of a segment of 15 base pairs (bp), encoding five amino acids (Glu-Gly-His-Arg-Gly) immediately carboxylterminal (exoplasmic) to the single membrane-spanning segment. We have cloned and sequenced this region of the H2 gene and showed that the two H2 forms are alternatively spliced variants differing in the presence of a 15-bp miniexon. Both H2 messenger RNAs were found in HepG2 cells, H2b accounting for about 92% of the H2 mRNAs. When expressed in NIH 3T3 cells without the H1 receptor subunit, the two-variant polypeptides exhibit different subcellular fates. H2a is completely retained in and degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum or a related pre-Golgi compartment. In contrast a substantial amount of H2b is processed by Golgi enzymes and reaches the cell surface. Thus, the sole difference determining the subcellular localization of the two forms if the five-amino acid insert in H2a. When a virion-packaged retroviral vector containing H2a cDNA infected 3T3 cells, 70% of the resulting clones expressed H2b and 30% H2a. Thus the 15-bp H2a miniexon can be spliced out, at least during the retrovirus life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1494080463,"Heparin cofactor II (HC) is a plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that inhibits the coagulant proteinase alpha-thrombin. We have recently demonstrated that proteolysis of HC by catalytic amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocyte proteinases (elastase or cathepsin G) generates leukocyte chemotaxins (Hoffman, M., Pratt, C. W., Brown, R. L., and Church, F. C. (1989) Blood 73, 1682-1685). One of four peptides produced when HC is degraded by neutrophil elastase has chemotactic activity for both monocytes and neutrophils with maximal migration comparable to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, the gold standard bacterially derived chemotaxin. The amino-terminal sequence of this HC peptide is Asp-Phe-His-Lys-Glu-Asn-Thr-Val-... and the peptide corresponds to Asp-39 to Ile-66 of HC. A variety of synthetic peptides derived from this sequence were evaluated for leukocyte migration activity, and a dodecapeptide from Asp-49 to Tyr-60 (Asp-Trp-Ile-Pro-Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr) was identified as the active site for leukocyte chemotactic action. The 12-mer synthetic peptide possesses significant neutrophil chemotactic action at 1 nM (60% of the maximal activity of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe), while a peptide with the reverse sequence has essentially no chemotactic activity. Cross-desensitization experiments also show that pretreatment of neutrophils with a 19-mer peptide (Asn-48 to Ile-66) greatly reduces subsequent chemotaxis to HC-neutrophil elastase proteolysis reaction products. When injected intraperitoneally in mice, the HC-neutrophil elastase digest elicits neutrophil migration. Our results demonstrate that not only does HC function as a thrombin inhibitor, but that limited proteolysis of HC near the amino terminus yields biologically active peptide(s) which might participate in inflammation and in wound healing and tissue repair processes."
https://openalex.org/W1527651922,"Abstract The significance of DNA ethylation at the central hydrogen-bonding site (N3) of thymine was investigated using an in vitro DNA replication system. The system utilized a primed template in which the 3'-end of the primer is eight nucleotides away from N3-ethyldeoxythymidine (N3-Et-dT), present at template position 26 from the 3'-end. The 34-nucleotide template corresponds to a specific DNA sequence at gene G of bacteriophage phi X174. DNA synthesis products were quantitated by electrophoretic separation and autoradiography. At 10 microM dNTP and 0.5 mM Mn2+, N3-Et-dT blocked DNA synthesis by Escherichia coli polymerase I (Klenow fragment): 60% after incorporating a nucleotide opposite N3-Et-dT (incorporation-dependent blocked product) and 39% 3' to N3-Et-dT. DNA replication past the lesion (post-lesion synthesis) was negligible. Post-lesion synthesis increased using higher concentrations of dNTP, reaching 68% at 200 microM dNTP. DNA sequencing revealed that dA was incorporated opposite N3-Et-dT in the incorporation-dependent blocked product. In the post-lesion synthesis product, dT was exclusively incorporated opposite N3-Et-dT. Formation of the N3-Et-dT.dA base pair at the replication fork terminated DNA synthesis, while the N3-Et-dT.dT base pair formed at the 3'-end of the growing chain was extended, leading to an A.T----T.A transversion mutation. The results suggest a dual role for the N3-Et-dT lesion, contributing in part to the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of ethylating agents. These studies provide a basis for understanding the activation of oncogene neu by A.T----T.A transversion mutation in rat neuroblastomas induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea."
https://openalex.org/W2169216089,"Although a low resolution model for the arrangement of the proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits is known, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the function of the ribosome awaits a high resolution structure of its components. While crystals have been obtained of several ribosomal proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, determination of atomic resolution structures of these proteins is impeded by the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of native proteins for crystallographic or NMR studies. We describe here the cloning and overexpression in Escherichia coli of the genes for ribosomal proteins S5, L6, L9, and L18 from B. stearothermophilus. S5 is extremely toxic to E. coli when overexpressed, and we have taken advantage of a new tightly regulated expression system to obtain high yields (more than 100 mg of pure protein/liter of culture) of this protein. The B. stearothermophilus S5 produced in E. coli crystallizes, and the crystals are identical to those obtained from the native protein. The crystals diffract to 2-A resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1525152388,"Amino acid substitutions within the amino-terminal 5 residues of the thrombin-specific inhibitor hirudin dramatically alter its ability to inhibit the thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of both a chromogenic substrate and fibrinogen. Replacing the highly conserved Tyr-3 residue with Trp or Phe increases hirudin's affinity for thrombin 3-6-fold (decreases the inhibition constant, Ki) whereas Thr results in a 450-fold increase in Ki. A more extensive modification involving deletion of the amino-terminal Val, and Tyr-3----Val, Thr-4----Gln, and Asp-5----Ile replacement, results in a large reduction in thrombin inhibitory activity corresponding to greater than a 10(7)-fold increase in Ki and a 10(3)-fold increase in IC50, using D-Phe-L-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2238) and fibrinogen, respectively, as substrates. Kinetic analysis of these mutant proteins and synthetic peptide fragments and available structural information on thrombin and hirudin derived from protein crystallography and two-dimensional NMR studies indicate that the amino-terminal region of hirudin binds at the apolar binding/active site region of thrombin, with Tyr-3 occupying the S3 specificity site. The large effect of these modifications on hirudin activity suggests that alteration of the amino-terminal segment can destabilize the interaction of other regions of hirudin with thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1665956227,"Much evidence has accumulated to support the idea that leucine can stimulate insulin release by allosterically activating glutamate dehydrogenase thus enhancing glutamate metabolism. It is less clear how the metabolism of leucine itself contributes to the signal for insulin release. We recently found that culturing pancreatic islets for 1 day at low glucose (1 mM) suppressed glucose-induced insulin release, but preserved leucine-induced insulin release. When islets were cultured at high glucose (20 mM), glucose-induced insulin release was preserved, but leucine-induced insulin release was suppressed (MacDonald, M. J., Fahien, L. A., McKenzie, D. I., and Moran, S. M. (1990) Am. J. Physiol., 259, E548-E554). The suppression of leucine-induced insulin release can be explained by glucose's suppression of the synthesis of the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of leucine metabolism, branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH). High glucose suppressed the enzyme activity of the E1 component of the BCKDH complex, as well as the total activity of the BCKDH complex, to usually negligible levels in islets and decreased by an average of 90% the mRNA which encodes E1 alpha, the catalytic subunit of the E1 component of BCKDH, in islets and rat insulinoma cells. Time course studies showed that about 24 h in culture was required to maximally induce or suppress the expression of BCKDH E1 alpha. Culture at high glutamine with or without leucine mimicked to a lesser and more variable degree the effects of high glucose on leucine-induced insulin release and BCKDH E1 alpha mRNA. Leucine-plus-glutamine-induced insulin release was present after culture of islets with glucose and with or without any other secretagogue. Also, glutamate dehydrogenase transcripts and enzyme activity were not significantly altered by varying the concentration of glucose in the culture medium. Thus, leucine's insulinotropism via activation of glutamate dehydrogenase is constitutive. Preproinsulin mRNA levels were markedly increased at high glucose and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts were either unaffected or slightly increased by glucose. Glutamine did not significantly effect the expression of genes other than BCKDH E1 alpha, and leucine had little or no effect on the expression of any of the four genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1493001904,"Aeromonas hydrophila releases a protein which is a member of the lipase superfamily, similar in reaction mechanism to the important mammalian plasma enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. We have used chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis of the protein to identify amino acids which may be involved in catalysis. The enzyme was unaffected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but it was almost completely inhibited by another serine-reactive compound, diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate. A serine selectively modified by this reagent was identified by sequencing the amino-terminal region of the protein. It was located at position 16, in the short consensus sequence shared by the enzyme with other lipases. When this serine was changed to asparagine the product was an enzymatically inert protein which nevertheless retained the surface activity of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting its ability to bind to substrate was not changed. Diethylpyrocarbonate treatment drastically reduced the rate of acyl transfer by the native enzyme, but this did not appear to be due to modification of an essential histidine, since inhibition was not reversed by addition of hydroxylamine. We have shown that only two of the histidines in the enzyme can be involved in catalysis (Hilton, S., McCubbin, W. D., Kay, C.M., and Buckley, J. T. (1990) Biochemistry, 29, 9072-9078). Replacing both of these with asparagines had little or no effect on enzyme activity. These results indicate that, in apparent contrast to other lipases, histidine does not participate in the reaction catalyzed by the microbial enzyme. Since catalysis was not inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, we conclude that a free cysteine is also not required for activity. This may distinguish the microbial enzyme from the mammalian acyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1533611871,"Factor VII-VIIa, in association with tissue factor, participates in the complex which initiates blood coagulation through the extrinsic pathway. To identify functional domains on factor VII which mediate the activation of factor X, 16 synthetic peptides corresponding to 55% of the primary structure were assayed for their ability to inhibit factor VII function. Factor Xa formation was inhibited by eight of the peptides in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analyses indicated noncompetitive inhibition of factor X activation by seven of these peptides. Peptide-(347-361) inhibited factor Xa cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by a competitive mechanism and was excluded from further analysis in this study. Among the seven inhibitory peptides which have the ability to prevent the factor VIIa-tissue factor-mediated conversion of factor X to factor Xa, peptide-(285-305) was most inhibitory, with a Ki value of 2.4 microM. The Ki values were in the range of 42-65 microM for peptides-(44-50), -(194-214), -(208-229), and -(376-390). The least inhibitory peptides were at positions 170-178 and 330-340, with a Ki value greater than 200 microM. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against four of these peptides; and when antisera were assayed by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay, they bound not only to their respective immunizing peptides, but also to factor VII. The Fab fragments of specific IgG preparations, affinity-purified on a factor VII-agarose column, inhibited the rate of factor X activation in a dose-dependent manner. Six of the seven inhibitory peptides represent amino acid sequences within the heavy chain of factor VII, and the remaining one corresponds to a sequence within the light chain. The corresponding regions in the x-ray crystal structure of chymotrypsin represented by the six heavy chain inhibitory peptides are found to be located in three distinct regions, one region located spatially distal to the active site and the other two regions located relatively closer to the active site and the substrate-binding pocket. The results suggest that at least three specific regions in the heavy chain and one region in the light chain of factor VII mediate its interaction with the factor X activation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1574519871,"Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid manipulation exerts a strikingly protective effect in models of tissue inflammation and injury. A critical element of this effect appears to revolve around leukocyte trafficking but underlying mechanisms are ill understood. In the current study it was observed that essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency markedly impaired the capacity of resident macrophages to spread and adhere. This effect was not a simple function of the alteration of membrane fatty acid composition. Elicited EFA-deficient macrophages were equally adherent to elicited control cells, despite the fact that they were equally EFA-deficient relative to resident EFA-deficient cells. With respect to the mechanism underlying defective macrophage adherence in EFA deficiency, no change in the expression of cell surface adherence molecules (Fc receptor, Mac-1, or LFA-1) was noted with the deficiency state. Also, an adherence defect could not be induced in normal cells pharmacologically with cyclooxygenase blockade, lipoxygenase blockade, or a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist. In contrast, phospholipase inhibition was able to induce a spreading and adherence defect in resident macrophages similar to that seen with EFA deficiency. Using several phospholipase inhibitors, a correlation between phospholipase inhibition and impairment of adherence was observed. Adding back exogenous fatty acids to cells after phospholipase inhibition demonstrated that normal adherence was reconstituted with arachidonate. This alteration in macrophage spreading and adherence with EFA deficiency may be an important component of the anti-inflammatory effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid manipulation. Additionally, these results suggest that arachidonate may be an intracellular mediator of leukocyte adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1583525342,"Infection with Schistosoma mansoni is initiated by penetration of the intact skin of the mammalian host with the head but not the tail of the parasite cercariae. The surface of cercariae is covered by a 1-2-micron thick carbohydrate-rich glycocalyx (gx). Furthermore, the transformation of cercariae to schistosomula (the next parasitic stage in the mammalian host) is associated with loss of gx from the bodies. To understand the role of gx in the host-parasite relationship, we have characterized the gx of both bodies and tails of S. mansoni cercariae. A fluorescent fucose-specific lectin-stained bodies and not tails of the organism. Moreover, when an enriched preparation of gx obtained by extraction with 40% aqueous phenol and exclusion from Sepharose CL-6B was subjected to affinity chromatography on insolubilized Lotus lectin, which binds fucose-containing glycans, only body gx was retained. Body gx is smaller and less negatively charged than tail gx. Electron microscopy showed that gx from bodies and tails is composed of 25-40-nm particles and fibrillar material. Carbohydrate composition of gx of bodies and tails indicate that fucose and glucose are major components, respectively. beta-Elimination experiments indicate that the linkage sugar is N-acetylgalactosamine in both cases. Upon treatment with alkaline borohydride, nearly 90% of gx of both bodies and tails was recovered as two glycan chains: I and II (Mr approximately 10,500 and 5,600, respectively). Glycan I was in both cases more negatively charged than glycan II. Fucose is the predominant sugar in glycan I of the bodies while glycan I of tails is mainly composed of glucose. The gx was resistant to several proteases. This resistance and the abundance of carbohydrate in gx may be of biological importance for survival of cercariae. The substantial differences observed between the gx of bodies and tails may provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of selective release of body gx during transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1616155428,"The primary control of autophagically mediated proteolysis in perfused rat liver is carried out via two alternate mechanisms in response to specific regulatory amino acids. One (L) elicits direct inhibition at low and high plasma levels, but requires a co-regulatory amino acid to express inhibition at normal concentrations. The second (H) is ineffective at normal levels and below, but active at higher concentrations. Because regulation is subject to unpredictable variability with ad libitum feeding, we have utilized rats synchronously fed 4 h day-1 to stabilize responses. Proteolytic control is seen to evolve in stages: H appears 12 h after the start of feeding; by 18 h L emerges, alternating with H in a statistically predictable way; with omission of the 24-h feeding, H disappears and L remains constant through 42 h. In both 18- and 42-h rats, alanine, glutamate, and aspartate exhibit similar inhibitory activity when added singly to the regulatory group at normal plasma concentrations. However, since alanine, but not glutamate or aspartate, evokes proteolytic acceleration when it is deleted from a full plasma mixture, alanine appears to be the sole co-regulator. Alanine yields co-regulatory effects with normal plasma leucine (0.2 mM) in 18- and 42-h animals and interacts synergistically with 0.8 mM leucine in 42-h but not in 18-h rats where leucine alone inhibits strongly. Because the inactivation of alanine amino-transferase by aminooxyacetate (determined from the conversion of [14C]alanine to glucose) does not alter the co-regulatory and synergistic effects of alanine, regulation by alanine must be mediated from a site of recognition before transamination."
https://openalex.org/W1579807417,"In BALB/c 3T3 cells pretreated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (primed-competent cells), insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) bind to their own receptors (IGF-IR and IGF-IIR) and stimulate calcium influx and DNA synthesis by a mechanism involving a 40-kDa pertussis toxin substrate. In contrast, these IGFs do not act on unprimed quiescent cells. In this study, the 40-kDa pertussis toxin substrate was identified as Gi-2 alpha using anti-G protein antibodies. We analyzed the quality of signal transduction from IGF-II to Gi-2 alpha. There was no difference in the amount of Gi-2 alpha between quiescent and primed-competent cells, and both of these cells had similar Kd values and numbers of IGF-II-binding sites. Whereas IGF-II did not alter pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi-2 alpha in quiescent cells, IGF-II reduced the pertussis toxin substrate activity by 35-50% via the IGF-IIR in primed-competent cells. The action of IGF-II lasted for up to 3 h when IGF-II was present in the medium, and it disappeared when IGF-II was removed. These results suggest that the signaling pathway triggered by IGF-II is uncoupled between the IGF-IIR and Gi-2 alpha in quiescent cells and that PDGF and EGF restore the IGF-IIR-Gi-2 coupling. This study also indicates that low concentrations of IGF-I reduce the pertussis toxin substrate activity of Gi-2 alpha in primed-competent cells in a time course slower than that of IGF-II, but not at all in quiescent cells. However, both of these cells had similar Kd values and numbers of IGF-I binding sites. Therefore, the IGF-I signaling pathway may also be uncoupled between the IGF-IR and Gi-2 alpha in quiescent cells and restored by PDGF and EGF. In BALB/c 3T3 cells transfected with temperature-sensitive Kirsten sarcoma virus bearing the v-Ki-ras gene (ts cells), a 40-kDa pertussis toxin substrate was also identified as Gi-2 alpha. In nonpermissive ts cells, IGF-II was without effect on the pertussis toxin substrate activity of Gi-2 alpha or on calcium influx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1543668689,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulates the human monoblastoid U937 cell to differentiate into a mature monocyte/macrophage-like cell. Since TPA may produce cellular responses by activating protein kinase C, the effects of TPA on kinase activity in the U937 cell were investigated. Brief exposures (less than or equal to 60 min) to TPA dramatically diminished protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of histone and endogenous substrates. However, using a peptide substrate corresponding to residues 720-737 of protein kinase C-epsilon, Ca2(+)-, phospholipid-, and diacylglycerol-dependent kinase activity was reduced only modestly after exposure to TPA. This phospholipid-dependent kinase activity coeluted on DEAE chromatography with protein kinase C. Examination of cytosolic protein kinase C content by Western blot analysis demonstrated a moderate decline in kinase content after TPA treatment. The decline was due primarily to loss of an 80-kDa species with preservation of a 76-kDa protein. The immunoreactive 76-kDa protein observed after TPA treatment comigrated on DEAE chromatography with the kinase activity phosphorylating the protein kinase C-epsilon peptide and had an elution profile similar to protein kinase C derived from untreated cells. Using antisera recognizing the catalytic and regulatory domains of the kinase, no evidence for proteolytic degradation of protein kinase C was observed. Although incubation of extracts from vehicle and TPA-treated cells inhibited the activity of partially purified protein kinase C, the degree of inhibition was similar in the two extracts. These findings suggest that TPA markedly diminishes protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of histone and endogenous substrates in part by altering kinase substrate specificity. These observations provide evidence for a novel post-translational process that can modulate protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1531158816,"Transcription of the GAL genes encoding the enzymes responsible for galactose metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated through an interplay of two regulatory proteins, GAL4 and GAL80. GAL4 binds to upstream activating sequences of GAL (UASG) and activates their transcription in yeast growing in the presence of galactose. GAL80 binds to GAL4 and inhibits the activation function of GAL4 in yeast growing without galactose. We have purified GAL80 in its native form as a protein that reacts with an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide of 18 amino acid residues in the GAL80 sequence. Purification was performed through ammonium sulfate precipitation, streptomycin precipitation, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, and gel filtration. From 50 g of wet cells, a final sample of 2.3 mg with a purity of more than 80% was obtained. The molecular size of the purified protein in both the native and denatured states was estimated to be approximately 50 kDa, indicating that GAL80 exists as a monomer in yeast cells. The amino-terminal residue of GAL80 was found to be acetylmethionine. The purified protein was shown to bind GAL4. We have also purified mutant GAL80 proteins encoded by two different alleles of gal80 known to be incapable of inhibiting the function of GAL4. These proteins were, in fact, unable to bind GAL4."
https://openalex.org/W1534243158,"The rat liver mitochondrial phosphate transporter contains a 44-amino acid presequence. The role of this presequence is not clear since the ADP/ATP carrier and the brown fat uncoupling protein, related members of a family of inner membrane anion transporters, lack a presequence and contain targeting information within the mature protein. Here, we present evidence that the rat liver mitochondrial phosphate transporter can be synthesized in vitro, imported into mitochondria, and processed to a protein of Mr 33,000. Import requires the membrane potential and external nucleotide triphosphate. The presequence inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane, and import proceeds via a process similar to other proteins destined for the inner membrane or matrix. A mutant phosphate transporter lacking 35 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of the presequence has little capacity for mitochondrial import. The rat liver phosphate transporter is also imported and processed by rat kidney mitochondria and by mitochondria from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A site-directed mutation of the N-ethyl-maleimide reactive cysteine 41 does not affect import or processing. The results presented show that optimal import of the mitochondrial phosphate transporter, unlike the ADP/ATP carrier and the brown fat uncoupling protein, is dependent on a presequence. As these carriers are believed to have evolved from a single gene, it seems likely that the H+/Pi carrier, known to be present in prokaryotes, appeared first and that subsequent evolutionary events leading to the other anion carriers eliminated the presequence."
https://openalex.org/W1536619868,"The cDNAs encoding two isoforms, S (slow) and F (fast), of alpha 1-antiproteinase (also referred to as alpha 1-antitrypsin or alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor) as well as contrapsin were obtained by screening lambda gt11 cDNA library prepared fro inflamed guinea pig liver. The sequence analyses of these cDNAs and NH2-terminal peptides of the purified proteins revealed that both isoforms of alpha 1-antiproteinase consist of 405 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 24 residues and that contrapsin consists of 410 amino acid residues with the same length of the signal peptide. Guinea pig contrapsin had 89, 88, 62, 42, and 41% homology to its own alpha 1-antiproteinases F and S, rat alpha 1-antiproteinase, mouse and rat contrapsins, respectively. This suggests that guinea pig contrapsin is not orthologous to mouse and rat contrapsins and that it developed from a much later duplication of alpha 1-antiproteinase gene after the guinea pig had diverged from the murine lineage. The available data suggest that the reactive site region of alpha 1-antiproteinase can be categorized into orthodox and unorthodox types: the former has P3-P'3 consensus sequence of Xaa-Pro-Met-Ser-Xaa-Pro, where Xaa is Leu, Ile, Val, or Met, while the latter, which occurs in species having multiple alpha 1-antiproteinase isoforms, has the sequence whose P1 Met has changed to other amino acids. Thus, the reactive site region of the orthodox type, which occurs in all seven mammals examined to date, is highly conserved. This is in marked contrast to the fact that the same region is hypervariable among the paralogous proteins belonging to the serpin superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1503284069,All five subunits of yeast mitochondrial F1-ATPase have been isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This procedure allows micro-preparative purification of all the subunits with 60% recoveries. The complete amino acid sequence of the epsilon-subunit has been established. This has been achieved by the sequence analysis of subnanomole amounts of the intact molecule and that of peptides derived by enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase Arg-C and by chemical cleavage with hydroxylamine. Yeast ATP synthase epsilon-subunit is composed of 61 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 6612 Da. This polypeptide is rather basic since it contains 7 basic residues and 3 acidic residues.

https://openalex.org/W1541210620,"Striated muscle thin filaments contain many troponin molecules, which contact each other indirectly via tropomyosin and actin. Such allosteric interactions between troponin molecules may be responsible for cooperative Ca2+ binding to the regulatory sites of the cardiac thin filament (Tobacman, L. S., and Sawyer, D. S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 931-939). To test whether thin filament-bound troponin molecules interact, we studied the competitive binding of troponin and troponin T-troponin I (an inhibitory complex lacking the Ca2+ binding subunit troponin C) to actin-tropomyosin. The relative affinities of these two forms of troponin for the thin filament depended upon their relative concentrations. Under conditions where total binding was saturated, each form binds with greater apparent affinity to sites that have similar neighbors. A theoretical model for competitive binding of two ligands to interacting sites on a linear lattice was developed and fit to the data. Surprisingly, energetically unfavorable interactions occurred between adjacent troponin and troponin T-troponin I molecules not only in the presence of Ca2+, but also in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid and/or myosin subfragment 1. Removal of Ca2+ strengthened the affinity of troponin for the thin filament less than 50%. These results suggest that, even in the absence of myosin, long range allosteric interactions occur between troponin molecules. The detailed involvement of tropomyosin and actin in these interactions remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1527095301,"After adipocytes were labeled with Na2[35SO4], immunoadsorbed with immobilized antilipoprotein lipase, and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and fluorography, a labeled band was identified at 59,700 daltons, the molecular mass of chicken lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Excess unlabeled LPL prevented the immunoadsorption of this labeled species, hence the labeled species was determined to be LPL. Digestion of LPL with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) caused a shift in mobility of LPL in SDS-PAGE with no loss of radioactivity, whereas digestion with glycopeptidase F resulted in removal of 99% of the radioactivity. Adipocytes cultured with Trans35S-label and tunicamycin produced an LPL species of 52,000 daltons, but tunicamycin abolished the incorporation of 35SO4 into LPL. This established that 35SO4 was incorporated into an N-linked oligosaccharide of LPL. Endo H digestion of pulse-chase labeled LPL revealed the presence of two complex and one high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides. A single 35SO4-labeled tryptic peptide was isolated by reverse phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide established that the 35SO4 oligosaccharide is conjugated at Asn-45. Behavior of the 35SO4-labeled oligosaccharide on concanavalin A-agarose, sequential exoglycosidase digestion, and chemical analysis of the 35SO4 oligosaccharide confirms that this moiety is of the complex type. Sequential exoglycosidase digestion, thin layer chromatography of the released monosaccharides, and the use of glycosylation inhibitors established that the sulfated sugar is a core N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The data show that chicken LPL contains two complex and one high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides and that 35SO4 is incorporated into LPL on a GlcNAc residue of a complex oligosaccharide located at Asn-45."
https://openalex.org/W1533180318,"Sodium-dependent alanine transport in plasma membrane vesicles from rat liver was inactivated in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion by prior treatment of membranes with the acylating reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). Both components of Na+/alanine cotransport (systems A and ASC) were inhibited. Exposure of vesicles to p-bromophenacyl bromide and methyl p-nitrobenzenesulfonate, which share with DEPC reactivity against histidine residues, also led to inhibition of alanine transport through systems A and ASC. The presence of Na+ (100 mM NaCl) and L-alanine (10 mM) during exposure to vesicles to DEPC protected against inactivation of system A (but not system ASC) transport activity. This protective effect was specific and required the presence of L-alanine since the presence of L-phenylalanine alone (10 mM) or L-phenylalanine plus Na+ (100 mM NaCl) did not cause any detectable protection. This overall pattern of protection is opposite to that previously found against specific sulfhydryl reagents (i.e. N-ethylmaleimide), where protection of system ASC was nearly maximal. The pH profile for DEPC-dependent inhibition of system A transport activity suggests modification of amino acid residue(s) with a pKr of approximately 7, most likely histidine(s), in close parallel with the pH dependence of system A transport activity. Our results suggest the presence of critical histidine residues on the system A carrier that may be responsible for the pH dependence of system A transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1646673644,"The relationship between global RNA transcription capacity and transcript initiation, attenuation, and stability in the rplKAJLrpoBC operon of Escherichia coli has been examined. The rplKAJLrpoBC operon encodes in order the four large ribosome subunit proteins, L11, L1, L10, and L12, and the two large beta and beta' subunits of RNA polymerase. Operon transcripts are initiated at two promoters, PL11 and PL10. The L12-beta intergenic space contains a transcription attenuator which, during balanced growth, terminates about 80% of the transcripts exiting the L12 gene; the remaining transcripts read through into the beta and beta' encoding genes. The capacity for global transcription initiation was modulated using a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive, initiation-defective mutation in rpoC. Following a shift to 39 degrees C, the global transcription initiation capacity was reduced to about one-half the level at 30 degrees C. This partial restriction resulted in a decrease in the stability of distal beta mRNA, whereas the stability of proximal L11-L1 and L10-L12 mRNA was not changed. Measurements of the synthesis rates of L11-L1, L10-L12, and beta mRNAs relative to total RNA synthesis indicated that this operon was selectively transcribed when the initiation capacity of RNA polymerase was limited. The synthesis rates of L11-L1 and L10-L12 mRNA increased about 2-fold, whereas the synthesis rate of beta mRNA increased nearly 5-fold. The relative transcription of other ribosome component genes and the alpha subunit gene exhibited only a modest increase during the partial restriction. Protection from S1 nuclease was used to demonstrate that the preferential transcription within the operon of beta mRNA was the consequence of active regulation of termination-antitermination at the attenuator structure in the L12-beta intergenic space. These results demonstrate that global transcription capacity may be an important parameter in determining both initiation and attenuation of transcription of the rplKAJLrpoBC ribosomal protein-RNA polymerase operon."
https://openalex.org/W1503122327,"The glucocorticoid receptor is present in the cytosol of cell extracts as a large nonactivated (i.e. non-DNA-binding) approximately 9 S (Mr 300,000) complex. Experimental evidence indicates that the purified nonactivated glucocorticoid receptor contains a single steroid-binding protein and two approximately 90-kDa nonsteroid-binding subunits identified as heat shock protein (hsp) 90. Translation of the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in vitro in reticulocyte lysates produces a large nonactivated glucocorticoid receptor complex similar to that found in cytosols. The cell-free synthesized glucocorticoid receptor is able to bind steroid and can be activated further to the DNA-binding form. To test the hypothesis of an active role played by hsp90 in the stabilization of a competent steroid-binding conformation of the glucocorticoid receptor, we have synthesized the receptor in a reticulocyte lysate that has been depleted of hsp90 by immunoadsorption with AC88 anti-hsp90. Although the translation capacity of the reticulocyte system was reduced considerably upon hsp90 removal, the glucocorticoid receptor was synthesized, and a significant number of molecules were found to bind [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose showed that most of the receptor molecules synthesized in hsp90-depleted lysate had lost the capacity to form an oligomeric receptor complex. Addition of purified rat liver hsp90 to the hsp90-depleted lysate before translation did not increase steroid binding nor did it restore formation of the heteromeric receptor complex. Analysis of [35S] methionine-labeled glucocorticoid receptor molecules synthesized in the hsp90-depleted lysate showed the production of polypeptides differing from the expected chromatographic pattern on DEAE-cellulose. Upon addition of purified hsp90 to the hsp90-depleted lysate, before translation, the 35S-labeled synthesized receptor fractionated on DEAE-cellulose as an intermediate peak between activated and nonactivated receptor forms. The data suggest that hsp90 alone may not be sufficient for the formation of the nonactivated steroid receptor complex."
