https://openalex.org/W3094239751,"In the frontline of the pandemic stand healthcare workers and public service providers, occupations which have proven to be associated with increased mental health problems during pandemic crises. This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected data from 1773 healthcare workers and public service providers throughout Norway between March 31, 2020 and April 7, 2020, which encompasses a timeframe where all non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) were held constant. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression were assessed by the Norwegian version of the PTSD checklist (PCL-5), General Anxiety Disorder –7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Health anxiety and specific predictors were assessed with specific items. Multiple regression analysis was used for predictor analysis. A total of 28.9% of the sample had clinical or subclinical symptoms of PTSD, and 21.2% and 20.5% were above the established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. Those working directly in contrast to indirectly with COVID-19 patients had significantly higher PTSD symptoms. Worries about job and economy, negative metacognitions, burnout, health anxiety and emotional support were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, after controlling for demographic variables and psychological symptoms. Health workers and public service providers are experiencing high levels of PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health workers working directly with COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depression compared to those working indirectly. Appropriate action to monitor and reduce PTSD, anxiety, and depression among these groups of individuals working in the frontline of pandemic with crucial societal roles should be taken immediately."
https://openalex.org/W3093539402,"Aging is associated with reduced fitness and increased myeloid bias of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, causing increased risk of immune compromise, anemia, and malignancy. We show that mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) can be used to prospectively isolate chronologically old HSCs with transcriptional features and functional attributes characteristic of young HSCs, including a high rate of transcription and balanced lineage-affiliated programs. Strikingly, MMP is a stronger determinant of the quantitative and qualitative transcriptional state of HSCs than chronological age, and transcriptional consequences of manipulation of MMP in HSCs within their native niche suggest a causal relationship. Accordingly, we show that pharmacological enhancement of MMP in old HSCs in vivo increases engraftment potential upon transplantation and reverses myeloid-biased peripheral blood output at steady state. Our results demonstrate that MMP is a source of heterogeneity in old HSCs, and its pharmacological manipulation can alter transcriptional programs with beneficial consequences for function."
https://openalex.org/W3093940085,"Conflicting information surrounding COVID-19 abounds, from disagreement over the effectiveness of face masks in preventing viral transmission to competing claims about the promise of certain treatments. Despite the potential for conflicting information about COVID-19 to produce adverse public health effects, little is known about whether the U.S. public notices this information, and whether certain population subgroups are particularly likely to do so. To address these questions, we fielded a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults in late April 2020 (N = 1,007). Results showed substantial self-reported exposure to conflicting information about COVID-19, with nearly 75% of participants reporting having recently heard such information from health experts, politicians, and/or others. Participants perceived disagreement across a range of COVID-19-related issues, though from politicians more than health experts. Factors including political affiliation, information source use, and personal experience with COVID-19 were associated with perceptions of disagreement. Future research should consider potential cognitive and behavioral consequences of such perceptions."
https://openalex.org/W3094401292,"As a novel concept of responding to disease epidemics, Fangcang shelter hospitals were deployed to expand the health system’s capacity and provide medical services for non-severe COVID-19 patients during the outbreak in Wuhan. To give insights on patient management within Fangcang hospitals, we conducted a retrospective analysis to: 1) describe the characteristics of the patients admitted to Fangcang hospitals and 2) explore risk factors for longer length of stay (LOS). We enrolled 136 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms, who were hospitalized in the Wuti Fangcang Hospital. 58 patients completed the treatment and discharged before 1 March 2020. After describing patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics, exposure history, treatment received and time course of the disease, we conducted linear regression analysis to identify factors influencing LOS. We found that patients having fever before admission were hospitalized 3.5 days (95%CI 1.39 to 5.63, p = 0.002) longer than those without fever and that patients having bilateral pneumonia were hospitalized 3.4 days (95%CI 0.49 to 6.25, p = 0.023) longer than those with normal CT scan results. We also found weak evidence suggesting that patients with diabetes were hospitalized 3.2 days longer than those without diabetes (95%CI -0.2 to 6.56, p = 0.065). However, we observed no significant differences in LOS between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and between patients who received treatment and those without treatment. Longer duration of hospitalization among non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with having fever, bilateral pneumonia on CT scan and diabetes. However, being asymptomatic and using supportive medications at the early stage of infection do not have significant influences on LOS. Our study is a single-centered study with relatively small sample size. The findings provide evidence for predicting hospital bed demand in a novel response scenario and may help decision-makers in preparing for ramping up the health system capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3094537525,"Recent studies have indicated oligodendroglial-vascular crosstalk during brain development, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We report that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) contact sprouting endothelial tip cells in mouse, ferret, and human neonatal white matter. Using transgenic mice, we show that increased or decreased OPC density results in cognate changes in white matter vascular investment. Hypoxia induced increases in OPC numbers, vessel density and endothelial cell expression of the Wnt pathway targets Apcdd1 and Axin2 in white matter, suggesting paracrine OPC-endothelial signaling. Conditional knockout of OPC Wntless resulted in diminished white matter vascular growth in normoxia, whereas loss of Wnt7a/b function blunted the angiogenic response to hypoxia, resulting in severe white matter damage. These findings indicate that OPC-endothelial cell interactions regulate neonatal white matter vascular development in a Wnt-dependent manner and further suggest this mechanism is important in attenuating hypoxic injury."
https://openalex.org/W3094147753,"Global climate change accompanied by continuous increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperature affects the growth and yield of important crops. The present study investigated the effect of elevated temperature and CO2 concentrations on the growth, yield, and photosynthesis of potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Superior) crops using Korean Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research chambers that allow the regulation of temperature and CO2 concentration under daylight conditions. Based on the average temperature from 1991 to 2010 in the Jeonju area, South Korea, potato plants were exposed to four different conditions: ambient weather (400 μmol mol-1, aCaT), elevated temperature (+4°C, aCeT), elevated CO2 concentration (800 μmol mol-1, eCaT), and concurrently elevated CO2 concentration and temperature (eCeT). Under aCeT conditions, the temperature exceeded the optimal growth temperature range towards the late growth phase that decreased stomatal conductance and canopy net photosynthetic rate and subsequently reduced biomass and tuber yield. Stomatal conductance and chlorophyll concentration were lower under eCaT conditions than under aCaT conditions, whereas late-growth phase biomass and tuber yield were greater. Compared to other conditions, eCeT yielded a distinct increase in growth and development and canopy net photosynthetic rate during tuber initiation and bulking. Consequently, biomass and canopy net photosynthesis increased, and tuber yield increased by 20.3%, which could be attributed to the increased tuber size, rather than increased tuber number. Elevated CO2 reduced chlorophyll, magnesium, and phosphorus concentrations; reducing nitrogen concentration (by approximately 39.7%) increased the C:N ratio. The data indicate that future climate conditions will likely change nutrient concentration and quality of crops. The present study shows that while elevated temperature may negatively influence the growth and yield of potato crops, especially towards the late-growth phase, the concurrent and appropriate elevation of CO2 and temperature could promote balanced development of source and sink organs and positively effect potato productivity and quality."
https://openalex.org/W3093496117,"Random population-based surveys to estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are useful to understand distributions and predictors of the infection. In April 2020, the first-ever nationally representative survey in Canada polled 4,240 adults age 18 years and older about self-reported COVID experience in March, early in the epidemic. We examined the levels and predictors of COVID symptoms, defined as fever plus difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, dry cough so severe that it disrupts sleep, and/or loss of sense of smell; and testing for SARS-CoV-2 by respondents and/or household members. About 8% of Canadians reported that they and/or one or more household members experienced COVID symptoms. Symptoms were more common in younger than in older adults, and among visible minorities. Overall, only 3% of respondents and/or household members reported testing for SARS-CoV-2. Being tested was associated with having COVID symptoms, Indigenous identity, and living in Quebec. Periodic nationally representative surveys of symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are required in many countries to understand the pandemic and prepare for the future."
https://openalex.org/W3093546542,"Background Crude case-fatality rates (CFRs) for COVID-19 vary widely between countries. There are serious limitations in the CFRs when making comparisons. We examined how the age distribution of the cases is responsible for the COVID-19 CFR differences between countries. Methods COVID-19 cases and deaths, by ten-year age-groups, were available from the reports of seven countries. The overall and age-specific CFRs were computed for each country. The age-adjusted CFRs were computed by the direct method, using the combined number of cases in all seven countries in each age group as the standard population. A meta-analytic approach was used to obtain pooled age-specific CFRs. Findings The crude overall CFRs varied between 0.82% and 14.2% in the seven countries and the variation in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller. There was wide variation in the age distribution of the cases between countries. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest CFR to that with the lowest (6.28) was much lower for the age-adjusted CFRs rates (2.57). Conclusions The age structure of the cases explains much of differences in the crude CFRs between countries and adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the definition of cases, coding of deaths and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation. It is misleading to compare the crude COVID-19 CFRs between countries and should be avoided. At the very least, age-specific and age-adjusted CFRs should be used for comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W3094482919,"Clear and findable publishing policies are important for authors to choose appropriate journals for publication. We investigated the clarity of policies of 171 major academic journals across disciplines regarding peer review and preprinting. 31.6% of journals surveyed do not provide information on the type of peer review they use. Information on whether preprints can be posted or not is unclear in 39.2% of journals. 58.5% of journals offer no clear information on whether reviewer identities are revealed to authors. Around 75% of journals have no clear policy on co-reviewing, citation of preprints, and publication of reviewer identities. Information regarding practices of open peer review is even more scarce, with <20% of journals providing clear information. Having found a lack of clear information, we conclude by examining the implications this has for researchers (especially early career) and the spread of open research practices."
https://openalex.org/W3093745530,"Testing is viewed as a critical aspect of any strategy to tackle epidemics. Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3094398827,"Background Interprofessional Education (IPE) aims to improve students’ attitudes towards collaboration, teamwork, and leads to improved patient care upon graduation. However, the best time to introduce IPE into the undergraduate curriculum is still under debate. Methods We used a mixed-methods design based on a sequential explanatory model. Medical students from all six years at the University of Bern, Switzerland (n = 683) completed an online survey about attitudes towards interprofessional learning using a scale validated for German speakers (G-IPAS). Thirty-one medical students participated in nine semi-structured interviews focusing on their experience in interprofessional learning and on the possible impact it might have on their professional development. Results Women showed better attitudes in the G-IPAS across all years (p = 0,007). Pre-clinical students showed more positive attitudes towards IPE [Year 1 to Year 3 (p = 0.011)]. Students correctly defined IPE and its core dimensions. They appealed for more organized IPE interventions throughout the curriculum. Students also acknowledged the relevance of IPE for their future professional performance. Conclusions These findings support an early introduction of IPE into the medical curriculum. Although students realise that interprofessional learning is fundamental to high-quality patient care, there are still obstacles and stereotypes to overcome. Trial registration ISRCTN 41715934."
https://openalex.org/W3093631491,"Background Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the standard therapy for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPC). Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-based stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as an alternative option to postpone starting ADT and its associated side effects including the development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine progression free-survival (PFS) and treatment failure free-survival (TFFS) after PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT in OMPC patients. The efficacy and safety of single fraction radiosurgery (SFRS) and ADT delay were investigated. Methods Patients with ≤5 metastases from OMPC, with/without ADT treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. PFS and TFFS were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and ADT-free survival (ADTFS). Results Fifty patients with a total of 75 metastases detected by PSMA-PET/CT were analyzed. At the time of SBRT, 70% of patients were castration-sensitive. Overall, 80% of metastases were treated with SFRS (median dose 20 Gy, range: 16-25). After median follow-up of 34 months (range: 5-70) median PFS and TFFS were 12 months (range: 2-63) and 14 months (range: 2-70), respectively. Thirty-two (64%) patients had repeat oligometastatic disease. Twenty-four (48%) patients with progression underwent second SBRT course. Two-year LC after SFRS was 96%. Grade 1 and 2 toxicity occurred in 3 (6%) and 1 (2%) patients, respectively. ADTFS and OS rates at 2-years were 60.5% and 100%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, TFFS significantly improved in patients with time to first metastasis (TTM) >36 months (p = 0.01) and PSA before SBRT ≤1 ng/ml (p = 0.03). Conclusion For patients with OMPC, SBRT might be used as an alternative to ADT. This way, the start/escalation of palliative ADT and its side effects can be deferred. Metastases treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SFRS reached excellent LC with minimal toxicity. Low PSA levels and longer TTM predict elongated TFFS."
https://openalex.org/W3094469335,"Objectives Up to 10% of Bladder Cancers may arise following occupational exposure to carcinogens. We hypothesised that different cancer phenotypes reflected different patterns of occupational exposure. Methods Consecutive participants, with bladder cancer, self-completed a structured questionnaire detailing employment, tasks, exposures, smoking, lifestyle and family history. Our primary outcome was association between cancer phenotype and occupational details. Results We collected questionnaires from 536 patients, of whom 454 (85%) participants (352 men and 102 women) were included. Women were less likely to be smokers (68% vs. 81% Chi sq. p<0.001), but more likely than men to inhale environmental tobacco smoke at home (82% vs. 74% p = 0.08) and use hair dye (56% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Contact with potential carcinogens occurred in 282 (62%) participants (mean 3.1 per worker (range 0–14)). High-grade cancer was more common than low-grade disease in workers from the steel, foundry, metal, engineering and transport industries (p<0.05), and in workers exposed to crack detection dyes, chromium, coal/oil/gas by-products, diesel fumes/fuel/aircraft fuel and solvents (such as trichloroethylene). Higher staged cancers were frequent in workers exposed to Chromium, coal products and diesel exhaust fumes/fuel (p<0.05). Various workers (e.g. exposed to diesel fuels or fumes (Cox, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.31–2.98) p = 0.001), employed in a garage (HR 2.19 (95% CI 1.31–3.63) p = 0.001), undertaking plumbing/gas fitting/ventilation (HR 2.15 (95% CI 1.15–4.01) p = 0.017), undertaking welding (HR 1.85 (95% CI 1.24–2.77) p = 0.003) and exposed to welding materials (HR 1.92 (95% CI 1.27–2.91) p = 0.002)) were more likely to have disease progression and receive radical treatment than others. Fewer than expected deaths were seen in healthcare workers (HR 0.17 (95% CI 0.04–0.70) p = 0.014). Conclusions We identified multiple occupational tasks and contacts associated with bladder cancer. There were some associations with phenotype, although our study design precludes robust assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3094560380,"Background Long distances to facilities, topographical constraints, inadequate service capacity of institutions and insufficient/ rudimentary road & transportation network culminate into unprecedented barriers to access. These barriers gets exacerbated in presence of external factors like conflict and political disruptions. Thus, this study was conducted in rural, remote and fragile region in India measuring geographical accessibility and modelling spatial coverage of public healthcare network. Methods Vector and raster based approaches were used to discern accessibility for various packages of service delivery. Alternative scenarios derived from local experiences were modelled using health facility, population and ancillary data. Based on that, a raster surface of travel time between facilities and population was developed by incorporating terrain, physical barriers, topography and travelling modes and speeds through various land-cover classes. Concomitantly, spatial coverage was modelled to delineate catchment areas. Further, underserved population and zonal statistics were assessed in an interactive modelling approach to ascertain spatial relationship between population, travel time and zonal boundaries. Finally, raster surface of travel time was re-modelled for the conflict situation in villages vulnerable to obstruction of access due to disturbed security scenario. Results Euclidean buffers revealed 11% villages without ambulatory & immunization care within 2 km radius. Similarly, for 5 km radius, 11% and 12% villages were bereft of delivery and inpatient care. Travel time accessibility analysis divulged walking scenario exhibiting lowest level of accessibility. Enabling motorized travel improved accessibility measures, with highest degree of accessibility for privately owned vehicle (motorcycle and cars). Differential results were found between packages of services where ambulatory & immunization care was relatively accessible by walking; whereas, delivery and inpatient care had a staggering average of three hours walking time. Even with best scenario, around 2/3rd population remained unserved for all package of services. Moreover, 90% villages in conflict zone grapples with inaccessibility when the scenario of heightened border tensions was considered. Conclusions Our study demonstrated the application of GIS technique to facilitate evidence backed planning at granular level. Regardless of the scenario, the analysis divulged inaccessibility to delivery and inpatient care to be most pronounced and majority of population to be unserved. It was suggested to have concerted efforts to bolster already existing facilities and adapt systems approach to exploit synergies of inter-sectoral development."
https://openalex.org/W3093691879,"Background We examined serum kynurenine levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and the relationship between serum kynurenine and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic hepatitis C. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 604 patients with HCC diagnosed between January 1999 and December 2015, and 288 patients without HCC who were seen at the National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center between October 2014 and November 2017. The association between serum kynurenine and prognosis was evaluated using the Cox’s proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Patients with HCC had significantly higher values of serum kynurenine than patients without HCC (median: 557.1 vs. 464.2 ng/mL, p<0.001). Five-year survival rates of HCC patients with serum kynurenine ≥900 (n = 65), 600–899 (n = 194), and <600 ng/mL (n = 345) were 30.6%, 47.4%, and 61.4%, respectively (p = 0.001, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis identified serum kynurenine as an independent predictor for prognosis of HCC patients. The hazard ratio of serum kynurenine ≥900, and 600–899 compared with serum kynurenine <600 ng/mL were 1.91 (p<0.001) and 1.37 (p = 0.015), respectively. Conclusions A high level of serum kynurenine correlated with poor prognosis of HCC. Serum kynurenine levels may be a novel biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. The development of drugs that inhibit kynurenine production is expected to help improve the prognosis of patients with HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3093793379,"Background In Brazil malaria is most frequent in the Amazon region, mainly in the Amazonas state, where it is found the most proportion of indigenous people of the whole country. It is remarkable publications about malaria in the Amazon, although information on malaria in indigenous populations is still poorly explored. Objective Identify factors associated with malaria in indigenous populations. Methods Cross-sectional study of positive cases of malaria in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, from 2007 to 2016. Secondary data were obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System for Malaria and from the Mortality Information System, both from Brazil. To tackle with race missing data, cases with no race fulfilled were classified according to the probable location where infection occurred. This way, was imputed indigenous race for those which the probable infection location was indigenous village (aldeia). Variables tested with race were: sex, age, schooling, microscope surveillance slide type, parasitic infection species, parasitemia level, and timeliness of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used. Results A total of 1,055,852 cases of malaria were notified in the state of Amazonas. Among the factors that associate malaria and indigenous peoples, the most significant were sex, children and high levels of parasitemia. The magnitude of Plasmodium vivax infection is higher than Plasmodium falciparum, although this parasite was more frequent in indigenous than other races. In regards to mortality, 109 deaths were registered, most of them related to P. vivax. Conclusion The findings underscore the importance of look at indigenous people differently of other races. The associated factors highlight a profile of cases severity, because of highest parasitemia, many cases of P. falciparum although high frequency of P. vivax, and children. Furthermore, the mortality in indigenous, specially in older people is worrying"
https://openalex.org/W3094057882,"Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPT-PCR) is commonly used to analyze gene expression, however, the accuracy of the normalized results is affected by the expression stability of reference genes. Holotrichia oblita (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) causes serious damage to crops. Reliable reference genes in H. oblita are needed for qRT-PCR analysis. Therefore, we evaluated 13 reference genes under biotic and abiotic conditions. RefFinder provided a comprehensive stability ranking, and geNorm suggested the optimal number of reference genes for normalization. RPL13a and RPL18 were the most suitable reference genes for developmental stages, tissues, and temperature treatments; RPL13a and RPS3 were the most suitable for pesticide and photoperiod treatments; RPS18 and RPL18 were the most suitable for the two sexes. We validated the normalized results using odorant-binding protein genes as target genes in different tissues. Compared with the selected suitable reference genes, the expression of OBP1 in antennae, abdomen, and wings, and OBP2 in antennae and wings were overestimated due to the instability of ACTb. These results identified several reliable reference genes in H. oblita for normalization, and are valuable for future molecular studies."
https://openalex.org/W3094085870,"There has been an upsurge of e-cigarette use in the United States in recent years. While e-cigarettes may contain lower levels of toxic chemicals than combusted cigarettes, they still pose serious health hazards, including increased risk for heart and respiratory disease. Despite these risks, public awareness of the health harms of e-cigarettes remains low. Thus, it is important to educate the public about the potential harms of e-cigarettes. This study took themes commonly found in antismoking messages and used them to develop messages about harms of e-cigarettes. A national sample of 2801 current smokers and nonsmokers (aged 18+ years) were randomized to view one of four e-cigarette messages (harmful effect of chemicals, uncertainty about ingredients, distrust of big tobacco, or cost of vaping) or a control message (bottled water ad). Participants’ reactions to the messages and behavioral intentions were assessed immediately following the exposure. MANOVA examined effects of the messages on blocks of the outcome variables and univariate analyses estimated adjusted means for each experimental condition for each outcome. The message about harmful chemicals was perceived as the most informative and effective and elicited the highest levels of negative emotions (Ps<0.05). However, on measures of actual effectiveness, the other messages performed equally well. Specifically, messages with different themes (harmful chemicals, uncertainty about ingredients, anti-industry, or financial cost) increased perceived risk of e-cigarettes, support for e-cigarette control, and lowered self-exempting beliefs and intentions to use e-cigarettes (Ps<0.05). Themes commonly used in anti-smoking messages may be effective in educating the public about the potential harm of e-cigarettes. The observed differential effects of the messages suggest the need to use multiple themes in a public education campaign about e-cigarettes."

We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with CVD risk factors using the non-laboratory Framingham Generalized 10-Year CVD risk score among older people in Malaysia. This was a population-based cross-sectional study using data of 3,375 participants aged ≥60 years from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015. Sociodemographic, health factors and clinical assessments (anthropometry and blood pressure) were included. Complex survey analysis was used to obtain prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We applied ordinal regression to determine the factors associated with CVD risk. The prevalence for the high 10-year CVD risk was 72.1%. Body mass index was higher among those aged 60–69 years in men (25.4kg/m2, 95%CI 25.1–25.8) and women (26.7kg/m2, 95%CI 26.3–27.1) than the other age groups. The factors associated with moderate and high 10-year CVD risk were Malay ethnicity (Odds Ratio(OR) 0.76, 95%CI 0.63–0.92, p = 0.004), unmarried status (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.22–1.97, p<0.001) and physically inactive (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.55–0.95, p = 0.020).

https://openalex.org/W3093653108,"Exposure to disasters is associated with a range of posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories. However, few studies have tracked PTSS for more than a decade postdisaster, and none to our knowledge has explored the role of predisaster resources and vulnerabilities in shaping the likelihood of trajectory membership. The current study included participants from the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina Study (N = 885). Participants were originally part of a community college intervention study and were assessed prior to the hurricane (6–21 months predisaster), and approximately 1 year, 4 years, and 12 years postdisaster. Latent class growth analysis identified PTSS trajectories. Perceived social support, probable mental illness, and physical health conditions or problems–all assessed predisaster–were examined as predictors of trajectory membership at the univariate level and in multivariable models without and with adjustment for disaster exposure. Three PTSS trajectories were detected: Moderate-Decreasing (69.3%), High-Decreasing (23.1%), and High-Stable (7.6%). In the multivariable predictive model without adjustment for disaster exposure, probable predisaster mental illness was significantly associated with greater odds of the High-Decreasing and High-Stable trajectories, and physical health conditions or problems with greater odds of the High-Decreasing trajectory, relative to the Moderate-Decreasing trajectory. However, when disaster exposure was adjusted, only the association between predisaster mental illness and the odds of the High-Stable trajectory remained statistically significant. Lower predisaster perceived social support was significantly associated with membership in the High-Decreasing trajectory, relative to the Moderate-Decreasing, at the univariate level, but not in either multivariable model. Whereas predisaster mental illness confers risk for chronic postdisaster PTSS, other impacts of predisaster resources and vulnerabilities on elevated PTSS trajectories do not go beyond those of disaster exposure. The results support disaster preparedness efforts targeting those with mental and physical health conditions, and postdisaster mental health services addressing preexisting vulnerabilities in addition to disaster-related PTSS."
https://openalex.org/W3093959891,"Aim Several studies in animal models have found that exposure to anesthetics in early life can cause cognitive dysfunction. Human studies show conflicting results and studies of cognitive function after anesthesia and neonatal surgery are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure to anesthesia and abdominal surgery during infancy was associated with cognitive dysfunction from the perspective of educational level, disposable income and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in adolescent and adult individuals. Methods A cohort study with patients born 1976 to 2002 that underwent abdominal surgery during infancy at a pediatric surgical center were matched by age, sex, and gestational age to ten randomly selected individuals from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Individuals with chromosomal aberrations were excluded. Data on highest level of education and annual disposable income were attained from Statistics Sweden and the diagnosis of ADHD were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register. Results 485 individuals and 4835 controls were included. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (24–44) and median age at surgery was seven days (0–365). Three hundred sixty-six individuals (70.0%) underwent surgery during the neonatal period (< 44 gestational weeks). Median operating time was 80 minutes (10–430). The mean age at follow-up was 28 years. Fisher’s exact test for highest level of education for the exposed and unexposed groups were respectively: university 35% and 33%, upper secondary 44% and 47%, compulsory 21% and 20% (p = 0.6718). The median disposable income was 177.7 versus 180.9 TSEK respectively (p = 0.7532). Exposed individuals had a prevalence of ADHD of 5.2% and unexposed 4.4% (p = 0.4191). Conclusions This study shows that exposure to anesthesia and abdominal surgery during infancy is not associated with cognitive dysfunction from the perspective of educational level, disposable income and ADHD in adolescent and adult individuals. Further studies in larger cohorts at earlier gestational ages are needed to verify these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3093706364,"In cancer metastasis, intravasation of the invasive tumor cell (TCi) represents one of the most relevant events. During the last years, models regarding cancer cell intravasation have been proposed, such as the “endocanalicular transendothelial crossing” (ETC) theory. This theory describes the interplay between two adjacent endothelial cells and the TCi or a leukocyte during intravasation. Two endothelial cells create a channel with their cell membranes, in which the cell fits in without involving endothelial cell intercellular junctions, reaching the lumen through a transendothelial passage. In the present study, ten SCID mice were subcutaneously xenotransplanted with the HEK-EBNA293-VEGF-D cell line and euthanized after 35 days. Post-mortem examinations were performed and proper specimens from tumors were collected. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, pAKT, pERK, ZEB-1, TWIST-1, F-actin, E-cadherin and LYVE-1 were performed followed by ultrastructural serial sections analysis. A novel experimental approach involving Computed Tomography (CT) combined with 3D digital model reconstruction was employed. The analysis of activated transcription factors supports that tumor cells at the periphery potentially underwent an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process. Topographical analysis of LYVE-1 immunolabeled lymphatics revealed a peritumoral localisation. TEM investigations of the lymphatic vessels combined with 3D digital modelling enhanced the understanding of the endotheliocytes behavior during TCi intravasation, clarifying the ETC theory. Serial ultrastructural analysis performed within tumor periphery revealed numerous cells during the ETC process. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that ETC is an intravasation mode more frequently used by the TCi than by leukocytes during intravasation in the HEK-EBNA293-VEGF-D xenograft model and lays down the potential basis for promising future studies regarding intravasation blocking therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3093749766,"Purpose Heightened obesity risk among food-insecure food pantry clients is a health equity issue because the co-occurrence of obesity and hunger is deeply-rooted in systematic social disadvantage and historical oppression. This qualitative study examined key stakeholders’ perspectives of the relationship between the U.S. food banking system and obesity disparities among food insecure clients. Methods We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 10 key stakeholders (e.g., food bank director, food bank board member, advocate) who are familiar with food bank operations. Data were transcribed verbatim, coded in NVivo [v11], and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Multiple themes emerged drawing linkages between structural characteristics of the food banking system and disparities in the dual burden of food insecurity and obesity: [a] access to unhealthy food from donors; [b] federal emergency food policy and programming; [c] state-level emergency food policy and programming; [d] geography-based risk profiles; and [e] inadequate food supply versus client need. Interviewees also identified social challenges between system leaders and clients that maintain disparities in obesity risk among individuals with very low food security including: [a] media representation and stereotypes about food pantry clients; [b] mistrust in communities of color; [c] lack of inclusion/representation among food bank system leaders; and [d] access to information. Conclusion Future efforts to alleviate obesity inequities among clients chronically burdened by food insecurity, especially among certain subpopulations of clients, should prioritize policy, systems, and environmental strategies to overcome these structural and social challenges within the food banking system."
https://openalex.org/W3094062346,"The ecological functionality of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is threatened by the loss of wetlands which provide staging and wintering sites for migrating waterbirds. The disappearance of wetland ecosystems due to coastal development prevents birds from completing their migrations, resulting in population declines, and even an eventual collapse of the migration phenomenon. Coastal wetlands are also under threat from global climate change and its consequences, notably sea level rise (SLR), extreme storm events, and accompanying wave and tidal surges. The impacts of SLR are compounded by coastal subsidence and decreasing sedimentation, which can result from coastal development. Thus, important wetlands along the flyway should be assessed for the impacts of climate change and coastal subsidence to plan and implement proactive climate adaptation strategies that include habitat migration and possibility of coastal squeeze. We modelled the impacts of climate change and decreasing sedimentation rates on important bird habitats in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate adaptation strategy that will continue to host migratory birds. Located in the Inner Deep Bay of the Pearl River estuary, Mai Po's tidal flats, coastal mangroves, marshes, and fishponds provide habitat for over 80,000 wintering and passage waterbirds. We applied the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to simulate habitat conversion under two SLR scenarios (1.5m and 2.0m) for 2050, 2075, and 2100 for four accretion rates (2mm/yr, 4 mm/yr, 8 mm/yr, 15 mm/yr). The results showed no discernible impact to habitats until after 2075, but projections for 2100 show that the mangroves, marshes and tidal flats could be impacted in almost all scenarios of SLR and accretion. Under a 1.5m SLR scenario, even at low tide, if accretion levels decrease to 4 mm/yr, the tidal flats will be inundated and with a 2 mm/yr accretion the mangroves will also be inundated. Thus, important shorebird habitats will be lost. During high tide the ponds inside the nature reserve, which are intensively managed to provide high tide roosting sites and other habitats for waterbirds, will also be inundated. Thus, with a 1.5m SLR and declining sedimentation the migratory shorebirds will lose habitat, including the high tide roosting habitats inside the nature reserve. The model also indicates that the fishponds further inland in the Ramsar site will be less impacted. Most fishponds are privately owned and could be developed in the future, including into high rise apartments; thus, securing them for conservation should be an important climate change adaptation strategy for Mai Po, since they provide essential habitats for birds under future climate change scenarios. But Mai Po is only one steppingstone along the EAAF, and hundreds of other wetlands are also threatened by encroaching infrastructure and climate change. Thus, similar analyses for the other wetlands are recommended to develop a flyway-wide climate-adaptation conservation strategy before available options become lost to wetland conversion."
https://openalex.org/W3094146876,"Background Repeated invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is desirable because many neurosurgical pathologies are associated with elevated ICP. On the other hand, it could become a risk for children to repeat sedation, anesthesia, or radiation exposure. As a non-invasive method, measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been revealed to accurately predict increased ICP. However, no studies have indicated a relationship among age, brain, and ventricular parameters in normal children, nor a prediction of increased ICP with artificial intelligence. Methods and findings This study enrolled 400 normal children for control and 75 children with signs of increased ICP between 2009 and 2019. Measurements of the parameters including ONSD on CT were obtained. A supervised machine learning was applied to predict suspected increased ICP based on CT measurements. A linear correlation was shown between ln(age) and mean ONSD (mONSD) in normal children, revealing mONSD = 0.36ln(age)+2.26 (R2 = 0.60). This study revealed a linear correlation of mONSD measured on CT with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. Additionally, the multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. The results of the group comparison between control and suspected increased ICP revealed a statistical significance in mONSD and the width of the ventricles. The study indicated that supervised machine learning application could be applied to predict suspected increased ICP in children, with an accuracy of 94% for training, 91% for test. Conclusions This study clarified three issues regarding ONSD and ICP. Mean ONSD measured on CT was correlated with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. The multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. Mean ONSD and the width of ventricles were statistically significant in children with signs of elevated ICP. Finally, the study showed that machine learning could be used to predict children with suspected increased ICP."

https://openalex.org/W3094373810,"Purpose To investigate the association between the characteristics of the retinal vascular network in the elderly and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in a population-based study. Methods We conducted a population-based study, the Montrachet study (Maculopathy Optic Nerve, nuTRition neurovAsCular, and HEarT disease), in participants aged ≥ 75 years. RNFL thickness was assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Analysis of the retinal vascular network was performed by means of the Singapore “I” Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software based on fundus photography. Results Data from 970 participants were suitable for analysis. Patients with optic neuropathy were excluded. In multivariable analysis, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in the caliber of the six largest arterioles and veins in zone B and the six largest arterioles and veins in zone C was associated with a decrease in global RNFL thickness (β = −1.62 μm, P = 0.001; β = −2.39 μm, P < 0.001; β = −1.56 μm, P = 0.002; and β = −2.64 μm, P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Our study found that decreased retinal vessels caliber were associated with a decreased RNFL thickness in the elderly without optic neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W3094423785,"The high prevalence of postural instability in individuals with intellectual disability (ID) warrants the need for reliable and practical postural control assessments. Stabilometry is a postural control assessment that has been widely used for clinical populations. However, the scant systematic knowledge about the reliability of stabilometric protocols for adults with ID renders results questionable and limits its value for clinicians and researchers. The study's purpose was to develop a stabilometric protocol for adults with and without ID based on optimal combinations of shortest necessary trial durations and the least number of trial repetitions that guarantee sufficient reliability. Participants performed six trials of bipedal standing in 2 vision (eyes open vs eyes closed) x 2 surface (solid vs compliant) conditions on a force platform. Several parameters were calculated from the first 10-, 20-, and 30-s interval of every center-of-pressure (COP) trial data. For different trial durations, we identified the number of trials that yielded acceptable relative (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.70) and absolute (standard error of measurement < 20%) reliability using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. To determine the optimal combination of trial duration and number of repetition for each COP parameter, we implemented a two-step process: 1) identify the largest number of repetition for each of the three trial durations and then 2) select the trial duration with the lowest number of repetition. For both ID- and non-ID groups, we observed a trend whereby shorter trial durations required more repetitions and vice versa. The phase plane and ellipse area were the most and least reliable center-of-pressure parameter, respectively. To achieve acceptable reliability, four 30-s trials of each experimental condition appeared to be optimal for testing participants with and without ID alike. The results of this research can inform stabilometric test protocols of future postural control studies of adults with ID."
https://openalex.org/W3093901158,"Background Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is an idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with acute heart failure during the peripartum period. It is common in patients of African ancestry. Currently, there is paucity of data on the burden, predictors and outcomes of PPCM in Uganda. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, predictors and six-month outcomes of PPCM in an adult cohort attending a tertiary specialised cardiology centre in Kampala, Uganda. Methods This study consecutively enrolled 236 women presenting with features of acute heart failure in the peripartum period. Clinical evaluation and echocardiography were performed on all the enrolled women. PCCM was defined according to recommendations of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on PPCM. Poor outcome at six months of follow-up was defined as presence of any of the following: death of a mother or her baby, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV or failure to achieve complete recovery of left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤55%). Results The median age, BMI and parity of the study participants was 31.5 (25.5–38.0) years, 28.3 (26.4–29.7) and 3 (2–4) respectively. The prevalence of PPCM was 17.4% (n = 41/236). Multiple pregnancy was the only predictor of PPCM in this study population (OR 4.3 95% CI 1.16–16.05, p = 0.029). Poor outcome at six-months was observed in about 54% of the patients with PPCM (n = 4, 9.8% in NYHA functional class III-IV and n = 22, 53.7% with LVEF <55%). No maternal or foetal mortality was documented. Conclusion PPCM is relatively common in Uganda and is associated with multiple pregnancy. Poor outcomes especially absence of complete recovery of left ventricular function are also common. Large studies to further investigate long-term maternal and foetal outcomes in Uganda are justified."
https://openalex.org/W3094006366,"Conservation of migratory species requires anticipating the potential impacts of extreme climatic events, such as extreme drought. During drought, reduced habitat availability for shorebirds creates the potential for changes in their abundance and distribution, in part because many species are highly mobile and rely on networks of interior and coastal habitats. Understanding how shorebirds responded to a recent drought cycle that peaked from 2013 to 2015 in central California, USA, will help optimize management of wetlands and fresh water for wildlife. In the Central Valley, a vast interior region that is characterized by a mosaic of wetlands and agricultural lands, we found 22% and 29% decreases in the annual abundance of shorebirds during periods of 3-year drought (2013–2015) and 2-year extreme drought (2014–2015), respectively, when compared to non-drought years. Lower abundance of shorebirds coincided with significant decreases in the mean proportion flooded of survey units (7% and 9%, respectively) that were reliant on fresh water. Drought was associated with lower abundance within both the interior Central Valley and coastal San Francisco Bay for greater and lesser yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca and T. flavipes) and long- and short-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus and L. griseus). Only dunlins (Calidris alpina) had patterns of abundance that suggested substantial shifts in distribution between the Central Valley and coastal regions of San Francisco Bay and Point Reyes. Our results indicate that drought has the potential to reduce, at least temporally, shorebird populations and flooded habitat in the Central Valley, and the ability to respond to drought by taking advantage of nearby coastal habitats may limit the long-term effects of drought on some species. Successful conservation strategies must balance the impacts of reduced habitat availability at interior sites with the ability of some migratory shorebirds to adapt rapidly to shifting distributions of resources."
https://openalex.org/W3094385503,"Games involving virtual worlds are popular in several segments of the population and societies. The online environment facilitates that players from different countries interact in a common virtual world. Virtual worlds involving social and economic interactions are particularly useful to test social and economic theories. Using data from EVE Online, a massive online multi-player game simulating a fantasy galaxy, we analyse the relation between the real-world context in which players live and their in-game behaviour at the country level. We find that in-game aggressiveness to non-player characters is positively related to real-world levels of aggressiveness as measured by the Global Peace Index and the Global Terrorist Index at the country level. The opposite is true for in-game aggressiveness towards other players, which seems to work as a safety valve for real-world player aggressiveness. The ability to make in-game friends is also positively related to real-world levels of aggressiveness in much the same way. In-game trading behaviour is dependent on the macro-economic environment where players live. The unemployment rate and exchange rate make players trade more efficiently and cautiously in-game. Overall, we find evidence that the real-world environment affects in-game behaviour, suggesting that virtual worlds can be used to experiment and test social and economic theories, and to infer real-world behaviour at the country level."
https://openalex.org/W3094409866,"Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which includes Exposure and Response (ERP) is a highly effective, gold standard treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Nonetheless, not all patients with OCD significantly benefit from CBT. This has generated interest in the potential benefits of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs), either integrated with CBT, to enhance engagement with ERP tasks, or delivered as a stand-alone, first-line or therapy to augment CBT. This paper reports on two qualitative studies that involved a thematic analysis of interview data with participants in a 10-week Mindfulness-Based ERP (MB-ERP) course (study 1) and a 9-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy course adapted for OCD (MBCT-OCD) (study 2). Whilst MB-ERP integrated a mindfulness component into a standard ERP protocol, MBCT-OCD adapted the psychoeducational components of the standard MBCT for depression protocol to suit OCD, but without explicit ERP tasks. Three common main themes emerged across MB-ERP and MBCT-OCD: 'satisfaction with course features', 'acceptability of key therapeutic tasks 'and 'using mindfulness to respond differently to OCD'. Sub-themes identified under the first two main themes were mostly unique to MB-ERP or MBCT-OCD, with the exception of '(struggles with) developing a mindfulness practice routine' whilst most of the sub-themes under the last main theme were shared across MB-ERP and MBCT-OCD participants. Findings suggested that participants generally perceived both MBIs as acceptable and potentially beneficial treatments for OCD, in line with theorised mechanisms of change."
https://openalex.org/W3093626274,"Background The patterns of blood pressure trajectory (i.e., change over time) over life-course remain to be explored. In this study, we aim to determine the trajectories of systolic blood pressure (SBP) from adulthood to late life and to assess its impact on the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Methods Based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a total of 3566 participants aged 20–50 years at baseline (1989) with at least three SBP measurements during 1989–2011 were included. SBP was measured through physical examination, and socio-demographic factors, lifestyles, medications, and CVDs were based on self-reported questionnaire. Latent class growth modeling was performed to examine SBP trajectory. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from logistic regression was used to determine the association between SBP trajectory and CVDs. Results Five trajectory groups of SBP were identified: Class 1: rapid increase (n = 113, 3.2%); Class 2: slight increase (n = 1958, 54.9%); Class 3: stable (n = 614, 17.2%); Class 4: increase (n = 800, 22.4%); Class 5: fluctuant (n = 81, 2.3%). After adjustment of demographic factors, baseline SBP, and lifestyles, compared with the “slight increase” group, the OR (95% CI) of CVDs was 0.65 (0.32, 1.28) for “stable” group, 2.24 (1.40, 3.58) for “increase” group, 3.95 (1.81, 8.62) for “rapid increase” group, and 4.32 (1.76, 10.57) for “fluctuant” group. After stratified by use of antihypertensive drugs, the association was only significant for “rapid increase” group among those using antihypertensive drugs with OR (95% CI) of 2.81 (1.01, 7.77). Conclusions Having a rapidly increasing SBP over life-course is associated with a higher risk of CVDs. This implies the importance of monitoring lifetime change of blood pressure for the prevention of CVDs."
https://openalex.org/W3093664048,"Background Postoperative complications after major gastrointestinal surgery are a major contributor to hospital costs. Thus, reducing postoperative complications is a key target for cost-containment strategies. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between postoperative complications and hospital costs following small bowel resection. Methods Postoperative complications were recorded for 284 adult patients undergoing major small bowel resection surgery between January 2013 and June 2018. Complications were defined and graded according to the Clavien–Dindo classification system. In-hospital cost of index admission was calculated using an activity-based costing methodology; it was reported in US dollars at 2019 rates. Regression modeling was used to investigate the relationships among a priori selected perioperative variables, complications, and costs. Findings The overall complication prevalence was 81.6% (95% CI: 85.7–77.5). Most complications (69%) were minor, but 22.9% of patients developed a severe complication (Clavien–Dindo grades III or IV). The unadjusted median total hospital cost for patients with any complication was 70% higher than patients without complications (median [IQR] USD 19,659.64 [13,545.81–35,407.14] vs. 11,551.88 [8,849.46–15,329.87], P < 0.001). The development of 1, 2, 3, and ≥ 4 complications increased hospital costs by 11%, 41%, 50%, and 195%, respectively. Similarly, more severe complications incurred higher hospital costs (P < 0.001). After adjustments were made (for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, anemia, surgical urgency and technique, intraoperative fluid administration, blood transfusion, and hospital readmissions), a greater number and increased severity of complications were associated with a higher adjusted median hospital cost. Patients who experienced complications had an adjusted additional median cost of USD 4,187.10 (95% CI: 1,264.89–7,109.31, P = 0.005) compared to those without complications. Conclusions Postoperative complications are a key target for cost-containment strategies. Our findings demonstrate a high prevalence of postoperative complications following small bowel resection surgery and quantify their associated increase in hospital costs.

https://openalex.org/W3093755514,"Background Difficulties accessing surgical care (e.g., related to wait times, cancellations, cost, receiving a diagnosis) are understudied in Canada. Using population-based data, we studied difficulty accessing non-emergency surgical care, including (1) the incidence and annual changes in incidence, (2) types of difficulties, and (3) associated factors (e.g., sociodemographics, surgery characteristics). Methods Cross-sectional data from the Canadian Community Health Survey annual components were analyzed from 2005–2014. Weighted frequencies established the annual incidence of difficulty accessing surgical care, and total incidence of types of difficulties. Chi-square analyses, independent samples t-tests, and a multivariable logistic regression examined sociodemographic and surgery-related characteristics associated with difficulty accessing surgical care. Results Among individuals who required past-year non-emergency surgery between 2005–2014 (weighted n = 3,052,072), 15.6% experienced difficulty accessing surgical care. The most common difficulty was “waited too long for surgery” (58.5%). There were significant differences in the incidence of difficulty according to year (Χ2 = 83.50, p < .001) from 2005–2014. The incidence of difficulty accessing surgery varied according to sex (Χ2 = 4.02, p < .05), surgery type (Χ2 = 96.09, p < .001), party responsible for cancellation/postponement (Χ2 range: 4.36–19.01, p < .05), and waiting time (t = 10.59, p < .001). In particular, males, orthopedic surgery, and surgery cancelled by the surgeon or hospital had the highest rates of difficulty. Conclusion Results provide insight into the difficulties experienced by patients accessing elective surgery, and the associated factors. These results may inform targeted healthcare interventions and resource reallocation to reduce these occurrences."
https://openalex.org/W3094206513,"Background Young female internal migrants are highly vulnerable to risky sexual behaviors (RSB) which may result in serious health problems such as unintended pregnancy, abortion and sexually transmitted infections including HIV. RSB includes early sexual debut (before 18 years), having multiple sexual partners, sex without a condom or inconsistent use of condom and sex under the influence of substance use. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and the factors associated with RSB among sexually-active unmarried young female internal migrants in Burayu Town, Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study design was used for the study. A total of 267 respondents was recruited into the study using a simple random sampling technique. A semi-structured interviews-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information from the study participants. The collected data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi data version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS Ver.21 for analysis. Multiple logistic regression models were used to indicate the association between dependent and independent variables. The results About 35% of the young female internal migrants had sexual debut before the age of 18 years; 64.4% had sex without condom or inconsistently used condom; nearly one quarter of the participants had multiple sexual partners, and 29.6% had sex under the influence of substance uses. The magnitude of RSB among the study participants was (79.1%). Sexting [AOR 3.47(95%; CI;1.10–11.94)], frequent engagement in social media [AOR 10.9(95%;CI;2.31–51.89)], feeling of embarrassment to buy condom [AOR 8.28(95%; CI; 2.10–32.62)], unfavorable attitude toward using condom for steady and loving relationship [AOR 5.72(95%; CI; 1.47–22.24)] were related with RSB while self-efficacy [AOR 0.15(95%: CI; 0.04–0.57)] to use condom and perceived risks of getting pregnant [AOR 0.05(95%; CI; 0.01–0.23)] were found to be protective factors. Conclusion The study found high levels of RSB among sexually-active unmarried young female internal migrants. This finding suggests an urgent need of intervention to promote safe sex among this group. Special attention and prompt interventions are needed to promote the use of condoms."
https://openalex.org/W3094262672,"Leigh Syndrome French Canadian (LSFC) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by severe lactic acidosis crises and early mortality. LSFC patients carry mutations in the Leucine Rich Pentatricopeptide Repeat Containing (LRPPRC) gene, which lead to defects in the respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial respiration modulates cellular metabolic activity, which impacts many cell types including the differentiation and function of immune cells. Hence, we postulated that, in addition to neurological and metabolic disorders, LSFC patients may show impaired immune activity. To gain insight into the quality of the immune response in LSFC patients, we examined the response to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine by measuring antibody titers to MMR in the plasma. In a cohort of eight LSFC patients, the response to the MMR vaccine was variable, with some individuals showing antibodies to all three viruses, while others had antibodies to two or fewer viruses. These results suggest that the mutations in the LRPPRC gene present in LSFC patients may affect the immune response to vaccines. Monitoring vaccine response in this fragile population should be considered to ensure full protection against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3094000599,"Background The intraoperative blood loss is estimated daily in the operating room and is mainly done by visual techniques. Due to local standards, the surgical sponge colours can vary (e.g. white in US, green in Germany). The influence of sponge colour on accuracy of estimation has not been in the focus of research yet. Material and methods A blood loss simulation study containing four “bleeding” scenarios each per sponge colour were created by using expired whole blood donation samples. The blood donations were applied to white and green surgical sponges after dilution with full electrolyte solution. Study participants had to estimate the absorbed blood loss in sponges in all scenarios. The difference to the reference blood loss was analysed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate other influence factors such as staff experience and sponge colour. Results A total of 53 anaesthesists participated in the study. Visual estimation correlated moderately with reference blood loss in white (Spearman's rho: 0.521; p = 3.748*10−16) and green sponges (Spearman's rho: 0.452; p = 4.683*10−12). The median visually estimated blood loss was higher in white sponges (250ml IRQ 150–412.5ml) than in green sponges (150ml IQR 100-300ml), compared to reference blood loss (103ml IQR 86–162.8). For both colour types of sponges, major under- and overestimation was observed. The multivariate statistics demonstrates that fabric colours have a significant influence on estimation (p = 3.04*10−10), as well as clinician’s qualification level (p = 2.20*10−10, p = 1.54*10−08) and amount of RBL to be estimated (p < 2*10−16). Conclusion The deviation of correct blood loss estimation was smaller with white surgical sponges compared to green sponges. In general, deviations were so severe for both types of sponges, that it appears to be advisable to refrain from visually estimating blood loss whenever possible and instead to use other techniques such as e.g. colorimetric estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3094237274,"Urbanization is one of the main drivers in the conversion of natural habitats into different land use and land cover types (LULC) which threaten the local as well as global biodiversity. This impact is particularly alarming in tropical countries like India, where ~18% of the world's population live, and its ever-growing economy (i.e., industrial development) expanded urban areas by several folds. We undertook this study to examine the impacts of urbanization (i.e., LULC) on terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Western Ghats, India. We sampled different habitats ranged from highly disturbed urban areas to less disturbed forested areas. Multiple sampling methods such as quadrat sampling, line transect, point count, and camera trapping were used to quantify the target taxa. We used multi-species occupancy modeling in the Bayesian framework to estimate detection probability and occupancy and to assess the effect of various LULC on different species. All four groups showed a significant negative impact of increasing anthropogenic habitat cover on occupancy. Out of 213 species detected in this study, 96% of mammals, 85% of birds, 93.75% of amphibians, and 69.43% of reptiles showed a negative effect of anthropogenic habitat cover. Evidence suggests that historical and recent human disturbances could have played an important role in transforming this area from semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forest to open, scrubby, dry deciduous, and fire-prone landscape. This might be the reason for the high occupancy of open and degraded forest habitat preferring species in our study area. We recommend species-rich areas in the MMR, e.g., Karnala Bird Sanctuary (KBS) and Prabalgad-Matheran-Malanggad Hill Range (PMMHR), must be conserved through habitat restoration, ecotourism, public awareness, and policymaking."

Border areas are at high risk of measles epidemics. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of the routine two-dose measles containing vaccine (MCV) program in border counties of Southwest China.


Methods 
Data used in the study were derived from a cross-sectional survey among 1,467 children aged 8 to 84 months from five border counties of Yunnan Province, Southwest China in 2016. The participants were recruited using a multistage sampling method. Primary guardians of the children were interviewed to collect information on vaccination history, socio-economic status, and knowledge about immunization. Both coverage and timely coverage for the first (MCV1) and the second (MCV2) dose of MCV were calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to estimate the cumulative coverage of MCV, and Log-rank tests were adopted to compare the differences across counties and birth cohorts. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the predictors of delayed MCV1 vaccination.


Results 
The coverage for MCV1 and MCV2 were 97.5% and 93.4%, respectively. However, only 63.8% and 84.0% of the children received MCV1 or MCV2 on time. Significant differences in the cumulative coverage were detected across counties and birth cohorts. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that children whose primary guardian knew the schedule of MCV were less likely to receive MCV1 late (OR = 0.63, P<0.01). For the guardians, doctors at vaccination units were the primary and also the most desired source of vaccination information.


Conclusions 
Although the coverage for MCV is high in border areas of Southwest China, the timeliness of MCV vaccination seems suboptimal. Tailored information from local health professionals may help to reduce untimely vaccination."

To evaluate the reliability of 3D image analysis and the effect of an iodine contrast agent on the computed tomography (CT) Hounsfield unit (HU) values of the proximal femur.


Materials and methods 
Fifty female patients (mean age, 61.3 years; age range, 50–79 years) who underwent both pre- and post-enhancement abdominopelvic CT scans were included in this retrospective study. Whole 3D volumes of the left proximal femur from the head to the lesser trochanter were extracted using the regional growth technique with commercial 3D software. Total volume, mean HU, and HU histogram analysis (HUHA) values of the extracted femur were calculated. HUHA distribution was classified into HUHAfat for the assumed fatty marrow (percentage of negative HU values) and HUHAdense-bone (percentage of HU values ≥ 126 HU). Reliability was assessed by calculating intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients (ICCs) and by drawing Bland–Altman plots. The effect of contrast medium administration was evaluated by the paired t-test.


Results 
All intra- and interobserver ICCs of 3D volume measurements showed excellent reproducibility (all ICCs > 0.90). On Bland–Altman analysis of two observers’ 3D volume measurements, the differences in the mean total volume, HUHAfat, HUHAdense-bone, and mean HU were 2.4 cm3, 0.17%, 0.6%, and 1.9 HU, respectively. The mean difference in HU after contrast agent administration (-2.2 HU) was not significant (P = 0.27). The mean difference in HUHAfat and HUHAdense-bone after contrast agent administration were -1.1% and -2.2%, respectively, on the Bland–Altman plot. HUHAfat and HUHAdense-bone showed significant differences (P < 0.05). The 95% limits of agreement for HUHAfat, HUHAdense-bone, and mean HU were -3.6% to 1.3%, -6.5% to 2.1%, and -30.0 to 25.5 HU, respectively.


Conclusion 
Image analysis based on 3D volume measurement of the proximal femur showed excellent reliability, with the contrast agent administration showing negligible influence on the mean HU."
https://openalex.org/W3093570485,"Recent advance in VMS technology has made it viable to ease traffic congestion and improve road traffic efficiency. However, the drivers' low compliance with the posted information may limit its performance to ease traffic congestion and improve traffic safety. This paper explores drivers' attitude to the service quality of VMS system resulted from the identified predominant influencing factors. A questionnaire is developed and used for surveying 9,600 drivers in Beijing, China. The collected data are analyzed with a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) model considering different driver categories (e.g., private car driver, office car driver, taxi driver). The results show that the causal relationships between latent variables and socio-demographic characteristic is significant. Driving frequency, attitude towards contents of VMS, drivers' decision-making and the effectiveness of VMS message can directly and indirectly affect driver's perceived quality of service. The attitude towards formats of VMS indirectly affect their QoS resulting from the effectiveness of VMS message, while there is no indirect impact for taxi drivers. Besides, the drivers' decision-making directly affects the perceived quality of service for private car drivers and office car drivers, but there is no impact for taxi drivers. The findings of this study can provide guidance and reference for urban authorities to perform the relevant actions required to meet user expectations."
https://openalex.org/W3093775081,"Guide RNA design for CRISPR genome editing of gene families is a challenging task as usually good candidate sgRNAs are tagged with low scores precisely because they match several locations in the genome, thus time-consuming manual evaluation of targets is required. To address this issues, I have developed ARES-GT, a Python local command line tool compatible with any operative system. ARES-GT allows the selection of candidate sgRNAs that match multiple input query sequences, in addition of candidate sgRNAs that specifically match each query sequence. It also contemplates the use of unmapped contigs apart from complete genomes thus allowing the use of any genome provided by user and being able to handle intraspecies allelic variability and individual polymorphisms. ARES-GT is available at GitHub (https://github.com/eugomin/ARES-GT.git)."
https://openalex.org/W3093817780,"Evidence on childbearing desire and reproductive behaviors in women living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is scarce, particularly in West Africa. We investigated the prevalence and associated factors of childbearing desire in HIV-infected women in care in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire and explored whether such desires were translated into behaviors related to contraceptive use and communication with health personnel.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two HIV-care facilities in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire in 2015. Eligible women were non-pregnant, non-menopausal, aged 18-49 years and diagnosed as HIV-infected. The outcomes were childbearing desire, prevalence of modern contraceptive use, unmet needs for family planning and intention of the last pregnancy since HIV diagnosis. Women wishing to conceive immediately were asked whether they had discussed their desire with HIV healthcare workers. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the outcomes and women's characteristics.Of 1,631 women, 80% declared having childbearing desire. No association was found between women's childbearing desire and ART status or its duration. In multivariate models, younger age, being in a stable relationship and having no or only one child were significantly associated with increased childbearing desire. Of the women wishing to conceive immediately (n = 713), only 43% reported having had fertility-related dialogue with healthcare provider. Among sexually active women wanting to avoid or delay pregnancy (n = 650), unmet needs for family planning was 40%. Regarding the last pregnancy since HIV diagnosis, one in three women reported not having wanted a baby at that time.Pregnancy desire in women living with HIV in Abidjan was extremely high. Integration of safe conception strategies as well as improvement of contraceptive uptake among women in need of family planning are of utmost importance to ensure optimal conception and to avoid transmission of HIV to the male partner or to the forthcoming child."
https://openalex.org/W3094053304,"The objective of this study was to evaluate predicting factors for supraphysiologic serum estradiol elevation during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with administration of letrozole and gonadotropins in patients with estrogen-dependent cancer. Use of aromatase inhibitors is recommended to prevent the potential effects of elevated serum estradiol levels and recurrence of tumor in patients with estrogen-dependent cancers during COS. Although previous studies reported that letrozole have shown an effective lowering of peak estrogen levels, a part of patients shows supraphysiologic levels of estrogen associated with ovarian stimulation despite the administration of letrozole. From January 2009 to December 2019, patients with estrogen-dependent cancer who underwent COS with antagonist protocol using a letrozole (5 mg/ day) to keep estrogen levels low were included in this study. Early monitoring serum estradiol was measured in all patients on the 4-6th day of stimulation. Subjects were classified into two groups according to the serum estradiol level on hCG triggering day, physiologic estradiol group (≤400 pg/mL) and supraphysiologic estradiol group (>400 pg/mL). A total of 96 COS cycles were retrospectively analyzed. Supraphysiologic level of serum estradiol was found in 21.9% of the patients. Mean age, AMH, duration of stimulation, total dose of gonadotropins administered were not different between the two groups. However, early monitoring serum estradiol level was significantly higher in the supraphysiologic estradiol group (67.1±47.9 vs. 115.6±78.1, p = 0.001) and was associated with the occurrence of supraphysiologic elevation of serum estradiol on hCG triggering day. Patients with early monitoring serum estradiol ≥84.5 pg/mL had an odds ratio of 5.376 [95% CI, 1.613-17.913] for supraphysiologic elevation of serum estradiol compared to those with early monitoring serum estradiol below 84.5 pg/mL. In conclusion, early monitoring serum estradiol is an independent predicting factor for supraphysiologic level of serum estradiol on hCG triggering day in the COS cycles using letrozole and gonadotropins."
https://openalex.org/W3094069547,"Background Mistrust and conflicts in patient-provider relationships (PPR) have become prevalent in China. The frequency of verbal and physical violence against healthcare workers has been increasing, but few interventions seem to be effective. Limited prior research has focused on the perspectives of healthcare professionals in training. This paper aimed to understand their viewpoints and conceptualize potentially actionable areas for future policy interventions. Methods We analyzed de-identified training registration data of a convenience sample of 151 healthcare students and 38 junior professionals from 20 provinces in China. One open-ended question in the registration form asked the participant to comment on PPRs in China. We used qualitative thematic coding to analyze the narrative data. All answers were categorized into three overarching frames: patients, providers, and external agencies/regulations. Frequently mentioned themes in each frame were evaluated to generate an overall theoretical framework. Findings Although fewer than 25% indicated that current PPRs are good or acceptable, 98% of respondents were optimistic about the future improvement of these relationships. The leading factors of PPRs mentioned as patient-relevant were eroding trust in the physician, unrealistic expectations, and ineffective communication. The provider-relevant themes highlighted were poor service quality, ineffective communication, and heavy workload. Leading themes relevant to external agencies or regulations were dysfunctional administration system, negative media reports, and disparity in healthcare resource distribution. Interpretation Healthcare professionals in training had a negative view of the current situation but had confidence in future improvement. Patient, provider, and societal factors all contributed to the tension between patients and providers. All aspects of the healthcare sector should be carefully considered when contemplating policy or social interventions to improve the patient-provider relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3094095504,"Scholars have used mathematical models to estimate the missing length of deteriorated scrolls from ancient Egypt, Qumran, Herculaneum, and elsewhere. Based on such estimations, the content of ancient literature as well as the process of its composition is deduced. Though theoretically reasonable, many practical problems interfere with the method. In the current study, the empirical validity of these mathematical models is examined, showing that highly significant errors are quite frequent. When applied to comparatively intact scrolls, the largest contribution to errors is the subjectivity inherent in measuring patterns of damaged areas. In less well preserved scrolls, deterioration and deformation are more central causes of errors. Another factor is the quality of imaging. Hence, even after maximal reduction of interfering factors, one should only use these estimation methods in conjunction with other supporting considerations. Accordingly, past uses of this approach should be reevaluated, which may have substantial implications for the study of antiquity."
https://openalex.org/W3094143920,"Classic micro-economic and psychology theories propose different implications of monetary incentives on performance. Empirical studies in sports settings show that athletes generally perform worse when the stakes are higher, while a range of lab studies involving cognitively demanding tasks have led to diverging results, supporting positive, negative and null-effects of higher (vs. lower) stakes. In order to further investigate this issue, we present a pre-registered, randomized, controlled trial of 149 participants solving both anagrams and math addition tasks. We do not find a statistically significant effect of the size of the reward on neither performance, self-reported effort nor intrinsic motivation. We propose that future studies should contrast the potential impact of rewards on different kinds of task, e.g. compare tasks that solely require cognitive effort vs. tasks that require motor skills, as in sports."
