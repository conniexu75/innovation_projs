https://openalex.org/W2018739526,A polypeptide isolated from porcine hypothalami stimulates the release of both luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitaries of several species. This polypeptide has been structurally identified as (pyro)Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH(2) and synthesized. The natural and synthetic materials share biological properties. It appears that this peptide represents the hypothalamic hormone regulating the secretion of both luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

Several workers have concluded that these growth responses are caused by an increased uptake of phosphate from the soils and possible mechanisms have been suggested2 to account for this increased uptake. The purpose of our work was to distinguish between some of these possibilities, and we report preliminary results here."

The results of these studies indicated that marihuana did not affect retrieval of information in memory when the method of free recall was used, but did affect recognition processes such that subjects were less able to discriminate between items that had been presented previously and items that had not appeared a short time before. With respect to initial learning, marihuana was shown to affect acquisition processes involved in the storage of information."

Subcutaneous injection of 0.089 to 0.357 nanomole of this synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone stimulated release of luteinizing hormone and induced ovulation."

https://openalex.org/W2044102716,"COMPOUNDS with antimalarial activity are used as therapeutic agents in a number of disorders other than malarial infections. Our dermatological interest in these substances is two-fold. First, they are specific therapeutics for a number of autoimmune disorders with cutaneous manifestations1 and, second, the use of these substances in malarial therapy or prophylaxis often causes adverse cutaneous side effects1."

No particular hazard of this chemical to man has been recognized (see, for example, ref. 1) except for the poisoning of infants by the accidental ingestion of concentrated solution. We now report, however, that sodium hypochlorite is definitely concerned in cancer production in mice as a cocarcinogen2–4."

https://openalex.org/W1993241290,"IN 1967, in India, I came across a practitioner of ancient Ayurvedic medicine who successfully used a decoction of common oats (Avena sativa) to cure the opium habit. While using an alcoholic extract of the plant on a group of opium addicts, several patients reported a loss of interest in smoking. The drug is listed in the United States Dispensatory and National Formulary1–2, yet no reference has been traced regarding its application on smokers (Library of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, personal communication). I have therefore studied the effect of this drug on a group of smokers."

https://openalex.org/W2094870984,"IF a cell which is topologically a sphere is covered with a coat composed of identical units arranged to form a surface crystal, this crystal necessarily1 contains screw disclinations of total strength +2 complete rotations. Harris and Scriven2 draw attention to the micrograph of a marine bacterium, Nitrosomonas, published by Watson and Remsen3, on the cover of Science, showing a coat of apparently spherical units in close packing. They say that intrinsic disclinations are strongly indicated. We have undertaken further analysis of the disclination structure of this coat."
