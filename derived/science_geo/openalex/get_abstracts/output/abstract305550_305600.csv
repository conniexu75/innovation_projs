https://openalex.org/W1969558457,"A wide variety of two- and three-dimensional physical-chemical systems display domain patterns in equilibrium. The phenomenology of these patterns, and of the shapes of their constituent domains, is reviewed here from a point of view that interprets these patterns as a manifestation of modulated phases. These phases are stabilized by competing interactions and are characterized by periodic spatial variations of the pertinent order parameter, the corresponding modulation period generally displaying a dependence on temperature and other external fields. This simple picture provides a unifying framework to account for striking and substantial similarities revealed in the prevalent ""stripe"" and ""bubble"" morphologies as well as in commonly observed, characteristic domain-shape instabilities. Several areas of particular current interest are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983357101,"There has been a long history of unexplained anomalous absorption of solar radiation by clouds. Collocated satellite and surface measurements of solar radiation at five geographically diverse locations showed significant solar absorption by clouds, resulting in about 25 watts per square meter more global-mean absorption by the cloudy atmosphere than predicted by theoretical models. It has often been suggested that tropospheric aerosols could increase cloud absorption. But these aerosols are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, whereas the observed cloud absorption is remarkably invariant with respect to season and location. Although its physical cause is unknown, enhanced cloud absorption substantially alters our understanding of the atmosphere's energy budget."
https://openalex.org/W2000459287,"Ship observations and ocean models indicate that heat export from the mixed layer of the western Pacific warm pool is small (<20 watts per square meter). This value was used to deduce the effect of clouds on the net solar radiation at the sea surface. The inferred magnitude of this shortwave cloud forcing was large ( approximately - 100 watts per square meter) and exceeded its observed value at the top of the atmosphere by a factor of about 1.5. This result implies that clouds (at least over the warm pool) reduce net solar radiation at the sea surface not only by reflecting a significant amount back to space, but also by trapping a large amount in the cloudy atmosphere, an inference that is at variance with most model results. The excess cloud absorption, if confirmed, has many climatic implications, including a significant reduction in the required tropics to extrattropics heat transport in the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2058724379,"The San Andreas fault at Parkfield, California, apparently late in an interval between repeating magnitude 6 earthquakes, is yielding to tectonic loading partly by seismic slip concentrated in a relatively sparse distribution of small clusters (<20-meter radius) of microearthquakes. Within these clusters, which account for 63% of the earthquakes in a 1987-92 study interval, virtually identical small earthquakes occurred with a regularity that can be described by the statistical model used previously in forecasting large characteristic earthquakes. Sympathetic occurrence of microearthquakes in nearby clusters was observed within a range of about 200 meters at communication speeds of 10 to 100 centimeters per second. The rate of earthquake occurrence, particularly at depth, increased significantly during the study period, but the fraction of earthquakes that were cluster members decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2062279054,A detailed chemical dynamic model is presented for a moist martian atmosphere. Recombination of carbon dioxide is catalyzed by trace amounts of water. The abundances of carbon monoxide and molecular oxygen should vary in response to changes in atmospheric water and atmospheric mixing.

https://openalex.org/W2055397105,"Measurements of uranium/thorium and samarium/neodymium isotopes and concentrations in a suite of Hawaiian basalts show that uranium/thorium fractionation varies systematically with samarium/neodymium fractionation and major-element composition; these correlations can be understood in terms of simple batch melting models with a garnet-bearing peridotite magma source and melt fractions of 0.25 to 6.5 percent. Midocean ridge basalts shows a systematic but much different relation between uranium/thorium fractionation and samarium/neodymium fractionation, which, although broadly consistent with melting of a garnet-bearing peridotite source, requires a more complex melting model."
https://openalex.org/W2087344290,"Molecular oxygen was detected in martian spectra near 7635 angstroms and its abundance measured both during and after the 1971 dust storm. Its column abundance in the clear martian atmosphere is about 10.4 +/- 1.0 centimeters amagat, giving a mixing ratio of molecular oxygen to carbon dioxide of 1.3 x 10-(3). The mixing ratio of molecular oxygen to carbon monoxide (1.4 +/- 0.3) is quite different from the value of 0.5 that would result from the photolysis of a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere, which indicates that there is or was a net source of oxygen relative to carbon (probably water) in the martian atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2009573990,"Magnetic anisotropy measurements on single crystals of a series of paramagnetic 8-coordinate lanthanide shift reagent adducts of the type Ln[(CH(3))(3)CCOCHCOC(CH(3))(3)(4-CH(3)C(5)H(1)N)(2) have been made for the following lanthanides: praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, and ytterbium. The susceptibility tensors are highly anisotropic and nonaxial. Dipolar nuclear magnetic resonance shifts evaluated from the solid-state date are in satisfactory agreement with the solution results."

https://openalex.org/W1990025246,"Scanning tunneling microscopy and monoenergetic molecular beams have been used to obtain real-space atomic images of the competition between abstractive and dissociative chemisorption. The size distribution of Si-F adsorbates on the Si(111)-(7×7) surface was examined as a function of the incident translational energy of the F2 molecules. For F2 molecules with 0.03 electron volt of incident energy, the dominant adsorbate sites were isolated Si-F species. As an F2 molecule with low translational energy collides with the surface, abstraction occurs and only one of the F atoms chemisorbs; the other is ejected into the gas phase. For F2 molecules with 0.27 electron volt of incident energy, many adjacent Si-F adsorbates (dimer sites) were observed because F2 molecules with high translational energy collide with the surface and chemisorb dissociatively so that both F atoms react to form adjacent Si-F adsorbates. For halogens with very high incident energy (0.5-electron volt Br2), dissociative chemisorption is the dominant adsorption mechanism and dimer sites account for nearly all adsorbates."
https://openalex.org/W2030418811,A study of the evolution of the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 ratio of the oceans suggests that this ratio is unlikely to have remained constant with time. Our models suiggest that early formation of the oceans is more likely than linear growth.
https://openalex.org/W2063257815,"Fourier harmonic amplitudes quantitatively characterize chamber shapes of fossil tubular bryozoans. The odd-numbered harmonics, particularly the seventh, carry evolutionary information. The phenotypically plastic second and sixth harmonics measure zooecial orientation and packing, respectively. As a measure of crowding, the sixth harmonic reflects mechanistic growth response to paleoenvironmental conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1847525727,"Careful reprocessing of the Voyager images reveals that the Uranìan lambda ring has marked longitudinal variations in brightness comparable in magnitude to those in Saturn's F ring and Neptune's Adams ring. The ring's variations show a dominant five-cycle (72-degree) periodicity, although additional structure down to scales of about 0.5 degree is also present. The ring's shape is defined by a small overall eccentricity plus a six-cycle (60-degree) sinusoidal variation of radial amplitude around 4 kilometers. Both of these properties can be explained by the resonant perturbations of a moon at a semimajor axis of 56,479 kilometers, but no known moon orbits at this location. Unfortunately, the mass required suggests that such a body should have been imaged by Voyager."

https://openalex.org/W2019614427,"As models of the real world, climate models are far from perfect. For decades, the working assumption of climate modelers has been that the tiny water droplets that make up clouds reflect some solar radiation back into outer space and let almost all the rest filter to the surface, but two new studies suggest that clouds actually absorb a significant portion of the sunlight passing through them. This article discusses the ramifications of the new research and resulting improvement in climate models."
https://openalex.org/W2168079763,"This is technical comment and response to the subject of paleotophography of glacial age ice sheets. The model presented by Peltier reconstructing the paleotopography of glacial age ice sheets has implications for atmospheric general circulation models of ice age climate. In addition, the model suggests that the glacial-age Antarctic Ice Sheet was significantly larger than today`s. The commentor, Edwards, suggests there is a discrepancy between data from Papua New Guinea and the model results."
https://openalex.org/W1977129132,A panel appointed by Energy Secretary Hazel O`Leary has concluded that the DOE`s 10 major laboratories should focus more on basic research than on directly serving industry. Despite its emphasis on basic research the report stops short of recommending that individual labs be leaders in particular fields. This article discusses the report and the political repercussions.
