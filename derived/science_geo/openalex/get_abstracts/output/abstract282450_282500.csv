https://openalex.org/W2006904697,"The Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) on Nimbus-7, launched in October 1978, is the only sensor in orbit that is specifically designed to study living marine resources. The initial imagery confirms that CZCS data can be processed to a level that reveals subtle variations in the concentration of phytoplankton pigments. This development has potential applications for the study of large-scale patchiness in phytoplankton distributions, the evolution of spring blooms, water mass boundaries, and mesoscale circulation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1972660144,"The removal of atmospheric effects from Nimbus-7 Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) images reveals eddy-like ocean turbidity patterns not apparent in the original calibrated images. Comparisons of the phytoplankton pigment concentrations derived from the corrected CZCS radiances with surface measurements agree to within less than 0.5 log C, where C is the sum of the concentrations of chlorophyll a plus phaeopigments a (in milligrams per cubic meter)."

Field and laboratory experiments reveal that canopy patterns are a major influence in the home range orientation of this ponerine ant, a common species in African forests. Canopy orientation appears to be well suited to the restrictive lighting conditions of tropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W1996559097,"The observed rate of change of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at the South Pole, Fanning Island, Hawaii, and ocean weather station P correlates with an index of the southern oscillation and with El Niño occurrences. There are changes at all four stations that seem to be in response to the weak 1975 El Niño. Thus, even poorly developed El Niño events may affect the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2101709261,"The Sadat Canal, now under construction, is designed to drain excess water from Lake Nasser to the Western Desert by way of Wadi Tushka, a sand-filled, dry-wash tributary of the Nile 34 kilometers north of Abu Simbel. Core-drilling logs made by the Aswan High Dam Authority prior to excavation of the Sadat Canal and along 48 kilometers of its axis reveal as much as 33 meters of unconsolidated sand and gravel over Mesozoic bedrock and under surficial dune sand and playa muds of Holocene age. Excavation of the canal revealed Acheulean artifacts 6.7 meters below the surface in fluvial sediments capped by a buried, red calcic paleosol. These data are interpreted as evidence for the existence of a major tributary of the Nile during the late middle Pleistocene. The tributary drained the Kiseiba-Dungul Depression and possibly the Kharga Depression as well. Chalcedony-armored mudstones in the depressions are believed to be saline lake deposits possibly related to a lake that drained to the Nile by way of Wadi Tushka, thus entrenching the divide between the depression and the valley. Gross correlations with Pleistocene deposits of the Nile Valley and the Kharga Depression are based upon archeological evidence only until more precise geochronology can be applied to the problem."

https://openalex.org/W2049739043,"The suseeptibility of certain strains of E. coli and Salmonella is significantly greater in synthetic medium than in meat infusion broth. Casein hydrolysate, asparagine, glutamic acid to a lesser degree, and possibly some other aminoacids partially antagonize the effect of penicillin upon E. coli in synthetic medium. The antagonism of casein hydrolysate and asparagine can be removed in greater part by methionine. The observations suggest that the refractoriness of Gram-negative bacilli to penicillin is at least to some extent extrinsic in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2063820947,"When rats on either a stock or a vitamin B deficient diet are given the amino acid dl-serine by stomach tube, there is a fall in the cocarboxylase concentration of the kidney. This organ exhibits marked damage. There is, also, a lessened tendency for cocarboxylase to disappear from the tissue homogenate upon anaerobic incubation in vitro. In animals on the stock diet, only, there is a recovery of the normal cocarboxylase level. The probable relation of these findings to the mechanism of the production of the injurious action of serine is discussed. We would like to acknowledge the helpful criticisms of Dr. C. Artom."
