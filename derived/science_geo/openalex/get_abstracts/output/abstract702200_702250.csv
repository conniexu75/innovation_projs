https://openalex.org/W4304084008,"Recent progress in targeting KRASG12C has provided both insight and inspiration for targeting alternative KRAS mutants. In this study, we evaluated the mechanism of action and anti-tumor efficacy of MRTX1133, a potent, selective and non-covalent KRASG12D inhibitor. MRTX1133 demonstrated a high-affinity interaction with GDP-loaded KRASG12D with KD and IC50 values of ~0.2 pM and <2 nM, respectively, and ~700-fold selectivity for binding to KRASG12D as compared to KRASWT. MRTX1133 also demonstrated potent inhibition of activated KRASG12D based on biochemical and co-crystal structural analyses. MRTX1133 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell viability in KRASG12D-mutant cell lines, with median IC50 values of ~5 nM, and demonstrated >1,000-fold selectivity compared to KRASWT cell lines. MRTX1133 exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of KRAS-mediated signal transduction and marked tumor regression (≥30%) in a subset of KRASG12D-mutant cell-line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, including eight of 11 (73%) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. Pharmacological and CRISPR-based screens demonstrated that co-targeting KRASG12D with putative feedback or bypass pathways, including EGFR or PI3Kα, led to enhanced anti-tumor activity. Together, these data indicate the feasibility of selectively targeting KRAS mutants with non-covalent, high-affinity small molecules and illustrate the therapeutic susceptibility and broad dependence of KRASG12D mutation-positive tumors on mutant KRAS for tumor cell growth and survival. A potent and selective inhibitor of KRASG12D, the most common mutant form of the KRAS oncoprotein, has anti-tumor efficacy in multiple pre-clinical cancer models, opening the possibility to therapeutically target this highly prevalent oncogenic driver."
https://openalex.org/W4304080455,"Abstract The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥5% at week 104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg ( n = 152) or placebo ( n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0) years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg m –2 and weight of 106.0 (22.0) kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 104 was −15.2% in the semaglutide group ( n = 152) versus −2.6% with placebo ( n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of −12.6 %-points (95% confidence interval, −15.3 to −9.8; P &lt; 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥5% from baseline at week 104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P &lt; 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104 weeks versus placebo.

https://openalex.org/W4304080474,"Studying viral-host protein-protein interactions can facilitate the discovery of therapies for viral infection. We use high-throughput yeast two-hybrid experiments and mass spectrometry to generate a comprehensive SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactome network consisting of 739 high-confidence binary and co-complex interactions, validating 218 known SARS-CoV-2 host factors and revealing 361 novel ones. Our results show the highest overlap of interaction partners between published datasets and of genes differentially expressed in samples from COVID-19 patients. We identify an interaction between the viral protein ORF3a and the human transcription factor ZNF579, illustrating a direct viral impact on host transcription. We perform network-based screens of >2,900 FDA-approved or investigational drugs and identify 23 with significant network proximity to SARS-CoV-2 host factors. One of these drugs, carvedilol, shows clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients in an electronic health records analysis and antiviral properties in a human lung cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our study demonstrates the value of network systems biology to understand human-virus interactions and provides hits for further research on COVID-19 therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4304080659,"Large serine recombinases (LSRs) are DNA integrases that facilitate the site-specific integration of mobile genetic elements into bacterial genomes. Only a few LSRs, such as Bxb1 and PhiC31, have been characterized to date, with limited efficiency as tools for DNA integration in human cells. In this study, we developed a computational approach to identify thousands of LSRs and their DNA attachment sites, expanding known LSR diversity by >100-fold and enabling the prediction of their insertion site specificities. We tested their recombination activity in human cells, classifying them as landing pad, genome-targeting or multi-targeting LSRs. Overall, we achieved up to seven-fold higher recombination than Bxb1 and genome integration efficiencies of 40-75% with cargo sizes over 7 kb. We also demonstrate virus-free, direct integration of plasmid or amplicon libraries for improved functional genomics applications. This systematic discovery of recombinases directly from microbial sequencing data provides a resource of over 60 LSRs experimentally characterized in human cells for large-payload genome insertion without exposed DNA double-stranded breaks."
https://openalex.org/W4304084108,"The levels of the thousands of metabolites in the human plasma metabolome are strongly influenced by an individual's genetics and the composition of their diet and gut microbiome. Here, by assessing 1,183 plasma metabolites in 1,368 extensively phenotyped individuals from the Lifelines DEEP and Genome of the Netherlands cohorts, we quantified the proportion of inter-individual variation in the plasma metabolome explained by different factors, characterizing 610, 85 and 38 metabolites as dominantly associated with diet, the gut microbiome and genetics, respectively. Moreover, a diet quality score derived from metabolite levels was significantly associated with diet quality, as assessed by a detailed food frequency questionnaire. Through Mendelian randomization and mediation analyses, we revealed putative causal relationships between diet, the gut microbiome and metabolites. For example, Mendelian randomization analyses support a potential causal effect of Eubacterium rectale in decreasing plasma levels of hydrogen sulfite-a toxin that affects cardiovascular function. Lastly, based on analysis of the plasma metabolome of 311 individuals at two time points separated by 4 years, we observed a positive correlation between the stability of metabolite levels and the amount of variance in the levels of that metabolite that could be explained in our analysis. Altogether, characterization of factors that explain inter-individual variation in the plasma metabolome can help design approaches for modulating diet or the gut microbiome to shape a healthy metabolome."
https://openalex.org/W4304080209,"The association between physical activity and human disease has not been examined using commercial devices linked to electronic health records. Using the electronic health records data from the All of Us Research Program, we show that step count volumes as captured by participants' own Fitbit devices were associated with risk of chronic disease across the entire human phenome. Of the 6,042 participants included in the study, 73% were female, 84% were white and 71% had a college degree, and participants had a median age of 56.7 (interquartile range 41.5-67.6) years and body mass index of 28.1 (24.3-32.9) kg m-2. Participants walked a median of 7,731.3 (5,866.8-9,826.8) steps per day over the median activity monitoring period of 4.0 (2.2-5.6) years with a total of 5.9 million person-days of monitoring. The relationship between steps per day and incident disease was inverse and linear for obesity (n = 368), sleep apnea (n = 348), gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 432) and major depressive disorder (n = 467), with values above 8,200 daily steps associated with protection from incident disease. The relationships with incident diabetes (n = 156) and hypertension (n = 482) were nonlinear with no further risk reduction above 8,000-9,000 steps. Although validation in a more diverse sample is needed, these findings provide a real-world evidence-base for clinical guidance regarding activity levels that are necessary to reduce disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W4304084051,"Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle. The canonical description of MU function rests upon two foundational tenets. First, cortex cannot control MUs independently but supplies each pool with a common drive. Second, MUs are recruited in a rigid fashion that largely accords with Henneman’s size principle. Although this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs across diverse force profiles. In this study, we developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings, in a rhesus macaque, even during rapidly changing forces. Patterns of MU activity were surprisingly behavior-dependent and could be accurately described only by assuming multiple drives. Consistent with flexible descending control, microstimulation of neighboring cortical sites recruited different MUs. Furthermore, the cortical population response displayed sufficient degrees of freedom to potentially exert fine-grained control. Thus, MU activity is flexibly controlled to meet task demands, and cortex may contribute to this ability. Muscle fibers have diverse properties—for example, slow and fast twitch. Groups of fibers are activated by motoneurons. Marshall et al. found that motoneurons are used flexibly, presumably allowing us to intelligently employ fibers suited to each task."
https://openalex.org/W4304080164,"The dentate gyrus (DG) gates neocortical information flow to the hippocampus. Intriguingly, the DG also produces adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) throughout the lifespan, but their contribution to downstream firing dynamics remains unclear. Here, we show that abDGCs promote sparser hippocampal population spiking during mnemonic processing of novel stimuli. By combining triple-(DG-CA3-CA1) ensemble recordings and optogenetic interventions in behaving mice, we show that abDGCs constitute a subset of high-firing-rate neurons with enhanced activity responses to novelty and strong modulation by theta oscillations. Selectively activating abDGCs in their 4-7-week post-birth period increases sparsity of hippocampal population patterns, whereas suppressing abDGCs reduces this sparsity, increases principal cell firing rates and impairs novel object recognition with reduced dimensionality of the network firing structure, without affecting single-neuron spatial representations. We propose that adult-born granule cells transiently support sparser hippocampal population activity structure for higher-dimensional responses relevant to effective mnemonic information processing."
https://openalex.org/W4304084152,"Understanding the mechanisms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease severity to efficiently design therapies for emerging virus variants remains an urgent challenge of the ongoing pandemic. Infection and immune reactions are mediated by direct contacts between viral molecules and the host proteome, and the vast majority of these virus-host contacts (the 'contactome') have not been identified. Here, we present a systematic contactome map of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with the human host encompassing more than 200 binary virus-host and intraviral protein-protein interactions. We find that host proteins genetically associated with comorbidities of severe illness and long COVID are enriched in SARS-CoV-2 targeted network communities. Evaluating contactome-derived hypotheses, we demonstrate that viral NSP14 activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcription, even in the presence of cytokine signaling. Moreover, for several tested host proteins, genetic knock-down substantially reduces viral replication. Additionally, we show for USP25 that this effect is phenocopied by the small-molecule inhibitor AZ1. Our results connect viral proteins to human genetic architecture for COVID-19 severity and offer potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W4304080870,"High systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease (IHD), the leading cause of death worldwide. Using data from published observational studies and controlled trials, we estimated the mean SBP-IHD dose-response function and burden of proof risk function (BPRF), and we calculated a risk outcome score (ROS) and corresponding star rating (one to five). We found a very strong, significant harmful effect of SBP on IHD, with a mean risk-relative to that at 100 mm Hg SBP-of 1.39 (95% uncertainty interval including between-study heterogeneity 1.34-1.44) at 120 mm Hg, 1.81 (1.70-1.93) at 130 mm Hg and 4.48 (3.81-5.26) at 165 mm Hg. The conservative BPRF measure indicated that SBP exposure between 107.5 and 165.0 mm Hg raised risk by 101.36% on average, yielding a ROS of 0.70 and star rating of five. Our analysis shows that IHD risk was already increasing at 120 mm Hg SBP, rising steadily up to 165 mm Hg and increasing less steeply above that point. Our study endorses the need to prioritize and strengthen strategies for screening, to raise awareness of the need for timely diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and to increase the resources allocated for understanding primordial prevention of elevated blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W4304084045,"Exposure to risks throughout life results in a wide variety of outcomes. Objectively judging the relative impact of these risks on personal and population health is fundamental to individual survival and societal prosperity. Existing mechanisms to quantify and rank the magnitude of these myriad effects and the uncertainty in their estimation are largely subjective, leaving room for interpretation that can fuel academic controversy and add to confusion when communicating risk. We present a new suite of meta-analyses-termed the Burden of Proof studies-designed specifically to help evaluate these methodological issues objectively and quantitatively. Through this data-driven approach that complements existing systems, including GRADE and Cochrane Reviews, we aim to aggregate evidence across multiple studies and enable a quantitative comparison of risk-outcome pairs. We introduce the burden of proof risk function (BPRF), which estimates the level of risk closest to the null hypothesis that is consistent with available data. Here we illustrate the BPRF methodology for the evaluation of four exemplar risk-outcome pairs: smoking and lung cancer, systolic blood pressure and ischemic heart disease, vegetable consumption and ischemic heart disease, and unprocessed red meat consumption and ischemic heart disease. The strength of evidence for each relationship is assessed by computing and summarizing the BPRF, and then translating the summary to a simple star rating. The Burden of Proof methodology provides a consistent way to understand, evaluate and summarize evidence of risk across different risk-outcome pairs, and informs risk analysis conducted as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study."

https://openalex.org/W4304084126,"As a leading behavioral risk factor for numerous health outcomes, smoking is a major ongoing public health challenge. Although evidence on the health effects of smoking has been widely reported, few attempts have evaluated the dose-response relationship between smoking and a diverse range of health outcomes systematically and comprehensively. In the present study, we re-estimated the dose-response relationships between current smoking and 36 health outcomes by conducting systematic reviews up to 31 May 2022, employing a meta-analytic method that incorporates between-study heterogeneity into estimates of uncertainty. Among the 36 selected outcomes, 8 had strong-to-very-strong evidence of an association with smoking, 21 had weak-to-moderate evidence of association and 7 had no evidence of association. By overcoming many of the limitations of traditional meta-analyses, our approach provides comprehensive, up-to-date and easy-to-use estimates of the evidence on the health effects of smoking. These estimates provide important information for tobacco control advocates, policy makers, researchers, physicians, smokers and the public."
https://openalex.org/W4304084154,"Previous research suggests a protective effect of vegetable consumption against chronic disease, but the quality of evidence underlying those findings remains uncertain. We applied a Bayesian meta-regression tool to estimate the mean risk function and quantify the quality of evidence for associations between vegetable consumption and ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, type 2 diabetes and esophageal cancer. Increasing from no vegetable consumption to the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (306-372 g daily) was associated with a 23.2% decline (95% uncertainty interval, including between-study heterogeneity: 16.4-29.4) in ischemic stroke risk; a 22.9% (13.6-31.3) decline in IHD risk; a 15.9% (1.7-28.1) decline in hemorrhagic stroke risk; a 28.5% (-0.02-51.4) decline in esophageal cancer risk; and a 26.1% (-3.6-48.3) decline in type 2 diabetes risk. We found statistically significant protective effects of vegetable consumption for ischemic stroke (three stars), IHD (two stars), hemorrhagic stroke (two stars) and esophageal cancer (two stars). Including between-study heterogeneity, we did not detect a significant association with type 2 diabetes, corresponding to a one-star rating. Although current evidence supports increased efforts and policies to promote vegetable consumption, remaining uncertainties suggest the need for continued research."
https://openalex.org/W4304204954,"To assess the levels of infection across communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, researchers have measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in feces dissolved in sewer water. This activity is colloquially known as sewer monitoring and is referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology in academic settings. Although global ethical principles have been described, sewer monitoring is unregulated for health privacy protection when used for public health surveillance in the United States. This study used Qualtrics XM, a national research panel provider, to recruit participants to answer an online survey. Respondents (N = 3,083) answered questions about their knowledge, perceptions of what is to be monitored, where monitoring should occur, and privacy concerns related to sewer monitoring as a public health surveillance tool. Furthermore, a privacy attitude questionnaire was used to assess the general privacy boundaries of respondents. Participants were more likely to support monitoring for diseases (92%), environmental toxins (92%), and terrorist threats (88%; e.g., anthrax). Two-third of the respondents endorsed no prohibition on location sampling scale (e.g., monitoring single residence to entire community was acceptable); the most common location category respondents wanted to prohibit sampling was at personal residences. Sewer monitoring is an emerging technology, and our study sheds light on perceptions that could benefit from educational programs in areas where public acceptance is comparatively lower. Respondents clearly communicated guard rails for sewer monitoring, and public opinion should inform future policy, application, and regulation measures."
https://openalex.org/W4304014316,"Cell-surface proteins (CSPs) mediate intercellular communication throughout the lives of multicellular organisms. However, there are no generalizable methods for quantitative CSP profiling in specific cell types in vertebrate tissues. Here, we present in situ cell-surface proteome extraction by extracellular labeling (iPEEL), a proximity labeling method in mice that enables spatiotemporally precise labeling of cell-surface proteomes in a cell-type-specific environment in native tissues for discovery proteomics. Applying iPEEL to developing and mature cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed differential enrichment in CSPs with post-translational protein processing and synaptic functions in the developing and mature cell-surface proteomes, respectively. A proteome-instructed in vivo loss-of-function screen identified a critical, multifaceted role for Armh4 in Purkinje cell dendrite morphogenesis. Armh4 overexpression also disrupts dendrite morphogenesis; this effect requires its conserved cytoplasmic domain and is augmented by disrupting its endocytosis. Our results highlight the utility of CSP profiling in native mammalian tissues for identifying regulators of cell-surface signaling."

https://openalex.org/W4304086886,"Issues related to malnutrition, broadly defined, have received a growing attention in recent years, not only in connection with the Sustainable Development Goals but also recently with the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, there exists a complex interaction between institutions, capital flows, and food and nutrition security that has received less attention in the relevant literature. In this paper we estimate a series of dynamic panel data models to examine the impact of institutional quality and capital flows on food security, nutrition security and undernourishment by using panel data for 25 SSA countries over the period 1996 to 2018. One of the key contributions of the paper is the use of both aggregate and disaggregated capital flows to examine the impact on both food and nutrition security, a dimension that has been surprisingly neglected in most of the relevant literature. We combine this with the interaction of various types of capital flows with an institutional quality index we constructed from various governance indicators to examine the impact of institutions on the overall nexus. Finally, we examine the impact not only on food and nutrition security but also on undernourishment. Our findings clearly demonstrate the importance of a heterogeneity approach and reflect on earlier work regarding the role of institutional quality in the overall nexus between external capital flows and various measures of food and nutrition security which leads, and as expected, to an interesting variation in the results obtained, depending on the type of capital flows and the interaction with the governance indicators."
https://openalex.org/W4304086855,"Background The role of school contacts in the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of school closures in controlling the epidemic is still debated. We aimed to quantify the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the school setting by type of school, characteristics of the index case and calendar period in the Province of Reggio Emilia (RE), Italy. The secondary aim was to estimate the speed of implementation of contact tracing. Methods A population-based analysis of surveillance data on all COVID-19 cases occurring in RE, Italy, from 1 September 2020, to 4 April 2021, for which a school contact and/or exposure was suspected. An indicator of the delay in contact tracing was calculated as the time elapsed since the index case was determined to be positive and the date on which the swab test for classmates was scheduled (or most were scheduled). Results Overall, 30,184 and 13,608 contacts among classmates and teachers/staff, respectively, were identified and were recommended for testing, and 43,214 (98.7%) underwent the test. Secondary transmission occurred in about 40% of the investigated classes, and the overall secondary case attack rate was 4%. This rate was slightly higher when the index case was a teacher but with almost no differences by type of school, and was stable during the study period. Speed of implementation of contact tracing increased during the study period, with the time from index case identification to testing of contacts being reduced from seven to three days. The ability to identify the possible source of infection in the index case also increased. Conclusions Despite the spread of the Alpha variant during the study period in RE, the secondary case attack rate remained stable from school reopening in September 2020 until the beginning of April 2021."

In Singapore, the prevalence of Type 2 DM is rising, but comprehensive information about trends in DM-related complications is lacking.We utilized the Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) diabetes registry (SDR) to assess trends in DM micro and macro-vascular complications at the population level, explore factors influencing these trends.We studied trends for ten DM-related complications: ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and strokes, diabetic eye complications, nephropathy, neuropathy, diabetic foot, major and minor lower extremity amputation (LEA). The complications were determined through clinical coding in hospital (inpatient and outpatient) and primary care settings within the SingHealth cluster. We described event rates for the complications in 4 age-bands. Joinpoint regression was used to identify significant changes in trends.Among 222,705 patients studied between 2013 and 2020. 48.6% were female, 70.7% Chinese, 14.7% Malay and 10.6% Indian with a mean (SD) age varying between 64.6 (12.5) years in 2013 and 65.7 (13.2) years in 2020. We observed an increase in event rates in IHD, PAD, stroke, diabetic eye complications nephropathy, and neuropathy. Joinpoints was observed for IHD and PAD between 2016 to 2018, with subsequent plateauing of event rates. Major and minor LEA event rates decreased through the study period.We found that DM and its complications represent an important challenge for healthcare in Singapore.

However, we should point out that DNA of NETs may impact the site specificity and catalytic efficiency in the proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase. DNA interacting with HMGB1 may protect the DNA-binding interfaces of HMGB1 from the attack of proteases while noninterfacial regions remain unprotected and cleavable. This effect would increase the site specificity in the proteolysis. Colocalization on DNA may also increase the chance for HMGB1 to encounter with neutrophil elastase and thereby enhance the kinetic efficiency in the proteolytic cleavage of HMGB1. In this article, we demonstrate that DNA enhances both efficiency and site specificity in the proteolytic cleavage of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase. HMGB1 is a redox sensitive protein and forms a disulfide bond between Cys23 and Cys45 in extracellular space (33Sahu D. Debnath P. Takayama Y. Iwahara J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 11621-11627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The oxidized HMGB1 protein (i.e., often referred to as ‘disulfide HMGB1’) was used in our current biochemical and biophysical experiments because this form of HMGB1 is more relevant to the extracellular function than the reduced HMGB1 (‘all-thiol HMGB1’). We show that the DNA-mediated proteolysis of disulfide HMGB1 occurs specifically at the sites (mainly V176) between the B-box domain and the C-terminal D/E repeats. Importantly, this proteolysis causes a remarkable increase in the binding affinities of disulfide HMGB1 for G-quadruplex DNA, Holliday junction DNA, and TLR4•MD-2 complex. Therefore, the DNA-mediated proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase in NETs may play an important role in inflammation. Based on what is described previously, we hypothesized that DNA could impact the proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase. To test this hypothesis, HMGB1 proteins were processed by neutrophil elastase in the presence and absence of DNA. Figure 1A shows the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels for the reaction mixtures at some different time points. In the presence of sonicated calf thymus DNA (400 μM base pairs), the proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase was fast. A major product from the reaction was observed as early as in 1 min. A similar result was observed in the presence of 20 μM linear 20 bp DNA (corresponding to 400 μM base pairs). By contrast, the reaction in the absence of DNA was far slower and two major products and subsequently additional products were observed over hours (see Fig. S1 in the Supporting information). These data clearly show that DNA enhances the efficiency and site specificity in the proteolytic cleavage of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase. Through further experiments, we investigated the enzyme kinetics of the DNA-mediated proteolysis. Because the molarity of sonicated calf thymus DNA cannot be clearly defined, we used the 20 bp DNA duplex for the quantitative investigations of the proteolysis. Through densitometry of SDS-PAGE images, we quantitatively analyzed the time course of the proteolysis kinetics. We measured the reaction rates as initial velocities (36Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Enzyme kinetics, inhibition, and control.in: Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level. 5th Ed. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2016: 361-401Google Scholar) for the proteolysis of HMGB1 at various concentrations in the presence and absence of the 20 bp DNA duplex. From the HMGB1 concentration dependence of the cleavage rate (Fig. 1B), we determined the Michaelis–Menten steady-state constant Km and the catalytic rate constant kcat. Table 1 shows the values of these Michaelis–Menten parameters for the reaction in the presence and absence of DNA. The ratio kcat/Km corresponds to a second order rate constant that represents the catalytic efficiency of an enzymatic reaction (36Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Enzyme kinetics, inhibition, and control.in: Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level. 5th Ed. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2016: 361-401Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1C, the catalytic efficiency of HMGB1 proteolysis by neutrophil elastase is increased by as much as ∼11-fold in the presence of DNA.Table 1Michaelis–Menten parameters Km and kcat for the proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase in the presence and absence of 20 bp DNAaBuffer conditions were 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl at room temperature.

Open table in a new tab The data of Km and kcat (Table 1) provide mechanistic insight into how DNA promotes the HMGB1 cleavage by neutrophil elastase. The presence of DNA caused a significant decrease in the Km constant by a factor of 4.4. This suggests that DNA increases the probability of encounter between neutrophil elastase and HMGB1, presumably through a transient ternary complex formation. DNA can also release the intramolecular interactions involving the C-terminal tail within HMGB1 (37Wang X. Greenblatt H.M. Bigman L.S. Yu B. Pletka C.C. Levy Y. et al.Dynamic autoinhibition of the HMGB1 protein via electrostatic fuzzy interactions of intrinsically disordered regions.J. Mol. Biol. 2021; 433: 167122Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Compared to the kinetic data for cleavage of peptide substrates by neutrophil elastase in the literature (38Aimetti A.A. Tibbitt M.W. Anseth K.S. Human neutrophil elastase responsive delivery from poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels.Biomacromolecules. 2009; 10: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Koehl C. Knight C.G. Bieth J.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12609-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), our kcat values are comparable, whereas the Km value for the reaction in the presence of DNA is far smaller than those reported for the peptide cleavage by neutrophil elastase. These data support the notion that the decrease in Km is more important for the DNA-mediated proteolysis by neutrophil elastase. However, we should point out that the kcat constant also becomes larger in the presence of DNA. The crystal structures of neutrophil elastase show that the active site residue, Ser195, of this serine protease is located apart from the highly positively charged surface (Fig. S2 in the Supporting information). It is likely that neutrophil elastase uses the positively charged surface to interact with DNA. The DNA binding might allosterically affect the active site and thereby improve the catalytic rate kcat. Interestingly, a HMGB1 variant lacking the D/E repeats but retaining the cleavage site exhibited a slower proteolysis by neutrophil elastase (Fig. S3 in the Supporting information), which suggests that the positively charged surface of the neutrophil elastase may also contribute to substrate specificity. Thus, electrostatic interactions appear to play a role in the efficiency and specificity of HMGB1 cleavage by neutrophil elastase. Previous studies on substrate specificity of neutrophil elastase suggested that this serine protease exhibits only weak sequence specificity (40Fu Z. Thorpe M. Akula S. Chahal G. Hellman L.T. Extended cleavage specificity of human neutrophil elastase, human proteinase 3, and their distant ortholog clawed frog PR3-three elastases with similar primary but different extended specificities and stability.Front.

A. 2014; 111: 2518-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This ambiguity makes it challenging to predict the cleavage sites on HMGB1 from its amino acid sequence alone. We used LC-MS to analyze the intact mass profiles of disulfide HMGB1 samples treated with neutrophil elastase in the presence and absence of DNA. Deconvolution results of neutrophil elastase-treated full-length (FL) HMGB1 in the presence of DNA provide high mass accuracy identification of two major species Δ39 (∼60%) and Δ40 (∼30%), which lack C-terminal 39 and 40 residues, respectively, and a minor species corresponding to Δ44 (∼10%), which lacks C-terminal 44 residues (Fig. 2; see also Table S1 in the Supporting information), consistent with the major and minor bands present in the SDS-PAGE results. We confirmed the identities of these peaks through intact mass analysis of recombinant FL HMGB1 and Δ40 variant control samples, each of which was separately expressed and purified by chromatographic methods. These data indicate that the major product of the DNA-mediated proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase is Δ39. We also conducted the same LC-MS analysis for reaction mixtures for the HMGB1 proteolysis in the absence of DNA. The data show the same species: Δ39 (∼45%), Δ40 (∼30%), and Δ44 (∼25%). However, compared to the DNA-mediated proteolysis, the preference for Δ39 was weaker and the relative population of Δ44 was higher. In fact, in the SDS-PAGE images shown in Figure 1A, the relative intensity of the band of the Δ44 product appears stronger for the reaction in the absence of DNA. These results suggest that the proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase in the absence of DNA is not only slower but also less selective. Since Δ39 is the major product of the DNA-mediated proteolysis of HMGB1 by neutrophil elastase, we prepared a recombinant Δ39 variant protein and compared its molecular properties to those of the FL disulfide HMGB1 protein. Through fluorescence experiments, we examined the extent to which the proteolytic truncation impacts the DNA-binding affinities of disulfide HMGB1 for a DNA G-quadruplex named 32G (42Amato J.

https://openalex.org/W4304087048,"Objectives The diaphragm changes position and respiratory excursions during postural loading. However, it is unclear how it reacts to lifting a load while breath-holding or breathing with simultaneous voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles (VCAM). This study analyzed diaphragm motion in healthy individuals during various postural-respiratory situations. Methods 31 healthy participants underwent examination of the diaphragm using M-mode ultrasonography, spirometry, and abdominal wall tension (AWT) measurements. All recordings were performed simultaneously during three consecutive scenarios, i.e., 1. Lifting a load without breathing; 2. Lifting a load and breathing naturally; 3. Lifting a load and breathing with simultaneous VCAM. Results Using paired-samples t -tests, lifting a load without breathing displaced the diaphragm’s expiratory position more caudally ( P &lt; .001), with no change noted in the inspiratory position ( P = .373). During lifting a load breathing naturally, caudal displacement of the diaphragm’s inspiratory position was presented ( P &lt; .001), with no change noted in the expiratory position ( P = 0.20) compared to tidal breathing. Total diaphragm excursion was greater when loaded ( P = .002). Lifting a load and breathing with VCAM demonstrated no significant changes in diaphragm position for inspiration, expiration, or total excursion compared to natural loaded breathing. For all scenarios, AWT measures were greater when lifting a load ( P &lt; .001). Conclusion In healthy individuals, caudal displacement and greater excursions of the diaphragm occurred when lifting a load. The postural function of the diaphragm is independent of its respiratory activity and is not reduced by the increase in AWT."

https://openalex.org/W4304204806,"Background Although hyperinflammatory response influences the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), little has been reported about the utility of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related biomarkers in reflecting the prognosis. We examined whether TNF receptors (TNFRs: TNFR1, TNFR2) and progranulin (PGRN) levels, in addition to interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are associated with mortality or disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective study was conducted at Juntendo University Hospital. Eighty hospitalized patients with various severities of COVID-19 were enrolled. Furthermore, serum levels of TNF-related biomarkers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Twenty-five patients died during hospitalization, and 55 were discharged. The median (25th and 75th percentiles) age of the study patients was 70 (61–76) years, 44 (55.0%) patients were males, and 26 (32.5%) patients had chronic kidney disease (CKD). When comparing with patients who received and did not receive treatment at the intensive care unit (ICU), the former had a higher tendency of being male and have diabetes, hypertension, and CKD; had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase; and had lower body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lymphocyte counts. Significant differences were observed in TNFR, PGRN, IL-6, and CRP levels between each severity (mild–severe) group. Furthermore, the serum levels of TNFR, IL-6, and CRP, but not PGRN, in ICU patients were significantly higher than in the patients who were not admitted to the ICU. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high levels of TNFR2 were only associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 even after adjustment for relevant clinical parameters. Conclusions High TNFR2 level might be helpful for predicting mortality or disease severity in patients with COVID-19."

This study aimed to further investigate the role of plasma microRNA-221-3p level in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were randomly assigned according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. POCD was diagnosed by the Z score method. The relative level of plasma microRNA-221-3p was decided by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Multiple logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves were used for the analysis of plasma microRNA-221-3p prediction performance for POCD. At 7 days post-surgery, the rate of POCD was 34.04%. Patients in the POCD group had a higher preoperative depression score, older age, and longer operation duration than that in the NPOCD group. The relative level of plasma microRNA-221-3p in the POCD group was 1.78 and 2.73 times higher than that in the NPOCD group at 1 day before and 7 days after the surgery, respectively. The relative content of plasma microRNA-221-3p at 7 days after operation was an independent risk factor for POCD. The ROC curves showed that the area under the curve was 0.938 for plasma microRNA-221-3p at postoperative 7 days, and the threshold for POCD detection was 12.33 with a sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 96.3%, respectively. Our results indicate that the plasma postoperative microRNA-221-3p levels could be an effective predictor for POCD after non-cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4304206071,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that causes thousands of deaths in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the 30 high TB burden countries. In this study, we aimed to assess the knowledge, practices, and attitude toward TB, and to determine the factors associated with them among people who have internet access in Bangladesh. Design, Setting, and Participant: A web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 20 to August 10, 2021, among people (age> = 18 years) who have internet access in Bangladesh. A comprehensive consent statement was included at the beginning of the survey and informed consent was taken.This study's outcomes of interest were respondents' adequate knowledge, good practices, and positive attitudes toward TB and were coded binarily. The association between respondents' socio-demographic factors and knowledge, attitude, and practices toward TB was inspected using the Chi-square test and Multivariable logistic regression model.Among 1,180 respondents, 58.64% were males, and 62.37% were married. The majority of the participants (78.28%) were aged between 18 to 44 years. Overall adequate knowledge, favorable attitudes, and good practices about TB were found respectively in 47.8%, 44.75%, and 31.19% of the people with internet access in Bangladesh. Almost the same sets of associated factors were found to influence adequate knowledge, favorable attitudes, and good practices toward TB among social media users in Bangladesh. Males, young, unmarried, social media users with higher education, and urban social media users were more likely to have adequate knowledge, favorable attitudes, and good practices toward TB.Policymakers need to design programs and interventions to improve knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward TB in Bangladesh with a particular focus on females, young and older people, people who live in rural areas, and illiterate/less educated people. Social media can be a powerful medium for disseminating scientific facts on TB and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4304479964,"Background Long Covid is recognised as a complex condition characterised by multiple, interacting and fluctuating symptoms which impact everyday life in diverse ways. The extent of symptom clusters and variability supports interventions that can accommodate heterogeneity, such as personalised self-management support. This approach is also advocated by people living with long Covid and guidelines published by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Long Covid Personalised Self-managemenT support co-design and EvaluatioN (LISTEN) is one of 15 research projects funded by the UK’s National Institute of Health Research long Covid research programme. LISTEN aims to work with people living with or recovered from long Covid to co-design self-management resources, and a training programme for rehabilitation practitioners to deliver personalised support. The intervention will focus on people not hospitalised for Covid. The protocol presented here details the co-design of the LISTEN intervention which, on completion, will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Methods The study will utilise an Accelerated Experience-Based Co-Design approach, and involve 30 people from England and Wales with lived experience of long Covid, and 15 rehabilitation practitioners living with, or supporting people with, long Covid. Through online meetings, participants will share their stories of long Covid, their challenges and strategies to live better with or recover from long Covid, their priorities for self-management resources and the practitioner training andcreate, review and refine these resources and the training. Throughout, LISTEN will draw upon the UK standards of public involvement in research. Discussion If effective and cost-effective, the intervention will be available across the UK’s National Health Service. The first of its kind, this study could make a difference to the lives of people with long Covid. To ensure impact, we have developed strategies to involve people from diverse backgrounds and mitigate potential barriers to involvement."
https://openalex.org/W4303628205,"Modification of histones provides a dynamic mechanism to regulate chromatin structure and access to DNA. Histone acetylation, in particular, plays a prominent role in controlling the interaction between DNA, histones, and other chromatin-associated proteins. Defects in histone acetylation patterns interfere with normal gene expression and underlie a wide range of human diseases. Here, we utilize Xenopus egg extracts to investigate how changes in histone acetylation influence transcription of a defined gene construct. We show that inhibition of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) specifically counteracts transcription suppression by preventing chromatin compaction and deacetylation of histone residues H4K5 and H4K8. Acetylation of these sites supports binding of the chromatin reader and transcription regulator BRD4. We also identify HDAC1 as the primary driver of transcription suppression and show that this activity is mediated through the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex. These findings highlight functional differences between HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are often considered to be functionally redundant, and provide additional molecular context for their activity."
https://openalex.org/W4303644500,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ (CaMKIIδ) has a pivotal role in cardiac signaling. Constitutive and deleterious CaMKII ""autonomous"" activation is induced by oxidative stress, and the previously reported mechanism involves oxidation of methionine residues in the regulatory domain. Here, we demonstrate that covalent oxidation leads to a disulfide bond with Cys273 in the regulatory domain causing autonomous activity. Autonomous activation was induced by treating CaMKII with diamide or histamine chloramine, two thiol-oxidizing agents. Autonomy was reversed when the protein was incubated with DTT or thioredoxin to reduce disulfide bonds. Tryptic mapping of the activated CaMKII revealed formation of a disulfide between Cys273 and Cys290 in the regulatory domain. We determined the apparent pKa of those Cys and found that Cys273 had a low pKa while that of Cys290 was elevated. The low pKa of Cys273 facilitates oxidation of its thiol to the sulfenic acid at physiological pH. The reactive sulfenic acid then attacks the thiol of Cys290 to form the disulfide. The previously reported CaMKII mutant in which methionine residues 281 and 282 were mutated to valine (MMVV) protects mice and flies from cardiac decompensation induced by oxidative stress. Our initial hypothesis was that the MMVV mutant underwent a conformational change that prevented disulfide formation and autonomous activation. However, we found that the thiol-oxidizing agents induced autonomy in the MMVV mutant and that the mutant undergoes rapid degradation by the cell, potentially preventing accumulation of the injurious autonomous form. Together, our results highlight additional mechanistic details of CaMKII autonomous activation."
https://openalex.org/W4303648367,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a multisystem disease occurring in women of child-bearing age manifested by uncontrolled proliferation of smooth muscle–like “LAM” cells in the lungs. LAM cells bear loss-of-function mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes TSC1 and/or TSC2, causing hyperactivation of the proliferation promoting mammalian/mechanistic target of Rapamycin complex 1 pathway. Additionally, LAM-specific active renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been identified in LAM nodules, suggesting this system potentially contributes to neoplastic properties of LAM cells; however, the role of this renin-angiotensin signaling is unclear. Here, we report that TSC2-deficient cells are sensitive to the blockade of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (Agtr1). We show that treatment of these cells with the AGTR1 inhibitor losartan or silencing of the Agtr1 gene leads to increased cell death in vitro and attenuates tumor progression in vivo. Notably, we found the effect of Agtr1 blockade is specific to TSC2-deficient cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that cell death induced by Agtr1 inhibition is mediated by an increased expression of Klotho. In TSC2-deficient cells, we showed overexpression of Klotho or treatment with recombinant (soluble) Klotho mirrored the cytocidal effect of angiotensin blockade. Furthermore, Klotho treatment decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, potentially leading to this cytocidal effect. Conversely, silencing of Klotho rescued TSC2-deficient cells from cell death induced by Agtr1 inhibition. Therefore, we conclude that Agtr1 and Klotho are important for TSC2-deficient cell survival. These findings further illuminate the role of the RAS in LAM and the potential of targeting Agtr1 inhibition in TSC2-deficient cells.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by hamartoma-like tumor growths in various organs, cerebral calcifications, seizures, and mental retardation, and the development of cystic lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).

Inhibitors of the mTORC1 pathway have been shown to have therapeutic benefits in LAM and other TSC manifestations; however, there is a need for continuous therapy for persistent benefit, since mTORC1 inhibitors have cytostatic, and not cytotoxic, effects on TSC2-deficient cells (17Dabora S.L.

Identifying novel therapies that alone or in combination with mTORC1 inhibitors can induce TSC2-deficient cell death is of critical importance. We recently demonstrated that targeting E26 transformation–specific (ETS) variant transcription factor 2, an ETS family transcription factor specifically in TSC2-deficient cell promotes cytocidal response via regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 binding protein and therefore can have therapeutic potential in LAM or other TSC manifestations (19Shrestha S. Lamattina A. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ng J. Liu X. Sonawane A. et al.ETV2 regulates PARP-1 binding protein to induce ER stress-mediated death in tuberin-deficient cells.Life Sci. Alliance. 2022; 5e202201369Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Multiple TSC-related manifestations have also been linked to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). For instance, LAM lung nodules have been shown to possess a functional RAS, including the presence of renin, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen, angiotensin II, and angiotensin II receptors (20Valencia J.C. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Carmona A.K. Xavier J. Bruneval P. Riemenschneider W.K. et al.Tissue-specific renin-angiotensin system in pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 35: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A retrospective review of LAM patients receiving ACE inhibitors showed slower decline in lung function (21Steagall W.K. Stylianou M. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may affect pulmonary function in lymphangioleiomyomatosis.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e126703Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Furthermore, patients with TSC2-polycystic kidney disease 1 deletion syndrome and hypertension treated with inhibition of the RAS pathway via angiotensin receptor blockade had decreased renal AML development compared to those who did not receive this therapy (22Siroky B.J. Yin H. Dixon B.P. Reichert R.J. Hellmann A.R. Ramkumar T. et al.Evidence for pericyte origin of TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas and implications for angiotensin receptor inhibition therapy.Am.

However, the precise mechanisms underpinning these effects of angiotensin II receptor (AGTR) blockade have not been elucidated. Here, we seek to exploit the RAS present in LAM or TSC to overcome the limitations of rapalogs. Klotho, an aging-suppressor gene, encodes for α-Klotho protein (Klotho), which associates with fibroblast growth factor receptor family protein to regulate metabolic processes (23Sachdeva A. Gouge J.

Dial Transpl. 2011; 26: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the role of Klotho in TSC2-related manifestations remains to be examined. Herein, we explored the roles of AGTR1 and Klotho in TSC2-deficient cells. We show that blocking AGTR1 in TSC2-deficient cells results in cell death in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Crucially, we also show that treatment with losartan, an AGTR1-blocker, as well as shRNA-mediated Agtr1 knockdown (KD) leads to induction of Klotho expression. Further, genetic manipulation of Klotho (silencing or overexpressing) leads to protection against or induction of cell death, respectively. Additionally, treatment with sKlotho increased TSC2-deficient cell death by reducing AKT phosphorylation. Based on our data, Klotho-dependent cytotoxic effect of AGTR1 blockade may highlight a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of LAM and other manifestations of TSC. Tuberin deficiency results in mTORC1 hyperactivation, leading to uncontrolled cell growth (45Cui Y. Steagall W.K. Lamattina A.M. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Stylianou M. Kidambi P. et al.Aberrant SYK kinase signaling is essential for tumorigenesis induced by TSC2 inactivation.Cancer Res. 2017; 77: 1492-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As we hypothesize that AGTR1 is involved in LAM pathogenesis, we first sought to determine whether AGTR1 expression is regulated upon Tsc2 loss. We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot using TSC2-deficient ELT3V and TSC2-addback ELT3T cells derived from Eker rat uterine leiomyoma (46Howe S.R. Everitt J.L. Gottardis M.M. Walker C. Rodent model of reproductive tract leiomyomata: characterization and use in preclinical therapeutic studies.Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1997; 396: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). Both cell types expressed Agtr1 mRNA and AGTR1 protein at similar levels, suggesting that AGTR1 expression is Tsc2 loss–independent (Fig. S1, A–D). Next, to determine the effects of AGTR1 blockade on TSC2-deficient cells, we treated ELT3V cells with losartan and examined the effects on cell survival. Treatment with losartan resulted in a decrease in P38 MAPK phosphorylation, a known downstream effector of AGTR1 signaling (Fig. S2, A and B) (47Imani J. Bodine S.P.M. Lamattina A.M. Ma D.D.

Additionally, treatment with losartan induced a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, suggesting disruption of the cell membrane and increased cytotoxicity (Fig. 1C). The deep blue cell viability assay also confirmed that losartan treatment led to reduced TSC2-deficient cell viability (Fig. S2E). To demonstrate that these effects are specific to TSC2-deficient cells, we treated TSC2-addback ELT3T cells with losartan and showed that in contrast to the effects of AGTR1 blockade in ELT3V cells, ELT3T cells treated with losartan did not have an increase in cell death as demonstrated by the lack of increase in cPARP level (Fig. S3, A and C) as well as no difference in LDH release compared to DMSO treatment (Fig. S3D). Since losartan can also affect transforming growth factor-β signaling in a nonreceptor-dependent manner (50Diop-Frimpong B. Chauhan V.P. Krane S. Boucher Y. Jain R.K.

Agtr1 KD cells, denoted by AT1-shRNA, showed significantly reduced Agtr1 mRNA and AGTR1 protein expressions compared to nontarget control cells (NT-shRNA) (Fig. 1, D–F). Like ELT3V cells treated with losartan, AT1-shRNA cells demonstrated increased level of cPARP expression compared to NT-shRNA cells (Fig. 1, E and G), increased LDH release (Fig. 1H), and decreased cell viability (Fig. S2F). Together, these data strongly suggest that Agtr1 gene silencing leads to increased TSC2-deficient cell death. These data demonstrate that, contrary to TSC2-addback cells, TSC2-deficient cells require continuous AGTR1 signaling for cell survival. Angiotensin receptor blockade has been shown to induce Klotho expression in the kidney (44Yoon H.E. Ghee J.Y. Piao S. Song J.H. Han D.H. Kim S. et al.Angiotensin II blockade upregulates the expression of Klotho, the anti-ageing gene, in an experimental model of chronic cyclosporine nephropathy.Nephrol.

Like Agtr1, comparison between TSC2-deficient ELT3V and TSC2-addback ELT3T cells showed no significant differences in Klotho expression (Fig. S1, B and D). Next, to evaluate whether Klotho is downstream of AGTR1 in TSC2-deficient cells, we treated ELT3V and ELT3T cells with losartan and analyzed cell lysates for Klotho expression with Western blotting. Our data showed that AGTR1 inhibition with losartan resulted in increased Klotho levels only in TSC2-deficient cells (Fig. 2, A and B) but not in TSC2-addback cells (Fig. S3, A and B). Further, to confirm that these effects are AGTR1-dependent, we examined Klotho protein levels in Agtr1 KD cells and found a corresponding increase in Klotho levels in AT1-shRNA cells compared to NT-shRNA cells (Fig. 2, C and D). To confirm the specificity of AT1-shRNA, a second construct (AT1-shRNA-2) was used to corroborate that Agtr1 silencing leads to increased Klotho expression and cell death (Fig. S4, A–E). Taken together, our data show that Klotho is downstream of the AGTR1 receptor in TSC2-deficient cells. To elucidate Klotho’s involvement in Agtr1 blockade–mediated cell death, we silenced Klotho using siRNA in ELT3V cells (Fig. 2, E and F), followed by treatment with losartan. We observed that cells targeted with Klotho siRNA had a marked decrease in cPARP compared to cells targeted with Scr siRNA (Fig. 2, E and G), suggesting that Klotho is necessary for AGTR1 blockade–dependent cell death in TSC2-deficient cells. These results were also confirmed with a second Klotho siRNA (Fig. S4, F–H). Finally, to examine if increased Klotho levels are sufficient to induce TSC2-deficient cell death, ELT3V cells were transiently transfected with Klotho or empty vector (EV) construct for 48 h and subjected to Western blotting. Cells overexpressing Klotho demonstrated increased cell death as shown by the increase in cPARP levels compared to vector transfected cells (Fig. 2, H–J). Taken together, these data show that Klotho is necessary and sufficient to induce TSC2-deficient cell death and that AGTR1 signaling is necessary for mTORC1-hyperactive cell survival. Next, we wanted to examine if sKlotho affects TSC2-deficient cell survival. First, we performed an LDH release assay with increasing sKlotho concentrations and determined that 100 ng/ml was the optimal dose (Fig. S2G), which is consistent with previous studies (55Batlahally S. Franklin A. Damianos A. Huang J. Chen P. Sharma M. et al.Soluble Klotho, a biomarker and therapeutic strategy to reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension in preterm infants.Sci.

Wu Q. et al.Klotho retards renal fibrosis through targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in renal tubular cells.Physiol. Rep. 2021; 9e14696Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Next, we exposed ELT3V cells with 100 ng/ml sKlotho for 24 h. Treatment with sKlotho significantly increased cPARP level, suggesting increased cell death (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar to AGTR1 inhibition, treatment of TSC2-addback ELT3T cells with sKlotho did not result in cell death (Fig. 3, C and D). Treatment with sKlotho also induced a significant increase in LDH release in TSC2-deficient ELT3V cells but not in TSC2-addback ELT3T cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Finally, sKlotho-driven cell death was also confirmed by demonstrating the decreased cell viability in TSC2-deficient cells (Fig. S2H). AKT signaling pathway is associated with proliferation/survival of various cancer cells, and Klotho overexpression has been shown to decrease activation of prosurvival phospho(p)-AKT (23Sachdeva A.

https://openalex.org/W4304080449,"Abstract The formation of macromolecular complexes can be measured by detection of changes in rotational mobility using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. However, this method is limited to relatively small molecules (~0.1–30 kDa), excluding the majority of the human proteome and its complexes. We describe selective time-resolved anisotropy with reversibly switchable states (STARSS), which overcomes this limitation and extends the observable mass range by more than three orders of magnitude. STARSS is based on long-lived reversible molecular transitions of switchable fluorescent proteins to resolve the relatively slow rotational diffusivity of large complexes. We used STARSS to probe the rotational mobility of several molecular complexes in cells, including chromatin, the retroviral Gag lattice and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein oligomers. Because STARSS can probe arbitrarily large structures, it is generally applicable to the entire human proteome."

However, there is limited existing guidance on the specific systematic checks that should be undertaken to confirm and enhance data quality for individual participant data meta-analyses and how to conduct these checks. We aim to address this gap by developing a checklist of items for data quality checking and cleaning to be applied to individual participant data meta-analyses of randomised trials. This study will comprise three phases: 1) a scoping review to identify potential checklist items; 2) two e-Delphi survey rounds among an invited panel of experts followed by a consensus meeting; and 3) pilot testing and refinement of the checklist, including development of an accompanying R-markdown program to facilitate its uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4304206003,"Background In response to reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) post-vaccination, the Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) vaccine was paused and then restarted in April 2021. Our objective was to assess whether this pause adversely impacted vaccine confidence. Methods Two large internet-based surveys were conducted in the US among adults to measure knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of the J&amp;J vaccine pause and rates of vaccine hesitancy among unvaccinated persons before, during and after the pause. Results Among 66% of respondents aware of the pause, 44% identified blood clots as the reason for the pause without prompting. The impact of the pause on vaccine behavior among unvaccinated persons and perception of the vaccine safety system was mixed and modified by trust in the public health authorities. Those who were less willing to get vaccinated because of the pause were less inclined for all vaccines, not only the J&amp;J product. Moreover, a notable proportion (22.1%) of the small number of persons (n = 30) vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine after the pause reported not receiving information about the risk of TTS. The proportion of unvaccinated persons who were hesitant was increasing before and during the pause and then leveled off after the pause. Conclusions The J&amp;J vaccine pause is unlikely to be a major barrier to vaccine uptake. Public attitudes about vaccines may be more resilient than appreciated, especially when safety issues are investigated with transparent communication. This paper has important implications for messaging and program administration with future vaccine-specific adverse events. Efforts may be warranted to ensure all persons being offered the J&amp;J vaccine are made aware of the risk of TTS."
https://openalex.org/W4304206079,"Building information modelling (BIM) is considered to be significant for organisational communication in construction projects. However, the role of BIM has not been fully shown in practice. To this end, this study examined the impact of BIM on communication network from inter- and intra- organisational relationships in the construction project. First, the structures of the communication networks before and after the use of BIM in a project in China were determined based on the social capital perspective. Then, the social network analysis was adopted to measure the changes in network metrics (i.e., number of ties, density, centrality, centralisation, and clique). Results shows that the connections among nodes are denser, and all the values of the network centralisation decrease after BIM application compared with the situation before BIM use. Nevertheless, results also shows that some construction project participants, who originally have interaction and communication needs, remain unable to establish effective connections among one another even after BIM use. Accordingly, some suggestions were proposed to solve the issues and deficiencies. This research contributes to (a) the state of knowledge by proposing social capital perspective that can identify inter- and intra-organizational relationships of the construction project from social interaction and common cognition to build communication network, and (b) the state of practice by identifying conditions and proposing strategies for strengthening organisational communication and collaboration in BIM-enabled network relationships."

As childhood TB cases rise, finding a diagnostic high in sensitivity and specificity is critical. In this study 91 urine samples from children aged 1-10 years were analyzed for tuberculostearic acid (TBSA) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and capture ELISA (C-ELISA). In C-ELISA the CS35/A194-01 antibody performed very poorly with both curve-based and model-based cutoffs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the CS35 OD450 values was only 0.60. Replacing the capture antibody with BJ76 gave a better performance in both sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.95). When these samples were analyzed by GC/MS, 41 classified as 'probable/possible' for TB were distinctly TBSA positive with ten samples having <3 ng/mL LAM. However, from the 50 samples with 'unlikely' TB classification, 36 were negative but 7 had >3 ng/mL and were designated as LAM positive. This experimental assay assessment study signifies that i) the antibody pair CS35/A194-01 that has been successful for adult active TB diagnosis is not adequate when LAM level is low as in pediatric TB; ii) no one mAb appears to recognize all TB-specific LAM epitopes."

Building on previous research looking at cultural differences in judgements of facial expressions, we examined how listeners recognize speech-embedded emotional expressions and make inferences about a speaker's feelings in relation to their vocal display. Canadian and Chinese participants categorized vocal expressions of emotions (anger, fear, happiness, sadness) expressed at different intensity levels in three languages (English, Mandarin, Hindi). In two additional tasks, participants rated the intensity of each emotional expression and the intensity of the speaker's feelings from the same stimuli. Each group was more accurate at recognizing emotions produced in their native language (in-group advantage). However, Canadian and Chinese participants both judged the speaker's feelings to be equivalent or more intense than their actual display (especially for highly aroused, negative emotions), suggesting that similar inference rules were applied to vocal expressions by the two cultures in this task. Our results provide new insights on how people categorize and interpret speech-embedded vocal expressions versus facial expressions and what cultural factors are at play."

The study also sought to identify the effect of the qualification and years of experience variables on the degree to which the NGSS-aligned practices were present in the performance of physics teachers. The study adopted a mixed method in applying a closed-ended questionnaire and an interview. The questionnaire comprised 44 indicators and was applied to (49) teachers who were randomly selected. The interview was applied to (6) education supervisors who were purposively selected. The results revealed that the following five practices: “asking questions and identifying problems”; “obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information”; “planning and carrying out investigations”; “analyzing and interpreting data”; and “involvement with proofs and evidence” all rated medium. The three practices, “interpretation and solutions design”; “developing and using models”; and “using mathematics and computational thinking” all rated weak. Data analysis of education supervisors’ interviews revealed that their opinions were, to an extent, concordant with the questionnaire findings. The results also revealed that graduate teachers exhibited a higher level of these practices than the teachers with just BS degrees while years of experience, as a variable, had no significant difference in teachers’ use of these practices. It was concluded that teachers of physics need to reconsider their teaching practices to be aligned with NGSS. This study can be a contribution to teachers’ professional development efforts that target the alignment of science instruction with the NGSS."

Introduction Many interventions to prevent ECC have multiple interacting components and can be seen as CHI’s. Recent reviews on these interventions have found inconclusive effects, which may be due to differences in the development, evaluation, and implementation of CHI’s. Inclusion criteria This scoping review will consider clinical trials reporting CHI’s to prevent ECC that starts during pregnancy or in the first year of life. Studies in the English language will be included regardless of the country of origin, sociocultural setting, or context. Methods This review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. An initial search of PubMed identified keywords and Medical Subject Headings terms. A second search of PubMed, Embase, Clarivate Analytics/Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Wiley/Cochrane Library will follow. Two independent reviewers will perform title and abstract screening, retrieve and review full-text studies, and extract data. The reference lists of all included sources will be screened for additional CHI’s or relevant publications about a specific CHI. Data charting will be utilised based on study characteristics and intervention complexity. A 39-item instrument will be used to explore the details in the description of the CHI’s development, evaluation, and implementation. The results will be presented in tables, visual outputs, and a narrative summary in response to the review questions. Discussion The proposed review will generate evidence which may provide a direction for the future design of studies on CHI’s to prevent ECC and more complete information for those who want to adopt successful interventions to prevent ECC."

We extended the embodied carbon flow network analysis at the provincial level. The results demonstrated the following: (1) The interprovincial embodied carbon flow network of China's exports has small-world and scale-free characteristics. The node degree probability distribution curves for the networks obviously conformed to a decreasing power law distribution, indicating that a few industrial sectors carry a large amount of embodied carbon and suggesting that reducing the embodied carbon of China's exports could yield twice the results with half the effort as long as attention is paid to a few sectors. (2) The key nodes and edges in the networks show that industrial sectors and production chains such as the power and heat production and supply industry, the petroleum processing, coking, and nuclear fuel processing industry, and the metal smelting and calendering industry play the role of key ""bridges"" in the entire network, among which Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi are important node provinces and the main flow paths for the generation of embodied carbon in national exports. These industrial sectors and production chains should bolster their policies to encourage the innovation of carbon emission reduction technologies and decrease carbon emissions, so as to reduce the embodied carbon of national exports on a large scale.

This study investigated the effects of using low-dye taping on plyometric performance and muscle activities in recreational basketball players with overpronated feet.Twelve collegiate males with at least three years basketball training experience and navicular drop (ND) value ≥10 mm performed the navicular drop, drop jump and countermovement jump tests. Surface electromyography of selected lower limb muscles were observed during bilateral free squat. All tests in non-taped (NT) and taped (TAP) conditions were counterbalanced using repeated crossover study design. Paired t-test with an alpha level of 0.05 and non-clinical magnitude-based decision (MBD) with standardized effects were used to analyze data.Contact time and reactive strength index (RSI) in the TAP condition were significantly shorter (p = 0.041) and higher (p<0.01) than the NT condition respectively. No significant difference in CMJ performance between NT and TAP was observed. MBD demonstrated clear effects on both ND (standardized effect: -1.54±0.24), flight time (standardized effect: 0.24±0.30), contact time (standardized effect: -0.27±0.21), RSI (standardized effect: 0.69±0.35) and eccentric activities of inferior gluteus maximus (standardized effect: 0.23±0.35), gluteus medius (standardized effect: 0.26±0.29) and tibialis anterior (standardized effect: 0.22±0.06).LDT is effective in correcting overpronated feet by increasing ND height. Meanwhile, it provides a small increase in RSI and gluteal muscle activity during the eccentric (down) phase of the bilateral squat, and without affecting CMJ performance.

https://openalex.org/W4304204917,"Background Previous international studies have shown that over-indebtedness is associated with poor health. However, in Switzerland research addressing over-indebtedness is widely lacking, strongly needed and particularly important because it is evidently a rising but still commonly tabooed, socially “undesired” and highly stigmatized phenomenon that is rarely discussed and largely ignored and unexplored. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among over-indebted adults seeking advice from one of the four official debt advisory centers in the Canton of Zurich. The survey finally included 219 respondents participating voluntarily and anonymously. This sample was then linked with a comparable subsample of the nationally representative Swiss Health Survey of 2017, namely 1,997 respondents of the same age from the Canton of Zurich. For reasons of comparability identical health questions and measures were taken from the Swiss Health Survey and used in the over-indebtedness survey. The pooled or combined dataset covered a total of 2,216 adult individuals. Results Remarkably high prevalence rates and relative risks of poor self-rated health, severe musculoskeletal and sleep disorders and moderate to severe depression were observed among over-indebted individuals compared to the general population. More than 50% of the over-indebted individuals had poor general health or moderate to severe depression compared to the general population with 14% and 7%, respectively. And far above one third of the over-indebted but ‘only’ between 6% and 8% of the general population showed severe musculoskeletal disorders and sleep disorders. Even after adjustment for various control variables and covariates, over-indebtedness increased the odds ratios for poor health outcomes consistently and dramatically, i.e. by a factor of 8 and more (aOR = 8.5–11.6). Conclusions Over-indebtedness in Switzerland has particularly negative effects on various aspects of the health of the persons concerned, irrespective of their demographic characteristics and their social and employment status."
https://openalex.org/W4304204918,"Background Frailty is a key issue in current healthcare delivery and falls is an important component. Care and support planning (CSP) is an established approach to managing long term conditions (LTCs) and has potential to provide more person-centred care for those at risk of falling. This qualitative evaluation aimed to understand the barriers and success criteria involved in incorporating falls assessment and management into the CSP process. Methods CSP for falls prevention was implemented in eight general practices in the North of England. Six of the eight practices participated in the qualitative evaluation. Seven group interviews were undertaken with staff (n = 31) that included practice nurses, health care assistants, nurses, and administrative staff (n = 2–8 per group). Observations of the falls and CSP training provided additional data. Interviews covered experiences and potential impacts of training, and processes of implementation of the programme, and were informed by normalisation process theory. Thematic analysis was undertaken using a team-based approach. Results Although successfully implemented across the practices, how established CSP was and therefore ‘organisational readiness’ was an overarching theme that illustrated differences in how easily sites were able to implement the additional elements for frailty. The challenges, successes and impacts of implementation are demonstrated through this theme and four further themes: training resources and learning; positive impacts of the programme (including enabling easier conversations around ‘frailty’); integrating work processes/work with patients; and dealing with uncertainty and complexity. Conclusions Care and Support Planning services designed to target frailty and falls is feasible and can successfully be delivered in the primary care setting, if key enablers are promoted and challenges to implementation addressed from planning through to integration in practice."

Although risk factors for PPCs have been identified in high-income countries, less is known about PPCs and their risk factors in low- and middle-income countries, such as South Africa. This study examined the incidence of PPCs and their associated risk factors among general surgery patients in a public hospital in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to inform future quality improvement initiatives to decrease PPCs in this clinical population. Methods A retrospective secondary analysis of adult patients with general surgery admissions from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017 was conducted using data from the health system’s Hybrid Electronic Medical Registry. The sample was comprised of 5352 general surgery hospitalizations. PPCs included pneumonia, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, prolonged ventilation, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and other respiratory morbidity which encompassed empyema, aspiration, pleural effusion, bronchopleural fistula, and lower respiratory tract infection. Risk factors examined were age, tobacco use, number and type of pre-existing comorbidities, emergency surgery, and number and type of surgeries. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to identify risk factors for developing a PPC. Results The PPC rate was 7.8%. Of the 418 hospitalizations in which a patient developed a PPC, the most common type of PPC was pneumonia (52.4%) and the mortality rate related to the PPC was 11.7%. Significant risk factors for a PPC were increasing age, greater number of comorbidities, emergency surgery, greater number of general surgeries, and abdominal surgery. Conclusions PPCs are common in general surgery patients in low- and middle-income countries, with similar rates observed in high-income countries. These complications worsen patient outcomes and increase mortality. Quality improvement initiatives that employ resource-conscious methods are needed to reduce PPCs in low- and middle-income countries."

This program is believed to be the most effective strategy for reaching a large group of children suffering from SAM in rural and disadvantaged communities. Nonetheless, poor treatment outcomes, notably mortality and prolonged recovery time, become pressing public health problems, which could be a result of suboptimal implementation and poor service quality.To evaluate the implementation of C-OTP for managing uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in the Central Gondar Zone.Multiple studies involving both qualitative and quantitative will be conducted. Availability of essential drugs and equipment, acceptability of the program by mothers/caregivers, health extension workers' compliance to the treatment protocol, and treatment outcome will be assessed employing different methods. Likewise, knowledge of health extension workers about SAM diagnosis and management and their skills to diagnose and manage uncomplicated malnutrition will be determined. Health extension workers, mothers/caregivers, supervisors, and healthcare administrators will be enrolled in the study. Besides, children's medical records registered between 2017 and 2020 will be reviewed to determine the treatment outcome. The data will be collected using pretested self-administered and face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires. Similarly, focus group discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews, and observation checklists will be applied. Binary logistic regression analysis will be conducted, while the qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic content analysis.Severe acute malnutrition is a public health problem that remains the underlying cause for over half of under-five mortality in Ethiopia. As a result, community-based therapeutic care has been launched in the country to address these problems and maximize population-level impact by improving treatment coverage, access, and cost-effectiveness. Despite its achievement, the program has been threatened with unfavourable treatment outcomes and a shortfall of resources. Hence, this implementation evaluation study will also identify gaps between healthcare systems and service users.

Thus, it is necessary to identify individual and environmental factors that encourage drinking. This study investigated factors associated with the sustainable use of alcohol (SUA) in adolescents who consume alcohol, and the possibility of future drinking (PFD) in non-drinking adolescents. Data from ""The Adolescents Awareness Survey of Alcohol Encouraging Environment"" by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Korea Health Promotion Institute (2017) were used. The survey was completed by 1,038 participant, selected through a proportional allocation extraction method, who were aged 13-18 years and lived in five cities with a population of over 1 million. The factors associated with SUA included gender (β = 0.634, p = 0.004), grade (8th β = 1.591, p<0.001, 9th β = 1.674, p<0.001, 10th β = 1.497, p = 0.001, 11th β = 1.041, p = 0.004, 12th β = 2.610, p<0.001), drinking alone (β = -2.147, p = 0.002), liquor commercial (β = 1.644, p<0.001), ease of alcohol purchase (β = 1.541, p = 0.025), parent's recommendation for drinking (β = 1.084, p<0.001), not knowing the mother's education level (β = -0.685, p = 0.045), positive expectancy of drinking (β = 0.141, p<0.001), number of pubs (β = 0.303, p = 0.002), internet game cafes (β = 0.456, p = 0.019), and karaokes (β = -0.098, p = 0.023) in the community. The factors associated with the PFD in non-drinkers were grade (8th β = 0.531, p = 0.024, 10th β = 0.717, p = 0.035, 12th β = 1.882, p = 0.001), liquor commercial (β = -1.355, p<0.001), parent's recommendation for drinking (β = 0.783, p = 0.020), positive expectancy of drinking (β = 0.139, p<0.001), and relationship with the father (β = 0.072, p = 0.033). Multidimensional interventions, including those by individuals, parents, peers, and local communities, are needed to prevent SUA and the PFD in adolescents."
