https://openalex.org/W2498411827,"In a mouse model of ischaemia, mitochondrial particles released from astroctyes are taken up by adjacent neurons, leading to enhanced cell survival signalling; disruption of this release mechanism resulted in worsened neurological outcomes. Emerging results suggest that neurons can transfer damaged mitochondria into adjacent astrocytes for disposal and recycling. Here Eng Lo and colleagues identify a transfer of healthy mitochondria in the opposite direction. In a mouse model of ischaemia, the authors demonstrate the release of mitochondrial particles from astrocytes that are taken up by adjacent neurons, leading to enhanced cell survival signalling. Disrupting this transfer led to worsened neurological outcomes. These findings suggest a previously unknown form of crosstalk between glia and damaged neurons, and suggest pathways that may be potentially targeted for improving stroke recovery in the future. Neurons can release damaged mitochondria and transfer them to astrocytes for disposal and recycling1. This ability to exchange mitochondria may represent a potential mode of cell-to-cell signalling in the central nervous system. Here we show that astrocytes in mice can also release functional mitochondria that enter neurons. Astrocytic release of extracellular mitochondrial particles was mediated by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving CD38 and cyclic ADP ribose signalling. Transient focal cerebral ischaemia in mice induced entry of astrocytic mitochondria into adjacent neurons, and this entry amplified cell survival signals. Suppression of CD38 signalling by short interfering RNA reduced extracellular mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological outcomes. These findings suggest a new mitochondrial mechanism of neuroglial crosstalk that may contribute to endogenous neuroprotective and neurorecovery mechanisms after stroke."

Bale et al. used pairwise combinations of dimeric, trimeric, or pentameric building blocks to design two-component, 120-subunit protein complexes with three distinct icosahedral architectures. The capsid-like nanostructures are large enough to hold nucleic acids or other proteins, and because they have two components, the assembly of cargoes such as drugs and vaccines can be done in a controlled way.

Here we show that multiple lineages of the predominant bacterial taxa in the gut arose via cospeciation with humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas over the past 15 million years. Analyses of strain-level bacterial diversity within hominid gut microbiomes revealed that clades of Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae have been maintained exclusively within host lineages across hundreds of thousands of host generations. Divergence times of these cospeciating gut bacteria are congruent with those of hominids, indicating that nuclear, mitochondrial, and gut bacterial genomes diversified in concert during hominid evolution. This study identifies human gut bacteria descended from ancient symbionts that speciated simultaneously with humans and the African apes."
https://openalex.org/W2487385493,"Understanding freshwater fluxes at continental scales will help us better predict hydrologic response and manage our terrestrial water resources. The partitioning of evapotranspiration into bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration remains a key uncertainty in the terrestrial water balance. We used integrated hydrologic simulations that couple vegetation and land-energy processes with surface and subsurface hydrology to study transpiration partitioning at the continental scale. Both latent heat flux and partitioning are connected to water table depth, and including lateral groundwater flow in the model increases transpiration partitioning from 47 ± 13 to 62 ± 12%. This suggests that lateral groundwater flow, which is generally simplified or excluded in Earth system models, may provide a missing link for reconciling observations and global models of terrestrial water fluxes."
https://openalex.org/W2499326555,"Lattices of cubic building blocks that deform anisotropically and that are designed to fit together like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle are 3D printed to create aperiodic, frustration-free, mechanical metamaterials; these metamaterials act as programmable shape-shifters and are able to perform pattern analysis. The mechanical properties of a material can be engineered by controlling its underlying architecture. This engineered architecture is typically periodic and spatially homogeneous, targeting control of the bulk properties of the material. Martin van Hecke and colleagues have developed and implemented a design principle that enables a greater degree of complexity in mechanical response: they describe a scheme for preparing mechanical 'metamaterials' possessing aperiodic architectures and for which the resulting materials are pre-programmed to give complex, spatially textured responses. When such a material is subjected to spatially patterned linear compression (using a two-dimensional array of indentations, for example), it responds by predictably shifting to a new, spatially complex shape. Such a capability could find application in, for example, soft robotics. The structural complexity of metamaterials is limitless, but, in practice, most designs comprise periodic architectures that lead to materials with spatially homogeneous features1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. More advanced applications in soft robotics, prosthetics and wearable technology involve spatially textured mechanical functionality, which requires aperiodic architectures. However, a naive implementation of such structural complexity invariably leads to geometrical frustration (whereby local constraints cannot be satisfied everywhere), which prevents coherent operation and impedes functionality. Here we introduce a combinatorial strategy for the design of aperiodic, yet frustration-free, mechanical metamaterials that exhibit spatially textured functionalities. We implement this strategy using cubic building blocks—voxels—that deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule that allows cooperative shape changes by guaranteeing that deformed building blocks fit together as in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, and three-dimensional printing. These aperiodic metamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, whereby the two-dimensional pixelated surface texture dictates the three-dimensional interior voxel arrangement. They also act as programmable shape-shifters, morphing into spatially complex, but predictable and designable, shapes when uniaxially compressed. Finally, their mechanical response to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform sensing and pattern analysis. Combinatorial design thus opens up a new avenue towards mechanical metamaterials with unusual order and machine-like functionalities."

Neuroscientists can localize and manipulate them, but until now, little was known about how multiple engrams interact to influence memories. Rashid et al. examined how neural assemblies in an area called the lateral amygdala interact.

However, if the events were separated by 24 hours, distinct memory traces were formed. Science , this issue p. 383"
https://openalex.org/W2502908858,"Cancers often evade immune surveillance by adopting peripheral tissue- tolerance mechanisms, such as the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the inhibition of which results in potent antitumor immunity. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a serine-threonine kinase that is highly active in postmitotic neurons and in many cancers, allows medulloblastoma (MB) to evade immune elimination. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced PD-L1 up-regulation on MB requires Cdk5, and disruption of Cdk5 expression in a mouse model of MB results in potent CD4(+) T cell-mediated tumor rejection. Loss of Cdk5 results in persistent expression of the PD-L1 transcriptional repressors, the interferon regulatory factors IRF2 and IRF2BP2, which likely leads to reduced PD-L1 expression on tumors. Our finding highlights a central role for Cdk5 in immune checkpoint regulation by tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2489386941,"In solar-type stars (with radiative cores and convective envelopes like our Sun), the magnetic field powers star spots, flares and other solar phenomena, as well as chromospheric and coronal emission at ultraviolet to X-ray wavelengths. The dynamo responsible for generating the field depends on the shearing of internal magnetic fields by differential rotation. The shearing has long been thought to take place in a boundary layer known as the tachocline between the radiative core and the convective envelope. Fully convective stars do not have a tachocline and their dynamo mechanism is expected to be very different, although its exact form and physical dependencies are not known. Here we report observations of four fully convective stars whose X-ray emission correlates with their rotation periods in the same way as in solar-type stars. As the X-ray activity-rotation relationship is a well-established proxy for the behaviour of the magnetic dynamo, these results imply that fully convective stars also operate a solar-type dynamo. The lack of a tachocline in fully convective stars therefore suggests that this is not a critical ingredient in the solar dynamo and supports models in which the dynamo originates throughout the convection zone."

To minimize the filler content, it needs to be uniformly distributed in the composite, which is particularly challenging for nanoscale materials. Liu et al. alternately stacked sheets of graphene and polycarbonate to make a base composite. By further cutting and stacking, up to 320 aligned layers were made with a very uniform filler distribution. Alternatively, the initial stack could be rolled into a rod. In both cases, the properties exceeded what might be expected from a simple combination of the two materials. Science , this issue p. 364"

Regular communication between humans and wild animals, however, is rare. African honey-guide birds are known to regularly lead human honey-hunters to bee colonies, and the humans, on opening up the nest, leave enough mess for the birds to feast on. Spottiswoode et al. show that when the honey-hunters make a specific call, honey-guides are both more likely to come to their aid and more likely to find them a bee's nest.

When the trap is made shallower, the gas radially expands as the energy cost for atoms that are farther from the trap center decreases. Deng et al. observed an interesting effect when they reduced the characteristic frequency of the parabolic trap so that it was at any moment inversely proportional to the elapsed time. Instead of expanding continuously, a strongly interacting Fermi gas held in such a trap stalled at certain time points. These time points formed a geometric progression, a consequence of scale invariance in the strongly interacting limit. Science , this issue p. 371"

Germinating plants utilize oil bodies and peroxisomes to mobilize storage lipids for the generation of sucrose as the main energy source. Although membrane interaction between oil bodies and peroxisomes has been widely observed, its underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here we present genetic evidence for control of the physical interaction between oil bodies and peroxisomes. We identified alleles of the sdp1 mutant altered in oil body morphology. This mutant accumulates bigger and more oil body aggregates compared with the wild type and showed defects in lipid mobilization during germination. SUGAR DEPENDENT 1 (SDP1) encodes major triacylglycerol lipase in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, sdp1 seedlings show enhanced physical interaction between oil bodies and peroxisomes compared with the wild type, whereas exogenous sucrose supplementation greatly suppresses the interaction. The same phenomenon occurs in the peroxisomal defective 1 (ped1) mutant, defective in lipid mobilization because of impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation, indicating that sucrose production is a key factor for oil body-peroxisomal dissociation. Peroxisomal dissociation and subsequent release from oil bodies is dependent on actin filaments.

Membrane-delimited organelles perform specialized subcellular functions. They communicate with each other through physical interaction, exerting functions as a community to benefit the cells, such as energy transduction and lipid delivery (1Toulmay A. Prinz W.A.

Those interactions are dynamic and rapid upon intracellular and extracellular signals. Notably, organelle interactions are highly selective, attributed to specific membrane protein-protein interaction, which, in some cases, is mediated through cytoplasmic linker proteins.

Oil bodies, also referred to as lipid bodies or lipid droplets, have been widely found in eukaryotic cells and are the only place in cells that stores lipids for later usage. The hydrophobic core of oil bodies is composed of neutral lipids, mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterol esters (5Czabany T. Wagner A. Zweytick D. Lohner K. Leitner E. Ingolic E. Daum G.

In plant, TAGs stored in the seeds are the main energy reservoir during seed germination. Accumulation of those storage lipids occurs mainly in the cotyledon tissues during plant embryogenesis (7Mansfield S.G. Briarty L.G. Cotyledon cell development in Arabidopsis thaliana during reserve deposition.Can. J. Bot. 1992; 70: 151-164Crossref Google Scholar). This process is accompanied by oil body biogenesis, featuring an increased number and size of cellular oil bodies (8Brown L.A. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Hawes C. Paudyal R. Warriner S.L. Baker A.

Oleosins, caleosins, and steroleosins have been identified in plant as the major constituents of oil body membrane proteins, of which oleosin is the most abundant (14Tzen J.T.C. Integral proteins in plant oil bodies.ISRN Botany. 2012; 2012: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar). For example, oleosins represent 80–90% of total proteins isolated from oil body membranes in sesame (15Tzen J.T. Peng C.C. Cheng D.J. Chen E.C. Chiu J.M. A new method for seed oil body purification and examination of oil body integrity following germination.J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Suppression of oleosins in Arabidopsis resulted in bigger oil bodies in embryonic tissues, suggesting that oleosins are involved in the regulation of oil body morphology (16Siloto R.M. Findlay K.

The accumulation of oleosins determines the size of seed oil bodies in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Mobilization of TAGs is essential for germinating plants to generate sucrose as the main energy source during the nonautotrophic stage before photosynthesis. Degradation of TAGs mainly occurs in cotyledons. Sucrose generated from TAG metabolism is transported to nonautotrophic organs such as roots from the cotyledon through the phloem (17Ayre B.G.

Symplastic continuity between companion cells and the translocation stream: long-distance transport is controlled by retention and retrieval mechanisms in the phloem.Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1518-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Oil bodies and peroxisomes are central organelles for storage lipid degradation during seed germination. Sugar-dependent 1 (SDP1) is a patatin-like TAG lipase that resides on the oil body membrane and mobilizes TAGs up to 90% upon germination in Arabidopsis (18Eastmond P.J.

SDP1 hydrolyzes TAG to produce fatty acids. Fatty acids are then translocated into peroxisomes by a peroxisomal membrane protein ATP binding cassette transporter, PED3 (also known as COMATOSE (CTS) and PXA1) (19Hayashi M. Nito K.

Loss of XRN4 function can trigger cosuppression in a sequence-dependent manner.Plant Cell Physiol. 2012; 53: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our previous report has shown that oil bodies in AtOleG aggregate with each other and are displayed as green spots under a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 1A) (36Hayashi M. Nanba C. Saito M. Kondo M. Takeda A. Watanabe Y. Nishimura M. Loss of XRN4 function can trigger cosuppression in a sequence-dependent manner.Plant Cell Physiol. 2012; 53: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The size of these aggregates and the amounts of storage lipids in the seedlings gradually decrease along germination. With the aim of identifying the mutants with altered morphology of oil bodies or/and oil body aggregates, we mutagenized AtOleG seeds by ethyl methane sulfonate treatment and conducted a forward genetic screening. As a result, we identified two mutants that accumulate more oil bodies in germinating seedlings (Fig. 1A). The diameter of oil body aggregates in the hypocotyl of 3-day-old AtOleG was 3∼10 μm (Fig. 1A, AtOleG). The oil body aggregates in the mutants appeared significantly larger (Fig. 1A, sdp1–6(OleG)); the size of those aggregates was 206 ± 141 μm2 versus 22 ± 16 μm2 in the wild type. The morphology of oil body aggregates in the mutants varied. Many of them appeared as tubular structures that extended up to 100 μm in length. The elongated morphology is probably due to the physical pressure caused by cell vacuolation. Big oil body aggregates were maintained in the mutants during the later stage of germination, whereas the aggregates became largely limited in the wild type, indicating higher accumulation of oil bodies in the mutants. High-resolution mapping of the mutants revealed that the mutations in both mutants were located 3.9 centimorgans away from At5g01060, 1.0 centimorgans away from At5g05100, and close to At5g03730. We carefully analyzed the DNA sequence in this region and found that the mutants bear mutations in a gene, At5g04040, that is annotated as SDP1 (Fig. 1B), encoding a TAG lipase located on the oil body membrane. One of the mutants is identical to the previously reported sdp1–1 (18Eastmond P.J. SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 encodes a patatin domain triacylglycerol lipase that initiates storage oil breakdown in germinating Arabidopsis seeds.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), whereas the other mutant contains a single nucleotide substitution in nucleotide 1339 (guanine to adenine), changing amino acid 447 from Val to Met in the encoded gene product (Fig. 1B). We designated this allele sdp1–6 and called the mutant sdp1–6(OleG). SDP1 is a major lipase in Arabidopsis, with higher lipase activity against TAG than diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol and shares the highest sequence similarity with yeast TGL3 (18Eastmond P.J. SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 encodes a patatin domain triacylglycerol lipase that initiates storage oil breakdown in germinating Arabidopsis seeds.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 37Athenstaedt K. Daum G. YMR313c/TGL3 encodes a novel triacylglycerol lipase located in lipid particles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23317-23323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Like previously identified sdp1 mutant alleles (18Eastmond P.J. SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 encodes a patatin domain triacylglycerol lipase that initiates storage oil breakdown in germinating Arabidopsis seeds.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), sdp1–6(OleG) exhibited sucrose-dependent post-germinative growth (Fig. 1, C and E) and a defect in lipid degradation (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, sucrose-dependent growth in the sdp1 mutant was not significant during early seedling germination (3 days, Fig. 1D) but became evident at a later stage (10 days, Fig. 1E) under dark conditions. We further analyzed the oil body-peroxisome interaction by using 3-day-old dark-grown seedlings in the presence or absence of sucrose to minimize the effects of the tissue stage on organelle appearance, such as differences in cell volume. Both oil bodies and peroxisomes are involved in lipid metabolism, during which oil bodies deliver fatty acids to peroxisomes (20Zolman B.K. Silva I.D. Bartel B. The Arabidopsis pxa1 mutant is defective in an ATP-Binding cassette transporter-like protein required for peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation.Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1266-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, to elucidate the correlation between lipid metabolism and the dynamic behavior of oil bodies and peroxisomes, we established transgenic Arabidopsis, AtThiR, containing a chimeric gene encoding a fusion protein, ThiR, composed of the N terminus of peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase with peroxisomal targeting signal 2 and N-terminal red fluorescence protein (RFP) (25Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. cDNA cloning and expression of a gene for 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase in pumpkin cotyledons.Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes in AtThiR were visualized as red fluorescence. AtThiR was crossed with AtOleG and sdp1–6(OleG). In these plants, oil bodies and peroxisomes were visualized at the same time. They were designated AtOleG/ThiR and sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR). In AtOleG/ThiR seedlings, most peroxisomes were found in the cytosol (Fig. 2A, AtOleG/ThiR), and less than 20% of peroxisomes were attached to oil bodies (Fig. 2D). No significant difference was observed between AtOleG/ThiR seedlings grown in the presence or absence of sucrose (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, in sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings grown without sucrose, nearly all peroxisomes were attached to oil bodies, forming oil body-peroxisome clusters (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, exogenous sucrose supplementation greatly reduced this attachment (Fig. 2, A–C). Sucrose did not affect the morphology of oil body aggregates in sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings (Fig. 2A) at this stage, except that each oil body was generally smaller in the presence of sucrose (Fig. 2B). Oil body-peroxisome clusters in sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings were observed in the presence or absence of sucrose (Fig. 2A); however, the direct membrane attachment between oil bodies and peroxisomes seemed largely reduced in the presence of sucrose (Fig. 2B). It is noted that peroxisomes were uniformly spherical in the presence of sucrose, whereas, in the absence of sucrose, those in clusters with oil bodies showed irregular and, in some cases, tubular shapes. Those elongated peroxisomes were frequently observed to surround oil body surfaces (Fig. 2B, arrowhead), forming a larger interaction interface. To quantify the response of sdp1–6 seedlings against sucrose in relation to oil body-peroxisomal interaction, 3-day-old sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings grown without sucrose were transferred to growth medium containing 2% sucrose. After induction, peroxisomal separation from oil bodies occurred in 20% of seedlings within 6 h and was eventually observed in all seedlings within 18–24 h (Fig. 2C). Almost no peroxisomes were observed in the cytosol in sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings initially grown without sucrose (Fig. 2D). A total of 20% and 45% of peroxisomes appeared in the cytosol after 24 and 48 h of sucrose incubation, respectively (Fig. 2D). In contrast, all AtOleG/ThiR seedlings grown without sucrose showed the presence of unattached peroxisomes in the cytosol (Fig. 2C). Those unattached peroxisomes dispersed in the cytosol constituted about 80% of total peroxisomes (Fig. 2D). To rule out the possibility that sucrose-induced dissociation between oil bodies and peroxisomes might be a result of osmotic stress, we also tested the effect of various sugars, including mannitol, which is a reduced form of glucose and is used ordinarily as a control for osmotic pressure (Fig. 2E). sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings were germinated on various sugars for 3 days under dark conditions, followed by quantification of peroxisomes. sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings grown on metabolizable sugars showed dispersed peroxisomes in the cytosol with a similar level as those grown on sucrose, except that fructose, galactose, and maltose exhibited slightly lower levels than sucrose and glucose at 40 mm. By contrast, seedlings grown on an equivalent concentration of mannitol were deficient in those unattached peroxisomes and showed all peroxisomes clustering with oil bodies, indicating that the effect of sugars on the dissociation of peroxisomes from oil bodies is not due to the osmotic pressure but by the metabolizable sugars. These results show that both endogenous sucrose production in plants and exogenous sucrose application suppress physical interaction between oil bodies and peroxisomes. To check whether there is a physical tethering between oil bodies and peroxisomes, we isolated oil bodies from sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings and tested for the presence of peroxisomes. It has been known that oil bodies could be easily isolated by centrifugation of the crude extract prepared from etiolated cotyledons. As a result, oil bodies isolated from sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings grown without sucrose contained significantly higher numbers of peroxisomes compared with those grown in the presence of sucrose (Fig. 3A). A Western blotting experiment showed the presence of a larger quantity of peroxisomal membrane (ascorbate peroxidase) and matrix (3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase) proteins in the oil body fraction isolated from sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings grown without sucrose (Fig. 3B). These results indicate the presence of physical tethering between oil bodies and peroxisomes in seedlings grown without sucrose. Actin filaments drive the movement of various organelles, including peroxisomes in plants (28Mano S. Nakamori C. Hayashi M. Kato A. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Distribution and characterization of peroxisomes in Arabidopsis by visualization with GFP: dynamic morphology and actin-dependent movement.Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether actin filaments are involved in the sucrose-induced dissociation of peroxisomes from oil bodies. Three-day-old sdp1–6(OleG/ThiR) seedlings initially grown without sucrose were transferred to sucrose medium supplemented with or without latrunculin B (LATB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. As shown in Fig. 4A, LATB treatment negatively affected sucrose-induced peroxisomal dissociation from oil bodies in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, 0.1 μm LATB completely abolished the sucrose-induced appearance of peroxisomes in the cytosol (Fig. 4B), indicating that peroxisomal dissociation from oil bodies requires peroxisome mobility mediated by actin filaments. Next we tested whether the suppressive effect of sucrose on the oil body-peroxisome interaction observed in sdp1 also occurs in the wild type. Because oil bodies were reduced too rapidly in the hypocotyl tissues of the wild type during germination, we instead observed cotyledon tissues. Wild-type AtOleG/ThiR seeds were germinated on medium in the dark in the presence or absence of 2% sucrose, and epidermal cells were investigated. 2 days after germination, nearly all peroxisomes were attached to oil bodies in seedlings grown without sucrose (Fig. 5, A and C). Peroxisomes gradually disassociated from oil bodies from 3 days post-germination (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, large numbers of peroxisomes were observed in the cytosol, remaining unattached to oil bodies in the presence of sucrose (Fig. 5, A and C). The population of peroxisomes in physical association with oil bodies was increased 3 days post-germination"

The initial step of violacein biosynthesis is the oxidative conversion of l-tryptophan into the corresponding α-imine catalyzed by the flavoenzyme l-tryptophan oxidase (VioA). A substrate-related (3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid) and a product-related (2-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)prop-2-enoic acid) competitive VioA inhibitor was synthesized for subsequent kinetic and x-ray crystallographic investigations. Structures of the binary VioA·FADH2 and of the ternary VioA·FADH2·2-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)prop-2-enoic acid complex were resolved. VioA forms a “loosely associated” homodimer as indicated by small-angle x-ray scattering experiments. VioA belongs to the glutathione reductase family 2 of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases according to the structurally conserved cofactor binding domain. The substrate-binding domain of VioA is mainly responsible for the specific recognition of l-tryptophan. Other canonical amino acids were efficiently discriminated with a minor conversion of l-phenylalanine. Furthermore, 7-aza-tryptophan, 1-methyl-tryptophan, 5-methyl-tryptophan, and 5-fluoro-tryptophan were efficient substrates of VioA. The ternary product-related VioA structure indicated involvement of protein domain movement during enzyme catalysis. Extensive structure-based mutagenesis in combination with enzyme kinetics (using l-tryptophan and substrate analogs) identified Arg64, Lys269, and Tyr309 as key catalytic residues of VioA. An increased enzyme activity of protein variant H163A in the presence of l-phenylalanine indicated a functional role of His163 in substrate binding. The combined structural and mutational analyses lead to the detailed understanding of VioA substrate recognition.

The amino acid tryptophan (Trp) is a versatile metabolite that is shunted into several microbial secondary pathways. The oxidative dimerization of two Trp scaffolds is an essential step for the synthesis of the natural bisindole compounds violacein, rebeccamycin, and staurosporine. The water-insoluble purple pigment violacein is mainly produced by the bacteria Chromobacterium violaceum and Janthinobacterium lividum in tropical habitats where it might be responsible for the shielding against UV radiation (1Antônio R.V.

Furthermore, the postulated IPA imine dimer reaction product is also labile, which might reflect the need for an activated substrate for the unusual [1,2]-shift of the indole ring during VioE catalysis. However, present date in vitro investigations revealed that the direct interaction of VioA and VioB (or of VioB and VioE) is not an absolute prerequisite for protodeoxyviolaceinic acid synthesis (7Balibar C.J.

In a recent publication, 50% FAD occupancy was determined for recombinantly purified VioA protein. Kinetic characterization of this protein was performed in a tandem peroxidase assay with an optimal pH of 9.25. Formation of the unstable IPA imine goes along with a reduced flavin on VioA, which is subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen leading to stoichiometric peroxide formation. The detection of hydrogen peroxide revealed kcat and Km(Trp) values of 203 min−1 and 31 μm for VioA (7Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T.

This non-enzymatic chromopyrrolic acid formation is an essential step during staurosporine or rebeccamycin biosynthesis (Fig. 1) (3August P.R. Grossman T.H. Minor C. Draper M.P. MacNeil I.A.

Structural and biochemical investigations for VioE revealed that the sophisticated [1,2]-indole rearrangement is catalyzed in the absence of any cofactor or metal ion (67Hirano S. Asamizu S. Onaka H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 6459-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Violacein biosynthesis is completed by sequential action of two flavin-dependent oxygenases, VioD and VioC. VioD hydroxylates one indole ring at the 5-position to yield protoviolaceinic acid. Subsequently, VioC hydroxylates the second indole ring at the 2-position and spontaneous oxidative decarboxylation then leads to the formation of violacein (Fig. 1) (7Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. In vitro biosynthesis of violacein from l-tryptophan by the enzymes VioA-E from Chromobacterium violaceum.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the violacein biosynthetic pathway also results in the formation of deoxyviolacein (23Matz C. Webb J.S. Schupp P.J. Phang S.Y. Penesyan A. Egan S. Steinberg P. Kjelleberg S. Marine biofilm bacteria evade eukaryotic predation by targeted chemical defense.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Deoxyviolacein, lacking the hydroxyl group at position 5, is synthesized without involvement of VioD, which might indicate a certain degree of flexibility for VioC substrate recognition (Fig. 1). In this study, recombinantly produced VioA from C. violaceum is analyzed in a combined biochemical and x-ray crystallographic approach. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis along with kinetic experiments in the presence of artificial substrates or active site inhibitors reveal the molecular mechanism of VioA. The l-Trp oxidase VioA from C. violaceum was efficiently overproduced in Escherichia coli as a soluble GST-VioA fusion protein (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The tagged protein was immobilized on a glutathione-agarose column. Subsequently, the target VioA protein was liberated by on-column cleavage with PreScissionTM protease (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–7). Overall, 40 mg of the homogeneous target protein was obtained from 1 liter of cell culture. SDS-PAGE analyses indicated a relative molecular weight of 45,000 (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–7, calculated molecular mass, 47,159 Da) and the integrity of purified VioA was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy of a purified VioA sample revealed characteristic absorption maxima at 387 and 457 nm (Fig. 2B, solid line), as is characteristic for FAD-containing flavoproteins (24Macheroux P. UV-visible spectroscopy as a tool to study flavoproteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Spectroscopically, an overall FAD content of 55% was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of the oxidized flavin, in agreement with the outcome of a recent publication (7Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. In vitro biosynthesis of violacein from l-tryptophan by the enzymes VioA-E from Chromobacterium violaceum.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the FAD content of purified VioA was also estimated on the basis of single-turnover VioA activity experiments. Strict anoxic conditions were required to prevent the reoxidation of the resulting FADH2 cofactor due to electron transfer onto molecular oxygen. Purified samples of VioA at a concentration of 15 μm were incubated in the presence of varying l-Trp concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 μm. The recorded absorption spectra revealed a clear decrease of the characteristic FAD signal (Fig. 2B, compare solid line versus dotted lines). When the remaining FAD concentrations were plotted against the applied l-Trp concentration, an FAD content of ∼50% was estimated for the recombinantly purified VioA. Tight binding of the FAD cofactor was demonstrated in an aerobic dialysis experiment. Under the employed turnover conditions, the FAD cofactor is constantly regenerated due to the presence of O2. A VioA sample was incubated in the presence of a large volume of buffer containing 40 mm l-Trp. The resulting VioA dialysate after a subsequent buffer exchange step (to remove VioA educt and product) did not reveal a decreased FAD content (data not shown). The identification of efficient active site inhibitors is a well established strategy for the detailed understanding of enzyme mechanisms. Inhibitor concentrations of up to 10 mm were analyzed in the coupled VioA activity assay (9Kameya M. Onaka H. Asano Y. Selective tryptophan determination using tryptophan oxidases involved in bis-indole antibiotic biosynthesis.Anal. Biochem. 2013; 438: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or alternatively in VioA substrate depletion kinetics (compare Fig. 3, A–C). Experiments in the presence of d-Trp revealed a moderate VioA inhibition (72% relative activity, 10 mm d-Trp). In the present literature, citrate and o-aminobenzoate have been described as efficient inhibitors of LAAOs (21Pawelek P.D. Cheah J. Coulombe R. Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Vrielink A.

In agreement with these distantly related investigations, a relative activity of 15% in the presence of 10 mm citrate was observed. By contrast, in the presence of 10 mm o-aminobenzoate only a moderate inactivation indicated by a residual activity of 71% was determined (Fig. 3C). Because citrate does not closely resemble the l-Trp molecule, a substrate-related and a product-related l-Trp derivative was newly synthesized for subsequent inhibition experiments. In compound 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid (IAA), the amino group of l-Trp is replaced by a methyl group, whereas the non-chiral compound 2-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)prop-2-enoic acid (IEA) is carrying a methylene group, instead. Accordingly, the IEA molecule is sharing a closely related spatial orientation (due to the sp2-hybridized carbon) as the IPA imine reaction product of VioA (Fig. 3C). IEA and racemic IAA were synthesized from indole and methyl 2-(bromomethyl)acrylate (1) following a procedure from Holzapfel et al. (27Holzapfel C.W. Bischofberger K. Olivier J. A simple cycloaddition approach to a racemate of the natural sweetener monatin.Synth. Commun. 1994; 24: 3197-3211Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Methyl 2-(bromomethyl)acrylate was obtained in two steps from methyl acrylate and paraformaldehyde, followed by bromination with PBr3 (28Yu C. Liu B. Hu L.

Kinetic experiments revealed a residual specific VioA activity of 61 and 53% in the presence of 1 mm IEA and IAA. At inhibitor concentrations of 10 mm, residual activities of 7 and 1% were determined. Results for the efficient inhibitors citrate, IEA, and IAA were independently confirmed in substrate depletion activity assays (Fig. 3C). The results of these inhibition experiments were further substantiated in a direct biomolecular interaction study.FIGURE 4.Synthesis of potential VioA inhibitors IEA and rac-IAA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thermophoresis is a phenomenon that describes the movement of molecules along a temperature gradient (also termed Ludwig-Soret effect) (32Jerabek-Willemsen M. Wienken C.J. Braun D. Baaske P. Duhr S. Molecular interaction studies using microscale thermophoresis.Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2011; 9: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In this study, we made use of microscale thermophoresis to analyze the direct binding of citrate, IEA, and IAA to VioA (labeled with the fluorescence dye NT-647-NHS). Fluorescence was measured at a spot in the capillary that was heated by an IR laser beam. Inhibitor binding was observed as a change in the thermophoretic properties of the fluorescently labeled protein due to complex formation with VioA at various ligand concentrations. The following dissociation constants were determined in agreement with the results of the above mentioned inhibition study: IAA 32.2 ± 10.3 μm ≤ IEA 42.6 ± 13.6 μm ≤ citrate 45.3 ± 7.8 μm. According to these results, the newly synthesized compounds IEA and IAA were considered as promising candidates for the co-crystallization of VioA. The sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique was used to crystallize VioA, and the phase problem was resolved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data of a samarium nitrate-derivatized crystal. Electron density in the active center of the native VioA structure indicated the presence of the flavin cofactor (occupancy 100%). Crystals of VioA were also grown in the presence of IEA. The molecular replacement technique was used to solve the structure of the ternary VioA complex in the presence of the flavin and IEA.

https://openalex.org/W2487367705,"The molecular and population genetic evidence of the phylogenetic status of the Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) is not well understood, and little is known about this species’ genetic diversity. This knowledge gap is partly due to the difficulty of sample collection. This is the first work to address this question. Here, the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of 636 individual Tibetan sheep from fifteen populations were assessed using 642 complete sequences of the mitochondrial DNA D-loop. Samples were collected from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau area in China, and reference data were obtained from the six reference breed sequences available in GenBank. The length of the sequences varied considerably, between 1031 and 1259 bp. The haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were 0.992±0.010 and 0.019±0.001, respectively. The average number of nucleotide differences was 19.635. The mean nucleotide composition of the 350 haplotypes was 32.961% A, 29.708% T, 22.892% C, 14.439% G, 62.669% A+T, and 37.331% G+C. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all four previously defined haplogroups (A, B, C, and D) were found in the 636 individuals of the fifteen Tibetan sheep populations but that only the D haplogroup was found in Linzhou sheep. Further, the clustering analysis divided the fifteen Tibetan sheep populations into at least two clusters. The estimation of the demographic parameters from the mismatch analyses showed that haplogroups A, B, and C had at least one demographic expansion in Tibetan sheep. These results contribute to the knowledge of Tibetan sheep populations and will help inform future conservation programs about the Tibetan sheep native to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau."
https://openalex.org/W2500412781,"Agp1 is a canonical biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome from the soil bacterium Agrobacterium fabrum that acts as a light-regulated histidine kinase. Crystal structures of the photosensory core modules (PCMs) of homologous phytochromes have provided a consistent picture of the structural changes that these proteins undergo during photoconversion between the parent red light-absorbing state (Pr) and the far-red light-absorbing state (Pfr). These changes include secondary structure rearrangements in the so-called tongue of the phytochrome-specific (PHY) domain and structural rearrangements within the long α-helix that connects the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA (GAF) and the PHY domains. We present the crystal structures of the PCM of Agp1 at 2.70 A resolution and of a surface-engineered mutant of this PCM at 1.85 A resolution in the dark-adapted Pr states. Whereas in the mutant structure the dimer subunits are in anti-parallel orientation, the wild-type structure contains parallel subunits. The relative orientations between the PAS-GAF bidomain and the PHY domain are different in the two structures, due to movement involving two hinge regions in the GAF-PHY connecting α-helix and the tongue, indicating pronounced structural flexibility that may give rise to a dynamic Pr state. The resolution of the mutant structure enabled us to detect a sterically strained conformation of the chromophore at ring A that we attribute to the tight interaction with Pro-461 of the conserved PRXSF motif in the tongue. Based on this observation and on data from mutants where residues in the tongue region were replaced by alanine, we discuss the crucial roles of those residues in Pr-to-Pfr photoconversion."
https://openalex.org/W2490618010,"Understanding the factors associated with the long-term stress levels of captive animals is important from the view of animal welfare. In this study, we investigated the effects of relocation in addition to individual and environmental factors related to social management on long-term stress level in group-living captive chimpanzees by examining behaviors and hair cortisol (HC). Specifically, we conducted two studies. The first compared changes in HC levels before and after the relocation of 8 chimpanzees (Study 1) and the second examined the relationship between individual and environmental factors and individual HC levels in 58 chimpanzees living in Kumamoto Sanctuary (KS), Kyoto University (Study 2). We hypothesized that relocation, social situation, sex, and early rearing conditions, would affect the HC levels of captive chimpanzees. We cut arm hair from chimpanzees and extracted and assayed cortisol with an enzyme immunoassay. Aggressive behaviors were recorded ad libitum by keepers using a daily behavior monitoring sheet developed for this study. The results of Study 1 indicate that HC levels increased during the first year after relocation to the new environment and then decreased during the second year. We observed individual differences in reactions to relocation and hypothesized that social factors may mediate these changes. In Study 2, we found that the standardized rate of receiving aggression, rearing history, sex, and group formation had a significant influence on mean HC levels. Relocation status was not a significant factor, but mean HC level was positively correlated with the rate of receiving aggression. Mean HC levels were higher in males than in females, and the association between aggressive interactions and HC levels differed by sex. These results suggest that, although relocation can affect long-term stress level, individuals' experiences of aggression and sex may be more important contributors to long-term stress than relocation alone."
https://openalex.org/W2477970017,"Biomass gasification technology has been rapidly developed recently. But fire and poisoning accidents caused by gas leakage restrict the development and promotion of biomass gasification. Therefore, probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) is necessary for biomass gasification system. Subsequently, Bayesian network-bow-tie (BN-bow-tie) analysis was proposed by mapping bow-tie analysis into Bayesian network (BN). Causes of gas leakage and the accidents triggered by gas leakage can be obtained by bow-tie analysis, and BN was used to confirm the critical nodes of accidents by introducing corresponding three importance measures. Meanwhile, certain occurrence probability of failure was needed in PSA. In view of the insufficient failure data of biomass gasification, the occurrence probability of failure which cannot be obtained from standard reliability data sources was confirmed by fuzzy methods based on expert judgment. An improved approach considered expert weighting to aggregate fuzzy numbers included triangular and trapezoidal numbers was proposed, and the occurrence probability of failure was obtained. Finally, safety measures were indicated based on the obtained critical nodes. The theoretical occurrence probabilities in one year of gas leakage and the accidents caused by it were reduced to 1/10.3 of the original values by these safety measures."

https://openalex.org/W2481149061,"The epsin N-terminal homology domain (ENTH) is a major player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the influence of initial membrane tension on ENTH binding and activity, we established a bilayer system based on adhered giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to be able to control and adjust the membrane tension σ covering a broad regime. The shape of each individual adhered GUV as well as its adhesion area was monitored by spinning disc confocal laser microscopy. Control of σ in a range of 0.08-1.02 mN/m was achieved by altering the Mg2+ concentration in solution, which changes the surface adhesion energy per unit area of the GUVs. Specific binding of ENTH to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate leads to a substantial increase in adhesion area of the sessile GUV. At low tension (<0.1 mN/m) binding of ENTH can induce tubular structures, whereas at higher membrane tension the ENTH interaction deflates the sessile GUV and thereby increases the adhesion area. The increase in adhesion area is mainly attributed to a decrease in the area compressibility modulus KA. We propose that the insertion of the ENTH helix-0 into the membrane is largely responsible for the observed decrease in KA, which is supported by the observation that the mutant ENTH L6E shows a reduced increase in adhesion area. These results demonstrate that even in the absence of tubule formation, the area compressibility modulus and, as such, the bending rigidity of the membrane is considerably reduced upon ENTH binding.

Driven by a chain of remodeling events and an elaborate set of proteins acting in an orchestrated manner, an almost flat patch of plasma membrane is transformed into a closed, cargo-containing vesicle. As plasma membrane shape transformation is associated with significant local bending of the membrane, the process is highly sensitive to lateral membrane tension. Plasma membrane tension originates from two primary sources; that is, hydrostatic pressure across the lipid bilayer and cytoskeleton-membrane adhesion (5Morris C.E. Homann U.

Upon binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 an additional α-helix, referred to as helix-0 (amino acids 3–15) at the N terminus of ENTH, is formed. This newly formed helix-0 inserts into the inner monolayer of the plasma membrane resulting in an asymmetry that produces membrane curvature (25Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J.

Seo J.-H. Kim Y.S. Membrane topology of helix 0 of the epsin N-terminal homology domain.Mol. Cells. 2006; 21: 428-435PubMed Google Scholar). By means of protruded pore-spanning membranes exhibiting a lateral tension of ∼2 mN/m, we recently showed that specific ENTH binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing membranes reduces membrane tension (27Gleisner M. Mey I. Barbot M. Dreker C. Meinecke M. Steinem C. Driving a planar model system into the 3(rd) dimension: generation and control of curved pore-spanning membrane arrays.Soft Matter. 2014; 10: 6228-6236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ENTH-induced tubulation was never observed. We thus asked the question, whether the initial lateral membrane tension influences the process that is initiated by ENTH- PtdIns(4,5)P2 interaction. To control lateral membrane tension in an artificial well defined membrane system, we made use of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that adhere to an avidin-coated glass substrate. By adjusting the Mg2+ concentration in solution, we were able to control and tune the lateral membrane tension of these GUVs in a range of 0.08–1.02 mN/m. These values are well below the tension value of 2 mN/m reported in the previous study (27Gleisner M. Mey I. Barbot M. Dreker C. Meinecke M. Steinem C. Driving a planar model system into the 3(rd) dimension: generation and control of curved pore-spanning membrane arrays.Soft Matter. 2014; 10: 6228-6236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and might allow monitoring ENTH-induced membrane changes including tubulation or vesiculation. We show that with this system in hand, binding and helix-0 insertion of ENTH can be monitored in a label-free fashion by determining the increase in adhesion area of the GUV. From our observations, we conclude that ENTH binding results in a substantial softening of the lipid bilayer, which can eventually result in tubule formation at low initial lateral tension. Fluorescently labeled GUVs composed of DOPC/DOPE/Atto488 DPPE 3The abbreviations used are: Atto488 DPPE, Atto488-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; ENTH, epsin N-terminal homology domain; GUV, giant unilamellar vesicle; cap-biotin-PE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl); PtdIns(4,5)P2, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-myo-inositol-4′,5′-bisphosphate); SDCLM, spinning disc confocal laser microscopy. were doped with N-(cap-biotinyl)-DOPE to attach them onto the avidin-coated glass surface (28Albersdörfer A.

J. 1997; 73: 245-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For specific binding of ENTH to GUVs, the natural receptor lipid PtdIns(4,5)P2 with a concentration of 0.8 mol% was supplemented. To obtain the shape of the vesicles, they were imaged by spinning disc confocal laser microscopy (SDCLM) (Fig. 1, bottom images). Attractive forces between the GUV and the avidin-coated surface change its shape from a sphere with a radius Rv to a spherical cap with a slightly increased radius of the cap denoted as Rad (Fig. 1, top images). The spherical cap geometry is indicative of the strong adhesion regime (29Lipowsky R. Seifert U. Adhesion of vesicles and membranes.Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 1991; 202: 17-25Crossref Google Scholar, 30Gruhn T. Franke T. Dimova R. Lipowsky R. Novel method for measuring the adhesion energy of vesicles.Langmuir. 2007; 23: 5423-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the limit of strong adhesion the bending energy associated with changes in the shape of the vesicle can be ignored, and the vesicle can be described as a spherical cap usually parameterized solely by the contact angle ϴ with the surface (30Gruhn T. Franke T. Dimova R. Lipowsky R. Novel method for measuring the adhesion energy of vesicles.Langmuir. 2007; 23: 5423-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Ramachandran A. Anderson T.H. Leal L.G. Israelachvili J.N. Adhesive interactions between vesicles in the strong adhesion limit.Langmuir. 2011; 27: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The adhered GUV forms a circular contact area with the functionalized glass substrate with a radius Ri (Fig. 1, top image) (32Rädler J. Sackmann E. Imaging optical thicknesses and separation distances of phospholipid vesicles at solid surfaces.J. Phys. II. 1993; 3: 727-748Google Scholar). This adhesion area increases until the free energy of the vesicle is minimized. The elastic energy encompasses stretching energy, bending energy, and the entropic cost of suppressing thermal fluctuations of the contact area between the GUV and the substrate (33Shindell O. Mica N. Ritzer M. Gordon V. Specific adhesion of membranes simultaneously supports dual heterogeneities in lipids and proteins.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015; 17: 15598-15607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion energy is obtained from the surface energy times the contact area. In the strong adhesion limit, we can safely assume that the free energy Fv comprises only an elastic stretching term and an adhesion term (Equation 1), FV=12KA(Aad−AV)2AV−Aiγad(Eq. 1) where KA is the area compressibility modulus of the bilayer, Aad is the area of the adhered vesicle, Av is the area of the free vesicle, Ai is the contact area, and γad is the adhesion energy per unit area mainly originating from bond formation between a GUV and the substrate. Minimization of the free energy assuming constant volume requires the shell to be laterally dilated to allow generation of a finite-sized adhesion zone (31Ramachandran A. Anderson T.H. Leal L.G. Israelachvili J.N. Adhesive interactions between vesicles in the strong adhesion limit.Langmuir. 2011; 27: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Naturally, stretching of the bilayer inevitably generates lateral tension. Therefore, controlling the adhesion area permits to adjust membrane tension. To modify the contact area of a GUV, we made use of the fact that divalent cations increase the membrane-surface interaction, i.e. it was found that a strong interaction between phosphatidylcholine and Mg2+ promotes spreading of vesicles to planar supported bilayers (34Seantier B.

Visualization of chemical and physical properties of calcium-induced domains in DPPC/DPPS Langmuir-Blodgett layers.Langmuir. 2001; 17: 2437-2445Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To adjust the Mg2+ concentration, GUVs formed in sucrose solution (298 mosmol/kg) were added to a sucrose-containing buffer solution (2 mm HEPES, sucrose, pH 7.4, 298 mosmol/kg) doped with different MgCl2 concentrations. Isoosmolar conditions are required as the size of the contact area is also a function of the GUV excess area, which depends on the osmolality gradient. GUVs were allowed to bind to the avidin-coated surface and were imaged by SDCLM. Fig. 2 illustrates the increase in contact area of GUVs doped with 0.8 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a function of Mg2+ concentration. To compare GUVs of different sizes, the radius Ri of the contact area was related to the radius Rad of the adhered GUV (Fig. 2). This allowed us to normalize the adhesion area to the size of the GUV and compare different ensembles. The increase of Ri/Rad with Mg2+ concentration (Fig. 3) suggests that Mg2+ promotes the adhesion of the GUVs by interaction of the lipid head groups of the membrane with the functionalized glass surface (34Seantier B.

Bivalent-ion-mediated vesicle adsorption and controlled supported phospholipid bilayer formation on molecular phosphate and sulfate layers on gold.Langmuir. 2002; 18: 7923-7929Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to this interaction, it is also conceivable that Mg2+ influences the biotin-avidin-interaction itself. Holmberg et al. (38Holmberg A. Blomstergren A. Nord O. Lukacs M. Lundeberg J. Uhlén M. The biotin-streptavidin interaction can be reversibly broken using water at elevated temperatures.Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) showed that the dissociation of a biotin-streptavidin bond strongly depends on the ionic strength and is almost fully prevented in the presence of Mg2+. In essence, both effects result in a larger contact area with increasing Mg2+ concentration.FIGURE 3.Ratios Ri/Rad as a function of Mg2+ concentration.

For each condition 31–101 GUVs (ntotal = 413, A) and 79–117 GUVs (ntotal = 467, B) were measured obtained from at least two independent preparations for each condition.

Assuming constant volume of the GUV during the course of the experiment due to the low water permeability of the membrane (39Bernard A-L Guedeau-Boudeville M-A Jullien L. Di Meglio J.M. Strong adhesion of giant vesicles on surfaces: dynamics and permeability.Langmuir. 2000; 16: 6809-6820Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and isoosmolar conditions, lateral tension can be computed from the area dilatation generated by adhesion. In equilibrium, larger adhesion forces generate larger area dilatation. To calculate the lateral membrane tension from the normalized area increase, one has to consider two contributions, one from ironing out membrane undulations and one from dilating a flat membrane laterally in a two-dimensional Hookean fashion (40Helfrich W. Elastic properties of lipid bilayers - theory and possible experiments.Z. Naturforsch. C. 1973; 28: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (4960) Google Scholar). Excess area stored in thermally excited membrane undulations is sacrificed first followed by lateral expansion of lipids. Equation 2 relates area dilatation to membrane tension σ of an adhered GUV (41Evans E. Rawicz W. Entropy-driven tension and bending elasticity in condensed-fluid membranes.Phys. Rev. Lett. 1990; 64: 2094-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), ΔAAv=σ−σ0KA+KBT8π κln(σσ0)(Eq. 2) The bending rigidity κ of a DOPC membrane is assumed to be 21 kBT, and the area compressibility modulus KA = 265 mN/m accordingly (42Rawicz W. Olbrich K.C. McIntosh T. Needham D. Evans E. Effect of chain length and unsaturation on elasticity of lipid bilayers.Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 328-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). As a reference state, we choose the free vesicle with tension σ0, which depends on the size of the vesicle and the osmotic pressure between inside and outside of the vesicle. Equation 2 holds, if σ0 ≪ σ, and allows the estimation of the lateral membrane tension σ of an adhered GUV numerically. Because it is impossible to determine σ0 for all vesicles used here independently, we determined σ0 for a few representative GUVs by parallel plate compression in conjunction with optical microscopy (43Schäfer E. Vache M. Kliesch T.-T. Janshoff A. Mechanical response of adherent giant liposomes to indentation with a conical AFM-tip.Soft Matter. 2015; 11: 4487-4495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found σ0 to be in the range of 10−6-10−4 N/m in accordance with typical values for weakly adhering GUVs on a glass substrate as obtained by reflectometric interference microscopy (44Rädler J.O. Feder T.J. Strey H.H. Sackmann E. Fluctuation analysis of tension-controlled undulation forces between giant vesicles and solid substrates.Phys. Rev. E. 1995; 51: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To calculate the tension σ, we need to determine the relative area dilatation after adhesion of the vesicle. A free GUV forms a sphere with an area Av. It changes its geometry upon adhesion and forms a spherical cap with an increased surface area Aad. Note that a spherical cap geometry corresponds to the limit of strong adhesion with respect to membrane undulations (29Lipowsky R. Seifert U. Adhesion of vesicles and membranes.Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 1991; 202: 17-25Crossref Google Scholar). The normalized change in surface area ΔA/Av can be calculated from the shape change (Equation 3), ΔAAV=Aad−AVAV=4πRad2+πRi2−2πRad(Rad−Rad2−Ri2)−4πRv24πRV2(Eq. 3) with the condition of constant volume, 4π3Rv3=4π3Rad3−π(Rad−Rad2−Ri2)6(3Ri2+(Rad−Rad2−Ri2)2)(Eq. 4) ΔA/Av is only a function of Ri/Rad, which is related to the contact angle between a sessile vesicle and the substrate by ϴ = sin−1(Ri/Rad). Fig. 3 shows the Ri/Rad values (ntotal = 467) of adhered PtdIns(4,5)P2 containing GUVs with an average radius of Rv = 18 ± 5 μm for different Mg2+ concentrations. The mean ratios of Ri/Rad increased from 0.46 at a Mg2+ concentration of 0.5 mm to 0.63 at 3.0 mm. For GUVs lacking PtdIns(4,5)P2 (ntotal = 413) with an average radius of Rv = 18 ± 5 μm, Ri/Rad increased from 0.19 at a Mg2+ concentration of 1 mm to 0.53 at 6.0 mm. Fig. 4 shows how area dilatation and lateral tension change as a function of Ri/Rad according to Equations 2, 3 and 4. Based on this theoretical framework, the lateral tension of GUVs composed of DOPC/DOPE/cap-biotin-PE/Atto488-DPPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (66.2:30:2:1:0.8) adhering to an avidin-coated glass surface using different Mg2+ concentrations can be calculated (Fig. 5). The mean tensions cover a range of 0.08–1.02 mN/m assuming σ0 = 10−5 N/m. The upper value is slightly larger than values found for cell membranes, which range between 0.003 and 0.45 mN/m (5Morris C.E. Homann U. Cell surface area regulation and membrane tension.J. Membr.

Biol. 2013; 23: 1409-1417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A small change in Ri/Rad can result in a rather large change in lateral membrane tension (Fig. 4). At low Ri/Rad, the excess area of the GUV stored in undulations compensates for the area dilation caused by adhesion on the surface (Ri/Rad = 0.46, σ = 0.08 mN/m), whereas for larger Ri/Rad undulations are ironed out, and the lateral membrane tension increases significantly due to the first term in Equation 2 (Ri/Rad = 0.63, σ = 1.02 mN/m). The results clearly demonstrate that the lateral membrane tension of adhered GUVs can be readily adjusted within a certain regime making use of different Mg2+ concentrations to control γad, the adhesion energy per unit area. This system thus enables us to study the influence of the specific binding of ENTH to PtdIns(4,5)P2 containing GUVs as a function of a given initial lateral membrane tension. ENTH can induce membrane tubulation (22Yoon Y. Tong J. Lee P.J. Albanese A. Bhardwaj N. Källberg M. Digman M.A. Lu H. Gratton E. Shin Y.K. Cho W.

Curvature of clathrin-coated pits driven by epsin.Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that binding of ENTH to PtdIns(4,5)P2-doped and slightly curved pore-spanning membranes results in a reduction of the lateral membrane tension (27Gleisner M. Mey I. Barbot M. Dreker C. Meinecke M. Steinem C. Driving a planar model system into the 3(rd) dimension: generation and control of curved pore-spanning membrane arrays.Soft Matter. 2014; 10: 6228-6236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the initial tension of the bilayer was rather high, and it is well conceivable that tubulation is suppressed at elevated tension. To answer the question of how ENTH binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 containing adhered GUVs alters their shape dependent on the preadjusted lateral membrane tension, we prepared GUVs composed of DOPC/DOPE/cap-biotin-PE/Atto488-DPPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2, (66.2:30:2:1:0.8) in the presence of 0.5 mm and 2 mm Mg2+. The resulting mean membrane tensions were 0.08 mN/m and 0.52 mN/m, respectively. To these adhered GUVs, ENTH was added at a final concentration of cENTH = 1 μm. Interestingly, dependent on the preadjusted lateral membrane tension, two different behaviors were observed after protein addition. At a low lateral membrane tension (σ = 0.08 mN/m), the addition of ENTH can indeed result in the formation of tubules, eventually leading to the disappearance of the GUV (Fig. 6). Because of the stirring of the solution, tubules appear preferentially on one side of the GUV and also elongated along this direction. Of note, even at this low lateral membrane tension, only part of the GUVs show tubulation, whereas others display an increase in adhesion area indicative of transient reduction in lateral membrane tension (see below). It has been shown that upon binding of ENTH to PtdIns(4,5)P2, the protein experiences a change in structure in which helix-0 inserts into the lipid bilayer as demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy (22Yoon Y. Tong J. Lee P.J. Albanese A. Bhardwaj N. Källberg M. Digman M.A. Lu H. Gratton E. Shin Y.K. Cho W.

Chem. 2010; 285: 531-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This increases the surface area of the outer leaflet of the GUV membrane and induces an asymmetry in the two bilayer leaflets facilitating membrane bending by generating spontaneous curvature (26Kweon D.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2490822337,"Background Oral cancer is a common malignancy that is shown to be causally associated with hereditary and acquired factors. ADAMTS14 is a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin motifs) metalloproteinase family that plays an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and degradation. Elevation or deficiency of certain ADAMTS proteinases has been known to be implicated in a wide range of pathological processes including atherosclerosis, arthritis, and cancer. The present study aimed to explore the impact of ADAMTS14 gene polymorphisms, combined with environmental risks on the susceptibility to oral tumorigenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADAMTS14 gene, including rs10823607, rs12774070, rs4747096, and rs61573157 were evaluated from 1200 normal controls and 850 patients with oral cancer. We failed to detect a significant association of four individual SNPs with oral cancer between case and control group. However, while considering behavioral exposure of environmental carcinogens, the presence of four ADAMTS14 SNPs, combined with betel nut chewing and/or smoking, profoundly leveraged the risk of oral cancer. Moreover, we observed a significant association of rs12774070, which is predicted to alter the expression and function of ADAMTS14 by in silico and bioinformatics analyses, with poor tumor cell differentiation (AOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38–0.92; p = 0.02) in patients who chewed betel nuts. Conclusions These results implicate the interaction between ADAMTS14 gene polymorphisms and environmental mutagens as a risk factor of oral tumorigenesis and suggest a correlation of rs12774070 with the degree of oral tumor cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2497204150,"Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who can lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite the important implications for Spaceflight travelers and bedridden patients, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a mechanosensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular and calvarial osteoblasts (TOs and COs) from Pthrp +/+ and -/- mice were subjected to actual Spaceflight for 6 days (Foton M3 satellite). Pthrp +/+, +/- and -/- osteoblasts were also exposed to simulated microgravity for periods varying from 6 days to 6 weeks. While COs displayed little change in viability in 0g, viability of all TOs rapidly decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Furthermore, Pthrp+/+ TOs displayed a sharp viability decline after 2 weeks at 0g. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days in simulated 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins, apoptosis/survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, insulin-like growth factor family members and Wnt-related signalling molecules. 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlapped those caused by Pthrp ablation in normal gravity, and pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 not only reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced effects in Pthrp+/+ TOs but maintained viability over 6-week exposure to microgravity. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs."

https://openalex.org/W2481873492,"The increasing occurrence of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in the environment is raising questions about its potential ecological and human health impacts. TBBPA is microbially transformed under anaerobic conditions to bisphenol A (BPA). However, little is known about which taxa degrade TBBPA and the adaptation of microbial communities exposed to TBBPA. The objectives of this study were to characterize the effect of TBBPA on microbial community structure during the start-up phase of a bench-scale anaerobic sludge reactor, and identify taxa that may be associated with TBBPA degradation. TBBPA degradation was monitored using LC/MS-MS, and the microbial community was characterized using Ion Torrent sequencing and qPCR. TBBPA was nearly completely transformed to BPA via reductive debromination in 55 days. Anaerobic reactor performance was not negatively affected by the presence of TBBPA and the bulk of the microbial community did not experience significant shifts. Several taxa showed a positive response to TBBPA, suggesting they may be associated with TBBPA degradation. Some of these taxa had been previously identified as dehalogenating bacteria including Dehalococcoides, Desulfovibrio, Propionibacterium, and Methylosinus species, but most had not previously been identified as having dehalogenating capacities. This study is the first to provide in-depth information on the microbial dynamics of anaerobic microbial communities exposed to TBBPA."
https://openalex.org/W2484045137,"With this study, we wanted to prove the hypothesis that the unique extracellular osmolality within the renal medulla modulates a specific gene expression pattern. The physiologic functions of the kidneys are mediated by the segment-specific expression of key proteins. So far, we have limited knowledge about the mechanisms that control this gene expression pattern. The hyperosmolality in the renal medullary interstitium is of major importance as a driving force for urine concentration. We made use of primarily cultured rat renal inner medullary collecting-duct cells and microarray analysis to identify genes affected by the environmental osmolality of the culture medium. We identified hundreds of genes that were either induced or repressed in expression by hyperosmolality in a time- and osmolality-dependent fashion. Further analysis demonstrated that many of them, physiologically, showed a kidney- and even collecting-duct-specific expression, including secreted proteins, kinases, and transcription factors. On the other hand, we identified factors, down-regulated in expression, that have a diuretic effect. In conclusion, the kidney is the only organ that has such a hyperosmotic environment, and study provides an excellent method for controlling tissue-specific gene expression.-Schulze Blasum, B., Schröter, R., Neugebauer, U., Hofschröer, V., Pavenstädt, H., Ciarimboli, G., Schlatter E., Edemir, B.

https://openalex.org/W2493201357,"Large areas of tropical rainforest are being converted to agricultural and plantation land uses, but little is known of biodiversity and ecological functioning under these replacement land uses. We investigated the effects of conversion of rainforest into jungle rubber, intensive rubber and oil palm plantations on testate amoebae, diverse and functionally important protists in litter and soil. Living testate amoebae species richness, density and biomass were all lower in replacement land uses than in rainforest, with the impact being more pronounced in litter than in soil. Similar abundances of species of high and low trophic level in rainforest suggest that trophic interactions are more balanced, with a high number of functionally redundant species, than in rubber and oil palm. In contrast, plantations had a low density of high trophic level species indicating losses of functions. This was particularly so in oil palm plantations. In addition, the relative density of species with siliceous shells was >50% lower in the litter layer of oil palm and rubber compared to rainforest and jungle rubber. This difference suggests that rainforest conversion changes biogenic silicon pools and increases silicon losses. Overall, the lower species richness, density and biomass in plantations than in rainforest, and the changes in the functional composition of the testate amoebae community, indicate detrimental effects of rainforest conversion on the structure and functioning of microbial food webs."
https://openalex.org/W2497247052,"Fungus-farming (""attine"") ants are model systems for studies of symbiosis, coevolution, and advanced eusociality. A New World clade of nearly 300 species in 15 genera, all attine ants cultivate fungal symbionts for food. In order to better understand the evolution of ant agriculture, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed transcriptomes of four different attine ant species in two genera: three species in the higher-attine genus Sericomyrmex and a single lower-attine ant species, Apterostigma megacephala, representing the first genomic data for either genus. These data were combined with published genomes of nine other ant species and the honey bee Apis mellifera for phylogenomic and divergence-dating analyses. The resulting phylogeny confirms relationships inferred in previous studies of fungus-farming ants. Divergence-dating analyses recovered slightly older dates than most prior analyses, estimating that attine ants originated 53.6–66.7 million of years ago, and recovered a very long branch subtending a very recent, rapid radiation of the genus Sericomyrmex. This result is further confirmed by a separate analysis of the three Sericomyrmex species, which reveals that 92.71% of orthologs have 99% - 100% pairwise-identical nucleotide sequences. We searched the transcriptomes for genes of interest, most importantly argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase, which are functional in other ants but which are known to have been lost in seven previously studied attine ant species. Loss of the ability to produce the amino acid arginine has been hypothesized to contribute to the obligate dependence of attine ants upon their cultivated fungi, but the point in fungus-farming ant evolution at which these losses occurred has remained unknown. We did not find these genes in any of the sequenced transcriptomes. Although expected for Sericomyrmex species, the absence of arginine anabolic genes in the lower-attine ant Apterostigma megacephala strongly suggests that the loss coincided with the origin of attine ants."
https://openalex.org/W1947621081,"The objective of this study is to describe the genetic population structure and demographic history of the endangered marine fish, Epinephelus marginatus, within Malta's Fisheries Management Zone for the purpose of localised conservation planning. Epinephelus marginatus is a long-lived, sedentary, reef-associated protogynous hermaphrodite with high commercial and recreational value that is at risk of extinction throughout its global distribution. Based on global trends, population substructuring and gaps in local knowledge this has led to an increased interest in evaluation of local stock. Assessment of Maltese demography was based on historical and contemporary catch landings data whilst genetic population structure and regional connectivity patterns were evaluated by examining 175 individuals collected within the central Mediterranean region between 2002 and 2009 using 14 nuclear microsatellite loci. Demographic stock assessment of Maltese E. marginatus' revealed a 99% decline in catch landings between 1947 and 2009 within the Fisheries Management Zone. A contemporary modest mean size was observed, 3 ± 3 kg, where approximately 17% of the population was juvenile, 68% female/sex-changing and 15% were male with a male-to-female sex ratio of 1:5. Genetic analysis describes the overall population of E. marginatus' within the Fisheries Management Zone as decreasing in size (ƟH = 2.2), which has gone through a significant size reduction in the past (M = 0.41) and consequently shows signs of moderate inbreeding (FIS = 0.10, p < 0.001) with an estimated effective population size of 130 individuals. Results of spatially explicit Bayesian genetic cluster analysis detected two geographically distinct subpopulations within Malta's Fisheries Management Zone and that they are connected to a larger network of E. marginatus' within the Sicily Channel. Results suggest conservation management should be designed to reflect E. marginatus' within Malta's Fisheries Management Zone as two management units."
https://openalex.org/W2481786269,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a ubiquitously expressed Mg(2+)-permeable ion channel fused to a C-terminal α-kinase domain. Recently, aldosterone was shown to increase intracellular Mg(2+) levels and alter inflammatory signaling in TRPM7-expressing HEK293 cells. This study was undertaken to assess whether these effects were related to an aldosterone-mediated increase of TRPM7 current and/or plasma membrane localization. Using HEK293 cells stably expressing WT-TRPM7, we found that 18-h application of aldosterone significantly increased TRPM7 current and TRPM7 plasma membrane protein expression by 48% and 34%, respectively. The aldosterone-mediated increase of TRPM7 current was inhibited by eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker, and GSK-650394, an inhibitor of the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 blockade also prevented the aldosterone-induced increase of TRPM7 plasma membrane protein. It was further determined that K1648R-TRPM7, the phosphotransferase-inactive TRPM7 mutant, was unresponsive to aldosterone. Therefore, chronic aldosterone treatment increases the plasma membrane expression of TRPM7, which is associated with an increase of TRPM7 current. This process occurs via an MR-dependent, genomic signaling cascade involving SGK1 and a functioning TRPM7 α-kinase domain. We suggest that this mechanism may be of general relevance when interpreting the effects of aldosterone because the MR receptor is found in multiple tissues, and TRPM7 and SGK1 are ubiquitously expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2499329030,"Protein synthesis inhibition is an immediate response during stress to switch the composition of protein pool in order to adapt to the new environment. It was reported that this response could be either protective or deleterious. However, how cells choose to live or die upon protein synthesis inhibition is largely unknown. Previously, we have shown that elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K), a protein kinase that suppresses protein synthesis during elongation phase, is a positive regulator of apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Consistently, here we report that knock-out of eEF2K protects mice from a lethal dose of whole-body ionizing radiation at 8 Gy by reducing apoptosis levels in both bone marrow and gastrointestinal tracts. Surprisingly, similar to the loss of p53, eEF2K deficiency results in more severe damage to the gastrointestinal tract at 20 Gy with the increased mitotic cell death in small intestinal stem cells. Furthermore, using epithelial cell lines, we showed that eEF2K is required for G2/M arrest induced by radiation to prevent mitotic catastrophe in a p53-independent manner. Specifically, we observed the elevation of Akt/ERK activity as well as the reduction of p21 expression in Eef2k−/− cells. Therefore, eEF2K also provides a protective strategy to maintain genomic integrity by arresting cell cycle in response to stress. Our results suggest that protective versus pro-apoptotic roles of eEF2K depend on the type of cells: eEF2K is protective in highly proliferative cells, such as small intestinal stem cells and cancer cells, which are more susceptible to mitotic catastrophe.

In addition to its role in apoptosis induction, recent studies also suggested that eEF2K could be involved in cell cycle regulation. During checkpoint silencing, the degradation of eEF2K by the SCF(βTrCP) ubiquitin-proteasome system was connected with protein synthesis resumption (9Kruiswijk F. Yuniati L. Magliozzi R. Low T.Y. Lim R. Bolder R. Mohammed S. Proud C.G. Heck A.J.R. Pagano M. Guardavaccaro D. Coupled activation and degradation of eEF2K regulates protein synthesis in response to genotoxic stress.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, in an APC-deficient colorectal cancer mouse model, the inhibition of eEF2K by mTORC1 hyperactivation was critical for tumor growth. Depletion of eEF2K also resulted in an alteration of some cyclin proteins (10Faller W.J. Jackson T.J. Knight J.R. Ridgway R.A. Jamieson T. Karim S.A. Jones C. Radulescu S. Huels D.J. Myant K.B.

However, under the normal condition, depletion of eEF2K in mice did not affect cell cycle progression and the growth rate (7Chu H.P. Liao Y. Novak J.S. Hu Z. Merkin J.J. Shymkiv Y. Braeckman B.P.

Cell. 2014; 28: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we employed a classic ionizing radiation model to study the functions of eEF2K under DNA damage stress. Consistent with the role of eEF2K in programmed cell death, knock-out of eEF2K protected mice from 8 Gy of IR by reducing hematopoietic stem cell death. Unexpectedly, we found that when gastrointestinal syndrome was triggered with a higher dose of ionizing radiation, Eef2k−/− mice became more sensitive due to massive intestinal stem cell loss. We found that eEF2K-deficient cells escaped from G2/M arrest and resulted in more severe DNA damage and mitotic catastrophe post-IR. Collectively, our data demonstrated that eEF2K regulates both apoptosis and cell cycle in response to IR to govern stem cell survival. To study the role of eEF2K in radiation-induced damage, eEF2K wild type and knock-out mice were exposed to various doses of ionizing radiation: 8, 15, and 20 Gy. At 8 Gy, 50% of wild type mice died, but only 10% of Eef2k−/− mice died within 30 days (Fig. 1A, p = 0.041). When the dose was further increased to 15 Gy, both eEF2K wild type and deficient mice died within 2 weeks, but no significant difference was observed at this dose (Fig. 1B, p = 0.140). Surprisingly, when the dose was even further increased to 20 Gy, Eef2k−/− mice became more sensitive (Fig. 1C, p = 0.003) compared with their wild type littermates. All of the Eef2k−/− mice died in 6 days, whereas wild type mice survived up to 8 days. To further verify the cause of lethality at different doses, autopsy analysis was conducted immediately after death of mice. At 15 Gy, H&E staining showed a massive cell loss in bone marrow, whereas crypts with abnormal structures were still present in the small intestines. However, a complete destruction of small intestine microstructures was observed when mice were dead after exposure to 20 Gy of IR, with most of the bone marrow cells surviving at this time (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that eEF2K regulates cell death in bone marrow cells and leads to bone marrow failure upon IR. However, when gastrointestinal complications became the main cause of lethality induced by escalated dose of IR (20 Gy), eEF2K extended the life span. The different sensitivities of Eef2k−/− mice toward various doses of ionizing radiation may indicate that eEF2K functions differently according to tissue and cell types. To answer this question, phosphorylated eEF2 (p-eEF2) was measured by Western blotting in ovary, small intestine, and muscle at 4 and 24 h after 8- and 20-Gy γ-irradiation. In highly proliferative tissues, such as ovary and small intestine, eEF2K activity was quickly suppressed within 24 h independent of the doses. However, in non-proliferative tissues (e.g. muscle), the change of p-eEF2 level was not as robust as in other tissues after radiation treatment (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that the dynamics of eEF2K activity in DNA damage response is distinct in different cell types and could be related to cell proliferating status. To further investigate the role of eEF2K in IR-induced bone marrow failure, both wild type and Eef2k−/− mice were exposed to 8 Gy ionizing radiation. Femurs and tibias were collected at 4 and 24 h post-IR for immunohistochemistry analysis. To monitor the activity of eEF2K, immunostaining of p-eEF2 was conducted. Under normal conditions, p-eEF2 staining was barely observed in bone marrow cells. After IR exposure, the intensity of p-eEF2 staining was dramatically increased in various types of bone marrow cells. Specifically, the most intense staining was detected in the cells with condensed chromosomes, a characteristic of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2A). Because apoptosis plays an important role in bone marrow cell loss at post-IR, cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate apoptosis levels in bone marrow cells. Consistent with the role of eEF2K in apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3- and TUNEL-positive cells were reduced in Eef2k−/− mice (Fig. 2A). In addition, the quantification for the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive and TUNEL-positive cells also showed a significant decrease in Eef2k−/− mice (Fig. 2 (B and C), p = 0.001, p < 0.0001). To assess the function of eEF2K in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell survival after exposure to IR, a colony formation assay was performed using freshly isolated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− mice. Briefly, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were exposed to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Gy of IR, and the survival of bone marrow colony-forming cells was measured by counting the number of colonies in soft agar plates after culture for 10 days. The value of D0, which represents the amounts of radiation to reduce the number of colonies by 63% (11Lee J.M. Bernstein A. P53 mutations increase resistance to ionizing radiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), was calculated by linear regression analysis. At basal level without radiation treatment, the total number of bone marrow cells extracted from Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− femur and tibia was similar, and the cells displayed similar abilities to generate colonies (Fig. 2, D–F) with comparable percentages of colonies exhibiting myeloid and erythroid lineages (data now shown). After radiation, the calculated D0 for Eef2k−/− bone marrow colony-forming cells was significantly higher than the D0 of wild type cells (Fig. 2G, p = 0.02), indicating that depletion of eEF2K results in increased resistance to IR in hematopoietic cells. The radioresistant phenotype was described previously in PUMA knock-out mice (12Jeffers J.R. Parganas E. Lee Y. Yang C. Wang J. Brennan J. MacLean K.H. Han J. Chittenden T. Ihle J.N. McKinnon P.J. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Puma is an essential mediator of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the expression level of PUMA, a critical player in radiation-induced apoptosis, was reduced in the bone marrow cells of Eef2k−/− mice (Fig. 2H), suggesting that PUMA could be a downstream factor of eEF2K to mediate apoptotic cell death in response to IR. To further investigate the regulatory role of eEF2K in PUMA expression, PUMA mRNA and protein levels were compared between Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Consistently, we found that knock-out of eEF2K reduces PUMA expression at both RNA and protein levels. Moreover, re-expression of eEF2K in Eef2k−/− MEFs restored the levels of PUMA expression in both RNA and protein, suggesting that eEF2K could specifically regulate PUMA expression (Fig. 2 (I and J), p = 0.011, p = 0.0043). eEF2K knock-out mice displayed an increased sensitivity to elevated dose of IR, indicating that eEF2K may function in intestinal stem cell death. In addition to bone marrow stem cells, intestinal stem cells represent another pool of adult stem cells sensitive to IR. Previous studies showed that IR as low as 1 Gy can cause massive apoptosis in small intestine crypt epithelium (13Potten C.S. Grant H.K. The relationship between ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and stem cells in the small and large intestine.Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, small intestine tissues were collected from wild type and Eef2k−/− mice for a TUNEL assay at 4 and 24 h after exposure to 8 Gy of IR. The intestinal crypt has a very well organized structure, and the cell position at the very bottom is called the +1 position (Fig. 3B). In a stem cell niche, there are mainly two types of stem cells residing in the crypts; Lgr5-positive cells are actively proliferating cells between Paneth cells, and the others are label retention cells at the +4 position (14Potten C.S. Gandara R. Mahida Y.R. Loeffler M. Wright N.A. The stem cells of small intestinal crypts: where are they?.Cell Prolif. 2009; 42: 731-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Once the stem cells lose the contact with the stem cell niche (above +4 position), they quickly migrate upward and differentiate into various lineages of epithelial cells to maintain the high turnover rate within the crypt-villus units (15Clevers H. The intestinal crypt, a prototype stem cell compartment.Cell. 2013; 154: 274-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). To quantify the apoptosis level in stem cells, the percentage of TUNEL staining-positive cells was counted and calculated from +1 to +14 position. At 4 h, when maximum apoptosis occurs, the apoptosis level in the small intestine of Eef2k−/− mice was reduced at the stem cell zone (+1 to +4 position) (Fig. 3, A and C). However, when the apoptosis level began to decrease in the small intestine of wild type mice at 24 h, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was increased in Eef2k−/− mouse small intestine crypts (Fig. 3, A and D). The examination of TUNEL-positive cells showed giant cell appearance with abnormally distributed condensed chromosomes in the small intestine of Eef2k−/− mice at 24 h post-IR (16Merritt A.J. Allen T.D. Potten C.S. Hickman J.A. Apoptosis in small intestinal epithelial from p53-null mice: evidence for a delayed, p53-independent G2/M-associated cell death after γ-irradiation.Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that eEF2K functions to suppress mitotic cell death after ionizing radiation. Moreover, when mice were exposed to 18 Gy radiation, the cell death level became comparable between Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− small intestines at both 4 and 24 h post-IR (Fig. 3E). To analyze the effects of eEF2K on intestinal stem cell survival after ionizing radiation, a microcolony formation assay was conducted. It is generally thought that a single stem cell could regenerate a whole crypt within 4 days if it survives after IR insults. Therefore, mice were sacrificed at day 4 post-IR, and small intestine tissues were collected from at least three mice for cross-section, followed by H&E staining. The number of regenerated crypts was counted in each section as evidence of surviving intestinal stem cells. The number of regenerated crypts was comparable between Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− mice at 8 and 10 Gy; whereas, the regenerated crypt number was significantly reduced in Eef2k−/− mice at doses of 12 and 14 Gy (Fig. 4 (A and B), p < 0.001). In addition, the loss of regeneration capacity could be represented by reduction of the proliferative index. To analyze the proliferative index in intestinal stem cells, BrdU was injected into mice 2 h before sacrifice at day 4 post-IR. Consistently, the number of BrdU-positive crypts was significantly decreased in Eef2k−/− mice compared with their wild type cohorts (Fig. 4 (C and D), p < 0.001). To exclude the possibility that eEF2K may directly affect cell proliferation under normal conditions, Ki67 staining was used to label proliferative cells in intestinal crypts, and the expression level of Ki67 was similar between wild type and Eef2k−/− mice (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that eEF2K protects intestinal stem cells from an extremely high dose of radiation. Previous studies have shown that mitotic cell death or clonogenic death occurs during the second wave of cell death in the small intestine in response to IR (16Merritt A.J. Allen T.D. Potten C.S. Hickman J.A.

Because we found that the second wave of cell death in the small intestine was increased in Eef2k−/− mice, we wanted to test whether eEF2K regulates the mitotic cell death. We further investigated the cell cycle progression of crypt epithelial cells in Eef2k−/− mice post-IR. As a marker of cell proliferation, Ki67 antigen is present in all cells residing in G1, S, G2, and mitosis phases (18Scholzen T. Gerdes J. The Ki-67 protein: from the known and the unknown.J. Cell.

To visualize actively cycling cells, Ki67 was used for immunohistochemistry staining in the small intestine at 24 h after exposure to 8 Gy of IR. By counting 50 crypts, the number of Ki67-positive cells was higher in Eef2k−/− mice crypts at the stem cell zone compared with wild type mouse crypts (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, the mitotic cell death was compared between Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− small intestine after IR. Although no difference was observed in the number of mitotic cells before IR (Fig. 5C), the mitotic cell death was significantly higher in the intestinal crypt of Eef2k−/− mice (Fig. 5, D and E). The epithelial cells eliminated by mitotic cell death displayed abnormal mitotic morphology, which could be easily distinguished by simple nuclear staining by hematoxylin (Fig. 5D). The quantification results also indicated significantly greater mitotic cell death in Eef2k−/− mouse small intestine at 24 and 72 h after 8-Gy γ-irradiation (Fig. 5E, p = 0.049, p = 0.028), most of which displayed abnormal mitotic condensed chromosomes and chromosome fragments. Thus, overall, these results suggest that the higher stem cell loss rate in Eef2k−/− small intestinal crypts after IR is at least partially due to the improper cell cycle progression, especially mitosis. The same phenotype in response to ionizing radiation was also observed in p53−/− mice, which is due to the dual role of p53 in DNA damage response, including apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (17Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Wang K. Christov K. Golovkina T.V. Goldblum J.R. Gudkov A.V.

Jacks T. p53 controls radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome in mice independent of apoptosis.Science. 2010; 327: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We then asked whether eEF2K regulates cell cycle progression upon DNA damage. Further investigations of the functions of eEF2K in DNA damage response were conducted in epithelial cell lines after radiation treatment. The cell lines were derived from baby mouse kidney (BMK) of Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− mice and immortalized with dominant negative p53 to avoid the impact of p53 (20Degenhardt K. Sundararajan R. Lindsten T. Thompson C. White E. Bax and Bak independently promote cytochrome C release from mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14127-14134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− BMK cells were exposed to various doses of IR, more cells were surviving at 5 Gy in Eef2k−/− cells at both 48 and 72 h post-IR, whereas the levels of cell death were higher in Eef2k−/− cells at 10 and 20 Gy at 48 h (Fig. 6A, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). We further tested three pairs of Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− cells derived from different mice. Consistently, a significant increase in cell survival was observed in all Eef2k−/− cell lines after 5 Gy of IR (Fig. 6B, p = 0.006). Moreover, the impact of eEF2K in cell cycle arrest was studied by propidium iodide staining after exposure to IR. Before IR, the cell cycle distribution was similar between Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− cells. At 12 h post-IR, when >80% wild type cells were arrested at G2 phase, far fewer Eef2k−/− cells were arrested. At this time point, <5% of G1 cells were observed in Eef2k+/+ cells, but >20% of G1 cells were observed in Eef2k−/− cells. Furthermore, at 24 h post-IR, when most of the wild type cells continually resided in G2 phase, Eef2k−/− cells already displayed a nearly normal cell cycle distribution. Moreover, a similar change pattern was observed after exposure to 10-, 15-, and 20-Gy ionizing radiation (Fig. 6C). To further test whether cells were arrested in G2 phase after DNA damage, BrdU labeling was used to study cell cycle progression. When most of the BrdU-positive Eef2k+/+ cells were arrested at G2 phase at 12 h post-IR, some Eef2k−/− cells escaped from G2/M checkpoint and progressed into G1 phase (Fig. 6D), indicating that depletion of eEF2K renders cells incapable of arresting at G2/M checkpoint. To explore the underlying mechanism mediating the functions of eEF2K in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, various molecular signaling markers were analyzed by Western blotting. The Akt and ERK pathways play critical roles in promoting cell cycle progression (21Chambard J.C. Lefloch R. Pouysségur J. Lenormand P. ERK implication in cell cycle regulation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 22Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Multiple roles of the PI3K/PKB (Akt) pathway in cell cycle progression.Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed an increase of activities of both pathways in Eef2k−/− cells. Additionally, p21, a potent cell cycle kinase inhibitor, was decreased after the loss of eEF2K, which may also contribute to the insufficient cell cycle arrest in eEF2K-deficient cells. Moreover, consistent with the results obtained from bone marrow cells and MEFs, there was a reduction of PUMA expression level in Eef2k−/− BMK cells (Fig. 6E). Evidence has shown that deficiency in cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage leads to large pieces of DNA fragments escaping from the nucleus to form micronuclei and causes cell death due to mitotic catastrophe (23Roninson I.B. Broude E.V. Chang B.D. If not apoptosis, then what? Treatment-induced senescence and mitotic catastrophe in tumor cells.Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We further quantified the number of micronuclei in Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− BMK cells after 5 Gy of IR. Consistent with the observations in mice, more cells underwent abnormal mitosis after ionizing radiation (Fig. 7 (A and B), p = 0.030), and more cells exhibited micronuclei in Eef2k−/− cells (Fig. 7 (A and C), p = 0.002), indicating that eEF2K protects cells from mitotic catastrophe induced by IR. γH2AX is a sensitive marker to detect DNA damage. Consistently, more γH2AX was accumulated in Eef2k−/− cells after 5-Gy ionizing radiation (Fig. 7D), indicating a higher level of DNA damage due to insufficient cell cycle arrest with the loss of eEF2K. To study whether the regulation of eEF2K in DNA damage response is dose-dependent, Eef2k+/+ and Eef2k−/− BMK cells were treated with 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-Gy γ-irradiation, and the percentage of cells with micronuclei was quantified at 24 and 48 h post-treatment. Eef2k−/− cells displayed a higher level of micronuclei after various doses of ionizing radiation (Fig. 7E, p < 0.001 for all doses and time points). Here we report that eEF2K plays important roles in IR-induced injuries of bone marrow and small intestine. Knock-out of eEF2K protects mice from hematopoietic syndrome but sensitizes them to gastrointestinal syndrome, which is due to the dual functions of eEF2K in response to DNA damage induced by IR. Our results demonstrate that eEF2K promotes apoptosis; however, it protects cells from mitotic cell death by regulating cell cycle arrest (Fig. 8). In response to DNA damage, a multilayer surveillance system was evolved to maintain genomic stability, in which programmed cell death collaborates closely with cell cycle progression to determine cell fate. Whereas interphase cells may die from apoptosis or step into senescence, mitotic cells usually die during mitosis or after mitosis due to mitotic catastrophe. Mitotic catastrophe has been described as the major form of cell death after ionizing radiation because of premature and inappropriate entry of cells into mitosis (24Portugal J. Mansilla S. Bataller M. Mechanisms of drug-induced mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2010; 16: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Jonathan E.C. Bernhard E.J. McKenna W.G.

https://openalex.org/W2483795012,"To improve fishery management, there is an increasing need to understand the long-term consequences of natural and anthropogenic climate variability for ecological systems. New England’s iconic cod populations have been in decline for several decades and have recently reached unprecedented lows. We find that 17% of the overall decline in Gulf of Maine cod biomass since 1980 can be attributed to positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This is a consequence of three results: i) a 1-unit increase in the NAO winter index is associated with a 17% decrease in the spring biomass of age-1 cod the following year; ii) this NAO-driven decrease persists as the affected cohort matures; iii) fishing practices appear to exacerbate NAO’s direct biological effect such that, since 1913, a 1-unit increase in the NAO index lowers subsequent cod catch for up to 19 years. The Georges Bank cod stock displays similar patterns. Because we statistically detect a delay between the NAO and subsequent declines in adult biomass, our findings imply that observed current NAO conditions can be used in stock forecasts, providing lead time for adaptive policy. More broadly, our approach can inform forecasting efforts for other fish populations strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic climatic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2490233722,Water flow affects settlement of marine larvae on several scales. At the smallest scale local flow regime may control the probability of adhesion to the substrate. Our aim was to mechanistically understand the transition from suspended to attached larvae in turbulent flow. Recently it was proposed that opportunities for larval settlement in turbulent boundary layers depend on time windows with suitable instantaneous flow properties. In flume flow we characterized the proportion of suitable time windows in a series of flow velocities with focus on the near-bed flow. The change in the proportion of potential settling windows with increasing free-stream velocities was compared to the proportion of temporary attachment of barnacle cypris larvae at different flow velocities. We found large instantaneous flow variations in the near-bed flow where cyprid attachment took place. The probability of temporary attachment in cyprids declined with local flow speed and this response was compatible with a settling window lasting at least 0.1 s with a maximum local flow speed of 1.9–2.4 cm s-1. Cyprids swam against the near-bed flow (negative rheotaxis) and the swimming speed (1.8 cm s-1) was close to the critical speed that permitted temporary attachment. We conclude that temporary attachment in barnacle cyprids requires upstream swimming to maintain a fixed position relative to the substrate for at least 0.1 s. This behaviour may explain the ability of barnacles to recruit to high-flow environments and give cyprids flexibility in the pre-settlement choice of substrates based on flow regime.

These shared characteristics have caused difficulties with revealing the relationships among genera and species in the group, and some conflicting taxonomic views remain unresolved. The present study aims to infer a more comprehensive phylogeny of the tribe using molecular data, to test the monophyly of the tribe as well as the genera it includes in order to clarify their taxonomic status, and finally to revise the current classification of the group. In order to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree, the mitochondrial COI-COII and 16S genes as well as the nuclear EF-1α and 28S genes were analyzed using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. The analysis included 67 specimens of 41 species, and we confirmed the monophyly of Baorini, and revealed that 14 genera are well supported. The genus Borbo is separated into three clades: Borbo, Pseudoborbo, and Larsenia gen. nov. We confirmed that Polytremis is polyphyletic and separated into three genera: Polytremis, Zinaida, and Zenonoida gen. nov., and also confirmed that the genus Prusiana is a member of the tribe. Relationships among some genera were strongly supported. For example, Zenonia and Zenonoida were found to be sister taxa, closely related to Zinaida and Iton, while Pelopidas and Baoris were also found to cluster together."
https://openalex.org/W2503399269,"Intimin is an essential adhesin of attaching and effacing organisms such as entropathogenic Escherichia coli. It is also the prototype of type Ve secretion or inverse autotransport, where the extracellular C-terminal region or passenger is exported with the help of an N-terminal transmembrane β-barrel domain. We recently reported a stalled secretion intermediate of intimin, where the passenger is located in the periplasm but the β-barrel is already inserted into the membrane. Stalling of this mutant is due to the insertion of an epitope tag at the very N terminus of the passenger. Here, we examined how this insertion disrupts autotransport and found that it causes misfolding of the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain D00. We could also stall the secretion by making an internal deletion in D00, and introducing the epitope tag into the second Ig-like domain, D0, also resulted in reduced passenger secretion. In contrast to many classical autotransporters, where a proximal folding core in the passenger is required for secretion, the D00 domain is dispensable, as the passenger of an intimin mutant lacking D00 entirely is efficiently exported. Furthermore, the D00 domain is slightly less stable than the D0 and D1 domains, unfolding at ∼200 piconewtons (pN) compared with ∼250 pN for D0 and D1 domains as measured by atomic force microscopy. Our results support a model where the secretion of the passenger is driven by sequential folding of the extracellular Ig-like domains, leading to vectorial transport of the passenger domain across the outer membrane in an N to C direction.

Intimin is a well known virulence factor of attaching and effacing pathogens, such as enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), 3The abbreviations used are: EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; AFM, atomic force microscopy; BAM, β-barrel assembly machinery; HA, hemagglutinin; Ig, immunoglobulin; LB, lysogeny broth; TAM, translocation and assembly machinery; pN, piconewtons. 3The abbreviations used are: EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; AFM, atomic force microscopy; BAM, β-barrel assembly machinery; HA, hemagglutinin; Ig, immunoglobulin; LB, lysogeny broth; TAM, translocation and assembly machinery; pN, piconewtons.

Intimin is an adhesin that mediates tight attachment to epithelial cells, which ultimately leads to the effacement of microvilli and formation of actin pedestals on the host cell. Remarkably, the main receptor for intimin is not a host cell receptor but a bacterial protein called Tir for translocated intimin receptor. This protein is secreted by the pathogens directly into the host cells via a type III secretion system (2Kenny B. DeVinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) transfers its receptor for intimate adherence into mammalian cells.Cell. 1997; 91: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Intimin consists of three functional components: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a small periplasmically located domain. The adhesive, extracellular region (referred to as the passenger) of intimin is an extended, rod-like structure (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of the intimin C terminus shows three domains: two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1–2) capped by a C-type lectin-like domain (D3) (3Luo Y. Frey E.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Creagh A.L. Knoechel D.G. Haynes C.A. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Crystal structure of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli intimin-receptor complex.Nature. 2000; 405: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain D2 and the lectin-like domain D3 together form the Tir binding region (4Kelly G. Prasannan S. Daniell S. Fleming K. Frankel G. Dougan G. Connerton I. Matthews S. Structure of the cell-adhesion fragment of intimin from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, a third Ig-like domain (D0) was predicted at the N terminus of the passenger. Later, an additional domain at the very N terminus of the extracellular domain has been identified, referred to as the D00 domain, although its fold was not conclusively predicted (5Fairman J.W.

Intimin is anchored in the outer membrane by a 12-stranded β-barrel domain (5Fairman J.W. Dautin N. Wojtowicz D. Liu W. Noinaj N. Barnard T.J. Udho E. Przytycka T.M. Cherezov V. Buchanan S.K.

In addition, intimin contains a short N-terminal periplasmic region containing a lysin motif, which mediates dimerization and binding to peptidoglycan at low pH (6Leo J.C. Oberhettinger P. Chaubey M. Schütz M. Kühner D. Bertsche U. Schwarz H. Götz F. Autenrieth I.B. Coles M. Linke D. The intimin periplasmic domain mediates dimerisation and binding to peptidoglycan.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 80-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a surface-exposed protein, the intimin passenger is secreted across the outer membrane to the cell surface. This is accomplished by an autotransport process, termed type Ve secretion (7Leo J.C. Grin I. Linke D. Type V secretion: mechanism(s) of autotransport through the bacterial outer membrane.Philos.

The inverse autotransporter family: intimin, invasin, and related proteins.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2015; 305: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the current model for type Ve secretion, the β-barrel domain acts as a secretion pore through which the passenger domain is transported via a hairpin intermediate, such that the N terminus of the passenger is the first to reach the extracellular space (5Fairman J.W. Dautin N. Wojtowicz D. Liu W. Noinaj N. Barnard T.J. Udho E. Przytycka T.M. Cherezov V. Buchanan S.K.

Secretion of the entire passenger then proceeds N to C, with the C terminus the last to reach the surface. This model is supported by the crystal structure of the intimin β-barrel domain, where the linker region connecting the passenger and the β-barrel domain is located within the pore of the β-barrel (5Fairman J.W. Dautin N. Wojtowicz D. Liu W. Noinaj N. Barnard T.J. Udho E. Przytycka T.M. Cherezov V. Buchanan S.K.

However, outer membrane insertion of intimin is dependent on the β-barrel assembly machinery or BAM complex (10Bodelón G. Marín E. Fernández L.A. Role of periplasmic chaperones and BamA (YaeT/Omp85) in folding and secretion of intimin from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains.J.

Chem. 2015; 290: 1837-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, the periplasmic chaperone SurA is required for inverse autotransporter biogenesis (8Oberhettinger P. Schütz M. Leo J.C. Heinz N. Berger J. Autenrieth I.B. Linke D. intimin and invasin export their C-terminus to the bacterial cell surface using an inverse mechanism compared to classical autotransport.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47069Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Bodelón G.

The inverse autotransporter intimin exports its passenger domain via a hairpin intermediate.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 1837-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the term “autotransporter” is somewhat misleading but may still be valid for the export of the passenger. This study was prompted by our recent observation that introduction of a double hemagglutinin (HA) tag (sequence GSGYPYDVPDYAGSGYPYDVPDYAGSG) at the N terminus of the passenger domain prevents secretion of the passenger and traps intimin in what is most probably the hairpin intermediate (11Oberhettinger P. Leo J.C. Linke D. Autenrieth I.B. Schütz M. The inverse autotransporter intimin exports its passenger domain via a hairpin intermediate.J. Biol.

In this mutant the β-barrel domain is fully formed and inserted into the membrane, but the C terminus of the passenger is located in the periplasm (Fig. 1B). The double HA tag of this mutant is in fact located in the beginning of the D00 domain sequence, where it disrupts a predicted β-strand (Fig. 1C). In this study we investigated the effect of this insertion on the D00 domain and its implications for passenger secretion. The C-terminal, membrane-proximal region of several classical autotransporter passengers functions as a highly stable folding core that is necessary for efficient secretion (12Soprova Z.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4918-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This region has earlier been termed an “autochaperone” domain, although this name is no longer recommended (16Drobnak I.

By analogy, the N-terminal region of inverse autotransporters has been suggested to play a similar role in the secretion process by promoting protein folding (11Oberhettinger P. Leo J.C. Linke D.

The bacterial intimins and invasins: a large and novel family of secreted proteins.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e14403-e14414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We, therefore, set out to test whether the D00 domain acts as a folding core in inverse autotransport. Our results show that disruption of this domain leads to misfolding of D00 and stalling of passenger secretion; however, the D00 domain is not required for passenger secretion, and it does not form a stable folding core. Rather, our results support a model where sequential folding of individual Ig-like domains at the cell surface provides most of the free energy for inverse autotransporter passenger secretion. When investigating the borders of the β-barrel domain of Intimin, Fairman et al. (5Fairman J.W. Dautin N. Wojtowicz D. Liu W. Noinaj N. Barnard T.J. Udho E. Przytycka T.M. Cherezov V. Buchanan S.K.

This domain was not recognized as either a bacterial Ig-like or a C-type lectin domain by the Pfam database; therefore, Fairman et al. (5Fairman J.W. Dautin N. Wojtowicz D. Liu W. Noinaj N.

However, when we subjected the amino acid sequence of the D00 domain to sensitive homology-based structure prediction using HHPred (18Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), all the best hits were to Ig-like domains (Fig. 2A). In addition, secondary structure prediction for an alignment of D00 domains from various inverse autotransporters shows seven predicted β-strands, consistent with an Ig-like topology (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we made a homology model of the D00-D0 domain pair, which clearly shows both adopting an Ig-like fold (Fig. 2C and supplemental File 1). To test our prediction, we produced and purified the D00 domain using recombinant techniques. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the protein shows a broad minimum centered around 212 nm that is typical of β-structured proteins, consistent with our predictions of an Ig-like domain (Fig. 2D)."

It is often associated with loss of function of the BRCA1 gene, either through mutation, loss of heterozygosity or methylation. This study aimed to measure methylation of the BRCA1 gene promoter at individual CpG sites in blood, tumour and normal breast tissue, to assess whether levels were correlated between different tissues, and with triple negative receptor status, histopathological scoring for BRCA-like features and BRCA1 protein expression. Blood DNA methylation levels were significantly correlated with tumour methylation at 9 of 11 CpG sites examined (p<0.0007). The levels of tumour DNA methylation were significantly higher in triple negative tumours, and in tumours with high BRCA-like histopathological scores (10 of 11 CpG sites; p<0.01 and p<0.007 respectively). Similar results were observed in blood DNA (6 of 11 CpG sites; p<0.03 and 7 of 11 CpG sites; p<0.02 respectively). This study provides insight into the pattern of CpG methylation across the BRCA1 promoter, and supports previous studies suggesting that tumours with BRCA1 promoter methylation have similar features to those with BRCA1 mutations, and therefore may be suitable for the same targeted therapies."

A variety of different LCs are associated with the Dictyostelium myosin-1 isozymes. Myosin-1A and myosin-1E use CaM as a LC, whereas myosin-1D binds MlcD, a 17-kDa CaM-related protein that lacks the ability to bind Ca2+ (23Crawley S.W. Liburd J. Shaw K. Jung Y. Smith S.P. Côté G.P.

In this report, we describe the NMR-derived solution structure of free MlcC and the x-ray crystal structure of a complex between MlcC and the first two IQ motifs of myosin-1C. The results show that MlcC undergoes a transition from a closed to a semi-open state upon binding the IQ motif and that its structure in both states is very similar to that of the C-terminal lobe of apo-CaM. The binding of MlcC to IQ1 and IQ2 induces a distinct bend into the myosin-1C LCBD. The two MlcC molecules in the complex are rotated by ∼20° relative to the helix axis, which leaves the opposite, concave, side of the LCBD largely exposed. Although MlcC and the C-terminal lobe of apo-CaM are structurally very similar, the myosin-1C IQ1 and IQ2 motifs exhibit a very high degree of specificity for MlcC. The specificity is likely due to hydrophobic interactions between the last residue in the IQ motif and residues at the extreme N and C termini of MlcC. Toward assessing the structural properties of MlcC in solution, the NMR-based assignment of 98 and 96% of the backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts was completed. The water-refined NMR ensemble of the 20 lowest energy MlcC structures was determined using a total of 1279 NOE-based distance and 120 TALOS-derived dihedral angle restraints (Fig. 1, A and B). With the exception of Met-1–Thr-7 and Trp-73–Asp-74, the MlcC structure was well defined by the NMR data and was consistent with {1H}-15N NOE data (Fig. 1C). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the structured core of MlcC from the minimized average structure was 0.69 ± 0.13 and 1.16 ± 0.12 Å for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively.

The four helices (labeled A to D) run roughly parallel or antiparallel to one another to produce a compact four-helix bundle with dimensions of 19 × 18 × 32 Å. The two non-functional Ca2+-binding loops interact via two short β-strands (Val-25–Thr-26; Tyr-60–Val-61) that form an antiparallel β-sheet. MlcC contains five basic and 13 acid residues (Fig. 1D). The surface charge is asymmetrically distributed with seven acidic residues located in the inter-EF-hand linker and helix C (Fig. 1E). Structure database searches using the DALI server indicated that the MlcC structure most closely resembles that of the C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) of apo-CaM, with a Z-score of 8.9, a backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å, and similar interhelical angles (Fig. 1F; Table 2) (27Holm L.

Addition of the GB1-M1C-IQ2 to a uniformly 13C/15N-labeled MlcC resulted in significant chemical shift changes for numerous backbone amide resonances in the two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum corresponding to residues throughout the MlcC sequence (Fig. 2A). Mapping of these chemical shifts onto the structure of MlcC indicated that the M1C-IQ2 motif affects residues throughout MlcC structure, including the flexible N- and C-terminal segments, the central hydrophobic core, and the inter-EF-hand linker (Fig. 2B). These observations are more consistent with a ligand-induced conformational change as opposed to a ligand binding to a localized region on the MlcC structure. A recombinant GB1 fusion protein containing the tandem IQ1 and IQ2 motifs of myosin-1C (GB1-M1C-IQ1.2) was also produced. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that M1C-IQ1.2 had an α-helical content of ∼50%, whereas the individual M1C-IQ1 or M1C-IQ2 motif peptides had less than 10% helical content (Fig. 3). When the GB1-M1C-IQ1.2 peptide was incubated with MlcC and assessed by size exclusion chromatography, the GB1-M1C-IQ1.2·MlcC complex eluted with an apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, and SDS-PAGE confirmed that the complex contained both MlcC and GB1-M1C-IQ1.2 (Fig. 4A). The apparent size of the complex was consistent with a trimer in which two molecules of MlcC (∼8 kDa) bind to the GB1-M1C-IQ1.2 fusion protein (∼14 kDa).FIGURE 4MlcC forms a 2:1 complex with M1C-IQ1.2.

Titration of MlcC into a solution containing M1C-IQ1.2 resulted in a distinct biphasic binding curve (Fig. 4B). M1C-IQ1.2 bound one molecule of MlcC with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.25 ± 0.03 nm and a second molecule with an ∼200-fold lower affinity (Kd = 55 ± 12 nm). No binding interaction was detected when apo-CaM was titrated into M1C-IQ1.2, demonstrating that the myosin-1C IQ motifs exhibit a high degree of specificity for MlcC (Fig. 4B). The complex of MlcC and M1C-IQ1.2 readily crystallized, and its structure was determined to a resolution of 1.9 Å by molecular replacement using the myosin V IQ motif·apo-CaM complex as a search model (PDB accession 2IX7; Table 3). The x-ray crystal structure shows two molecules of MlcC, one per M1C-IQ motif, bound to M1C-IQ1.2 (Fig. 5A). M1C-IQ1.2 folds into a single 11-turn α-helix that is uniformly bent with a radius of curvature of ∼80 Å. The two molecules of MlcC are attached to the convex surface of the α-helix and are rotated by ∼20° relative to one another. There is a small region of contact (buried surface area of 300 Å2) between the two MlcC molecules involving Met-69 and Trp-73 at the C terminus of the M1C-IQ1-bound MlcC and Val-16 and Arg-19 of the M1C-IQ2-bound MlcC. The interaction with MlcC leaves a large portion of the bottom concave surface of the M1C-IQ1.2 helix exposed, including the side chains of Arg-699, Asp-703, Ser-706, Asn-710, Ala-717, Glu-721, Asn-724, Asn-728, Asn-732, and Leu-735 (Fig. 5).TABLE 3Data collection and refinement statistics for the 2:1 MlcC:M1C-IQ1.2 complexData collectionBeamlineCLS CMCF-IDWavelength (Å)1.7712Temperature (K)100Resolution (Å)28.2–1.90 (1.97–1.90)aa Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Space groupP1Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)28.7, 31.4, 56.4α, β, γ (°)75.8, 84, 67.1I/σI26.9 (11.2)Rmeasure (%)4.3 (13.3)CC1/21 (0.99)Completeness (%)90.9 (69.5)Redundancy3.8 (3.6)No. of reflections48,431RefinementResolution (Å)28.2–1.90 (2.05–1.90)Rwork/Rfree0.14/0.19 (0.12/0.19)No. of atomsProtein1606Water238B-factors (Å2)Protein15.0Water28.5r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)0.90Ramachandran statisticsFavored (%)98.9Allowed (%)1.1Outliers (%)0a a Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab With the exception of the extreme N- and C-terminal regions, the MlcC molecules bound to the IQ1 and IQ2 motifs have nearly identical structures (r.m.s.d. of 0.46 Å for 65 Cα atoms). Comparison with the NMR-derived structure of MlcC shows that MlcC undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding to the IQ motif (r.m.s.d. of 3.04 Å for 66 Cα atoms). The bottom portions of helices A, C, and D are displaced outward between 4.5 and 6 Å, which opens up a central V-shaped hydrophobic groove that allows MlcC to grasp the helical IQ motif (Fig. 6A; Table 2). The structure of the M1C-IQ motif-bound MlcC closely resembles the semi-open conformation adopted by the C-lobe of apo-CaM upon binding to an IQ motif (r.m.s.d. of 0.93Å for 65 Cα atoms) (Fig. 6B; Table 2) (29Houdusse A. Gaucher J.F. Krementsova E. Mui S. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Crystal structure of apo-calmodulin bound to the first two IQ motifs of myosin V reveals essential recognition features.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19326-19331Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The M1C-IQ1 and MIC-IQ2 motifs are each 18 residues in length (Fig. 7A), and their register is such that equivalent residues in each motif are positioned on the same face of the helical myosin neck region. Despite this similarity, they do not interact in an equivalent manner with MlcC because of the ∼20° rotation of the second MlcC molecule relative to the helix axis (Fig. 5). The MlcC-binding site within M1C-IQ1 extends from Trp-701 to Phe-718, resulting in a buried surface area of 2,302 Å2 and a solvent-free energy gain (ΔiG) of −14.2 kcal/mol (p value = 0.218) as calculated by the PISA server (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar). The interface with M1C-IQ2 extends from Gln-719 to Arg-737, yielding a buried surface area of 2,190 Å2 and a ΔiG of −10.2 kcal/mol (p value = 0.324). These values are suggestive of highly specific interactions, and the difference in ΔiG values for M1C-IQ1 and M1C-IQ2 reflects the more hydrophobic nature of the M1C-IQ1 motif. Several of the hydrophobic residues in M1C-IQ1 (Trp-701, Met-704, Ala-705, and Phe-718) that interact with MlcC are substituted by more polar residues in M1C-IQ2 (Gln-719, Cys-722, Ser-723, and Tyr-736, respectively) (Fig. 7B). The N terminus of MlcC, which is disordered in the NMR structure, is tightly anchored to the M1C-IQ1 motif but not to the M1C-IQ2 motif (Fig. 7C). Examination of the M1C-IQ1 motif shows that the side chain of Met-1 in MlcC binds into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Phe-718 in the M1C-IQ1 motif and Trp-73 at the C terminus of MlcC. The side chain of Val-16 in the adjacent M1C-IQ2-bound MlcC stabilizes the formation of the hydrophobic pocket through interactions with both the Phe-718 and Trp-73 side chains. In the M1C-IQ2 motif, the formation of the hydrophobic cluster is disrupted. Phe-718 in the M1C-IQ1 motif is replaced in the M1C-IQ2 motif by the more polar Tyr-736 residue (Fig. 7A). Instead of interacting with Trp-73, the side chain of Tyr-736 is solvent-exposed where it can hydrogen bond to a water molecule. It is also likely that the absence of an adjacent MlcC molecule that could help orient the Tyr-736 and Trp-73 side chains contributes to the disruption of the hydrophobic Met-1 binding pocket. The glutamine residue that is characteristic of canonical IQ motifs is replaced in both of the myosin-1C IQ motifs by a lysine residue (Lys-709 and Lys-727) (Fig. 7A). In the complex with MlcC, the side chains of Lys-709 and Lys-727 are completely buried by the loop formed by the inter-EF-hand linker sequence (Fig. 8A). The lysine side chain makes three hydrogen bond interactions with the main chain carbonyl groups of Leu-34, Leu-37, and Asp-39 in MlcC (Fig. 8A). The conserved Arg-713 and Arg-731 residues of the myosin-1C IQ motifs help to anchor the inter-EF-hand linker to the IQ motif through a hydrogen bond interaction with the main chain carbonyl of Met-40 of MlcC. The side chain of Arg-713, but not Arg-731, is involved in a salt bridge interaction with Asp-39 in the inter-EF-hand linker of MlcC. The C-terminal region of the M1C-IQ1 and M1C-IQ2 motifs contains a second lysine residue (Lys-716 and Lys-734, respectively). The side chain of Lys-716 forms a salt bridge with Glu-52 in the acidic helix C of MlcC, whereas Lys-734 in M1C-IQ2 forms salt bridges with Glu-45 and Glu-48 closer to the beginning of helix C (Fig. 8B). This difference is likely caused by the replacement of Gln-719 in M1C-IQ1 with Arg-737 in M1C-IQ2. The Arg-737 side chain displaces the Lys-734 side chain toward Glu-45/48 of MlcC by charge repulsion interaction and provides an alternative electrostatic binding partner for Glu-52. Most myosin LCs are composed of two globular lobes, each of which is made up of a pair of helix-loop-helix EF-hand motifs. Dictyostelium MlcC is an atypical small light chain composed of two EF-hand motifs, neither of which is able to bind Ca2+ (23Crawley S.W. Liburd J. Shaw K. Jung Y. Smith S.P. Côté G.P. Identification of calmodulin and MlcC as light chains for Dictyostelium myosin-I isozymes.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 6579-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MlcC functions as the light chain for myosin-1C, a long-tailed class-1 myosin. Here, we report the NMR-derived solution structure of MlcC as well as the x-ray crystal structure of a complex containing MlcC bound to both the IQ1 and IQ2 motifs of myosin-1C. In solution, the two EF-hand motifs of MlcC pack together to form a globular four-helix bundle flanked by short disordered N- and C-terminal segments. To bind to the helical myosin-1C IQ motifs, the four-helix bundle opens up to expose a central hydrophobic groove that grasps the N-terminal portion of the IQ motif. Hydrophobic residues in the flexible N- and C-terminal segments anchor MlcC to the C-terminal portion of each of the IQ motifs and to the adjacent MlcC molecule and are predicted to be responsible for high affinity specific binding to the myosin-1C IQ motifs. M1C-IQ.1.2, a fragment containing both the myosin-1C IQ1 and IQ2 motifs, bound one molecule of MlcC with a Kd of 0.25 ± 0.03 nm and a second MlcC molecule with a Kd of 55 ± 12 nm. When compared with the affinity of MlcC for peptides that correspond to the individual M1C-IQ1 (Kd = 71 ± 6 nm) and M1C-IQ2 motifs (Kd = 460 ± 4 nm) previously reported (23Crawley S.W. Liburd J. Shaw K. Jung Y. Smith S.P. Côté G.P. Identification of calmodulin and MlcC as light chains for Dictyostelium myosin-I isozymes.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 6579-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it is apparent that the tandem arrangement of the myosin-1C IQ motifs greatly enhanced the affinity for MlcC. This may be due in part to the helical conformation of M1C-IQ.1.2 in solution (Fig. 3). The presence of a pre-formed α-helical binding site in the M1C-1Q1.2 fragment would significantly lower the energetic cost for the binding of the MlcC. An increase in α-helical content does not explain why the two IQ motifs in the M1C-IQ1.2 fragment bind MlcC with a 200-fold difference in binding affinity, whereas the individual IQ1 and IQ2 motif peptides bind MlcC with a 6-fold differen"
https://openalex.org/W2480194505,"Chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis is characterized by pain and a pro-inflammatory tissue response. Rat models are frequently used in mucositis disease investigations yet little is known about the presence of pain in these animals, the ability of analgesics to ameliorate the condition, or the effect that analgesic administration may have on study outcomes. This study investigated different classes of analgesics with the aim of determining their analgesic effects and impact on research outcomes of interest in a rat model of mucositis. Female DA rats were allocated to 8 groups to include saline and chemotherapy controls (n = 8). Analgesics included opioid derivatives (buprenorphine; 0.05mg/kg and tramadol 12.5mg/kg) and NSAID (carprofen; 15mg/kg) in combination with either saline or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; 150mg/kg). Research outcome measures included daily clinical parameters, pain score and gut histology. Myeloperoxidase assay was performed to determine gut inflammation. At the dosages employed, all agents had an analgesic effect based on behavioural pain scores. Jejunal myeloperoxidase activity was significantly reduced by buprenorphine and tramadol in comparison to 5-FU control animals (53%, p = 0.0004 and 58%, p = 0.0001). Carprofen had no ameliorating effect on myeloperoxidase levels. None of the agents reduced the histological damage caused by 5-FU administration although tramadol tended to increase villus length even when administered to healthy animals. These data provide evidence that carprofen offers potential as an analgesic in this animal model due to its pain-relieving efficacy and minimal effect on measured parameters. This study also supports further investigation into the mechanism and utility of opioid agents in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced mucositis."
https://openalex.org/W2495545265,"Purpose To evaluate the peripapillary and perifoveal retinal perfusions of young healthy eyes with a tessellated fundus using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Methods Thirty-five Chinese subjects with a tessellated fundus and 35 subjects without a tessellated fundus from a population-based cross-sectional study in Shanghai were included. All participants underwent OCT angiography. The flow index and vessel density were examined in the peripapillary and perifoveal retinal areas, and their relationships with other ocular parameters were analyzed. Results In the peripapillary area, the eyes with a tessellated fundus had a lower retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) flow index (0.055 ± 0.009 vs. 0.061 ± 0.007, P = 0.006), RNFL vessel density (61.8 ± 7.3 vs. 65.9 ± 5.2, P = 0.010), retinal flow index (0.086 ± 0.010 vs. 0.092 ± 0.008, P = 0.012), and retinal vessel density (83.7 ± 5.0 vs. 86.4 ± 3.7, P = 0.018) than the control eyes, and the difference remained significant even after adjustments were made for gender and RNFL thickness. No difference was found in the perifoveal area. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that the retinal flow index and vessel density in the peripapillary area were significantly correlated with the tessellated fundus diagnosis (flow index: β = -0.006, P = 0.005; vessel density: β = -2.597, P = 0.006), gender (flow index: β = 0.005, P = 0.019; vessel density: β = 3.129, P = 0.002) and RNFL thickness (flow index: β = 0.000, P = 0.002; vessel density: β = 0.190, P = 0.002). The RNFL flow index and vessel density were significantly associated with the tessellated fundus diagnosis (flow index: β = -0.005, P = 0.005; vessel density: β = -3.572, P = 0.008) and the thickness of RNFL (flow index: β = 0.001, P < 0.001; vessel density: β = 0.421, P < 0.001). Conclusions Eyes with tessellated fundus with a relative decreased peripapillary retinal perfusion compared with eyes without a tessellated fundus were observed. The findings whether indicate causality that the reduction in the peripapillary perfusion and the peripapillary atrophy in myopia, need further study."
https://openalex.org/W2488988553,"Reproductive function is controlled by the pulsatile release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which regulates the expression of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone and FSH in pituitary gonadotropes. Paradoxically, Fshb gene expression is maximally induced at lower frequency GnRH pulses, which provide a very low average concentration of GnRH stimulation. We studied the role of secreted factors in modulating gonadotropin gene expression. Inhibition of secretion specifically disrupted gonadotropin subunit gene regulation but left early gene induction intact. We characterized the gonadotrope secretoproteome and global mRNA expression at baseline and after Gαs knockdown, which has been found to increase Fshb gene expression (1Choi S.G. Jia J. Pfeffer R.L.

We identified 1077 secreted proteins or peptides, 19 of which showed mRNA regulation by GnRH or/and Gαs knockdown. Among several novel secreted factors implicated in Fshb gene regulation, we focused on the neurosecretory protein VGF. Vgf mRNA, whose gene has been implicated in fertility (2Hahm S. Mizuno T.M.

In contrast with Fshb induction, Vgf induction occurred preferentially at high GnRH pulse frequency. We hypothesized that a VGF-derived peptide might regulate Fshb gene induction. siRNA knockdown or extracellular immunoneutralization of VGF augmented Fshb mRNA induction by GnRH. GnRH stimulated the secretion of the VGF-derived peptide NERP1. NERP1 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in Fshb gene induction. These findings implicate a VGF-derived peptide in selective regulation of the Fshb gene. Our results support the concept that signaling specificity from the cell membrane GnRH receptor to the nuclear Fshb gene involves integration of intracellular signaling and exosignaling regulatory motifs."

For identifying and comparing miRNAs and their targets in seed development between two maize inbred lines (i.e. PH6WC and PH4CV), two sRNAs and two degradome libraries were constructed. Through high-throughput sequencing and miRNA identification, 55 conserved and 24 novel unique miRNA sequences were identified in two sRNA libraries; moreover, through degradome sequencing and analysis, 137 target transcripts corresponding to 38 unique miRNA sequences were identified in two degradome libraries. Subsequently, 16 significantly differentially expressed miRNA sequences were verified by qRT-PCR, in which 9 verified sequences obviously target 30 transcripts mainly involved with regulation in flowering and development in embryo. Therefore, the results suggested that some miRNAs (e.g. miR156, miR171, miR396 and miR444) related reproductive development might differentially express in seed development between the PH6WC and PH4CV maize inbred lines in this present study."
https://openalex.org/W2504716999,"The detection of an error in the motor output and the correction in the next movement are critical components of any form of motor learning. Accordingly, a variety of iterative learning models have assumed that a fraction of the error is adjusted in the next trial. This critical fraction, the correction gain, learning rate, or feedback gain, has been frequently estimated via least-square regression of the obtained data set. Such data contain not only the inevitable noise from motor execution, but also noise from measurement. It is generally assumed that this noise averages out with large data sets and does not affect the parameter estimation. This study demonstrates that this is not the case and that in the presence of noise the conventional estimate of the correction gain has a significant bias, even with the simplest model. Furthermore, this bias does not decrease with increasing length of the data set. This study reveals this limitation of current system identification methods and proposes a new method that overcomes this limitation. We derive an analytical form of the bias from a simple regression method (Yule-Walker) and develop an improved identification method. This bias is discussed as one of other examples for how the dynamics of noise can introduce significant distortions in data analysis."

The transcriptome annotation of the skeletal muscles is a crucial step in muscle growth-related gene analysis. In this study, we generated 52 504 230 reads of mRNA sequence data from the fast muscles of the Chinese perch by using Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq. Twenty-one amino acid transporter genes were annotated by searching protein and gene ontology databases, and postprandial changes in their transcript abundance were assayed after administering a single satiating meal to Chinese perch juveniles (body mass, approximately 100 g), following fasting for 1 week. The gut content of the Chinese perch increased significantly after 1 h and remained high for 6 h following the meal and emptied within 48-96 h. Expression of eight amino acid transporter genes was assayed in the fast muscles through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h. Among the genes, five transporter transcripts were markedly up-regulated within 1 h of refeeding, indicating that they may be potential candidate genes involved in the rapid-response signaling system regulating fish myotomal muscle growth. These genes display coordinated regulation favoring the resumption of myogenesis responding to feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2495837822,"RGS2 is a negative regulator of G protein signaling that contains a GTPase-activating domain and a β-tubulin binding region. This study aimed to determine the localization and function of RGS2 during mouse oocyte maturation in vitro. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that RGS2 was widely expressed in the cytoplasm with a greater abundance on both meiotic spindles and first/second polar bodies from the fully-grown germinal vesicle (GV) stage to the MII stages. Co-expression of RGS2 and β-tubulin could also be detected in the spindle and polar body of mouse oocytes at the MI, AI, and MII stages. Inhibition of the binding site between RGS2 and β-tubulin was accomplished by injecting anti-RGS2 antibody into GV-stage oocytes, which could result in oocytes arrest at the MI or AI stage during in vitro maturation, but it did not affect germinal vesicle breakdown. Moreover, injecting anti-RGS2 antibody into oocytes resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of first polar body extrusion and abnormal spindle formation. Additionally, levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2 were significantly reduced in anti-RGS2 antibody injected oocytes compared with control oocytes. These findings suggest that RGS2 might play a critical role in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation by affecting β-tubulin polymerization and chromosome segregation."
