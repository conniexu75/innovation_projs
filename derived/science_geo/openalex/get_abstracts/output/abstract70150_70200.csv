https://openalex.org/W1552530238,"Aminoglycoside antibiotics were found to vary widely in the effect of variation in their concentration on the degree of misreading of synthetic RNA messengers. Thus, neomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin showed a 3- to 5-fold increase in the level of misreading as the drug concentration was raised from 10−6 to 10−4M. This effect suggests that each of these drugs may act on more than one site. Observed changes in the qualitative nature of the misreading at different concentrations support this inference, which is also consistent with the absence of one-step mutants with high level resistance to these drugs. In contrast, little increase in misreading, over the same concentration range, was seen with streptomycin and paromomycin, for which one-step, high level, resistant mutants are known. It therefore seems that these drugs each act on only a single site."

https://openalex.org/W2093835809,"Abstract The ability of rat liver lysosomes to digest various lipids has been investigated. The lysosomes were isolated from the livers of rats treated with Triton WR-1339 and were essentially free of other cell components. They were able to deacylate extensively phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, cardiolipin, tripalmitin, 1,2-dipalmitin, 1,3-dipalmitin, and 1-monopalmitin, when incubated with these substrates at 37° in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.3 to 4.6. With most substrates, hydrolysis occurred without the addition of a detergent. Exceptions were tripalmitin, which was not attacked in the absence of detergent, but was deacylated vigorously in the presence of 5% Triton X-100, and cardiolipin, which required addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 for hydrolysis in acetate buffer, but was attacked in citrate buffer without added detergent. The hydrolysis of diglycerides was stimulated by 5% Triton X-100. On the other hand, this detergent inhibited the deacylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and of monopalmitin. Sphingomyelin was not deacylated, but was hydrolyzed to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Hydrolysis of ceramide could not be established, either with lysosomes or with whole liver preparations, under a variety of conditions. The phosphodiesters arising from the digestion of phospholipids proved to be resistant to lysosomal hydrolysis, both at acid and alkaline pH. An alkaline phosphodiesterase acting on glycerophosphorylcholine is present in whole liver. Part of this activity is located in the cell sap; the remainder is distributed between the nuclear and microsomal fractions in a manner suggestive of a localization in the plasma membrane. The lysosomes were found to have the ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidic acid, α-glycerophosphate, and, although rather slowly, the phosphomonoesters of choline, ethanolamine, and serine. Extensive digestion of the lipids and proteins of both microsomes and mitochondria occurs upon prolonged incubation of these cell components with purified lysosomes at pH 4.3. RNA appears to be broken down under these conditions. Thus it is clear that lysosomes can accomplish the important digestive functions with which they are credited. However, the manner in which some of the products of this process, especially the phosphodiesters, are cleared from the particles raises a problem of physiological importance."

https://openalex.org/W1716826009,"The levels of the A and B proteins of lactose synthetase were measured in organ cultures of mouse mammary glands treated with different hormone combinations. Both the A and B proteins were stimulated specifically by insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin. Prolactin, however, induced the synthesis of each protein when the organ cultures were pretreated with insulin and hydrocortisone. Under these conditions there was a 10-fold increase in the A protein activity and a 2-fold increase in B protein activity. Specific inhibitors of protein synthesis prevented the induction of both proteins by prolactin. When the levels of the proteins were measured in mammary glands from mice at different stages of pregnancy, it was found that the level of the A protein increased to a maximum towards the end of pregnancy. In contrast, the B protein remained at a low level during pregnancy, but rose dramatically on the initiation of lactation. The relative levels of the A and B proteins in glands from late pregnant mice are similar to those observed after prolactin stimulation of organ cultures pretreated with insulin and hydrocortisone. The asynchronous expression of the A and B proteins may represent a unique type of hormonal control of a biosynthetic pathway, and appears to reflect the specific functional requirements of the mammary gland during development and lactation."
https://openalex.org/W1582400543,"Abstract Dihydroxyacetone phosphate was converted to a lipid by guinea pig liver mitochondria in the presence of fatty acids, coenzyme A (CoA), ATP, and Mg++. The isolated product was identified as acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate by its chemical and chromatographic properties. The structure of the product was confirmed by comparing the infrared spectra of synthetic and biosynthetic palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The requirement for fatty acid, CoA, and ATP could be replaced by acyl-CoA. When the rate of esterification was examined with different fatty acids, the highest rate was obtained with palmitic acid. At concentrations above 0.1 mm, unsaturated acids such as oleic and linoleic were incorporated at a much lower rate than were palmitic and stearic. Similar results were obtained when the rates of esterification with palmitoyl-, stearoyl-, and oleoyl-CoA were compared. Palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate was synthesized by mitochondria of brain, kidney, and heart, as well as liver. Biosynthesis of acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate was also catalyzed by the liver microsomal fraction, but the selective incorporation of saturated fatty acids was not seen."

https://openalex.org/W1569457562,"Abstract Reaction rates with acrylic acid derivatives were determined for —SH groups in mercaptoethanol and in mercaptoethanol-reduced wheat gluten and bovine serum albumin. The disappearance of —SH and NH2 groups is a direct function of pH in the range 6 to 8 and of acrylate concentration. Kinetic studies indicate that protein —SH groups are modified more rapidly than the mercaptoethanol —SH group. Conditions for specific alkylation of protein —SH groups are pH 7 and a 1:1 ratio of vinyl compound to total protein and mercaptoethanol —SH groups. Under these conditions, the reaction is complete in 5 min with methyl acrylate, 20 min with acrylonitrile, and 100 min with acrylamide."
https://openalex.org/W1482999216,"Abstract Because of the rather widespread interest in palmityl coenzyme A as a possible physiological inhibitor of a large number of enzymes, we have further investigated the inhibition of pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase by palmityl-CoA initially reported in 1958 by Porter and Long (1). The inhibition of the fatty acid synthetase is dependent on the presence of a critical mixed micellar concentration of palmityl-CoA and, more importantly, on the molar ratio of the CoA ester to protein. The molar ratio requirement eliminates the possibility of a site-specific inhibition of the fatty acid synthetase. It is concluded, rather, that palmityl-CoA inhibits this enzyme by virtue of its detergent nature. In support of this conclusion, data are reported which show that sodium lauryl sulfate, another strong detergent, acts in a similar way on the fatty acid synthetase. It is suggested, from the above results, that the inhibiting effect of palmityl-CoA on a number of enzymes reported in the literature may be solely or largely attributed to its detergent action. However, examination of these enzymes with respect to a possible molar ratio requirement for palmityl-CoA inhibition will be necessary before a final conclusion can be drawn."
https://openalex.org/W1514666668,"Abstract The amount and subcellular distribution in rat brain has been determined for four enzymes related to CO2 fixation. Total activities (micromoles per min per g of brain) found are pyruvate carboxylase, 0.2; malate enzyme, 0.82; TPN isocitrate dehydrogenase, 1.75; DPN isocitrate dehydrogenase, 4.0. Pyruvate carboxylase and DPN isocitrate dehydrogenase are found exclusively in the mitochondria. Malate enzyme is 25% soluble, 75% mitochondrial; TPN isocitrate dehydrogenase is 35% soluble, 65% mitochondrial. As the technique of subcellular fractionation used allows the isolation of intact nerve endings, information concerning the nonuniform distribution of these enzymes in nerve endings, as compared with neuron plus glia, is presented. The relationship to models of compartmentation of amino acids and Krebs cycle intermediates in brain is considered."

https://openalex.org/W1593141875,"The synthesis of 2-oxo-cis-4-hexenoic acid from DL-2-amino-cis-4-hexenoic acid is described. The α-oxo acid appears to exist at neutral pH largely in the dienolic form. Ultracentrifuged extracts of steroid-induced Pseudomonas testosteroni rapidly converted 2-oxo-cis-4-hexenoic acid-1-14C to 14CO2. The same enzyme preparations, when supplemented with NAD and a NADPH-generating system, have been previously shown to convert Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione-4-14C to 14CO2 and to accumulate L-2-amino-cis-4-hexenoic acid-1-14C and DL-alanine-1-14C in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate. It has now been shown that, under similar conditions, 2-oxo-amino-cis-4-hexenoic acid is efficiently converted to 2-amino-cis-4-hexenoic acid and alanine. The α-oxo acid also undergoes stereospecific enzymatic hydration to 2-oxo-4-hydroxyhexanoic acid, which is lactonized in the presence of acid to give a product that has been identified as one of the optically active isomers of 2-oxo-4-ethylbutyrolactone of unestablished configuration. These findings suggest that 2-oxo-cis-4-hexenoic acid is a key intermediate in the degradation of steroid ring A by microbial enzymes. The enzyme preparations also contain an enzyme which reduces the double bond of the α-oxo acid but does not appear to be involved in the degradative pathway of the steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1541224027,"Abstract 1. More than one mode of transport can be observed for concentrative uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by rat kidney cortex slices when the initial concentration of AIB in the medium is varied between 0.2 and 16 mm. 2. The relative contribution from both systems to the total observed uptake at various concentrations of AIB was calculated. The Km values for the two systems were 3.87 mm and 24.8 mm. 3. Sodium-dependent inhibitory reactions influence the uptake of 0.8 mm AIB more than of 8.0 mm AIB; inhibitors affecting —SH groups have the opposite effect. 4. l-Alanine is an effective competitive inhibitor of AIB transport at high substrate concentrations; more than one Ki value for l-alanine can be derived depending on the concentration of AIB. External l-proline enhances the affinity of AIB for uptake at low substrate concentrations; an inhibitory effect is observed at high substrate concentrations. Although omission of sodium from the medium abolishes concentrative uptake of AIB at all concentrations, it is restored at low substrate concentration by the addition of 4 mm l-proline to the external sodium-free medium. l-Proline placed internally stimulates AIB accumulation at low substrate concentrations only in the presence of sodium. 5. A site at which a ternary complex between proline or sodium and the AIB-carrier complex may be formed is proposed for AIB transport at low concentrations; another system with different properties is used predominantly for AIB transport at high concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1966777313,"Hippocampal synchronization during aversive dorsal midbrain stimulation was observed in rats both in a conditioning procedure and under d-tubo-curarine paralysis. The results restrict the generality of previous reports which correlated hippocampal synchronization and desynchronization with approach and withdrawal behavior, respectively. Relative to the condition of free movement, curarization reduced the frequency of both ""spontaneous"" and dorsal midbrain-evoked synchronization, thus suggesting possible direct and indirect effects of d-tubocurarine on subcortical structures."
https://openalex.org/W1492943437,"Evidence derived from physical, chemical, and kinetic studies of a partially purified branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase establishes that both α-ketoisocaproic and α-keto-β-methylvaleric acids are oxidatively decarboxylated by a single enzyme complex. This situation is consistent with the current clinical observations of branched chain ketoaciduria. The significance of this finding is discussed in relation to metabolic aspects of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1607496744,"Abstract The presence of cupric ions or ferric ions was found to enhance the development of color in the indole reaction for the colorimetric determination of deoxyribonucleic acid. The addition of calcium, cobaltous, magnesium, manganous, nickel, or zinc ions did not produce this effect. In the absence of added cupric ions, the indole reaction gave variable results, and the color developed to less than half of the optimum level. It is recommended that the reaction mixture for this assay include cupric ions at a concentration of 15 µm. Under these conditions, the molar extinction coefficient (based on the molarity of DNA phosphorus) of the colored product at 490 mµ is equal to 15,800 m-1 cm-1. The assay conforms to Beer's law until the concentration of DNA exceeds 25 µg per ml (A1 cm490 mµ = 1.25) in the reaction vessel."
https://openalex.org/W1549807724,"Abstract The substrate and modifier specificity of adenylate deaminase from calf brain has been investigated. The enzyme deaminates AMP, but no other nucleoside monophosphate. The enzyme is activated and inhibited by certain nucleotides. Among the nucleoside triphosphates, the most effective activator is ATP, and the most effective inhibitor is guanosine triphosphate. The inhibition by GTP is reversed by raising the concentration of ATP; the activation by ATP is reversed by raising the concentration of GTP. Both ATP and GTP are very effective at protecting the enzyme against heat inactivation. The common nucleoside mono- and disphosphates have little effect on the activity of the enzyme. However, the analogue of AMP in which the sugar is attached to the 3- instead of the 9-position of adenine is a powerful inhibitor. The kinetic properties of the enzyme suggest that the activity of the brain enzyme in vivo is regulated by the ratio of the concentrations of ATP and GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1643379906,"Abstract Incubation of adrenal homogenates of tocopherol-deficient rats was shown to produce a compound which was identified as malonaldehyde. This product formed a pink color with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) which had the same absorption characteristics as authentic malonaldehyde-TBA complex. The malonaldehyde production in vitro as an index of lipid peroxidation, as tested by the TBA test, has been evaluated and compared in the various tissue homogenates of tocopherol-deficient and control rats. Lipid peroxidation in the liver homogenates of tocopherol-deficient rats reached a maximum level in 1 week. In contrast, the adrenal homogenates exhibited a progressive increase in lipid peroxidation in vitro from the 2nd to 7th week of tocopherol deprivation. The kinetic studies of lipid peroxidation reaction of adrenal homogenate during various stages of vitamin E deprivation indicated presence of a lag period in the early period of tocopherol deprivation which disappeared by 9th week of tocopherol deprivation. The extent of adrenal lipid peroxidation in vitro was about 10 times higher than in any other tissue tested. Diminution of adrenal ascorbate in the deficient group by stress, dialysis of the homogenate, or addition of ascorbic acid oxidase to the homogenate reduced lipid peroxidation in vitro. Malonaldehyde was not produced by either the particulate nor the supernatant fraction of the adrenal homogenate, but optimal amounts were formed by combining these two fractions. The ability of the supernantant fraction to catalyze formation of malonaldehyde (in the presence of adrenal particulate fraction) could be mimicked by ascorbic acid; this catalytic effect was abolished by addition of ascorbic acid oxidase. The content of adrenal ascorbate and percentage of individual fatty acids were similar in the two dietary groups at various stages of vitamin E deprivation. It is suggested that with gradual diminution of tocopherol, the high level of polyunsaturated lipids in the adrenal particulate matter, in the presence of high ascorbic acid in the adrenal supernatant solution, may contribute to the high lipid peroxidation in vitro in vitamin E-deficient rats."
https://openalex.org/W1547896531,"Abstract We have measured the disappearance of dissolved CO2 with time after the mixing of dialyzed human hemoglobin solution (average 7.76 mm) at a CO2 partial pressure of nearly zero and water equilibrated with 75 torr of CO2 in a continuous flow rapid reaction apparatus with the use of a CO2 electrode to indicate its partial pressure. po2 was zero in both solutions and the temperature was 37°. Acetazolamide (1.1 mm) was included to inhibit carbonic anhydrase. There was (a) a rapid initial fall in pco2, complete within approximately 0.1 sec and (b) a further slow fall continuing out to several seconds. The initial fall (Process a) is greater at greater pH and less when the hemoglobin is oxygenated. The decrement in pco2 at 0.1 sec corresponds to the formation of amounts of hemoglobin carbamate equal to those reported by others with different techniques, within experimental error. We conclude that Process a represents the formation of hemoglobin carbamate and Process b represents the uncatalyzed hydration of CO2. The velocity constant for the reaction of CO2 and hemoglobin-NH2 (ka) was estimated from the relation between the over-all velocity of the reaction and [H+], which gives a value of 11,000 m-1 sec-1. This value of ka is dependent upon the value chosen for the equilibrium constant (Kz) of the pertinent hemoglobin NH2 groups with H+ ions, which was considered to approximate 7.2 x 10-8 m. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of CO2 and hemoglobin-NH2, Kc, was calculated with less reliability from the change in pco2 at 0.1 sec, under the assumption that it represented equilibrium of carbamate and CO2. Values ranged from 2 x 10-5 to 8 x 10-6, as compared with an estimate of 2.4 x 10-5 in the literature. When this last value is assumed for Kc, and a minimal value for the acid ionization constant of hemoglobin-NHCOOH is taken as 10-6 m, the velocity constant for the dissociation, kd, approximates 500 sec-1. Calculations from previously reported measurements of the rate of CO2 uptake by suspensions of deoxygenated human red cells give a ka within the cell of approximately 5 x 103 m-1 sec-1, which is probably not significantly different from that in solution."

A tripeptide, Gly-Hyp-Ala, was isolated from these digests and identified by sequence analysis and by comparison with a synthetic reference peptide. It was estimated to account for approximately 10% of the hydroxyproline of both purified salt-soluble collagen and of the total collagen of the cuticle."
https://openalex.org/W1584942039,"Interaction of various amino acids and peptides with hemin c or heme octapeptide has been studied. The imidazole group of histidine, the sulfur of methionine, and the indole of tryptophan were definitely established as potential heme-binding groups in such a model system at neutral pH. Methionine or methionine in a synthetic peptide gave type c ferri- and ferrohemochrome spectra with hemin c or heme octapeptide. However, the positions of the maxima of the α- and β-bands of the thioether-hemin c complex were at 552.5 and 523 mµ, respectively, and those of the thioetherheme octapeptide were located at 552 and 521 mµ, as compared to 550 and 520 mµ for cytochrome c. The methionine in a synthetic peptide gave a higher absorbance ratio of the α- and β-band with the model heme octapeptide than that obtained by coordination with free methionine alone. The new findings that tryptophan could coordinate with ferric iron of hemin c and that tryptophan in a synthetic tetrapeptide could coordinate with either ferric or ferrous iron of heme-octapeptide suggested the possibility that mixed hemochromes (histidine-iron-tryptophan) may be formed in cytochrome c. The δ-band in cytochrome c is not characteristic of the spectrum of ferrocytochrome c but was obtained by the interaction between reduced metalloporphyrin and two ligand complexes. The characteristic type c spectra were obtained only by the interaction between two ligands and mesohemes containing thioether bonds."

The name mung bean nuclease I is suggested for the enzyme that is first eluted. It corresponds to the enzyme previously described by Sung and Laskowski (1). This enzyme is further purified on Sephadex G-100. Additional evidence for lack of specificity toward sugar is presented. The purified enzyme is highly specific for denatured DNA."

The isolation and partial amino acid sequences of the 10 chymotryptic peptides are described. The total amino acid composition of these peptides is equal to the sum of the residues present in the tryptic peptides. On the basis of the data obtained for the chymotryptic peptides the order of the tryptic peptides was established. This information, combined with the known sequences of the tryptic peptides, provided sufficient evidence to construct a unique amino acid sequence for the 85 amino acid residues in cytochrome b5."

https://openalex.org/W1549055584,"Abstract The structural requirements for reactivity at the substrate site and for interaction at the regulatory site of ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii have been studied with the use of several nucleotide antibiotics. The 5'-triphosphates of tubercidin, toyocamycin, and sangivamycin were substrates. Without Mg++, tubercidin 5'-triphosphate was a better substrate than ATP. Therefore, the imidazole ring of ATP can be replaced by the pyrrole ring. The presence of a hydroxyl group at position 3' is especially important for reduction since 3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate was not a substrate. 3'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate did inhibit reduction of ATP but did not compete for the reduction of UTP, GTP, or CTP. Modification of the reductase by the prime effectors, dGTP and 2'-dATP, stimulated the reduction of the 5'-triphosphates of tubercidin and toyocamycin. Reduction of sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate was stimulated by dGTP but not 2'-dATP. Although 3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate was not a substrate, it was 50% as good an effector as 2'-dATP for stimulating the reduction of CTP. The pyrrolopyrimidine ribonucleotide antibiotics were less effective than 3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and the pyrazolopyrimidine ribonucleotide, formycin 5'-triphosphate, could not be substituted for ATP. Carbon atom 8 and nitrogen atom 9 of the base portion of ATP, but not nitrogen atom 7, are important for interaction at the regulatory site of ribonucleotide reductase, while a hydroxyl at position 3' of ribose is not essential. ATP, UTP, and GTP reductions are only slightly stimulated when the nucleotide antibiotics are added as allosteric effectors. The reduction of the nucleotide antibiotics and regulation of the reductase may be of possible significance in biological systems."

https://openalex.org/W1538457484,"Abstract Rat kidney mitochondria in the presence of ATP, orthophosphate, and magnesium ions convert pyruvate and bicarbonate primarily to malate, fumarate, and citrate. Pyruvate carboxylase activity was estimated by measuring the incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. In the presence of added α-ketoglutarate or glutamate, the incorporation of 14CO2 into organic acids was greatly increased. The addition of both glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, while greatly increasing 14CO2 incorporation, led to the inhibition of aspartate formation. The low specific radioactivity of malate and citrate obtained from carboxylation of pyruvate with radioactive bicarbonate indicates that some of the radioactive bicarbonate is again lost during metabolism of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and suggests that the unlabeled CO2, derived from oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, may be used preferentially for carboxylation. When pyruvate-1-14C instead of radioactive bicarbonate was labeled, the specific radioactivity of isolated malate and citrate was considerably higher. On the basis of these findings, pyruvate carboxylase activity is significantly higher than that previously reported in the literature based on the incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate into organic acids. Oxalacetate also exerts a regulatory effect on carboxylation of pyruvate as evidenced by the large increase in the 14CO2 incorporation in the presence of added glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1587164598,"Changes in the visible spectrum of human ceruloplasmin resulting from the interaction of the protein-copper chromophore with azide, cyanide, thiocyanate, and cyanate have been examined. Absorption maxima determined for the various protein-anion complexes were the following: N3−, 375 mµ with a shoulder at 435 mµ; CN−, 378 mµ; NCS−, 375 mµ and 435 mµ; NCO−, 395 mµ. The spectral transitions induced by N3−, NCS−, and NCO− produced reductions in the absorption of the protein-copper chromophore of 75, 62, and 65%, respectively. Complex formation in the case of azide and cyanate was reversible, as indicated by a quantitative recovery of both chromophore absorption (610 mµ) and oxidase activity upon removal of the anion. Ceruloplasmin regenerated from the thiocyanate complex exhibited a 10% reduction in these two properties. Protein-bound copper was not removed by either azide, thiocyanate, or cyanate treatment. In the presence of 0.01 M CN− at pH 5.5, ceruloplasmin rapidly lost 1 g atom of copper per 160,000 g of protein. This resulted in the permanent loss of approximately one-third of the absorption at 610 mµ and 54% of the initial oxidase activity. Additional copper was slowly lost upon long term incubation with cyanide. The results of this investigation indicate that predominantly 1 chromophoric cupric copper atom interacts in a reversible manner with N3−, NCS−, and NCO− under the conditions studied. Furthermore, this cupric atom appears to be located on the surface of the molecule exposed to the external environment of the protein and is probably the copper atom readily removed by cyanide."

https://openalex.org/W1541762460,"Abstract The inhibition of ribonuclease by cytidine 3'-phosphate, a reaction product, was investigated from pH 6.3 to pH 8.3. Rates of cytidine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate hydrolysis were determined at different product concentrations, and the results were analyzed by a novel procedure, the linear plot of (S)0/v against (P)0 at a particular pH and constant (S)0. The slope of this plot, corrected to provide for the ionization state of the product, is inversely proportional to the maximal velocity of the reverse reaction. The symmetry of the plot of maximal velocity against pH for the reverse reaction suggests that the velocity of the reverse acidic pathway is equal to the velocity of the reverse alkaline pathway. Apparent pK values of pH 6.95 and 7.59 were calculated for the acidic dissociations of the cytidine 3'-phosphate ribonuclease complexes at an ionic strength of 0.01. The pK values of the product-enzyme complexes, however, are shifted to a lower pH at an ionic strength of 0.15. A tentative explanation of the shift to acidic pH at high ionic strength is the formation of ternary complexes between the divalent anion form of cytidine 3'-phosphate, ribonuclease, and the cationic component of the buffer."

The possible interrelationships between the two enzymes has not been clarified, but both enzymes exhibit absolute specificity for linkages of the form RCO—N—, in which nitrogen is contributed by l-aspartate. In these substrates RCOOH represents not only a pteroyl group but also a variety of acyl groups and all the amino acids tested. This absolute specificity for aspartate in the carboxyl-terminal position of peptides complements previous studies on carboxypeptidase G, in which an analogous specificity is exhibited for glutamate."

https://openalex.org/W1503284450,"Abstract Kinetic studies are reported on the catalysis of tritium exchange from meso-2,3-ditritiosuccinate to water by soluble succinic dehydrogenase from bovine heart. Tritium exchange does not proceed for the most part via the equilibrium dismutation of succinate and fumarate; rather, exchange appears to proceed directly from an enzyme-succinate complex. Time-dependent changes in the exchange activity were observed in the presence of fumarate. Fumarate and fumarate analogues can either enhance or inhibit the exchange reaction depending on concentration and other conditions. Oxygen enhances the exchange rate several-fold in an easily reversible manner which cannot be attributed to the autoxidation of succinate. Attempts to detect a transfer of tritium from succinate to succinic dehydrogenase directly and indirectly by the transfer of tritium from succinate to 2-methylfumarate to yield tritiated 2-methylsuccinate via the succinate-fumarate dismutation reaction were unsuccessful. Exchange rates are dependent on pH, and the maximum in the pH rate profile occurs at pH 6.9 with an apparent turnover number for meso-2,3-ditritiosuccinate of about 5 moles of succinate x min-1 x moles of flavin-1 at 24°. Succinate Km is relatively insensitive to pH and values of 2 ± 0.5 x 10-4 m were obtained from pH 6.8 to 7.6. Ki values for oxalacetate and malonate are 0.5 to 1 µm and 60 to 70 µm, respectively, at pH 6.9. Solvent isotope effects arise to a large extent from an apparent shift in the pH rate profile toward lower pH values in deuterated water. Succinate Km remains essentially unaffected in deuterated water."

The rates of exchange of tritium from racemic-T1 and racemic-T2 are identical and 1.35 times faster than that from meso-T2. The enantiomorphs of racemic-T1 and racemic-T2 are not distinguished kinetically. Hydrogen exchange products of deuterated succinates were identified by their infrared spectra. In the exchange of deuterium from 2,2,3,3-tetradeuterosuccinate (D4) to water, meso-2,3-dideuterosuccinate (meso-D2) is the only major intermediate detected between D4 and the final product, succinate. 2-Deuterosuccinate is detected as an intermediate during the exchange of deuterium from racemic 2,3-dideuterosuccinate, but not from meso-D2. In the exchange of deuterium from D2O to succinate, meso-D2 is again the major intermediate detected between succinate and the final exchange product, D4. The exchange of deuterium from succinate to water goes to completion regardless of the extent and stereochemistry of deuteration. Hydrogen exchange proceeds mainly through the exchange of trans (RS) pairs of methylene hydrogens, and is analogous to the trans elimination of a proton pair during the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Kinetic isotope effects appear to relate only to the nature of trans hydrogen pairs and to be unrelated to the stereochemical differences between labeled enantiomorphs. Activation of succinate seems to involve both hydrogens of a trans pair symmetrically and thus all 4 methylene hydrogen atoms are very nearly equivalent kinetically."

https://openalex.org/W1532939885,Abstract A derivative of the basic pancreatic inhibitor which contained carboxamidomethyl groups on half-cystine residues 14 and 38 was incubated with trypsin and intact inhibitor at pH 5.5. The carboxamidomethyl derivative after separation from trypsin and intact inhibitor released only lysine when incubated with carboxypeptidase B. The derivative was oxidized with performic acid and a peptide corresponding to residues 1 through 15 in the inhibitor was isolated and identified. It was concluded that complex formation between this inhibitor and trypsin involves cleavage of the peptide bond linking residues 15 and 16 (Lys-Ala).

Although the inferences may eventually be proved correct it seems unwarranted for the author to make the statements: (1) “The experiment described here indicates that mice are able to discriminate between D2O and H2”, (2) “It is clear from the results of Table 1 that Mus musculus can distinguish (P≪0.001) between H2O and D2O”."
