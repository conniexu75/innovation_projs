https://openalex.org/W2081286173,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the closely related organism Mycobacterium bovis can survive and replicate inside macrophages. Intracellular survival is at least in part attributed to the failure of mycobacterial phagosomes to undergo fusion with lysosomes. The transformation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes involves gradual acquisition of markers from the endosomal compartment. Members of the rab family of small GTPases which confer fusion competence in the endocytic pathway are exchanged sequentially onto the phagosomal membranes in the course of their maturation. To identify the step at which the fusion capability of phagosomes containing mycobacteria is compromised, we purified green fluorescent protein-labeled M. bovis BCG phagosomal compartments (MPC) and compared GTP-binding protein profiles of these vesicles with latex bead phagosomal compartments (LBC). We report that the MPC do not acquire rab7, specific for late endosomes, even 7 days postinfection, whereas this GTP-binding protein is present on the LBC within hours after phagocytosis. By contrast, rab5 is retained and enriched with time on the MPC, suggesting fusion competence with an early endosomal compartment. Prior infection of macrophages withM. bovis BCG also affected the dynamics of rab5 and rab7 acquisition by subsequently formed LBC. Selective exclusion of rab7, coupled with the retention of rab5 on the mycobacterial phagosome, may allow organisms from the M. tuberculosis complex to avert the usual physiological destination of phagocytosed material.

A significant attribute of a pathogen with an intracellular lifestyle is its avoidance of or resistance to the noxious environment of the secondary lysosome, a highly acidic compartment filled with hydrolyses. Some organisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, lyse the phagosome and escape into the cytoplasm (1Falkow S. Isberg R.R. Portnoy D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 333-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast,Leishmania forms a vacuole that fuses rapidly with the lysosome, and the organism appears not to alter but to tolerate the environment of the phagolysosome (2Mosser D.M. Rosenthal L.A.

Phagocytosis sets in motion a series of fusion and fission events between the phagocytic vesicle and endocytic organelles resulting in a sequential acquisition and loss of markers as the phagosome matures toward the phagolysosome (25Desjardins M.

Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The docking and fusion machinery affecting these processes is not completely understood, but some progress has been made (27Robinson M.S. Watts C. Zerial M. Cell. 1996; 84: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In a report (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) addressing fusion events in phagocytosis, a precise temporal redistribution of rab(s), small ras-like GTP-binding proteins, was observed during maturation of latex bead phagosomal compartments (LBC). 1The abbreviations used are: LBC, latex bead compartment(s); BCG, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin; MPC, mycobacterial phagosomal compartment(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GFP, green fluorescent protein. Specific rab proteins are known to be recruited to membrane positions in their active, GTP-bound form to regulate assembly of docking proteins, providing a proofreading mechanism that ensures specificity of membrane fusions (28Lian J.P.

Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The known functions of rabs and their presence and succession on LBC strongly suggest a role for rab proteins in the control of homotypic and heterotypic vesicle fusion in the process of phagosome maturation (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In this work we investigated the composition of small GTP-binding proteins on mycobacterial phagosomes and compared M. bovisBCG phagosomal compartments (MPC) with LBC from J774 macrophages (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) to test whether the distribution of GTP-binding proteins on MPC was affected by the pathogen. We report that MPC acquire and retain rab5, a regulator of early endosome membrane fusion (31Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J.

The lack of rab7 defines the stage between the early and late endosome as the defective checkpoint in mycobacterial phagosome maturation. Murine macrophage-like cell line J774 was cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 200 mml-glutamine, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) (DMEM 5% FBS) (34Via L.E. Curcic R. Mudd M.H. Dhandayuthapani S. Ulmer R.J. Deretic V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. bovis BCG harboring phsp60-gfp (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was grown in 7H9 medium, homogenized in DMEM 5% FBS, and uniformity of the single-cell suspensions was verified (34Via L.E. Curcic R. Mudd M.H. Dhandayuthapani S. Ulmer R.J. Deretic V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages (3 × 107) were infected by exposure to 25 M. bovis BCG/macrophage for 1 h, washed, and incubated as described previously (34Via L.E. Curcic R. Mudd M.H. Dhandayuthapani S. Ulmer R.J. Deretic V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No apparent damage to the macrophage monolayer was observed up to 12 days. Macrophages were lysed by approximately 30 passages through a syringe apparatus fitted with 22-gauge needles in homogenization buffer containing leupeptin, pepstatin A, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and E64 as described by Chakraborty et al. (36Chakraborty P. Sturgill-Koszycki S. Russell D.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After repeated centrifugation three times at 200 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, the postnuclear supernatant was subjected to velocity sedimentation (1,000 ×g, 45 min, 4 °C) through 15% (w/w) sucrose overlaid on a 50% (w/w) sucrose cushion (36Chakraborty P. Sturgill-Koszycki S. Russell D.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Material collected at the 15–50% sucrose interface was diluted into 2 ml of 15% sucrose and overlaid on a preformed 11 ml linear 32–53% (w/w) sucrose gradient. After isopycnic separation by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 15 h in an SW40 rotor at 4 °C, 0.9-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient using a Buchler Auto Densi-Flow Fractionator (37Deretic D. Huber L.A. Ransom N. Mancini M. Simons K. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeling contamination assays (36Chakraborty P. Sturgill-Koszycki S. Russell D.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicated ≤10% contamination of MPC preparations with other cellular proteins. Dyed latex beads (0.8 mm, 10% solids; Sigma) were added (1:500 dilution in DMEM 5% FBS) to macrophage monolayers for 1 h, and monolayers were incubated as indicated. For LBC preparation, cells were lysed as described above, and LBC were isolated from postnuclear supernatant by flotation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as described by Desjardins et al. (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In experiments with sequential phagocytosis of M. bovis BCG and latex beads, macrophages were infected with mycobacteria and incubated for 72 h, after which latex beads were added (1:500 dilution) for 1 h followed by a 1-h chase. The infected monolayers were lysed, and LBC were isolated. The LBC fraction contained less than 1% of the bacteria in the gradient. Flow cytometry was carried out as described previously (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). β-Hexosaminidase activity was detected using 4-methylumbelliferylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (Calbiochem) as described by Green et al. (38Green S.A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and the product was assayed in an SLM Aminco SPF-500C spectrofluorometer (excitation 365 nm, emission 450 nm). Coverslips containing M. bovis BCG-infected macrophages were prepared for epifluorescence or confocal microscopy as described previously (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, macrophages and subcellular fractions were fixed and washed as described (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), osmicated, contrasted with uranyl acetate, embedded in 2% agarose, dehydrated with acetone, and infiltrated overnight in Epon (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Deretic D. Huber L.A. Ransom N. Mancini M. Simons K. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections of the oriented pellets were examined by transmission electron microscopy using a Philips 301 microscope. Equivalent amounts of phagosomes were solubilized in lysis buffer as described previously (37Deretic D. Huber L.A. Ransom N. Mancini M. Simons K. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing using Ampholines, pH 5–7 and pH 7–9 (1:1), at 1,200 V for 17 h followed by 12% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to Immobilon P membranes by electroblotting (37Deretic D. Huber L.A. Ransom N. Mancini M. Simons K. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTP-binding proteins were detected in an overlay assay with 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mm; DuPont NEN) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3% Tween 20 as described (37Deretic D. Huber L.A. Ransom N. Mancini M. Simons K. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. GTP binding was quantitated in a PhosphorImager. For immunoblots, membranes were incubated with affinity-purified antibodies for rab4, rab5a, and rab7 prepared and characterized as described by Zerial et al.(40Zerial M. Parton R. Chavrier P. Frank R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), or rat monoclonal antibodies to murine Lamp1 (clone 1D4B), Lamp2 (clone ABL-93) (Developmental Hybridoma Bank, NICHHD, Iowa City, IA) transferrin receptor (Biosource International), or rabbit anti-actin (Sigma). The ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) was used for visualization of bound antibodies. To investigate the small GTP-binding protein composition of mycobacterial phagosomes, vesicles containing M. bovis BCG had to be separated from other cellular compartments. To facilitate identification of MPC, M. bovis BCG was labeled in vivo by expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig.1 A) encoded by the plasmid phsp60-gfp (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). J774 macrophages were infected with GFP-labeled M. bovis BCG resulting in 1–4 bacilli/eukaryotic cell at the outset of the infection. The choice of J774 cells was based on the following considerations. (i) GTP binding profiles and several rab proteins have been defined on phagosomes in this cell line (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). (ii) J774 cells respond similarly to human monocyte-derived macrophages in phagocytosis studies (41Zimmerli S. Majeed M. Gustavsson M. Stenahl O. Sanan D.A. Ernst J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and have been used for studies of phagocytosis of various organisms and intracellular killing of mycobacteria (42McDonough K.A. Kress Y. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2763-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). (iii) The use of J774 allows isolation of subcellular organelles in sufficient quantities to permit biochemical analysis. After infection of macrophage monolayers and internalization of mycobacteria (Fig. 1, A and B), MPC were separated (Fig. 2) from other subcellular as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The velocity sedimentation step eliminated Golgi and substantial amounts of endosomal markers from the postnuclear supernatant. Further purification was achieved by isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients such that the majority (60%) of GFP-labeled phagosomes were located in fractions with a density of 1.16–1.19 g/ml (Fig. 3). These fractions contained 15% of total protein loaded on the gradient and appeared well separated from the remaining late endosomes and lysosomes that partitioned in fractions above the peak of green fluorescence and at the bottom of the gradient as assayed by β-hexosaminidase activity (Fig. 3). Fractions that displayed the highest GFP fluorescence and were significantly enriched in M. bovis BCG-containing phagosomes were used in further studies as MPC. Morphological analysis by electron microscopy of thin sections of the oriented pellets, from top to bottom to ensure complete representation of the contents of the gradient fractions corresponding to MPC, showed that the phagosomal membranes were intact and indicated little contamination with other subcellular organelles (Fig. 1, C–E).Figure 3Typical profile of vesicles from J774 macrophages with M. bovis BCG after isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients. The location of M. bovis-containing vesicles was followed by the fluorescence of GFP-labeled mycobacteria monitored by flow cytometry (35Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Distribution of late endosomes and lysosomes across the gradient was measured by β-hexosaminidase activity. The maximum GFP fluorescence corresponds to the fractions (fractions 6–8) enriched for M. bovis BCG phagosomes defined as MPC (see Figs. 1, C–E, and 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Samples of MPC, and LBC preparations generated as described previously (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, proteins transferred onto membranes under renaturing conditions, and GTP binding activity assessed by [32P]GTP overlay assay (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 37Deretic D. Huber L.A. Ransom N. Mancini M. Simons K. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MPC preparations showed several lowM r GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 4). The equivalent fractions prepared from uninfected macrophages did not contain any of the GTP-binding proteins in the basic region of the two-dimensional gel (data not shown). Although GTP binding patterns of MPC relative to LBC appeared nearly identical at 1 h postinfection (not shown), dramatic differences began to emerge at later time points (Fig. 4). Interestingly, differences were prominent in the basic region of the gels where the rab proteins of the endosomal pathway are located (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 44Huber L.A. Ullrich O. Takai Y. Lutcke A. Dupree P. Olkkonen V. Virta H. de Hoop M.J. Alexandrov K. Peter M. Zerial M. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7874-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Such proteins were persistently present in MPC preparations compared with the reduced GTP binding activity or its complete absence (168-h time point) in the basic region of the gels with LBC membranes (Fig. 4 D). Taken collectively, these observations were consistent with differential accumulation of a specific subset of GTP-binding proteins on MPC relative to LBC membranes. Next, we tested whether any previously characterized rab proteins were absent or retained on MPC compared with LBC membranes by immunoblotting (Fig. 5). Since the region on two-dimensional gels where the differences in GTP binding were most prominent coincided with the usual location of rab5 isomers and possibly of rab4 and rab7, corresponding antibodies were used to probe MPC and LBC membrane proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. A rab protein specific for the recycling endosomal compartment, rab4, was first tested. In these experiments, we could not detect rab4 on either LBC (consistent with the report by Desjardins et al. (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar)) or MPC, whereas it was detected in postnuclear supernatants (Fig.5 A). Next we confirmed the identity of one of the prominent GTP-binding proteins on MPC as rab5a (Figs. 4 C′ and 5C). The rab5 detected was not due to contaminating membranes based on the comparison of MPC 72 h postinfection (Fig.5 C, lane 1) with the corresponding fractions from uninfected cells (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). MPC appeared not only to maintain levels of rab5a but also to gain additional amounts at longer incubation time points (Fig. 4 C and 6B). The mean increase in GTP binding by rab5a from MPC membranes was 3-fold over 7 days as quantitated in a PhosphorImager. This was in contrast to LBC which, consistent with the findings of Desjardins et al. (26Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), showed a decrease of rab5a over time. When the amount of rab5a detected by Western blot analysis on LBC (Fig. 6 B) was normalized for the amount of membranes loaded (Fig. 6 A), rab5a content on LBC decreased between the 1-h and 168-h time points. Most importantly, very little rab7 was detected in MPC samples even 168 h postinfection, whereas LBC acquired rab7 by 1 h (Fig. 6 C). These results indicated that MPC maintained or increased their rab5 content but did not significantly intersect with the rab7-containing compartment.Figure 6GTP binding and protein immunoblot analysis of LBC and MPC indicating the presence of rab5 and the absence of rab7 in MPC samples. Equivalent amounts of phagosomes (with the exception of slightly overloaded LBC sample at 168 h) were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to Immobilon P membranes, and probed successively with [α-32P]GTP (panel A), affinity-purified antibody to rab5a (panel B), affinity-purified antibody against rab7 (panel C), and rat monoclonal antibody to Lamp2 (panel D). Note that thetop band of the apparent triplet on the GTP overlay (panel A) corresponds to the location of the polypeptide recognized by the antibody to rab5a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the possibility that infection with M. bovis BCG could affect the overall rab7 content of J774 cells, Western blots of whole cell extracts with antibodies against rab7 and actin (for standardization) were carried out and binding intensities quantitated by densitometry. The rab7 band in uninfected macrophage samples had an intensity of 157 ± 13.5 (for 3 days postinfection) arbitrary units compared with 141 ± 11.2 for BCG-infected macrophages (p value t test 0.4). In addition, no significant differences were observed in the distribution of rab7 across the gradient (Fig. 3) between BCG-infected and uninfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the presence of BCG does not alter the rab7 content of infected J774 cells and that the lack of rab7 on MPC reflects specific effects on the phagosomal compartment. Although MPC had no detectable rab4 (Fig. 5 A), transferrin receptor was detected on MPC both at 1 h (Fig. 5 B) and 72 h (data not shown). This observation can be best explained in light of the abundance of rab5 on MPC, compatible with the formal capacity for homotypic fusion within the early endocytic network. Lamps, the major membrane glycoproteins associated with lysosomes and late endosomes, were not present in appreciable quantities on MPC for the duration of the experiment, but they were present on LBC preparations at all time points tested as detected using anti-Lamp1 and anti-Lamp2 antibodies (data not shown and Fig. 6 D). The very low level of Lamp proteins observed on MPC compared with LBC was in agreement with the observations by Clemens and Horwitz (20Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In the case of rab7, ECL analysis of such blots indicated 146.8 ± 18.9 arbitrary units for LBC versus 15.8 ± 6.3 arbitrary units for MPC. These results are compatible with the interpretation that MPC have a severely reduced content of Lamp2 and rab7, an observation that could not be challenged by the purity of the preparations since any contamination with late endosomal and lysosomal membranes would contribute to the detection of rab7 and Lamp proteins (Fig. 6 C). To examine whether prior infection of host macrophage cells with M. bovis BCG can affect the distribution of rab proteins on subsequently formed phagosomes, we exposed macrophages sequentially toM. bovis and latex beads. Following infection with M. bovis and a 72-h incubation after internalization of the mycobacteria, macrophages were allowed to phagocytose latex beads for 1 h. After a chase period of 1 h, LBC were isolated, and rab profiles were examined by Western blots. Interestingly, LBC from preinfected cells showed different ratios of rab5 to rab7 than the matching LBC isolated from cells not previously exposed to M. bovis BCG (Fig. 7 A, lanes 2and 4). The abundance of rab7 relative to rab5 in the same samples changed from 129.4 ± 5.5% for beads alone (Fig. 7,lane 2) to 60.0 ± 8.9% in LBC from BCG-preinfected macrophages (Fig. 7, lane 4). Standard MPC preparations from infected cells with no addition of the beads were also analyzed at the same time (Fig. 7, lane 6). These results indicated that the preinfection with M. bovis BCG perturbed the physiological course of events and pos"
https://openalex.org/W1964606633,"The concentration of malonyl-CoA, a negative regulator of fatty acid oxidation, diminishes acutely in contracting skeletal muscle. To determine how this occurs, the activity and properties of acetyl-CoA carboxylase β (ACC-β), the skeletal muscle isozyme that catalyzes malonyl-CoA formation, were examined in rat gastrocnemius-soleus muscles at rest and during contractions induced by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. To avoid the problem of contamination of the muscle extract by mitochondrial carboxylases, an assay was developed in which ACC-β was first purified by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody. ACC-β was quantitatively recovered in the immunopellet and exhibited a high sensitivity to citrate (12-fold activation) and aK m for acetyl-CoA (120 μm) similar to that reported for ACC-β purified by other means. After 5 min of contraction, ACC-β activity was decreased by 90% despite an apparent increase in the cytosolic concentration of citrate, a positive regulator of ACC. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of both homogenates and immunopellets from these muscles showed a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of ACC, suggesting that phosphorylation could account for the decrease in ACC activity. In keeping with this notion, citrate activation of ACC purified from contracting muscle was markedly depressed. In addition, homogenization of the muscles in a buffer free of phosphatase inhibitors and containing the phosphatase activators glutamate and MgCl2 or treatment of immunoprecipitated ACC-β with purified protein phosphatase 2A abolished the decreases in both ACC-β activity and electrophoretic mobility caused by contraction. The rapid decrease in ACC-β activity after the onset of contractions (50% by 20 s) and its slow restoration to initial values during recovery (60–90 min) were paralleled temporally by reciprocal changes in the activity of the α2 but not the α1 isoform of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In conclusion, the results suggest that the decrease in ACC activity during muscle contraction is caused by an increase in its phosphorylation, most probably due, at least in part, to activation of the α2 isoform of AMPK. They also suggest a dual mechanism for ACC regulation in muscle in which inhibition by phosphorylation takes precedence over activation by citrate. These alterations in ACC and AMPK activity, by diminishing the concentration of malonyl-CoA, could be responsible for the increase in fatty acid oxidation observed in skeletal muscle during exercise.

Physiol. 1997; 272: E641-E648PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to affect the activity of ACC-β in skeletal muscle extracts, despite the fact that they produce substantial changes in malonyl-CoA content. Recent studies suggest that the rapid (min) increase in malonyl-CoA caused by insulin and glucose in incubated rat soleus muscle is caused by an increase in the cytosolic concentration of citrate, an allosteric activator of ACC and a substrate for its precursor, cytosolic acetyl-CoA (24Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Kurowski T.G. Apazidis A. Shafrir E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E641-E648PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in ACC activity due to phosphorylation may occur in skeletal muscle during voluntary exercise. Thus, Winder and Hardie (25Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that after 5 min of swimming, malonyl-CoA levels and ACC activity in rat skeletal muscle are diminished and the activity of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase is increased. Direct evidence that the decrease in ACC activity is due to phosphorylation is still lacking, however. In addition, it is unclear whether the observed decrease in ACC activity is a consequence of muscle contraction per seor a systemic effect of exercise. Finally, whether changes in the cytosolic concentration of citrate, such as those produced by insulin and glucose, continue to modulate ACC activity in muscle during exercise is not known. To examine these questions, ACC activity and tissue levels of citrate and malate, an antiporter for citrate efflux from the mitochondria, were assessed in control rat muscle and in muscle made to contract intensely by electrical stimulation. Because of difficulties in assaying ACC in frozen muscle due to the contamination of the extracts by other carboxylases (12Thampy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a novel method for studying ACC-β was developed, in which its properties and activity were assessed after immunopurification. The relationship between ACC activity and phosphorylation state was also addressed, as were the potential roles of the α1 and α2 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase isoforms in regulating ACC activity. All radiochemicals were obtained from DuPont NEN. Protein phosphatase 2A was purchased from Upstate Biochemical Inc. (UBI), and okadaic acid was purchased from Calbiochem. Agarose-Protein A/G plus conjugate was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase from Amersham Corp., and PVDF membranes (0.45 μm) from Millipore. For enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), luminol and p-coumaric acid were obtained from Sigma, and 30% H2O2was obtained from Fisher. X-ray films were Fuji RX. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 55–67 g were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). They were kept in the departmental animal house with a light-dark cycle of 6 p.m.–6 a.m. and were fed Purina rat chow ad libitum. In all studies, the rats were fasted for 18–20 h prior to an experiment. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (55 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally), and 45 min later the skin from both hindlimbs was removed, and the sciatic nerves were exposed. The right sciatic nerve was stimulated for 0–5 min with a bipolar electrode connected to a Grass stimulator (model S48) (5 pps, 100-ms trains of 2.5 V, 50 Hz, and 10-ms duration). The exposed muscle was kept moist with Ringer's solution maintained at room temperature. At various times following stimulation, the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles of the stimulated and unstimulated contralateral limbs were rapidly excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All tissues were stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Buffer A contained 30 mmNaHEPES, pH 7.4; 2.5 mm EGTA; 3 mm EDTA; 32% glycerol; 20 mm KCl; 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate; 40 mm NaF; 4 mmNaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 μmaprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Buffer B contained 30 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4; 2.5 mm EGTA; 3 mm EDTA; 70 mm KCl; 20 mm β-glycerophosphate; 20 mm NaF; 2 mm NaPPi; 1 mmNa3VO4; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 2 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate; 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 μm aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer C contained 30 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4; 2.5 mm EGTA; 3 mm EDTA; 32% glycerol; 30 mm KCl; 85 mm NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate; 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 μm aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer D contained 100 mm NaCl; 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4; 60 mm β-mercaptoethanol; and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Solution E contained 20 ml of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4; 10 μl of 30% H2O2; 200 μl of 250 mm Luminol; and 100 μl of 100 mm p-coumarate. (Note: luminol and coumarate were dissolved in 100% Me2SO and stored at room temperature protected from light.) Malonyl-CoA (26McGarry J.D. Stark M.J. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8291-8293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), citrate, and malate, were measured in perchloric acid extracts of frozen muscles as described elsewhere (24Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Kurowski T.G. Apazidis A. Shafrir E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E641-E648PubMed Google Scholar). For ACC and 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, frozen muscles were powdered under liquid N2, homogenized in buffer A, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatants were then diluted 1:1 with buffer B and centrifuged at 13,500 ×g for 12 min. The resultant supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation of ACC and AMPK and also for measuring ACC activity by the 14CO2 fixation assay. To assay ACC-β in immunoprecipitates, equal amounts of supernatant protein (500–700 μg) were incubated for 3 h with 2.5 μg of the monoclonal antibody 7AD3 (10Bianchi A. Evans J.L. Iverson A.J. Nordlund A.-C. Watts T.D. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 24 μl of agarose-Protein A/G plus beads. The beads were washed once in buffer B, twice in buffer B containing 250 mm NaCl, and once in buffer B. They were then assayed for ACC activity by the 14CO2fixation assay (15Witters L.A. Watts T.D. Daniels D.L. Evans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In selected experiments, the concentration of citrate or acetyl-CoA was varied. Results are expressed as pmol of14CO2 incorporated into acid-stable products per min per mg of extract protein subjected to immunoprecipitation. The AMPK was assayed against the SAMS peptide substrate, as in Ref. 27Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Tissue extracts were immunoprecipitated with nonimmune sera or with specific antisera directed against either the α1 or α2 catalytic subunits of the AMPK heterotrimer (28Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T. House C.M. Fernandez S.C. Cox T. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Following collection of the immunoprecipitates on Protein A/G beads and extensive washing, the immobilized enzyme was assayed under standard conditions in a 10-min assay. Peptide kinase activity in each sample was corrected both for apparent 32P incorporation in the absence of added substrate peptide and for apparent incorporation in nonimmune precipitates. Results are expressed as cpm of 32P incorporated per min per mg of extract protein subjected to immunoprecipitation. To assess the effect of dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases on ACC activity, muscles were homogenized in Buffer A or Buffer C (no phosphatase inhibitors) or Buffer C plus 50 nm okadaic acid. Supernatants, obtained after centrifuging the homogenates at 13,500 × g for 30 min, were incubated at 37 °C for 50 min with or without the addition of 100 mm sodium glutamate, 10 mmMgCl2. They were then diluted 1:1 with buffer B and centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 15 min. ACC was immunoprecipitated from the resultant supernatant, and its activity was assayed as described above. To examine the effect of dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) on ACC activity in vitro, muscles were homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatants were then diluted 1:1 with buffer B and centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 12 min. The resultant supernatants were used to immunoprecipitate ACC-β as described under “Metabolic and Enzyme Assays,” but with three additional washes with buffer D. Following the washes, the beads were incubated with 500 milliunits of PP2A (5 units/ml) at 37 °C for 2.5 h in the presence or absence of 100 mm sodium glutamate/10 mmMgCl2. As controls, the same incubations were carried out with the addition of 10 nm okadaic acid or with buffer D in the absence of PP2A. At the end of the incubations, the immunopellets were washed twice with buffer B and then assayed for ACC activity as described above. Samples were run overnight at 65 V on 6.4 or 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following the electrophoresis, the protein bands were transferred onto PVDF membrane at 70 V for 1 h and then at 100 V for 2.5 h using Towbin buffer containing 10% methanol and 0.01% SDS. The membranes were blocked with 0.5 mg/ml poly(vinyl alcohol) for 2 s and then probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for 20 min (1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.4% Tween 20). The membranes were washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Tween 20 and once with phosphate-buffered saline alone for 2 min. They were then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) by incubation for 90 s in freshly prepared solution E and exposure onto Fuji RX film for approximately 1 min. In agreement with previous results (4Saha A.K. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E283-E289PubMed Google Scholar, 29Duan C. Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), malonyl-CoA levels were diminished by 50% after 5 min of intense muscle contraction (1.9 ± 0.2 versus 0.9 ± 0.2 nmol/g of muscle, n = 4, p < 0.05). This was not attributable to a decrease in the cytosolic concentration of citrate, since the whole muscle cell concentration of citrate was increased (190 ± 16 versus 300 ± 34 nmol/g muscle, n = 4, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the concentration of malate, an antiporter for citrate efflux from the mitochondria, was also increased (280 ± 10 versus390 ± 28 nmol/g of muscle, n = 4,p < 0.05), suggesting the possibility of citrate redistributioon from mitochondria to cytosol (24Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Kurowski T.G. Apazidis A. Shafrir E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E641-E648PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to assay ACC activity directly in muscle supernatants were hindered by the presence of contaminating carboxylases, presumably pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) arising as a consequence of mitochondria breakage (Fig. 1 A). Thus, when acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was assayed by the 14CO2 fixation method in 100,000 × g supernatants obtained from frozen muscle extracts, a high but variable activity was noted in the absence of citrate (50–80% of total in different experiments), and activation by 10 mm citrate, an index of ACC activity, was modest (382 ± 63 versus 957 ± 78 pmol/min/mg,n = 4, p < 0.05). Supernatants from freshly homogenized muscles contained the same amount of ACC as did frozen muscles, as judged by streptavidin blots (data not shown), but less of the other carboxylases. They also exhibited less citrate-independent 14CO2 fixation activity and a relatively greater activation by 10 mm citrate (86 ± 29 versus 610 ± 48 pmol/min/mg, n = 4, p < 0.05), suggesting that the contaminating carboxylases account principally for the citrate-independent activity. To assay ACC in the absence of PC and PCC, a specific monoclonal antibody (7AD3) was used to immunoprecipitate ACC-β (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the antibody immunoprecipitated the majority of the ACC and left behind PC and PCC. Equally important, carboxylase activity toward acetyl-CoA in the immunodepleted supernatants was not increased by 10 mmcitrate, indicating that it was free of ACC activity (Fig.1 B). Nearly all (80–90%) of the citrate-dependent ACC activity present in the muscle supernatant was recovered in the immunoprecipitate, indicating that the antibody did not inhibit the enzyme. The immunopurified enzyme exhibited a Michaelis constant for acetyl-CoA (K m = 120 ± 4.2 μm) similar to that reported by others for ACC-β purified by conventional methods (10Bianchi A. Evans J.L. Iverson A.J. Nordlund A.-C. Watts T.D. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that immunoprecipitation with the 7AD3 antibody can be a simple alternative to more conventional techniques for purifying and assaying ACC-β. ACC activity in 7AD3 immunopellets, measured at close to physiological citrate levels (0.2 mm), was decreased by 90% after 5 min of intense muscle contractions (78 ± 9 versus 9.1 ± 4 pmol/min/mg). Similar decreases in activity were observed at all assay citrate concentrations (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the K 0.5 for citrate, which was 1.7 ± 0.12 mm (mean ± S.E.) for the control muscles, was increased to 2.6 ± 0.3 mm. Such decreases in the sensitivity and responsiveness of ACC to citrate are suggestive of increased enzyme phosphorylation (12Thampy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Witters L.A. Watts T.D. Daniels D.L. Evans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consistent with an increase in enzyme phosphorylation, the immunoprecipitated enzyme from stimulated muscle showed a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility when subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, B andC). To obtain more direct evidence that phosphorylation decreased ACC activity, muscles were homogenized in lysis buffer with or without the phosphatase inhibitors NaF, NaPPi, β-glycerophosphate, and Na3VO4, or without these phosphatase inhibitors but with okadaic acid present (another phosphatase inhibitor, see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3 A, homogenization in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors partially reversed the decrease in ACC activity caused by contractions, and it completely abolished it when the phosphatase activators glutamate and MgCl2 were added to the muscle extract (see “Experimental Procedures”). Incubation of extracts from control muscles with glutamate and MgCl2 in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors also enhanced ACC activity, although to a lesser extent. Under all conditions, these increases in ACC activity were prevented by 50 nm okadaic acid (Fig.3 A), confirming that they were due to the action of phosphatases. Similar results were obtained when ACC isolated from stimulated muscles was treated with PP2A. In these studies, immunopellets from lysates containing phosphatase inhibitors were washed with phosphatase buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) and then treated for 2.5 h with 500 milliunits of PP2A in the presence or absence of glutamate and MgCl2. As shown in Fig. 3 B, when PP2A was added to the immunopellets, it partially abolished the inhibition of ACC caused by electrical stimulation. This effect, like that of endogenous phosphatases, was greatly enhanced by the addition of MgCl2/glutamate and was inhibited by okadaic acid. The addition of MgCl2/glutamate alone to the immunopellets did not increase the activity of ACC, further suggesting that these agents work by activating a phosphatase. Also in keeping with this conclusion, treatment of immunoprecipitated ACC-β with PP2A eliminated the observed shift in its electrophoretic mobility caused by contraction (Fig. 2 C) in an okadaic acid-inhibitable manner. A logical candidate for regulating ACC phosphorylation during contraction is AMPK (25Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess its role, we compared the time course of changes in the activities of ACC and the α1 and α2 isoforms of AMPK during and after contraction. Immunoprecipitable ACC and α1 and α2 AMPK activities were measured after periods of contraction ranging from 5 s to 5 min. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the decrease in ACC activity was very rapid, with 50% inactivation evident by 20 s and near maximum (90%) inhibition in less than a minute. These changes were closely mirrored by reciprocal increases in α2 AMPK activity. The return of ACC and α2 AMPK activity to base-line values after the cessation of the contractions was slow (Fig. 4 B). Thus, ACC activity was still diminished by 50% 40 min poststimulation, and only after 1.5 h of recovery did it return to precontraction values. The return of α2 AMPK activity to precontraction values followed a similar pattern. In contrast, no detectable activation of α1 AMPK was observed during the course of stimulation. A transient activation of its activity poststimulation did not achieve statistical significance (p > 0.1). The results indicate that the activity of ACC and the concentration of malonyl-CoA in skeletal muscle decrease within seconds during intense contractions. They also strongly suggest that the decrease in ACC activity is secondary to phosphorylation, most probably due, at least in part, to activation of the α2 isoform of AMPK. In contrast, alterations in the cytosolic concentration of citrate, which acutely modulate ACC in muscle during changes in its fuel milieu (24Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Kurowski T.G. Apazidis A. Shafrir E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E641-E648PubMed Google Scholar), did not appear to play any role in the modulation of ACC activity during contraction. The potential relevance of these findings relates to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in muscle and the mechanism by which it is increased during and after exercise. Regulation of fatty acid oxidation by malonyl-CoA has been demonstrated in liver (1McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem.

When (Ca2+)4-calmodulin is bound to the indicator (K d = 0.4 nm), fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two fluorophores is attenuated; the ratio of the fluorescence intensity measured at 505 nm to the intensity measured at 440 nm decreases 6-fold. Images of microinjected living cells demonstrate that emission ratios can be used to monitor spatio-temporal changes in the fluorescence of the indicator. Changes in indicator fluorescence in these cells are coupled with no discernible lag (<1 s) to changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ ion concentration, ranging from below 50 nm to ∼1 μm. This observation suggests that the activity of a calmodulin target with a typical 1 nmaffinity for (Ca2+)4-calmodulin is responsive to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration over the physiological range. It is likely that the indicator we describe can be modified to detect the levels of ligands and proteins in the cell other than calmodulin.

Yet little is known about the extent and kinetics of enzyme activation in vivo, mainly because of the difficulty of directly monitoring target activation in the cell. Mitra et al. (5Mitra R.D. Silva C.M. Youvan D.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 173: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have recently reported that changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be used to monitor cleavage at a protease site within a linker amino acid sequence. We have designed a similar fluorescent indicator protein in which the GFP variants are linked by a CaM-binding sequence. This indicator exhibits a large CaM-dependent change in its fluorescence emission due to disruption of FRET when calmodulin is bound to the linker sequence. This response can be monitored in living cells, where it closely follows changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The vector for expression of FIP-CBSM is similar to the one described by Mitra et al. (5Mitra R.D. Silva C.M. Youvan D.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 173: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The coding sequences for the BGFP (6Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) and RGFP (7Delegrave S. Hawtin R.E. Silva C.M. Yang M.M. Youvan D.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 151-154PubMed Google Scholar) domains were produced by amplifying the GFP-encoding sequences in the BioBlue™ and BioYellow™ vectors obtained from PharMingen, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The vector pETIC, encoding a fluorescent indicator protein (FIP) control consisting of RGFP and BGFP domains joined by the linker sequence, GTSSGSSTGA, was generated first. The RGFP domain in pETIC is fused to the His6-tag/thrombin/S-tag/enterokinase leader sequence derived from pET30a (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The C terminus of the BGFP domain is fused to an additional His6 sequence, also derived from pET30a. The vector pETIC-1 encodes FIP-CBSM, which is identical to the FIP control, except that the linker has the sequence: GTSSRRKWNKTGHAVRAIGRLSSTGA. Boldface type denotes the CaM-binding sequence from avian smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (8Guerriero Jr., V. Russo M.A. Olson N.J. Putkey J.A. Means A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8372-8381Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For expression, pETIC and pETIC-1 were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells containing pETIC or pETIC-1 were grown at 23 °C to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, and protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. After incubating at 23 °C for ∼40 h, cells were harvested. Control FIP and FIP-CBSM were purified using His6 affinity chromatography essentially as described by Mitra et al. (5Mitra R.D. Silva C.M. Youvan D.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 173: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Vertebrate CaM expressed in E. coli was purified as described previously (9Persechini A. Blumenthal D.K. Jarrett H.W. Klee C.B. Hardy D.O. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8052-8058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of control FIP and FIP-CBSM were determined using an ε490 of 89 mm−1cm−1. Concentrations of FIP-CBSM stock solutions were verified by titration with a standard CaM solution. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International (Monmouth Junction, NJ) QuantaMaster™ photon counting spectrofluorometer. Reaction volumes (3 ml) were incubated at 30 °C in a stirred cuvette. Excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm. An excitation wavelength of 380 nm was used forin vitro measurements of FIP fluorescence. For most experiments, a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 0.1m NaCl, and 300 μm CaCl2, pH 7.5, was used. For experiments in which the free Ca2+ ion concentration was varied, a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm1,2-bis(2-amino-5,5′-dibromophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, pH 7.5, was used. Aliquots of standard CaCl2solutions were added to achieve various levels of free Ca2+ion, which were calculated using the MaxChelator program (10Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The FIP-CBSM fluorescence emission spectrum is essentially independent of the pH between 7.0 and 8.0, either in the presence or absence of bound (Ca2+)4-CaM. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) stably transfected with an epitope-tagged thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (11Yu, R., and Hinkle, P. M. (1997) Mol. Pharmacol., in press.Google Scholar) were grown on glass coverslips to 60–80% confluence, rinsed in Hank's balanced salt solution, and placed in a Sykes-Moore chamber maintained at 37 °C. Microinjections were performed on an Eppendorf Transjector 5246 equipped with a Micromanipulator 5171 using Femtotips from Eppendorf (Madison, WI). Microinjection solutions were centrifuged and filtered through 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filters and injected at pressures of 50–100 hectopascals for 0.1 s. Successful injections were visualized in brightfield and by observing at 530 nm the fluorescence of RGFP excited directly at 495 nm. After microinjection, cells were allowed to recover for at least 30 min. Dynamic measurements were performed using a Dage CCD72 camera and Geniisys image intensifier system (Michigan City, IN) and IMAGE-1/AT analysis software from Universal Imaging (Media, PA). Fura-2 340/380 fluorescence excitation ratios were obtained as described previously (12Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of FIP-CBSM and control FIP excited at 380 nm was measured at 500-ms intervals using a 510-nm emission filter. Still photographs were obtained with a Cohu CCD camera (San Diego, CA) and a 440A integrator (Colorado Video, Inc., Boulder, CO) and analyzed with Metamorph software from Universal Imaging. Cells were illuminated at 380 nm, and emitted light was collected for 10–20 s at 510 nm and then at 440 nm. We have designed a fluorescent indicator protein containing two green fluorescent protein variants, with reported fluorescence excitation and emission maxima of 382 and 448 nm (BGFP) (6Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) and 495 and 509 nm (RGFP) (7Delegrave S. Hawtin R.E. Silva C.M. Yang M.M. Youvan D.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 151-154PubMed Google Scholar), joined by an amino acid linker containing the CaM-binding sequence from smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (8Guerriero Jr., V. Russo M.A. Olson N.J. Putkey J.A. Means A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8372-8381Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We term this particular indicator FIP-CBSM. Excitation of the fluorophore in the BGFP domain at 380 nm results in fluorescence emission at 505 nm from the fluorophore in the RGFP domain due to FRET between the fluorophores. FRET is essentially eliminated when FIP-CBSM binds (Ca2+)4-CaM, and theF 505/F 440 ratio decreases from a value of 1.7 to a value of 0.3 (Fig. 1). FRET between the fluorophores in a control indicator protein lacking a CaM-binding sequence is not significantly affected by (Ca2+)4-CaM. FIP-CBSM binds (Ca2+)4-CaM with a K d of 0.4 nm, which is close to the 1 nm apparentK d value for the complex between (Ca2+)4-CaM and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (Fig. 2, A and B) (13Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Characterization of CaM binding by FIP-CBSM. A, titration of a mixture of 8.2 nm FIP-CBSM and 200 nm CaM with increasing concentrations of free Ca2+ ion. Data were fit to an equation of the form: F = α(L n)/(L n +K a), where F is the fractional saturation of FIP-CBSM with CaM, given in the figure as 1 − [(F −F min)/(F max −F min)], L is the free Ca2+ ligand concentration, K a is an apparent dissociation constant that depends upon the total amount of CaM, and n is the number of interacting sites, which equals 3.9 for the curve shown. This indicates that (Ca2+)4-CaM is the species bound by FIP-CBSM. F is the fluorescence measured at 505 nm, F max and F min are the values for F measured at maximal and minimal free Ca2+ ion concentrations, and α is a correction factor allowing adjustment of the maximal fraction of FIP-CBSMbound to give the best fit. α values are between 1 and 1.1 for the curves shown in panels A and B. B, binding of (Ca2+)4-CaM to FIP-CBSMat concentrations of 1.4 (▪) and 1.0 (▴) nm. The data measured at a 1 nm FIP-CBSM concentration were fit to a standard single-site kinetic model as described previously (20Persechini A. McMillan K. Leakey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16148-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data measured at a 1.4 nm FIP-CBSMconcentration were fit to an equation of the form: F = α{(P t + L t +K d) − [(P t +L t + K d)2 − 4(P t)(L t)]0.5}/2(P t), where L t is the total CaM concentration andP t is the total FIP-CBSMconcentration. In both cases a K d value of 0.4 nm was obtained. Emission spectra for titration of 1.4 nm FIP-CBSM with (Ca2+)4-CaM are shown in theinset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified GFP dimerizes in solution, and crystallographic data suggest that the two GFPs are in an antiparallel orientation with the chromophores ∼25 Å apart (14Ormo M.

Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling indicates that the linker sequence between the GFP domains in FIP-CBSM is long enough to allow them to interact in a similar manner. In the structures of the complexes between (Ca2+)4-CaM and the CaM-binding sequences in several targets, including smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, CaM enfolds the CaM-binding sequence forming a globular structure ∼ 40 Å in diameter (16Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Thus, when (Ca2+)4-CaM binds to the linker in FIP-CBSM, the inter-fluorophore distance is likely to be increased from ∼25 Å to ∼65 Å (Fig. 1). Since the efficiency of FRET is proportional to 1/r 6, where ris the inter-fluorophore distance, this would explain the reduction in FRET observed when FIP-CBSM binds (Ca2+)-CaM (17Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). CaM-dependent changes in FRET between the fluorophores in FIP-CBSM can be monitored in living cells, providing a view of free (Ca2+)4-CaM levels in the cell. We have microinjected FIP-CBSM, with or without equimolar CaM, into HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the Gq/11-coupled Ca2+-mobilizing receptor for TRH. We estimate an intracellular FIP-CBSM concentration in microinjected cells of 1–10 μm, similar to estimates for the intracellular concentrations of high-abundance CaM targets, such as smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (18Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of FIP-CBSMundoubtedly perturbs the balance between CaM and its targets. Coinjection of the indicator with equimolar CaM should help to restore it, but the exact mole ratio of CaM to its binding sites in the cell is unknown. The intracellular free Ca2+ ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) increases from below 50 nm, when cells are incubated in media containing BAPTA, to greater than 1 μm, when extracellular Ca2+ and ionomycin are added (data not shown). Corresponding fluorescence images show a clear Ca2+-dependent reduction in theF 510/F 440 ratios in cells injected either with FIP-CBSM alone or with FIP-CBSM and CaM. This indicates an increase in the fraction of FIP-CBSM bound to (Ca2+)4-CaM (Fig. 3). A greater reduction in theF 510/F 440 ratio is evident in cells injected with both FIP-CBSM and CaM. The basal fluorescence intensity of the RGFP acceptor (Fig. 3, Cand F) is brighter in some regions of the cell than others due to the distribution of the probe within the cells. Some cells were injected in the nucleus, some into the cytoplasm, and some into both nuclear and cytoplasmic regions. FIP-CBSM remained localized to the nucleus or cytoplasm in cells, depending upon its initial site of injection. The indicator, with a molecular mass of 63.4 kDa, would not be expected to move through nuclear pores, and such translocation was not observed. No systematic effort was made to compare the responses of the indicator in the nucleus and cytosol, although it is clear that similar responses occur in these compartments (Fig. 3). Ca2+-dependent changes in the 510/440 emission ratio measured in cells suggest microheterogeneity in the response that may be artifactual, perhaps reflecting small changes in cell shape occurring during data collection. Investigations of a possible physiological basis for the apparent microheterogeneity are clearly a high priority. To more precisely establish the kinetics and magnitude of the FIP-CBSM response to changes in [Ca2+]i, the F 510 of microinjected cells was measured at 500-ms intervals, while [Ca2+]i was manipulated (Fig. 4). Reductions in F 510 mirror increases in [Ca2+]i caused by addition of TRH, Ca2+, and ionomycin with no discernible lag (<1 s) (Fig.4). Measurements using Fura-2 indicate that basal [Ca2+]i in these cells is below 50 nm; it increases to 200–400 nm with TRH and to greater than 1 μm with the combination of external Ca2+ and ionomycin. In cells injected with equimolar FIP-CBSM and CaM, the combination of Ca2+ and ionomycin causes a 30% reduction in F 510. This appears to represent the saturated response of the indicator, since it is reached and maintained when [Ca2+]i is still increasing (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of cells injected with FIP-CBSM alone with TRH causes a ∼6% reduction inF 510; the combination of Ca2+ and ionomycin causes a ∼10% reduction (Fig. 4 B). Thus, saturation of the FIP-CBSM response is not approached in these cells, indicating that the CaM concentration is limiting. The maximum fractional reduction in the F 510 of FIP-CBSM observed in cells was 30%, or about half of the maximal 65% CaM-dependent reduction inF 510 measured in vitro (Fig. 1). Given the very different experimental systems used for measurements of fluorescence in vitro and in vivo, this difference in the maximal signals appears acceptable. The amount of probe injected was kept low to minimize perturbation of Ca2+-CaM homeostasis. A consequence is that fluorescence filters with bandwidths of ∼40 nm were required to obtain an adequate fluorescence signal. In contrast, the monochromator bandwidths used forin vitro measurements were about 3 nm. Some of the small discrepancy between in vitro and in vivomeasurements of CaM-dependent changes in indicator fluorescence may therefore be attributable to the different optical systems used. Our results clearly indicate that changes in [Ca2+]i ranging from below 50 nm to ∼1 μm are coupled to changes in theF 510 of FIP-CBSM. This suggests that the activity of a calmodulin target with a typical 1 nmaffinity for (Ca2+)4-calmodulin is responsive to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration over the physiological range. It also suggests that physiological changes in [Ca2+]i are coupled to changes in the free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration in the low nanomolar range. The free concentrations of (Ca2+)4-CaM occurring in the cell are therefore ∼1000-fold less than the total concentration of CaM (18Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the calmodulin concentration in the cell is limiting; essentially all the (Ca2+)4-CaM present in the cell must be bound to targets, as has been proposed based on studies of the intracellular mobility of tagged CaM (19Gough A.H. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The very low physiological levels of free (Ca2+)4-CaM indicate that small changes in the affinity of a typical target should significantly affect its level of activity at a submaximal [Ca2+]i, as recently demonstrated for smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase activity (18Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to monitor free (Ca2+)4-CaM levels in living cells provides an exciting new approach for dissecting the processes that link variations in [Ca2+]i to diverse cellular responses. Indeed, FIP-CBSM appears to represent a new class of ligand-dependent indicators that have the potential of reporting the levels of a variety of proteins and other ligands in the cell, depending upon the nature of the linker sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2034280103,"Cathelicidins are the precursors of potent antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mammalian species. Prior work has suggested that members of this gene family can participate in host defense through their antimicrobial effects and activate mesenchymal cells during wound repair. To permit further study of these proteins a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction approach was used to identify potential mouse homologs. A full-length 562-base pair cDNA clone was obtained encoding an NH2-terminal prepro domain homologous to other cathelicidins and a unique COOH-terminal peptide. This gene, namedCramp for cathelin-relatedantimicrobial peptide, was mapped to chromosome 9 at a region of conserved synteny to which genes for cathelicidins have been mapped in pig and man. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kilobase transcript that was expressed in adult bone marrow and during embryogenesis as early as E12, the earliest stage of blood development. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction also detected CRAMP expression in adult testis, spleen, stomach, and intestine but not in brain, liver, heart, or skeletal muscle. To evaluate further the expression and function of CRAMP, a peptide corresponding to the predicted COOH-terminal region was synthesized. CD spectral analysis showed that CRAMP will form an amphipathic α-helix similar to other antimicrobial peptides. Functional studies showed CRAMP to be a potent antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting growth of a variety of bacterial strains (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.5–8.0 μm) and by permeabilizing the inner membrane of Escherichia colidirectly at 1 μm. Antiserum against CRAMP revealed abundant expression in myeloid precursors and neutrophils. Thus, CRAMP represents the first antibiotic peptide found in cells of myeloid lineage in the mouse. These data suggest that inflammatory cells in the mouse can use a nonoxidative mechanism for microbial killing and permit use of the mouse to study the role such peptides play in host defense and wound repair. Cathelicidins are the precursors of potent antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mammalian species. Prior work has suggested that members of this gene family can participate in host defense through their antimicrobial effects and activate mesenchymal cells during wound repair. To permit further study of these proteins a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction approach was used to identify potential mouse homologs. A full-length 562-base pair cDNA clone was obtained encoding an NH2-terminal prepro domain homologous to other cathelicidins and a unique COOH-terminal peptide. This gene, namedCramp for cathelin-relatedantimicrobial peptide, was mapped to chromosome 9 at a region of conserved synteny to which genes for cathelicidins have been mapped in pig and man.

Endogenous antimicrobial peptides play an important role in innate immunity (1Martin E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

More than 100 microbicidal peptides have been isolated from plants and animals (4Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). The role of these defense peptides in mammals has been inferred from their expression in neutrophil granules and at sites exposed to multiple microbes such as the skin and gastrointestinal tract. To exert their antimicrobial effect these peptides adhere to and permeabilize the surface membranes of potential pathogens. This activity is a consequence of several common features such as a high content of basic residues and the tendency of some to adopt an amphipathic conformation. However, antimicrobial peptides show marked diversity in structure and antimicrobial spectrum. One class of antimicrobial peptides, the cathelicidin-derived peptides, contains a highly conserved prepro region that is homologous to cathelin, a putative cysteine-proteinase inhibitor originally isolated from pig leukocytes (5Ritonja A. Kopitar M. Jerala R. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cathelicidins have been identified in several species including pig, cow, sheep, rabbit, and man (6Agerberth B. Lee J.Y. Bergman T. Carlquist M. Boman H.G. Mutt V. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

A. 1995; 92: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of their cathelin domain suggests that the members of this family evolved from a common ancestor gene through duplication and modification (7Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In general, the precursors of these peptides are stored in neutrophil granules. Upon stimulation, the cathelin domain is cleaved proteolytically to allow the mature COOH-terminal antimicrobial peptide to be released. The antimicrobial portion of the cathelicidin-derived gene family is highly diverse in terms of structure and function. In the pig, the cathelicidin PR-39 has been found to have potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and also to function as a stimulator of syndecan-1 and -4 expression on fibroblasts and endothelia (14Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Observations of functions beyond antimicrobial activity have also been made for other host defense peptides (15Murphy C.J. Foster B.A. Mannis M.J. Selsted M.E. Reid T.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and suggest the need for further study of the role these peptides play in vivo. The mouse is a highly useful animal model to study the function of the immune system in events such as wound repair and cutaneous inflammation. Surprisingly, despite the well characterized immune system in the mouse, antimicrobial peptides have only been identified in the mouse intestine (16Yount N.Y. Wang M.-S.C. Yuan J. Banaiee N. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4476-4484PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.W. Cano-Gauci D.F. Nosek M.T. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect.

Thus, in this investigation we sought to identify a mouse member of the cathelicidin gene family and describe its expression and antimicrobial function. We report a full-length cDNA sequence derived from mouse marrow which is a member of the cathelicidin gene family. This gene, named Cramp, forcathelin-relatedantimicrobial peptide, mapped to a single region on murine chromosome 9, homologous to the map locations of cathelicidins in man and pig. Transcripts for Cramp were expressed in multiple mature tissues and during embryogenesis. Finally, CRAMP protein was identified by immunostaining in murine bone marrow cells and neutrophils and behaved structurally and functionally as a potent antimicrobial agent. Amino acids and coupling reagents for peptide synthesis were from PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) and Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). HPLC-grade acetonitrile, 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dichloromethane, andN,N-dimethylformamide were from Lab-Scan (Dublin, Ireland). Trifluoroacetic acid, N-methylmorpholine, and trifluoroethanol were from Janssen Chimica (Beerse, Belgium).o-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Sigma. Mueller-Hinton broth, Bacto-agar, dextrose, mycological peptone, and yeast extract powder were from Unipath Ltd (Basingstoke, U. K.). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Total RNA was extracted from C57BL/6 mouse femoral marrow cells with guanidinium thiocyanate (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). To isolate potential murine cDNA homologs to the cathelin-related antimicrobial peptides, a 5′ and 3′ RACE strategy was applied (Life Technologies, Inc.; 3′ and 5′ RACE systems, Gaithersburg, MD). For 3′ RACE, cDNA synthesis was carried out using adapter primer 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC(T)17-3′. Amplification toward the 3′ end was done first with the universal amplification primer 5′-(CUA)4GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′ and with a cathelin-specific primer-1, 5′-TCGGAAGCTAATCTCTAC-3–3′, which was designed based on a base pairs 165–182 sequence of porcine prepro-PR-39. A second nested amplification was then done with a cathelin-specific primer-2, 5′-(CAU)4CTGGACCAGCCGCCCAAG-3′ designed based on base pairs 195–212 of prepro-PR-39 and the universal amplification primer. For amplification toward the 5′ end, the gene-specific primer-1, 5′-TTTGCGGAGAAGTCCAGC-3′, based on a sequence derived from 3′ RACE, was used for cDNA synthesis. Amplification was done with an anchor primer, provided by Life Technologies, Inc., and with a gene-specific primer-2, 5′-(CAU)4GAAATTTTCTTGAACCG-3′. Products of 3′ and 5′ RACE were cloned into pAMP1 for sequencing by automated sequencer (model 373A, Perkin-Elmer) in both directions using primers against M13 and T7. Three independent clones were sequenced in both directions. Northern blot analysis of total RNA was performed as described previously (14Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of total RNA was extracted from whole C57BL/6 mouse embryos at different gestational ages and separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont NEN). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C in QuikHyb Solution (Stratagene) and probed using [32P]dCTP random primer-labeled cDNA, corresponding to base pairs 79–249 of murine CRAMP cDNA. Filters were washed twice for 15 min in 2 × SSPE (0.18 m NaCl, 0.01 mNa2H2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature and then twice in 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 55 °C. Total RNA from marrow, testis, stomach, small intestine, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, brain, heart, spleen, kidney, and large intestine of 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice was prepared with guanidinium thiocyanate (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA from each tissue was annealed at 42 °C with random hexamers in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The annealed hexamers were then extended by adding dNTP at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, 1.5 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison), and 1 unit of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 90 min. The resulting cDNA was then amplified with the specific primers 5′-GCTGATGTCAAAAGAATCAGCG-3′ and 5′-TCCCTCTGGAACTGCATGGTTCC-3′, based on base pairs 10–32 and 357–378, respectively, of the CRAMP cDNA sequence. These primers were used with the following thermal cycle profile: 95 °C for 5 min; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and a final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min. A second round of PCR was performed with nested primers 5′-CTGTGGCGGTCACTATCACT-3′ and 5′-GTTCCTTGAAGGCACATTGC-3′ based on base pairs 49–68 and 291–310, respectively, of the CRAMP cDNA sequence. Amplification conditions were as above, but a higher annealing temperature of 58 °C was used. Products were separated on 3% agarose gel and photographed using Eagle Eye apparatus (Stratagene). Solid phase peptide synthesis of CRAMP-1 was done on a Milligen 9050 synthesizer (Milligen, Bedford, MA). The synthesis was performed using Fmoc-l-Glu(OtBu)-PEG-PS resin (0.2mmol/g) andN,N-dimethylformamide as solvent. Couplings were carried out with a 6-fold excess of an equimolar mixture of Fmoc-amino acid, N-hydroxybenzotriazole, and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in the presence of N- methylmorpholine. Deprotection from the Fmoc group was performed with piperidine,N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, andN,N-dimethylformamide (1:2:2, v/v) in the presence of 0.7% (v/v) 1,8-diazabicyclo (5,4,0) undec-7-ene. To improve yield, the column temperature was increased to 45 °C, the resin was washed withN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone/N,N-dimethylformamide/dichloromethane (1:1:1, v/v) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2-methylencarbonate immediately before each coupling step, and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole and O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate replaced N-hydroxybenzotriazole and TBTU for the coupling of residues 7–11, 15–18, and 24. CRAMP-2 was obtained by elongation of CRAMP-1. Amino acid side chains were protected with trityl (Gln, Asn), t-butyloxycarbonyl (Lys),t-butyl (Glu, Ser), and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl (Arg). Peptide deprotection and cleavage from the resin were carried out using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/ethandithiol/phenol/water/triisopropylsilane (90:4:2:2:2, v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After cleavage, both peptides were extracted repeatedly with ethyl ether and purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 Delta-Pak column (Waters, Bedford, MA), using a 0–60% water/acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide concentration was measured by the absorbance of Phe at 257 nm and using a molar extinction coefficient of 195 (20Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mass determinations were performed with an API I ionspray mass spectrometer (PE SCIEX, Toronto, Canada). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Peptide samples (10–25 μm) were dissolved in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the absence or presence of 15, 30, and 45% (v/v) trifluoroethanol. The α-helical content was estimated by the method of Chen et al. (21Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar) from the [θ]222measurements, using −1,500 and −39,500 (1–2.5/n) deg-cm2 dmol−1, as the values for 0% and 100% of helix, respectively, with n indicating the number of residues. Antibacterial and antifungal minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by a microdilution susceptibility test described previously (9Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3142-3146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, ML-35 and D21,Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Pseuodomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Serratia marcescens ATCC 1800,Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Cowan 1, and two methicillin-resistant clinical isolates carrying the mecA gene (provided by L. Dolzani, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Trieste, Italy),Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, and Bacillus megaterium BM 11. The MIC values were determined after incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. The antifungal activity was determined using clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. The assay conditions were similar to those used for bacteria, except that the fungal species were grown and tested in Sabouraud liquid medium, and the MIC was determined after incubation at 30 °C for 36–48 h. The bactericidal activity of CRAMP-1 and CRAMP-2 against midlog phase cultures of E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosaATCC 27853, and S. aureus ATCC 25923 was tested in low ionic strength buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Bacteria (0.4–0.6 × 106 colony-forming units/ml) were incubated in the absence (controls) or in the presence of different amounts of peptides in a 96-well microtiter plate (final volume of 150 μl). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, samples were serially diluted with sterile PBS, plated in duplicate on Mueller-Hinton agar, and incubated for 16–18 h to allow colony counts (9Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3142-3146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial inner membrane permeabilization was evaluated with theE. coli ML-35 strain as described previously (22Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to synthetic CRAMP-1 were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by an initial intramuscular injection of 150 μg of CRAMP-1 in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by five booster injections of 150 μg of CRAMP in incomplete Freund's at 3-week intervals. Serum was collected 10 days after boosting. 4 × 105Swiss-Webster mouse bone marrow cells in 100 μl of PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, or 5 × 106 C57BL/six peripheral blood cells in Tris-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA, were attached to glass slides by cytospin at 400 × g for 5 min in a Shandon Cytospin 3 cytocentrifuge, fixed in methanol, then blocked for 1 h with a solution of 5% goat serum in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were then incubated for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-CRAMP antiserum or nonimmune rabbit serum. To confirm specificity of antibody binding, parallel slides were treated identically with rabbit-anti CRAMP serum that had been preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml synthetic CRAMP-1. Following primary antibody incubation slides were washed three times for 5 min in PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:250 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC). Each slide was washed three times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline. Coverslips were mounted with Prolong 228 Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and cells photographed with Kodak Elite II Ektachrome ASA400 film on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Cramp was mapped by analysis of the progeny of two multilocus crosses: (NFS/N or C58/J × Mus m. musculus) × M. m. musculus (23Kozak C.A. Peyser M. Krall M. Mariano T.M. Kumar C.S. Pestka S. Mock B.A. Genomics. 1990; 8: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and (NFS/N ×M. spretus) × M. spretus or C58/J (24Adamson M.C. Silver J. Kozak C.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Progeny of these crosses have been typed for over 1000 markers including the Chr 9 markers TRF (transferrin), Gnatl (guanine nucleotide-binding protein, α transducing subunit), Scn10a(peripheral sodium channel 3, subunit 10), and Cck(cholecystokinin) as described previously (25Ibaraki K. Kozak C.A. Wewer U.M. Albrechtsen R. Young M.F. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Kozak C.A. Sangameswaran L. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 787-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Data were stored an analyzed using the program LOCUS developed by C. E. Buckler (NIAID, Bethesda, MD). Recombinational distances and S.E. were calculated according to Ref. 27Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Macmillan, New York1981Crossref Google Scholar. Genes were ordered by minimizing the number of recombinants. To isolate potential murine homologs to the family of antimicrobial peptides related by a cathelin-like domain, primers were designed using sequence information from the conserved cathelin-like domain of the porcine gene PR-39. A nested RACE PCR strategy was used, capitalizing on the highly invariant cathelin-like prepro domain from all species studied to date. Three independently derived clones were sequenced in both directions to give the cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 1. No other related cDNAs were identified by this approach despite screening more than 500 clones for isolates related by the 5′ cathelin domain but distinct in the 3′ region. The murine cathelin-related cDNA contains an open reading frame of 516 base pairs and encodes a predicted translation product of 172 amino acids. Sequence comparisons between the prepro regions of the predicted murine (CRAMP) pig (PR-39) and human (FALL-39) cathelicidins identify significant primary sequence similarities; the murine protein maintains 52% identity with PR-39 and FALL-39 in the cathelin-like domain and 80% identity with either individually (Fig. 2). This sequence similarity includes the conservation of cysteines at positions 83, 94, 105, 122 and potential processing sites at the carboxyl terminus of the cathelin portion of the peptide. The previously reported cDNA sequences of human FALL-39 and porcine PR-39 encode different peptides in the 3′ region. Similarly, the predicted translation product of CRAMP is distinct in this region. To evaluate the expression of Cramp mRNA in the mouse, RNA was extracted from whole murine embryos isolated at various gestational ages and from whole adult mouse tissues. Northern blot of total RNA from whole embryos demonstrated abundant 1-kilobase message (Fig. 3, A and B) mRNA was detectable as early as gestational days 12 and 13 and increased relative to ribosomal RNA during development. In adult tissues, this transcript was detectable by Northern blot analysis only in marrow total RNA (data not shown). To increase the sensitivity for detection in adult tissues, a reverse transcriptase-PCR strategy was employed. Total RNA from brain, heart, spleen, kidney, testis, colon, liver, marrow, stomach, small intestine, lung, and skeletal muscle was prepared, and reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using nested primers to specifically amplify cDNA. As a control for all reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments, primers selected for β-actin were chosen, and reactions were included lacking either RNA or reverse transcriptase. Cramp transcripts were detectable in spleen, testis, colon, marrow, stomach, and small intestine (Fig.3 C). Faint bands corresponding to Cramp were also seen in heart, lung, and skeletal muscle but were not detectable in brain, kidney, and liver. All samples were positive with actin-specific primers and negative when performed in the absence of RNA or reverse transcriptase. Using the probe spanning base pairs 79–249 of Cramp, we identifiedScaI fragments of 10.2 kilobases in parental M. musculus DNA, 11.7 in NFS/N and C58/J, and 14.2 in M. spretus. Inheritance of the variant fragments was typed in the progeny of two sets of genetic crosses and compared with inheritance of more than 1000 genetic markers previously typed and mapped in these mice. CRAMP showed linkage to markers on distal Chr 9 (Fig.4) and was positioned just distal to Gnat1. This region of mouse Chr 9 is homologous to human 3p23-21, consistent with the location of the human homolog of this gene,Fall-39. The translation products of the cathelicidins are processed to release carboxyl-terminal peptides with antimicrobial activity. To investigate the properties of the carboxyl-terminal peptide predicted by the CRAMP cDNA, two peptides were synthesized. The first peptide, CRAMP-1, was prepared based on the predicted elastase cleavage site at position 138–139 and is a 33-amino acid peptide. The second, CRAMP-2, was prepared based on potential processing at the dibasic site at position 133–134 and is a 38-amino acid peptide. Helical wheel projections of both CRAMP-1 and CRAMP-2 predict that these peptides will form an amphipathic helix similar to that for FALL-39 (13Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and non-cathelin-related antimicrobial peptides such as the maganins and cecropins. To evaluate this directly, circular dichroism (CD) spectral analysis of CRAMP-1 and CRAMP-2 was done (Fig. 5). The spectra of 10–25 μm synthetic CRAMP-1 in buffer suggest that the peptide is in a random coil configuration and that it will assume a helical structure in the presence of 15–45% (v/v) trifluoroethanol. The CD spectra of CRAMP-2 (not shown) were similar to CRAMP-1. The capacity of CRAMP-1 and CRAMP-2 to function as antimicrobial agents was evaluated directly on a variety of microbes (Table I). Both peptides demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values in the range of 0.5–8.0 μm. CRAMP peptides were less active against Gram-positive strains (MIC 32–64 μm) and not active at the concentrations tested against P. vulgaris, C. albicans, and selected strains of S. aureus. The CRAMP peptides were also found to have potent direct bactericidal activity when assayed in low ionic strength buffer (Table II). Under these conditions even the Gram-positive bacterium (S. aureus) was killed at concentrations as low as 1 μm.Table IAntimicrobial activity of CRAMP-1 and CRAMP-2Organism and strainMICCRAMP-1CRAMP-2μmEscherichia coli ATCC 2592211Escherichia coli ML3522Escherichia coli D210.50.5Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 1402888Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2785344Serratia marcescens ATCC 810044Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315>64>64Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 259233232Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I3232Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)>64>64Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)6464Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 122281616Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 292123216Bacillus megaterium Bm1144Candida albicans>64>64Cryptococcus neoformans1616MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of peptide preventing visible growth after incubation with bacteria for 18 h or with fungi for 36–48 h.

https://openalex.org/W1994651714,"Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (FN) triggers a number of intracellular signaling events including the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic focal adhesion protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) and also the stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) associates with integrin receptors, and FN-stimulated phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 and Tyr-925 promotes the binding of Src family PTKs and Grb2, respectively. To investigate the mechanisms by which FAK, c-Src, and Grb2 function in FN-stimulated signaling events to ERK2, we expressed wild type and mutant forms of FAK in human 293 epithelial cells by transient transfection. FAK overexpression enhanced FN-stimulated activation of ERK2 ∼4-fold. This was blocked by co-expression of the dominant negative Asn-17 mutant Ras, indicating that FN stimulation of ERK2 was Ras-dependent. FN-stimulated c-Src PTK activity was enhanced by wild type FAK expression, whereas FN-stimulated activation of ERK2 was blocked by expression of the c-Src binding site Phe-397 mutant of FAK. Expression of the Grb2 binding site Phe-925 mutant of FAK enhanced activation of ERK2, whereas a kinase-inactive Arg-454 mutant FAK did not. Expression of wild type and Phe-925 FAK, but not Phe-397 FAK, enhanced p130Cas association with FAK, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, and Grb2 binding to Shc after FN stimulation. FN-induced Grb2-Shc association is another pathway leading to activation of ERK2 via Ras. The inhibitory effects of Tyr-397 FAK expression show that FAK-mediated association and activation of c-Src is essential for maximal signaling to ERK2. Moreover, multiple signaling pathways are activated upon the formation of an FAK·c-Src complex, and several of these can lead to Ras-dependent ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.

Evidence is accumulating for a facilitating role of Src family PTKs in signal transduction events involving both Pyk2 and FAK. In PC12 cells, where Pyk2 is calcium-activated (18Lev S. Moreno H.

In fibroblasts, FN stimulation induces the activation and redistribution of c-Src to focal contact structures (30Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E.

Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although integrin-initiated signaling to ERK2 is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton and may also involve the activation of the Rho family of small GTPases (5Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D.

Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and both Raf-1 and ERK2/mitogen-activated protein kinases of the Ras cascade are activated by integrin stimulation (4Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting reports as to whether Ras is essential for ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In two studies the dominant negative Asn-17 mutant of Ras was found to block FN-mediated ERK2 activation in NIH3T3 cells (3Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 37Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, there may be more than one signaling pathway upstream of Ras, since antibody-mediated clustering of integrins in suspended cells can generate signals to ERK2 in the absence of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (37Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), whereas presentation of fibroblasts to an insoluble FN matrix stimulates FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, transient c-Src association, and Grb2 binding in a time course that parallels ERK2 activation. 2D. D. Schlaepfer and T. Hunter, submitted for publication. 2D. D. Schlaepfer and T. Hunter, submitted for publication. In this study we tested the role of FAK in FN-stimulated signaling events to ERK2. In human 293 epithelial cells, FAK overexpression enhanced c-Src kinase activity and FN-stimulated signaling to ERK2, whereas dominant negative Ras expression blocked ERK2 activation without affecting FAK tyrosine phosphorylation or c-Src activity. Expression of Phe-397 FAK did not stimulate c-Src kinase activity and blocked integrin signaling to ERK2. Thus, we find that Src family PTK and Ras activation events are required for maximal signaling to ERK2 after FN stimulation. Further, we provide evidence that FAK·c-Src complexes may be connected to multiple signaling pathways involving p130Cas, Shc, and Grb2. Monoclonal antibodies to c-Src (mAb 2–17) and to the hemagglutinin epitope tag (anti-HA, mAb 12CA5) were kindly provided by J. Meisenhelder (The Salk Institute) as mouse ascites fluid. Polyclonal antisera to p130Cas (anti-Cas2) and to Shc were generously provided by H. Hirai (University of Tokyo) and P. van der Geer (Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto), respectively. Polyclonal ERK2 antibody (C-14) and polyclonal c-Src antibody (Src-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal Grb2 antiserum was generated to a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 23 residues of human Grb2 as described (27Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

The mouse FAK cDNA containing a triple-HA epitope tag at the FAK C terminus was kindly provided by Steve Hanks (Vanderbilt University). The various FAK constructs used were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector as described (27Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

HA-tagged p42 ERK2 in pLNC was a generous gift from M. Weber (University of Virginia). Murine Asn-17 Ras was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pZIPneoAsn-17 Ras using the sense (5′-AAAATCGATATGACAGAATACAAGCTT-3′) and antisense (5′-TTTATCGATTCAGGACAGCACACA-3′) oligonucleotides. The 588-base pair product was digested with ClaI, cloned into pBluescript KS−, and the sequence was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Asn-17 Ras was expressed by subcloning into theXhoI/BamHI sites of the pCLXSN eukaryotic expression vector (39Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Hass M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human kidney epithelial 293 cells attached to plastic cell culture dishes pre-coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine were transfected by standard calcium phosphate methods using either 5 μg of pcDNA3-FAK constructs, 10 μg of pCLXSN Asn-17Ras, or 1 μg of pLNC ERK2 per 10-cm dish (2 × 106 cells) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. After 18 h, the precipitate was removed by washing with PBS, and the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 24 h prior to cell lysis or FN-replating experiments. Human 293 cells were harvested by limited trypsin/EDTA treatment (0.01% trypsin, 2 mm EDTA in PBS). The trypsin was inactivated by soybean trypsin inhibitor addition (0.5 mg/ml), and cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and held in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell culture dishes (10 cm) were pre-coated with FN purified from bovine plasma (10 μg/ml, Sigma) or poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then rinsed with PBS and warmed to 37 °C for 1 h. Suspended cells were distributed onto ligand-coated dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish), and after 30 min at 37 °C, the attached cells were rinsed in PBS (4 °C) and lysed in 0.75 ml of modified RIPA lysis buffer (see below). Total cell protein in lysates was determined through a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad) and standardized prior to further analyses. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmNaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and antibodies were added to lysates for 3 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were collected with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads, and protein complexes were washed at 4 °C in Triton-only lysis buffer (RIPA lysis buffer without SDS and sodium deoxycholate) followed by washing in HNTG buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) prior to direct analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, 10% acrylamide) or in vitro 32P labeling. Immunoblotting was performed as described (27Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Briefly, blots were incubated with either 1 μg/ml anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) monoclonal or anti-Src (Src-2) polyclonal antibodies, 1:5000 dilution of anti-HA tag (12CA5), and 1:1000 dilutions of either Grb2, Shc, or p130Cas antiserum for 2 h at room temperature. Bound primary antibody was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection. Membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in 70 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 150 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 65 °C for 30 min. Prior to reprobing with different primary antibodies, stripped membranes were washed extensively in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and placed in blocking buffer (TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin) overnight. In vitro ERK2 kinase activity was measured after isolation with antibodies to the HA tag from ∼500 μg of total cell protein in RIPA lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates (IPs) were washed twice in Triton lysis buffer, once in HNTG buffer, once in ERK2 kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2), and 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) was added to each IP. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP to 20 μm (10–20 μCi/nmol [γ-32P]ATP), incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and stopped by the addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the phosphorylated MBP was resolved on a 15% acrylamide gel. The bands were visualized by autoradiography and cut from the gel, and the amount of 32P incorporated was determined by Cerenkov counting. HA-tagged FAK did not phosphorylate MBP in vitro. To measure c-Src kinase activity, endogenous c-Src was isolated by IP (mAb 2–17 covalently coupled to protein G-agarose as described (27Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar)) from ∼500 μg of total 293 cell protein in RIPA lysis buffer. The IPs were washed twice in Triton lysis buffer, once in HNTG buffer, once in enolase kinase buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and 2.5 μg of acid-denatured enolase was added to each IP. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP to 20 μm(10 μCi/nmol [γ-32P]ATP), incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and stopped by the addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and products were resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel. The enolase band was visualized by autoradiography and cut from the gel, and the amount of 32P incorporated was determined by Cerenkov counting. FAK did not appreciably phosphorylate enolasein vitro. To test the role of FAK in adhesion-mediated signal transduction events to ERK2, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create single-site phenylalanine replacements of FAK tyrosine residues (397, 407, 861, and 925) that have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (23Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

Mutagenesis was also used to produce a kinase-inactive FAK Arg-454 mutant (24Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Xing Z. Chen H.C.

HA-tagged wild type (WT) or mutant FAK constructs, HA-tagged ERK2, and a dominant negative Asn-17 mutant of Ras were transiently expressed from cytomegalovirus promoter-driven eukaryotic expression vectors in human 293 epithelial cells that were either serum-starved (Fig. 2, lanes 1–6) or serum-starved and FN-stimulated (Fig. 2, lanes 7–12).Figure 2Ras-dependent FN-initiated and FAK-stimulated signaling to ERK2. A, whole 293 cell RIPA lysates resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and analyzed by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 mAb to the HA epitope tag. The 293 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were either serum-starved (lanes 1–6) or serum-starved and then FN-replated for 30 min (lanes 7–12). B, anti-HA (12CA5 mAb) IPs were made from ∼1 mg of the total 293 cell RIPA lysates shown inpanel A, and ERK2 activity was measured by in vitro kinase (IVK) assays (20 μCi/nmol [γ-32P]ATP) with myelin basic protein (MBP). The 32P-labeled MBP (top panel) was quantitated by Cerenkov counting, and average values from two separate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since both the FAK and ERK2 constructs were HA-tagged, FAK expression and ERK2 gel shifts were monitored simultaneously by immunoblotting whole cell lysates with the 12CA5 mAb (Fig. 2 A), and HA-tagged ERK2 activity was measured in 12CA5 mAb IPs using an in vitro phosphorylation assay (Fig. 2 B). In serum-starved cells, there was a low basal level of ERK2 activity that was stimulated ∼5-fold by expression of the Δ1–100 FAK construct, which is highly tyrosine-phosphorylated and exhibits elevated association with c-Src (27Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). WT FAK overexpression enhanced ERK2 activity ∼3-fold (Fig.2 B), and the extent of FAK-induced ERK2 activity was correlated with the extent of FAK Tyr(P) levels (data not shown). Co-expression of Asn-17 Ras had no effect on FAK Tyr(P) levels (data not shown), but its expression inhibited Δ1–100 and WT FAK-induced ERK2 activation in serum-starved cells (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and6). Activation of the endogenous integrin signaling pathways in the transfected 293 cells by FN replating was sufficient to stimulate exogenously expressed ERK2 (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and8), whereas poly-l-lysine control replating did not result in ERK2 activation (data not shown) (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 27Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). FN stimulation led to an ∼8-fold activation, whereas FN replating coupled with FAK overexpression led to an ∼20-fold stimulation of ERK2 compared with the basal serum-starved activity level (Fig. 2 B). This FAK-enhanced FN stimulation of ERK2 is consistent with FAK activation after FN stimulation (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 15Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Asn-17 Ras blocked both the endogenous and FAK-stimulated FN-dependent increases in ERK2 activity, whereas it did not affect the FN-mediated increases in FAK Tyr(P) levels as evidenced by the doublet of Δ1–100 FAK bands (Fig. 2 A, lane 10) and confirmed by anti-Tyr(P) blotting of FAK IPs (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that the lower level of transient Asn-17 Ras expression driven by the vector pZIPneo with a long-terminal repeat promoter did not significantly block FN-stimulated ERK2 activation (data not shown). By placing the Asn-17 Ras construct into a vector with a cytomegalovirus promoter (pCLXSN), transient Asn-17 Ras expression was significantly elevated compared with pZIPneoAsn-17 Ras (data not shown) leading to inhibition of FN and FAK-stimulated signaling to ERK2 (Fig. 2). Our studies are consistent with the reported Ras dependence of integrin signaling to ERK2 (3Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol.

Since previous studies have shown that integrin-activated FAK transiently associates with Src family PTKs (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

Src kinase activity as measured by in vitro phosphorylation of acid-denatured enolase was low in lysates from serum-starved 293 cells and was increased 2-fold by the expression of Δ1–100 FAK (Fig. 3, lane 2), and this stimulation was not significantly affected by the expression of Asn-17 Ras (Fig. 3,lane 3).

It mediates transfer of lipid from HDL to cells via selective lipid uptake, a mechanism distinct from receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. SR-BI is expressed most abundantly in steroidogenic tissues (adrenal gland, ovary), where trophic hormones coordinately regulate its expression with steroidogenesis, and in the liver, where it may participate in reverse cholesterol transport. Here we have used immunochemical methods to study the structure and subcellular localization of murine SR-BI (mSR-BI) expressed either in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells or in murine adrenocortical Y1-BS1 cells. mSR-BI, an ∼82-kDa glycoprotein, was initially synthesized with multiple high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide chains, and some, but not all, of these were processed to complex forms during maturation of the protein in the Golgi apparatus. Metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitate and [3H]myristate demonstrated that mSR-BI was fatty acylated, a property shared with CD36, another class B scavenger receptor, and other proteins that concentrate in specialized, cholesterol- and glycolipid-rich plasma membrane microdomains called caveolae. OptiPrep density gradient fractionation of plasma membranes established that mSR-BI copurified with caveolin-1, a constituent of caveolae; and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that mSR-BI colocalized with caveolin-1 in punctate microdomains across the surface of cells and on the edges of cells. Thus, mSR-BI colocalizes with caveolae, and this raises the possibility that the unique properties of these specialized cell surface domains may play a critical role in SR-BI-mediated transfer of lipids between lipoproteins and cells.

HDL particles bind to cell surface receptors, but the intact particles are neither transported to lysosomes nor degraded (hydrolyzed). Instead, the core cholesteryl esters are selectively transferred into cells, and the lipid-depleted apolipoprotein-containing shell is released into the extracellular fluid, a process known as selective cholesterol uptake (5Glass C.

The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying selective cholesterol uptake from HDL have not yet been determined.

Topologic studies of CD36 in conjunction with sequence analysis indicate that human CD36 has two transmembrane domains, which sit adjacent to relatively short cytoplasmic N-terminal (∼6–8 residues) and cytoplasmic C-terminal (6 residues) domains (23Greenwalt D.E.

This raises the possibility that if SR-BI, like CD36, were concentrated in caveolae, these specialized membrane domains might play a role in SR-BI-mediated lipid transport. In the current study, we have examined the structure of murine SR-BI (mSR-BI) and the possibility that this receptor is concentrated in caveolae. Immunochemical techniques were used to examine the synthesis and posttranslational processing of mSR-BI, and cell fractionation and immunofluorescence methods were used to assess its subcellular localization. Most experiments were performed using transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing murine SR-BI (ldlA[mSR-BI] cells), and key findings were confirmed by analysis of the endogenous mSR-BI expressed in a murine adrenocortical cell line, Y1-BS1. As has been observed for CD36, mSR-BI was extensivelyN-glycosylated, with the mature protein containing both complex as well as hybrid and/or high mannose chains, and it was fatty acylated; mSR-BI was labeled with both [3H]palmitate and [3H]myristate. In addition, mSR-BI copurified with caveolin-1 in a low density plasma membrane fraction and colocalized with caveolin-1 in punctate microdomains across the surface of cells and on the edges of cells.

We show here that the SH3 domain of amphiphysin, but not a mutant SH3 domain, bound with high affinity to a single site in the long proline-rich region of human dynamin I, that this site was distinct from the binding sites for other SH3 domains, and that the mutation of two adjacent amino acids in dynamin I was sufficient to abolish binding. The dynamin I sequence critically required for amphiphysin binding (PSRPNR) fits in the novel SH3 binding consensus identified for the SH3 domain of amphiphysin via a combinatorial peptide library approach: PXRPXR(H)R(H).

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) of the wild type SH3 domain fragment and a primer partially matching its 3′ end (5′-ACG ATG AAT TCA ATC TAA GCG TCG GGT GAA GTT CTC TAG AAA GAG GCG TTT GTA GGT GGC-3′), which included two base changes resulting in the substitution of two amino acids at position 684 (glycine to arginine) and 687 (proline to leucine), were used in polymerase chain reactions using the wild type SH3 domain as the template. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into pGEX2T and expressed using the Escherichia colistrain BL21 as a GST-fusion protein. A polyhistidine human dynamin deletion construct missing the entire proline-rich domain (amino acid 1750) was expressed in the pET23c vector (Novagen). GST and GST-fusion proteins containing either the full-length proline-rich domain (PRD) or the COOH-terminal truncated forms of this domain (see Fig. 2 A) were expressed in pGEX2T. The construct harboring point mutations at positions 835 (arginine to aspartic acid) and 836 (proline to alanine) (Fig. 3, construct 5) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using mutant primers. All dynamin constructs were partial sequences of the human dynamin isoform Iaa (11Sontag J-M. Fykse E.M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Liu J-P. Robinson P.J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Whereas the NH2-terminal primer for most constructs was the same (5′-GGC GGA TCC AGC ACG CCC ATG CCC CCG- 3′), the COOH-terminal primer used to construct the dynamin-PRD GST-fusion proteins (see Figs. 2 A and3 A) was as follows: full-length PRD, 5′-C GGG AAT TCC GTC GAA GGG GGG CCT GGG-3′; 751–848 (Fig. 2 A, construct 4), 5′- C GGG AAT TCC ACC CGA TCG GCT GGG GAC C -3′; 751–832 (Figs. 2 A and 3 A, construct 5), 5′-C GGG AAT TCC CAC CTG AGG GGG AGG GCC-3′; 751–815 (Fig. 2 A,construct 6), 5′-C GGG AAT TCC CAC GGG GGG CGC CCC CCC-3′; 751–798 (Fig. 2 A, construct 7), 5′-C GGG AAT TCC AGG GCC CCG CGA CCC GGG-3′; 751–783 (Fig. 2 A,construct 8), 5′-C GGG AAT TCC GCG CTG CGG CGT GGG GC-3′; 751–838 (Fig. 3 A, construct 2), 5′-GC GCC GGG AAT TCC GCG GTT GGG GCG CGA GGG CAC C-3′; 751–838mut (Fig.3 A, construct 3), 5′-GC GCC GGG AAT TCC GCG GTT GGC GTC CGA GGG CAC C-3′; 751–827 (Fig. 3 A, construct 6), 5′-CGG GAA TTC CGC CGA AAG GGT CAG GGG-3′.

Recombinant proteins to be used as adsorbents were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). 50 μl of saturated beads were incubated with 1 ml of soluble protein extract (10 mg/ml total protein) for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with incubation buffer and eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 (GST proteins), or 250 mm imidazole (His-dynamin). Proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE gels and reacted by Western blotting with various antibodies using the 4-chloro-1-naphthol reaction method. GST-dynamin fusion proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with His-amphiphysin (20 μg/ml) in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was then processed for bound amphiphysin immunoreactivity as described for Western blotting. An oriented peptide library (MAXXXXPXXPXXXAKKK, where Xindicates all amino acids except Cys and Trp) synthesized as described (28Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.

GST-amphiphysin SH3 domain fusion protein, preadsorbed on glutathione-Sepharose beads, was incubated with the peptide library (1 mg) in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HP04, 2 mm KH2P04, pH 7.2), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The peptides retained were eluted with 30% acetic acid, lyophilized, resuspended in distilled water, and sequenced as a mixture. To determine the relative selectivity of amino acids at each degenerate (X) position, the sequences of bound peptides were compared with those of control experiments using GST alone (28Songyang Z.

The GST-SH3 domain of amphiphysin was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose followed by anion exchange chromatography on a Protein-Pack Q 8HR column (Waters) using a 0–350 mm NaCl gradient in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). 90 μg of purified protein was labeled with 125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific radioactivity of the labeled protein was determined as 1.772 × 106 cpm/μg, which corresponds to 7.974 × 107 cpm/nmol. A GST-fusion protein comprising the full-length proline-rich domain (PRD) of dynamin was coupled to Ultralink Biosupport medium (Pierce) at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. The radiolabeled GST-SH3 domain of amphiphysin was incubated with 5 μl of PRD beads in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation in the Eppendorf microcentrifuge and washed twice with ice-cold reaction buffer. The radioactivity of the supernatant of the centrifugation (free) and beads (bound) was determined using a γ-radiation counter. Specific binding was determined as the difference in binding in the absence and presence of a 100-molar excess of unlabeled amphiphysin SH3 domain. The affinity constant was calculated from the slope of the Scatchard plot of the binding data. Preparation of total tissue homogenates and SDS-PAGE were performed according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Protein was measured using the BCA and Coomassie Plus protein assay kit (Pierce). To determine whether the binding of amphiphysin to dynamin I is critically dependent on the classical SH3 domain binding interface, we generated a mutant amphiphysin SH3 domain harboring point mutations at amino acid positions 684 (glycine to arginine) and 687 (proline to leucine). Each of these two mutations were found to abolish the binding properties of the SH3 domains of the Grb2Sem5Drk protein (31Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). GST-fusion proteins comprising either the wild type or the mutant amphiphysin SH3 domains were incubated with brain extracts, and the proteins that selectively bound to these constructs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein staining. As shown in Fig. 1, both dynamin I and synaptojanin were specifically affinity-purified by the wild type but not by the mutant SH3 domain. To identify the binding site for amphiphysin SH3 domain in dynamin I, a variety of dynamin I deletion constructs were generated (Fig.2,A and B), and their ability to affinity-purify amphiphysin from brain extract was assessed by Western blotting of the affinity-purified material (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C (lane 3), a GST-fusion protein containing the entire proline-rich domain of dynamin I binds amphiphysin, while GST alone or a truncated form of dynamin I missing the entire proline-rich region does not (Fig. 2, Band C, lanes 1 and 2), confirming that the interaction is mediated as expected by the proline-rich region of dynamin I. Progressive deletion of the COOH-terminal portion of the proline-rich region of dynamin I defined the segment comprising amino acids 832 and 848 as essential for amphiphysin binding (Fig. 2, comparelanes 4 and 5). Since amphiphysin is the major band selectively enriched in the material, which is affinity-purified by constructs 3 and 4 (lanes 3 and 4 of Fig.2 B, arrows), these data also confirm that amphiphysin is indeed one of the major dynamin-binding proteins in rat brain. Further deletions within the proline-rich domain of dynamin I allowed definition of the sequence PSRPNR as the amino acid stretch required for the interaction (Fig. 3 A,constructs 2 and 5; Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 5). This result was corroborated by the demonstration that mutation of the arginine and proline within this segment into an aspartate and alanine, respectively (construct 3 of Fig. 3 A), also abolished amphiphysin binding (Fig.3 B, lane 3). A common characteristic of SH3 domain binding sites is the presence of the core motif PXXP, which is often followed by an arginine at position +5 (the first P of the core PXXP being position 0) in class II binding ligands for SH3 domains (32Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 33Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L.

A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Disruption of amphiphysin binding by the mutation of constructs 3 and 5 is therefore compatible with a binding of amphiphysin either to the sequence PSRPNR or to the overlapping sequence PQVPSR. However, amphiphysin was still able to bind (albeit less efficiently) to construct 4, which includes only the PSRPNR motif (Fig. 3 A, construct 4; Fig.3 B, lane 4), confirming the importance of this amino acid sequence. The less effective binding of the amphiphysin to this construct is not surprising since there is evidence that SH3 domain binding can be modulated by amino acid sequences flanking the main SH3 domain binding site (34Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, all Grb2 binding activity was lost in constructs 4, 5, and 6, indicating that the PQVPSR motif is the major Grb2 binding site (Fig. 3 B). Mutation or deletion of the PSRPNR sequence did not decrease binding of the SH3-containing proteins PLC-γ1 (36Scaife R. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Margolis R.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B) and cortactin (37Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) (not shown), which therefore must bind to sequences NH2-terminal to this site. The crucial role of the PSRPNR region for the amphiphysin-dynamin I interaction was confirmed by overlaying blots of dynamin I constructs (Fig. 3 A) with recombinant polyhistidine-tagged amphiphysin (Fig. 3 C). This experiment rules out the possibility that the interactions revealed by affinity chromatography of brain extracts (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. 3 B) may be indirect. We next used a combinatorial peptide library approach to identify the preferred binding motif of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin and its relation to the binding region identified in dynamin I. A combinatorial peptide library was incubated with the GST-amphiphysin SH3 domain, and the consensus amino acid sequence that binds the SH3 domain was established by sequencing of the bound peptides (Fig.4). The consensus obtained was PXRPXR(H)R(H) in good agreement with the results of our binding studies. To determine the affinity of the interaction between the proline-rich domain of dynamin I and the SH3 domain of amphiphysin we tested a125I-labeled GST-SH3 domain of amphiphysin for its binding to immobilized GST-fusion protein comprising the proline-rich domain of dynamin I (construct 3 of Fig. 2 A). The results are shown in Fig. 5. They are consistent with a single-site binding model and demonstrate a high affinity interaction with a dissociation constant of 190 ± 10 nm. Since the putative preferred binding sites for amphiphysin and Grb2 are partially overlapping in the proline-rich domain of dynamin, we tested whether the SH3 domain of amphiphysin and Grb2 can compete for binding to dynamin I. As shown in Fig. 6, Grb2 prevented the binding of amphiphysin, confirming the close localization of the binding sites for these two proteins in the dynamin I molecule.Figure 6Grb2 competes with amphiphysin SH3 domain for binding to dynamin I. A GST-fusion protein comprising the proline-rich sequence of dynamin I (construct 3 of Fig.2 A) was incubated with 400 nm radiolabeled GST-amphiphysin SH3 domain in the absence (1) or presence (2) of 40 μm GST-Grb2-fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dynamin I contains a proline-rich COOH-terminal region of about 100 amino acids that interacts in vitro and in vivo with a variety of SH3 domain-containing proteins, including PLC-γ, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src, Grb2, and amphiphysin (15Gout I.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of the binding partners for this domain revealed by in vitro and in vivo studies may be explained by either a promiscuous interaction of various SH3 domains with several proline-rich stretches or by the presence in the tail of dynamin I of an array of distinct sites, each of which specifically binds certain SH3 domains. We report here that amphiphysin, a binding partner for dynamin I in nerve endings (19David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), binds with remarkable specificity and high affinity to a unique site in its long proline-rich domain. The sequence PSRPNR at the amino acid position from 833 to 838 was found to be critically required for amphiphysin binding. Strikingly, this sequence matches the consensus binding motif of the amphiphysin-SH3 domain very well as revealed by a combinatorial peptide library: PXRPXR(H)R(H). The only difference between the dynamin I binding site and this consensus is the presence of an alanine rather than an arginine at position +6 (see Fig.3 A). However, the position +6 is clearly not essential for dynamin I binding as shown by the similar binding of constructs 1 and 2 of Fig. 3 A. This is a novel SH3 binding consensus that would predict a class II type orientation of the peptide, given the presence of an arginine at the COOH-terminal side (position +5) of the core (32Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 33Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L.

A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We note that an amino acid sequence that fits the consensus PXRPXR is present in synaptojanin, the other major amphiphysin binding protein in brain (23McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.M. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The PSRPNR sequence is placed at the COOH-terminal end of a longer proline-rich stretch in dynamin I (Fig. 3 A) that contains the sequence PQVPSR. This sequence was recently reported to fit the consensus for binding to the NH2-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and to the SH3 domain of Src (35Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). While the core of these other consensus motifs is the PQVP sequence, our results suggest that the core of the amphiphysin binding site is located three amino acids closer to the COOH terminus and corresponds to the PSRP sequence. We do, however, provide support to the hypothesis that the PQVP motif represents the core of the major Grb2 binding site, which is consistent with the mapping of the Grb2 binding region in dynamin I reported by other groups (15Gout I.

Accordingly, the ability of Grb2 to compete with amphiphysin for binding to dynamin I supports a close localization of the binding sites for these two proteins. The sequence PSRPNR is clearly not required for the binding of dynamin I to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ, in agreement with previous results indicating that PLC-γ and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase bind to an amino acid sequence upstream of this region (amino acids 778–795) (15Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Troung O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 36Scaife R. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Margolis R.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a dynamin sequence including the PSRPNR site was proposed to be a PLC-γ binding site based on combinatorial peptide library data (35Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These results stress the importance of complementing information on SH3 domain consensus sequences obtained using small peptides with studies on longer protein stretches. These findings provide support to the hypothesis that the long proline-rich COOH-terminal region of dynamin I represents a template for the recruitment of different SH3-containing proteins via highly specific interactions mediated by distinct binding sites. The proline-rich domain of dynamin I undergoes phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (38Robinson P.J. Sontag J-M. Liu J-P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C.A. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is possible that the phosphorylation of specific amino acid positions may serve to selectively regulate the interactions of dynamin I with one or a subset of SH3 domains. Many of the SH3 domain-containing proteins that interact with dynamin I can also interact via distinct domains with proteins that are concentrated at plasmalemmal clathrin-coated pits. For example, PLC-γ, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2, also contains SH2 domains that bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors (39Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin interacts via a region distinct from its SH3 domain with the clathrin adaptor AP2 (19David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 24Wang L-H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The presence of binding sites for these various proteins in the tail of dynamin I may serve to guarantee an efficient recruitment of dynamin I at clathrin-coated buds (19David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) where dynamin I plays a key role in the fission reaction (13Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Conversely, due to its property of interacting with multiple SH3 domains dynamin I itself may serve to further recruit other SH3 domain-containing proteins in a positive feedback loop. In agreement with these considerations, we have recently shown that disruptions of the SH3-mediated interactions of dynamin in living nerve terminal preparations potently inhibits the fission reaction of clathrin-coated vesicles (40Shupliakov O Low P Grabs D Gad H Chen H David C Takei K De Camilli P Brodin L et al.Science. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a previous study has shown that an SH3 domain binding motif in dynamin I is required for its targeting to clathrin-coated pits in COS7 cells (41Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This motif was mapped to a site upstream to the sequence PSRPNR described here, which could be deleted without abolishing dynamin I targeting in these cells (41Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the SH3 domain of amphiphysin may play a dominant role in the recruitment of dynamin I at clathrin-coated pits involved in synaptic vesicle reformation, while other SH3 domain-containing proteins may play a dominant role at other types of clathrin-coated pits. The data here open the possibility of generating mutant dynamin I molecules that are selectively impaired in their property of binding the SH3 domain of amphiphysin and therefore studying the precise role of this interaction in nerve terminal function.

V189 has been expressed in wild type CHO-K1 cells and in glycosaminoglycan-deficient pgsA-745 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cells. It could be released from CHO-K1 cell membranes by heparin or a synthetic peptide designed on the sequence encoded by exon 6 but was freely released from CHO mutant cells. In both cases, the immunoreactive V189 was mainly released as a 40-kDa cleaved form, provided that the serine protease urokinase, but not plasmin, was active. Recombinant V189 was purified from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus as a nonmitogenic 50-kDa precursor that binds to the receptor Flt-1 but not to Flk-1. It could be matured by urokinase as a 38-kDa fragment able to bind to Flk-1 and to trigger cell proliferation. V165 and V189, however, could be cleaved by plasmin as 34-kDa fragments that exhibit a decreased mitogenic activity. These findings indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of V189 masks its binding domain to Flk-1.

Recombinant V189 was purified from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus as a nonmitogenic 50-kDa precursor that binds to the receptor Flt-1 but not to Flk-1. It could be matured by urokinase as a 38-kDa fragment able to bind to Flk-1 and to trigger cell proliferation. V165 and V189, however, could be cleaved by plasmin as 34-kDa fragments that exhibit a decreased mitogenic activity. These findings indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of V189 masks its binding domain to Flk-1.

Molecular cloning of human cDNA has shown that the factor is in fact composed of multiple species that are generated after alternative splicing of a single gene transcription product (9Keck P.J.

The transcript encoding the 165-amino acid form is expected to generate the 45-kDa peptide following signal peptide cleavage (V165). A shorter transcript encodes V121, which presents a 44-amino acid deletion between positions 116 and 159 when compared with V165. A longer transcript encodes a 189-amino acid isoform (V189) with a 24-amino acid insertion at position 116. This 24-amino acid peptide corresponds to exon 6 of the gene. A fourth molecular species, V206, identical to V189 but containing 17 additional codons following the 24-codon insertion appears only to be expressed in embryonal tissue (11Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The significance of these observations is not known in terms of bioactivity. Houck et al. (13Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that, contrasting with V165, which is secreted and freely soluble in the tissue culture medium, the bioavailability of the secreted 165 and more specifically of the 189 forms appears to be regulated by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix. This would provide a reserve of biologically active growth factor from which the V189 species could be released by heparin, heparan sulfate, and heparinase or through proteolysis following plasminogen activation. They also showed that both V165 and V189 were released from their bound states as 34-kDa dimeric species that were active as endothelial mitogens and as vascular permeability agents. Possible mechanisms for these biological activities would be the triggering of a protease cascade to digest the extracellular matrix and the activation of latent growth factors. Such a process has been described for transforming growth factor-β (14Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 109: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) and for pro-hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF). It has been shown that the maturation of pro-HGF into a bioactive dimer takes place in the extracellular environment under the influence of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) bothin vitro and in vivo (15Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G. Birchmeier W. Daikuhara Y. Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 16Naldini L. Vigna E. Bardelli A. Follenzi A. Galimi F. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 603-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and that this process constitutes a crucial limiting step in the HGF signaling pathway after its secretion. We studied the maturation process of V189 under the influence of plasmin or uPA, comparing Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) and related glycosaminoglycan-deficient pgsA-745 mutant cells permanently expressing the 189 isoform. In agreement with the data from Houcket al. (13Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we found that V189 was secreted but was entirely bound to the cell surface or the extracellular matrix of CHO-K1 cells. It could be released as 52- and 40-kDa fragments by heparin or a synthetic peptide designed on the sequence encoded by the exon 6. In contrast, we observed that V189 was directly released in the extracellular environment of heparan sulfate-defective cells as a biologically active 40-kDa fragment, suggesting that the 52-kDa precursor in such cell populations was readily accessible to a spontaneous maturation process from which it would be protected in CHO-K1 cells. V189 was expressed in insect cells and purified as 38- and 50-kDa proteins, which were compared with native V165 with respect to various biochemical and biological functions. Both forms bound to the VEGF receptor Flt-1, but the 50-kDa form could bind to the VEGF receptor Flk-1 and exert a mitogenic activity only after maturation by uPA or plasmin. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad, chromatography reagents were from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., and Na-125I was from Amersham Corp. Heparin was obtained from Choay, and aprotinin, leupeptin, and goat anti-chicken immunoglobulins conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate were from Sigma. α2-Antiplasmin was from Stago, and anti-urokinase monoclonal antibody was from American Diagnostics. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cell culture trays were from Costar. The clones pUC-121, pUC-165, and pUC-189 were obtained from Dr. J. Abraham (Scios-Nova, Mountain View, CA). Recombinant human V165 was produced from the conditioned medium of infected insect Sf9 cells using a a recombinant baculovirus expression system as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The purification procedure has already been described (1Plouët J. Schilling J. Gospodarowicz D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3801-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recombinant FGF2 was prepared inEscherichia coli as described (17Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrunn M. Lélias J.M. Liauzin P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P. Amalric F. Smith J.A. Caput D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine (45 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham. The peptides corresponding to the sequences 119–134 (Ex6P, RGKGKGQKRKRKKSRY) and 126–134 (Ex6sP, KRKRKKSRY) and a control scrambled peptide SP (RKGKRQKGRKGKSKYR) were synthesized by a solid phase technique and conjugated to keyhole limulus hemocyanin. 2 μg of V165 or V189 were iodinated with the iodogen procedure and separated from free iodine by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose as already described (18Plouët J. Moukadiri H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22071-22074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and averaged 150,000 and 85,000 cpm/ng, respectively. Polyclonal chicken antibodies were prepared by immunizing Wyandotte hens (19Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Weiser T. Hübscher V. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) with V121 produced in E. coli. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were obtained by serial injections of V165 or keyhole limulus hemocyanin-conjugated Ex6P in lymph nodes. The VEGF affinity column was prepared by mixing 1 g of CNBr-Sepharose equilibrated in 0.1m carbonate buffer, pH 8.5, with 1 mg of V165 overnight and then an additional 2 h with 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Antibodies were loaded on this column, and specific immunoglobulins were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5. The eluate was immediately neutralized and dialyzed against PBS, and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. Anti-FGF2 was prepared as already described (20Plouët J. Gospodarowicz D. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recombinant V189 was produced in Sf9 insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system. V189 expressing cells (108 cells) were extensively washed 3 days postinfection with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin; extracted in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate supplemented with 2 m NaCl and then adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl; and loaded on an SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography column, which had been equilibrated in the same buffer. After loading, the column was washed with the phosphate buffer adjusted to 0.4 m NaCl, and V189 was eluted with 1 m NaCl. This material was diluted twice, loaded on a heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography column, and eluted by a 0.5–1.5 m NaCl gradient. V189 was measured in the fractions by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described below. CHO-K1, parental wild-type CHO cells, and pgsA-745 mutant CHO cells presenting xylosyltransferase deficiency (21Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cDNA fragment corresponding to V189 was subcloned into a bicistronic eukaryotic expression vector, pR-EN, containing the Neo gene as a selective marker (22Jang S.K. Davies M.V.R. Kaufman J. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this construct, the VEGF cDNA is directly placed downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter element as a first open reading frame, and the Neo gene is directly placed downstream of the internal entry of the encephalomyocarditis virus mRNA as the second open reading frame. A phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter is positioned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter immediately after the transcription start. Cells were transfected with the resulting expression plasmids or the control plasmid using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by Brunette et al. (23Brunette E. Stribling R. Debs R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stable integrants were selected using 500 μg/ml G418, and cloning was carried out by colony isolation using a Pasteur pipette. Expression of specific mRNAs was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed RNA using a T7 promoter oligonucleotide and a reverse oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ end of the VEGF coding sequence. The conditioned media were prepared by exposing confluent cells to serum-free DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and 5 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin either alone or supplemented with 50 μg/ml heparin, synthetic peptides, anti-uPA IgG, α2 antiplasmin, or 5 μg/ml leupeptin or aprotinin. pgsA-745 CHO cells were also transfected with a mixture of 10 μg of psV-7d expression vectors carrying the Flt-1 or the Flk-1 coding sequences (24Quinn T.P.

Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of pSV2 expression vector carrying the neomycin resistance gene with the Lipofectin method as described above. Transformants were screened by their ability to specifically bind iodinated VEGF. Bovine endothelial cells cultured from adrenal cortex capillaries (ACE) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone. Stock cultures received 1 ng/ml of FGF2 every other day (26Gospodarowicz D. Massoglia S. Cheng J. Fujji D.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Subconfluent pSV-7d Flk-1- and pSV-7d Flt-1-transfected pgsA-745 cells were rinsed with cold binding buffer (DMEM supplemented with 2 mg/ml gelatin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), transferred to 4 °C, and incubated with various dilutions of unlabeled V165 or V189 in the presence of 5 ng/ml 125I-V165. After 2 h, the cells were washed three times with cold binding buffer and lysed with 0.5 ml of O.2 m NaOH. Solubilized material was counted in a γ counter. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 μg/ml of V165 and was less than 30%. In another set of experiments, ACE cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml of iodinated V165 or V189, either native or cleaved with plasmin or uPA, and treated as above. For proliferation assays, ACE cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well in 12-well cluster plates in 1 ml of culture medium. Increasing concentrations of growth factors were added every other day, and cells were trypsinized and counted on day 4. Neither the treatments used to cleave V165 or V189 (plasmin, uPA) nor leupeptin affected ACE cell proliferation at the concentrations used. VEGF content was measured in conditioned media by a radioreceptor assay already described (18Plouët J. Moukadiri H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22071-22074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the conditioned medium was performed by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels in 0.1% SDS followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), incubation was carried out with 0.2 μg/ml of anti-VEGF IgG, followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG serum conjugated with peroxidase. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed on 96-well dishes coated with 2 μg/ml immunopurified anti-V121 chicken Ig diluted in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and further blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the same buffer. Serial dilutions in TBST of V165 and V189 were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated an additional 1 h with 0.5 μg/ml of immunopurified anti Ex6P-IgG. Immunocomplexes were revealed with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by orthophenylene diamine substrate, and the optical density was read at 492 nm in a Dynatech Microlisa reader. Confluent V189- and control-transfected CHO K1 and pgsA-745 cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin and further incubated 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml of heparin or Ex6P. The cells were then resuspended for 1 h with 20 μg/ml purified chicken anti-VEGF antibody, rinsed, and further incubated with commercial goat anti-chicken immunoglobulins labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate diluted 1:80 in the same buffer. 35,000 cells were counted, and the fluorescence was analyzed with a Coulter Counter ELITE (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 522 nm). The addition of propidium iodide allowed the exclusion of nonviable cells. The tight binding was ascertained by the observation that negative cells supplemented with large amounts of membranes of lysed positive cells remained negative (27Loken M.R. Stall A.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 50: R85-R112Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). V165 or V189 were mixed with 10 units of uPA in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.8, for 1 h at 37 °C in siliconized tubes. In parallel experiments, iodinated proteins were mixed with 10 units of plasmin in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.2. The reaction was quenched, if desired, by the addition of 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Cleavage of proteins was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Human V189 mRNA was expressed in K1 and mutant CHO cells as judged by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ oligonucleotide complementary to the sequence of T7 and a 3′ oligonucleotide complementary to the distal sequence of VEGF (data not shown). No signal was detected in vector-transfected cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that untransfected K1 cells exhibited a mean fluorescence of <0.7 arbitrary units, whereas that of their transfected counterparts rose to 10.2 (Fig. 1). Incubation of the cells for 3 h at 4 °C in the presence of heparin or Ex6P led to a significant reduction of the signal (1.8 and 1.1 arbitrary units, respectively). No VEGF-like activity was detected by radioreceptor assay in the conditioned medium alone, whereas heparin and Ex6P released similar amounts of VEGF (Table I). The peptide Ex6sP containing a shorter sequence encoded by exon 6 released almost as much VEGF, whereas the isocationic scrambled peptide SP released one-third of the amount obtained with Ex6P, confirming that V189 cell association was dependent on both charge and sequence-specific interactions.Table IRelease of V189 from transfected CHO cell membranesK1pgsA-745ng/106cellsNoneND240 ± 21Heparin95 ± 8328 ± 14Ex6P110 ± 4358 ± 21Ex6sP90 ± 7345 ± 51SP40 ± 5254 ± 23Confluent CHO-K1 and pgsA-745 cells constitutively expressing V189 were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml heparin, Ex6P, Ex6sP, or SP, and the conditioned medium was collected 48 h later. VEGF content was assayed by a radioreceptorassay using ACE cells as target cells and iodinated V165 as tracer. VEGF was calculated by comparison with standard curves of recombinant V165 supplemented or not with the same concentrations of the modulators. No VEGF-like activity was detected in vector-transfected cells. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. ND, not detected. The experiment was repeated four times with similar results. Open table in a new tab Confluent CHO-K1 and pgsA-745 cells constitutively expressing V189 were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml heparin, Ex6P, Ex6sP, or SP, and the conditioned medium was collected 48 h later. VEGF content was assayed by a radioreceptorassay using ACE cells as target cells and iodinated V165 as tracer.

No VEGF-like activity was detected in vector-transfected cells. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. ND, not detected. The experiment was repeated four times with similar results. Two distinct peaks corresponding to 2.2 and 32.1, respectively, were detected by flow cytometry analysis in V189-transfected pgsA-745 cells (Fig. 1). The signal corresponding to the peak displaying the lower fluorescence intensity was shifted to the negative range, whereas the second remained detectable upon heparin or Ex6P treatments. VEGF-like activity was not detected in the corresponding conditioned medium (Table I). Heparin, Ex6P, and Ex6sP released a significant amount of VEGF-like activity, whereas SP was almost ineffective. Western blot analysis of the proteins in the conditioned medium showed that V189 migrated as two molecular species of 52 and 40 kDa (Fig.2). Interestingly, uPA inhibitors leupeptin and anti-uPA antibody prevented the release of V189 immunoreactivity, whereas plasmin inhibitors were inefficient. Parallel Western blots of cell-associated V189 showed that the less V189 was released, the more it remained cell-associated, confirming that protein synthesis was not affected by uPA or plasmin inhibitors. The addition of heparin to the cultures increased the total amount of immunoreactive V189 isoforms, regardless of plasmin inhibition (Fig. 2). In contrast, heparin induced the release of only the native 52-kDa form from urokinase-inhibited cells, confirming that V189 cleavage was not a prerequisite for cell release. To distinguish between the biological properties of the cleaved and the native forms, V189 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus carrying V189 cDNA. The cell lysate was subjected to cation exchange chromatography, and the V189 immunoreactivity eluted between 0.4 and 1.0 m NaCl was further purified by heparin affinity chromatography. V189 immunoreactivity was resolved in two molecular species eluted at 0.7 and 1.2 m NaCl whose molecular masses (38 and 50 kDa, respectively) were 2 kDa lower than those of the corresponding V189 isoforms observed in pgsA-745 CHO cells, probably due to different glycosylations occurring in mammalian and insect cells. The purified recombinant V189 50-kDa and V165 forms were then iodinated and subjected to serine protease cleavage and analyzed by autoradiography. No sign of self-activation of V189 or V165 could be detected. As shown in Fig. 3, plasmin generated an identical 34-kDa molecular species from both V165 and V189 (Pl-V189). The resulting peptides with an expected size of 12 kDa for V165 or 16 kDa for V189 were not visualized. uPA did not cleave V165 but generated a 38-kDa from V189 (uPA-V189). The purified 50- and 38-kDa V189 forms and the uPA-cleaved 38-kDa V189 were equally recognized in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using IgG directed against Ex6P, whereas Pl-V189 and V165 were not (Fig. 4).Figure 4Effects of V189 proteolytic processing on its immunoreactivity toward anti-Ex6P IgG. Various concentrations of V165 (•), 50-kDa V189 (▪), 38-kDa V189 (□), uPA-V189 (▵), or Pl-V189 (▴) were coated in microtiter plates in 50 mmcarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. 0.5 μg/ml of immunopurified anti-Ex6P IgG was added for 1 h at 37 °C, and the antigen-antibody complexes were revealed with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase. The complexes were detected by orthophenylene diamine. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the effects of mild plasmin or uPA cleavage of 50-kDa V189 by a radioreceptor assay using pgsA-745 CHO cells expressing constitutively Flt-1 or Flk-1 as target cells. Various concentrations of V165, 38- and 50-kDa V189, and the 34- and 38-kDa fragments generated by plasmin or uPA were tested for their ability to compete with the cell binding of iodinated V165 in the presence of 5 μg/ml of leupeptin to inhibit the putative cell maturation of V189. V165 and 38- and 50-kDa V189 forms competed almost equally to unlabeled V165. Radioiodinated V165 binding to Flt-1-expressing cells was half-maximally displaced by 47, 92, and 75 pm V165, 38-kDa V189, and 50-kDa V189, respectively (Fig.5 A). uPA cleavage did not affect the competing activity of V189 (IC50 = 68 pm), whereas plasmin reduced the competing activity 4-fold (IC50= 281 pm). Surprisingly, 50-kDa V189 was not able to displace iodinated V165 from Flk-1-expressing cells (Fig.5 B). 38-kDa V189 and uPA-V189 competed almost equally toward the binding of iodinated V165 to Flk-1-expressing cells (IC50 = 316 and 289 pm as compared with 184 pm for V165). In contrast, Pl-V189 was less potent than uPA-V189 (IC50 = 1,052 pm). To determine if V189 maturation could occur at the target cell level, bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml of various preparations of iodinated V189 (50-, 38-, and 34-kDa isoforms) at 4 or 37 °C for 2 h. The specific binding was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled 38-kDa V189 because its binding to Flt-1 and Flk-1 has been demonstrated in the previous experiments. As shown in Fig.6 A, V165 bound ACE cells slightly more at 4 than at 37 °C (360 and 270 pg/105 cells, corresponding to 4,900 and 3,700 sites/cell, respectively). Only a low amount of 50-kDa V189 and Pl-V189 bound to ACE cells (240 and 640 sites/cell, respectively) as compared with uPA-V189, which could bind to 3100 sites/ACE cell. The incubation of all of these V189 isoforms at 37 °C provided results similar to those obtained at 4 °C, suggesting that V189 maturation did not occur at the target cell level when added exogenously. Stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation was evaluated using the same target cell. Half-maximal stimulation of ACE cell proli"

Selective inhibition of these respective kinases with PD 098059 and SB 203580 indicated that p42 MAP kinase, but not p38 MAP kinase, contributed to the production of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α, and the release of arachidonic acid in these cells. Neither kinase, however, was essential for FcεRI-mediated degranulation or constitutive production of tumor growth factor-β. Studies with SB 203580 and the p38 MAP kinase activator anisomycin also revealed that p38 MAP kinase negatively regulated activation of p42 MAP kinase and the responses mediated by this kinase.

These cascades lead ultimately to secretion of intracellular granules, a response primarily driven by the increase in [Ca2+]i and activation of PKC (6Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M.

The activation of cPLA2 is dependent on increase of [Ca2+]i and phosphorylation by MAP kinase (2Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol.

Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 796-803PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulated mast cells also produce a variety of cytokines that include interleukins 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as well as TNFα and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (9Baumgartner R.A.

Eng. J. Med. 1993; 328: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Typically, increased expression of cytokine mRNA and protein is detectable 30 min to several hours after the addition of stimulant (11Gordon J.R. Burd P.R. Galli S.J. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 458-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These cytokines, particularly TNFα, are thought to mediate pathologic inflammatory reactions (10Galli S.J. N. Eng. J. Med. 1993; 328: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) and protective responses to bacterial infection (12Galli S.J. Wershil B.K. Nature. 1996; 381: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The production and release of TNFα are regulated through signals transduced by calcium and PKC, although there are indications that additional FcεRI-mediated signals may operate for optimal production of TNFα in cultured RBL-2H3 mast cells. Compared with antigen, other stimulants are relatively weak inducers of TNFα production when doses of stimulants are matched for maximal stimulation of degranulation (13Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). Also, concentrations of Ro31–7549 that block PKC, secretion of granules, and release of TNFα only partially block production of TNFα (13Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). The present objective was to determine whether stimulation of MAP kinases induces additional signals for production of TNFα. A linkage between these events has not been established in mast cells. Antigen-induced stimulation of p42 MAP kinase coincides with the activation of its upstream regulators, Ras, Raf, and MEK-1 (2Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol.

A J. Immunol. in press, 1997: 158Google Scholar). As noted in this paper, however, RBL-2H3 cells also possess the mammalian homologue of the yeast HOG-1 protein kinase, p38 MAP kinase. We have utilized the MEK-1 inhibitor, PD 098059 (15Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar), to evaluate the role of these MAP kinases in the production of TNFα and, for comparison, the release of arachidonic acid, degranulation, and production of TGFβ. Release of arachidonic acid is thought to be dependent on phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAP kinase, although the identity of the MAP kinase is uncertain (18Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27395-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Degranulation and TGFβ production were assumed to be MAP-kinase-independent responses (7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar, 19Baumgartner R.A. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4087-4093PubMed Google Scholar). We show that, while p42 MAP kinase regulated production of both TNFα and arachidonic acid, p38 MAP kinase negatively regulated the activation of p42 MAP kinase and the responses mediated by this kinase. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: all reagents for cell culture from Life Technologies, Inc.; ATP from Boehringer Mannheim; adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate tetra(triethyl-ammonium) salt and [14C]arachidonic acid from DuPont NEN; phenyl-Sepharose from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden); MAP kinase substrates (myelin basic protein and a myelin basic peptide, residues 94–102), polyclonal antibodies against the COOH-terminal peptide of rat MAP kinase R2 (erk1-CT), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, and p42 MAP kinase glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); polyclonal antibodies against p38 MAP kinase, MEK, and cPLA2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); TGFβ 1 kit and Factor-testTM Mouse TNF-α from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Ro31–7549 was obtained from LC Laboratories. The compounds PD 098059 and SB 203580 were synthesized in the Tsukuba Research Laboratories, Eisai Co., according to the procedures of Bridges et al. (20Bridge A.J. Saltiel A.R. et al.U. S. Patent.. 1995; 5: 525-625Google Scholar) and Adams et al. (21Adams, J. L. (1993) International Patent Application WO 93/14081Google Scholar), respectively, and purified by column chromatography and recrystallization. These compounds were determined to be >95% pure on the basis of high performance liquid chromatography and NMR analysis. The antigen, DNP-BSA, and O-dinitrophenol-specific monoclonal IgE were kindly supplied by Dr. Henry Metzger (NIAMS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The RBL-2H3 cell line was maintained in complete growth medium (minimum essential medium) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, glutamine, antibiotic, and antimycotic agents. Trypsinized cells were plated into 150-mm culture dishes or six-well Costar cluster plates and were incubated overnight in complete growth medium withO-dinitrophenol-specific IgE (0.5 μg/ml) and, for measurement of arachidonic acid release, [14C]arachidonic acid (0.1 μCi/ml). Cultures were washed the next day and replenished with the required medium. For the assay of hexosaminidase or [14C]arachidonic acid, experiments were performed in a PIPES-buffered medium (25 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 159 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.1% fatty acid-free fraction V bovine serum albumin). For [32P]phosphorylation of proteins, cultures were incubated for 90 min with 32P-labeled orthophosphate in PIPES-buffered medium exactly as described (7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar). For all other assays, experiments were performed in complete growth medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (for measurement of TNFα), 5% fetal calf serum (for measurement of TGFβ), or 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 (for assay of MAP kinases and separation of proteins by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis). The inhibitors were added either 30 min (PD 098059) or 15 min (SB 203580 and indomethacin) before stimulation of cultures with antigen (DNP-BSA) as described in the figure legends. Release of the granule marker, hexosaminidase, was determined by colorimetric assay of medium and cell lysates by previously described procedures (6Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of release of arachidonic acid, cells were labeled to equilibrium with [14C]arachidonic acid before the addition of inhibitors and antigen as described above. Reactions were terminated by placing cultures on ice and rapidly removing medium. The medium was briefly centrifuged (Beckman Microfuge for 30 s) to remove extraneous cells. Both medium and cell lysates (in 0.1% Triton X-100) were assayed for hexosaminidase (6Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and radiolabel (22Collado-Escobar D. Cunha-Melo J.R. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 244-250PubMed Google Scholar). Values were expressed as the percentage of intracellular hexosaminidase or radiolabel that was released into the external medium, and they were corrected for spontaneous release from unstimulated cells. It should be noted that, in RBL-2H3 cells, arachidonic acid is metabolized in part to leukotriene C4/B4 and prostaglandin D2 via the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways, respectively (23McGivney A.

Kaliner M.A. White M.V. Immunopharmacology. 1993; 25: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Release of radiolabel, as measured in this paper, was an estimate of total release of [14C]arachidonic acid and its metabolites. The cytokines were assayed as described elsewhere (19Baumgartner R.A. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4087-4093PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared by freezing and thawing the cultures three times. TGFβ was assayed with a human TGFβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, which utilized a mouse monoclonal anti-human antibody that cross-reacted with rat TGFβ. TNFα was assayed with a murine TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, which utilized a monoclonal hamster anti-murine antibody that reacted with mouse or rat TNFα and -β. The limits of detection for these assays were 25 pg of TGFβ/106 cells and 6 pg of TNFα/106 cells. Values were corrected for spontaneous release in the absence of stimulant (≤3% for release of hexosaminidase, ≤2% for release of arachidonic acid, and undetectable release of TNFα) except for TGFβ, which was produced constitutively in RBL-2H3 cells (19Baumgartner R.A. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4087-4093PubMed Google Scholar). After stimulation of cultures in six-well cluster plates, the cultures were washed once, and the medium was removed. The plates were then placed on ice before the addition of 510 μl of a Tris buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing three times. The lysate was centrifuged (15,800 × g for 10 min), and 450 μl of the supernatant fraction was mixed with 50 μl of ethylene glycol and 80 μl of washed phenyl-Sepharose. The phenyl-Sepharose was washed beforehand with 300 μl of the Tris buffer. The mixture was kept on ice for 5 min for binding of MAP kinase to the beads. After centrifugation, the phenyl-Sepharose beads were washed with 1 ml of 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and then with 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Finally, MAP kinase was eluted by incubating the beads with 75 μl of 60% ethylene glycol for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation of the suspension, 15 μl of supernatant was incubated (15 min, 30 °C) in a solution that contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol, 37 kBq/tube), and 25 μg of MAP kinase substrate peptide (peptide 94–102 of bovine myelin basic protein). The phosphorylated peptide was isolated by centrifugation of the incubation mixture through phosphocellulose membrane (SpinZyme; Pierce), which was then washed twice with 500 μl of 75 mmH3PO4 for the assay of radioactivity. p42 and p38 MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate polyclonal antibodies by procedures described elsewhere (2Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins from 5 × 106 cells were incubated in a MOPS buffer (25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) with Mg2+-[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi in 150 μm cold ATP, 25 μm MgCl2) and 5 μm myelin basic protein (18 kDa) as substrate in a final volume of 30 μl. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 12 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer. MEK was immunoprecipitated with anti-MEK antibody and assayed similarly except that p42 MAP kinase glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (1 μg/assay) was used as substrate for phosphorylation. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. The preparation of cell lysates and immunoprecipitates, analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE, and transfer to nitrocellulose paper were performed as described elsewhere (2Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar) with the following exception: cPLA2 was separated on NOVEX 10% Tris/glycine gels for 3 h at 35 mA and 4 °C as described by Kramer and co-workers (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Previously described procedures were used for isolation and detection of [32P]MEK (7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise, proteins were detected by the immunoblotting technique with antibodies against MEK, p42 MAP kinase, cPLA2, or anti-phosphotyrosine. Secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG or mouse IgG. Finally, proteins were visualized by the ECL System (Amersham Corp.) or by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1, the MEK inhibitor PD 098059 attenuated antigen-induced [32P]phosphorylation of MEK (panel A) and the activation of MEK as determined by in vitroassay of immunoprecipitated MEK (panel B). Activation of p42 MAP kinase was also attenuated, as indicated by the change in electrophoretic migration of p42 MAP kinase (panel C) or by the assay of MAP kinase activity of immunoprecipitated p42 MAP kinase (panel D). The extent of these inhibitions was dependent on the concentration of PD 098059. As shown in Fig. 2, the suppression of MAP kinase activation by PD 098059 (panel A) was associated with similar dose-dependent suppression of arachidonic acid release (panel B) and TNFα production (panel C). The suppression of the latter two responses was highly correlated (r > 0.95). All three responses were inhibited by ∼50% with 10 μm PD 098059. As will be described later, activation of cPLA2 was also inhibited by PD 098059. These results suggested that release of arachidonic acid and production of TNFα were both regulated by p42 MAP kinase.Figure 2Suppression of MAP kinase-dependent responses by PD 098059. A, cultures were incubated with the indicated concentrations of PD 098059 for 30 min and then either left unstimulated (Unstim.) or stimulated for 5 min with 20 ng/ml DNP-BSA. MAP kinase activity was assayed in whole cell extracts as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, cultures were incubated with the indicated concentrations of PD 098059 for 30 min and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml DNP-BSA for 15 min for measurement of release of arachidonic acid. C, cultures were incubated for 10 min with PD098059 and then stimulated for 135 min with 20 ng/ml DNP-BSA for measurement of production of TNFα (C) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values for this and all other figures were mean (±S.E.) values from three separate experiments (two cultures in each).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the selectivity of PD 098059, we next examined the effects of this compound on antigen-stimulated degranulation and the constitutive production of TGFβ, which are thought not to be regulated by MAP kinase (7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar, 19Baumgartner R.A. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4087-4093PubMed Google Scholar). PD 098059 had only minimal effects on stimulated release of the granule constituent, hexosaminidase (Fig.3 A) and the production of TGFβ in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 B). The only significant effect was partial inhibition (<30%) of degranulation at 50 μmPD 098059 (Fig. 3 A). Antigen stimulation also resulted in increased activity of p38 MAP kinase (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 1 and2). The p38 kinase inhibitor, SB 203580, inhibited this activation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, antigen activation of p42 MAP kinase was enhanced significantly by SB 203580. This enhancement was apparent when cells were stimulated with 20 or 200 ng/ml antigen (Fig. 4 B). The latter concentration of antigen was known to elicit maximal activation of p42 MAP kinase. 2C. Zhang, R. A. Baumgartner, K. Yamada, and M. A. Beaven, unpublished data. These results suggested that p38 MAP kinase negatively regulates p42 MAP kinase and that this regulation is alleviated by SB 203580. The enhanced activation of p42 MAP kinase in the presence of SB 203580 was associated with increased release of arachidonic acid (Fig.5 A) and production of TNFα (Fig.5 B). In the experiment shown in Fig. 5 B, cells were stimulated with a low concentration of antigen (6 ng/ml) to maximize enhancement of the TNFα response (250% increase in Fig.5 B). At optimal doses of antigen enhancement of TNFα production was less (40–80% increase) but still significant (data not shown). Because pyridinyl imidazoles that are closely related to SB 203580 have cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activity (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J.

White J.R. Young P.R. Bender P.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 149-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), experiments were conducted to determine whether blockade of cyclooxygenase activity with indomethacin (27Vane J.R. Nat. New. Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7348) Google Scholar) altered accumulation of radiolabel in the medium by suppressing metabolism [14C]arachidonate via this enzyme. Unlike SB 203580, 10 μm indomethacin did not significantly alter release of radiolabel from antigen-stimulated cells (7.8 ± 0.4% release over 15 min versus 7.2 ± 0.2% release in the absence of indomethacin; mean ± S.E. in eight cultures from two experiments). It seemed probable, therefore, that SB 203580 enhanced release rather than the accumulation of [14C]arachidonic acid in the medium. In contrast to the increased release of arachidonic acid and production of TNFα, SB 203580 had no significant effect on antigen-induced degranulation (Fig. 5 C) or constitutive production of TGFβ (Fig. 5 D). Collectively, these results provided further evidence for the notion that release of arachidonic acid and TNFα production are both regulated by p42 MAP kinase. In addition, the results suggested that p38 MAP kinase negatively modulates these responses through p42 MAP kinase. The above results suggested that release of arachidonic acid, as well as production of TNFα, was regulated by p42 MAP kinase. As in other systems (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L.

Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar). The connection between p42 MAP kinase and the release of arachidonic acid via cPLA2 was further demonstrated by the finding that the antigen-induced retardation of electrophoretic migration of cPLA2 (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was suppressed by PD 098059 but not by SB 203580 (Fig. 6). The p38 MAP kinase activator, anisomycin, markedly activated this kinase (Fig. 7 A) but much less so p42 MAP kinase (Fig. 7 B). The combination of anisomycin and antigen revealed inhibitory communication between these two kinase. For example, the combination of stimulants resulted in less activation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 7 C, lane 3) than that induced by antigen (Fig. 7 C, lane 2) or anisomycin (Fig. 7 A, lane 2) alone. The combination also caused less activation of p42 MAP kinase (Fig.7 D, lane 3) than that by antigen alone (Fig.7 D, lane 2). Thus, stimulation of p42 MAP kinase by antigen appeared to block activation of p38 MAP kinase by anisomycin, and conversely stimulation of p38 MAP kinase by anisomycin appeared to partially block activation of p42 MAP kinase by antigen. Consistent with the latter situation, anisomycin partially suppressed antigen-induced release of arachidonic acid (25 ± 4% reduction, mean of three experiments). This reduction corresponded to an approximately 25% reduction in p42 MAP kinase activation as determined by densitometric analysis of the blots shown in Fig. 7 D and two other experiments. Anisomycin almost totally blocked (by 83 ± 4%) antigen-induced production of TNFα, probably as a consequence, however, of its known inhibitory actions on protein synthesis at the translation step (29Vazquez D. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 130: 513-527Google Scholar). Presumably, de novo synthesis of TNFα would be especially sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis. Past studies have shown that the responses evoked by antigen in RBL-2H3 cells were dependent on calcium and signals generated through PKC or MAP kinase. These studies indicated, for example, that PKC regulated degranulation (6Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the production and secretion of TNFα, although it appeared likely that additional FcεRI-mediated signals facilitated TNFα production (13Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p42 MAP kinase, in contrast, was associated with phosphorylation of cPLA2 and release of arachidonic acid (2Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not address the issue of whether other MAP kinases, such as p38 MAP kinase, regulated cPLA2. The present results demonstrate that both p38 and p42 MAP kinases are activated in antigen-stimulated cells. Activation of the latter kinase appears to be most closely related to release of arachidonic acid and production of TNFα. All three events are inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, PD 098059 (Fig. 2), and enhanced by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB 203580 (Figs. 4 and 5). Both compounds are reported to be selective inhibitors of MEK (i.e. PD 098059) and p38 MAP kinase (i.e. SB 203580) when tested against a wide range of kinases (15Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J.

In addition, the enhancement of responses in the presence of SB 203580, in contrast to the attenuation of p42 MAP kinase activation by the p38 MAP kinase activator, anisomycin (Fig. 7), suggest that p38 MAP kinase negatively regulates activation of p42 MAP kinase and its associated responses. Antigen-stimulated degranulation and the constitutive production of TGFβ in RBL-2H3 cells are minimally affected by the inhibitors (Figs. 3 and 5). Collectively, the results support the notion that p42 MAP kinase regulates release of arachidonic acid and promotes an additional signal for stimulating TNFα production but does not regulate degranulation. Interestingly, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB 203580, was first identified as an inhibitor of cytokine biosynthesis in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes (17Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Stickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to suppress TNFα production in lipopolysaccharide-injected mice (30Badger A.M. Bradbeer J.N. Votta B. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Griswold D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1453-1461PubMed Google Scholar). The compound also possessed anti-inflammatory activity in mouse models of arthritis (collagen- and adjuvant-induced), whereas cellular immune responses measured ex vivo were unaffected (30Badger A.M. Bradbeer J.N. Votta B. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Griswold D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1453-1461PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that different MAP kinase pathways are utilized for activating gene transcription for cytokine synthesis when synthesis is induced by inflammatory agents or through multimeric immunologic receptors such as FcεRI. The question has been raised whether p38 rather than p42 MAP kinase is responsible for the activation of cPLA2 (18Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27395-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is phosphorylated by both kinases in thrombin-stimulated platelets, although the phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase does not appear to activate cPLA2 (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p42 MAP kinase regulates phosphorylation of cPLA2 and release of arachidonic acid and suggest, therefore, that this kinase is the activator of cPLA2 at least in RBL-2H3 cells. Mast cells, including RBL-2H3 cells, also contain a low molecular weight secreted form (type II) of PLA2 (31Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M. Fujimoi Y. Takahashi K. Inoue K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in secretory granules, and this form is presumably released along with other granule constituents in activated cells (32Chock S.P. Schmauder-Chock E.A. Cordella-Miele E. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A role for secreted PLA2 is unlikely, however, because total suppression of degranulation by selective inhibitors of PKC, such as Ro31–7549 and calphostin C, minimally affects release of arachidonic acid in RBL-2H3 cells (Refs. 7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar and 33Yamada K. Jelsema C.L. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar and see below). 3In addition to the cytosolic (cPLA2) and secreted (sPLA2) PLA2, a calcium-independent form of PLA2 (iPLA2) has been described in myocytes and smooth muscle cells (40Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). iPLA2 is inhibited by bromoenol lactone (41Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores or by the calmodulin inhibitor, W7 (40Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). By use of the same experimental strategies, we find no evidence for the presence of iPLA2 in RBL-2H3 cells (T. Hundley and M. A. Beaven, unpublished data). In addition to the correlations between activation of the p42 MAP kinase/cPLA2 pathway and release of arachidonic acid noted here with PD 098059 and SB 203580, similar correlations have been noted in previous studies with less specific MAP kinase inhibitors. Activation of the entire Raf/MEK/p42 MAP kinase pathway and release of arachidonic acid were suppressed equally by the glucorticoid, dexamethasone, and the kinase inhibitor, quercetin, while effects on degranulation were apparent only at relatively high concentrations of these agents (7Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Correlations were noted with the PKC inhibitor, Ro31–7549. This inhibitor transiently delayed activation of p42 MAP kinase in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. There was a corresponding transient delay in the release of arachidonic acid, although the cumulative release eventually equaled that observed in the absence of Ro31–7549 (14Zhang C Hirasawa N Beaven M. A J. Immunol. in press, 1997: 158Google Scholar). On the basis of these and other results, we have suggested that the p42 MAP kinase/cPLA2 pathway, although transiently activated by PKC, was predominantly activated by Ras through recruitment of Shc/Grb2/Sos or Vav by FcεRI (14Zhang C Hirasawa N Beaven M. A J. Immunol. in press, 1997: 158Google Scholar). Others have reported that fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, activate p42 and p44 MAP kinases through PKC (35Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This scenario is unlikely in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, however, because of the predominance of the PKC-independent (i.e. Ro31–7549-resistant) pathway in RBL-2H3 cells. The present data extend previous findings on the regulation of TNFα synthesis and release. This cytokine is synthesized de novoand subsequently secreted via Golgi in a PKC- and calcium-dependent manner (13Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). The PKC inhibitor, Ro31–7549, blocks secretion of TNFα but only partially suppresses synthesis of TNFα (6Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J.

Thus, additional signals may be necessary for optimal stimulation of TNFα synthesis. Antigen is a particularly potent stimulant of TNFα production when compared with the combination of calcium ionophore and PKC agonist, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (13Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar, 19Baumgartner R.A. Deramo V.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4087-4093PubMed Google Scholar). These observations and the present studies with the MAP kinase inhibitors suggest that optimal production of TNFα is achieved through activation of both PKC and p42 MAP kinase. The present findings may explain why antigen-induced activation of p42 MAP kinase (34Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar), release of arachidonic acid (22Collado-Escobar D. Cunha-Melo J.R. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 244-250PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar) and production of TNFα (36Baumgartner R.A. Hirasawa N. Ozawa K. Gusovsky F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1625-1629PubMed Google Scholar) exhibit similar sensitivity to dexamethasone. All three responses are totally suppressed in RBL-2H3 cells that have been treated with 10 nm dexamethasone, whereas antigen-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, increase in [Ca2+]i, and degranulation (22Collado-Escobar D. Cunha-Melo J.R. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 244-250PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar) are only partially suppressed by treatment of cells with 100 nmdexamethasone. Dexamethasone, as noted above, inhibits the entire Raf/MEK/p42 MAP kinase/cPLA2 pathway at nanomolar concentrations (34Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if p42 MAP kinase is the common regulator of TNFα production and arachidonic acid release, the similar sensitivities to dexamethasone would be expected. The connections between the p42 MAP kinase pathway and cytokine production are unknown for mast cells, but recent reports indicate the following connections in other types of cells. The overexpression of Raf1 (37Reimann T. Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. Baccarini M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5740-5749PubMed Google Scholar, 38Li S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) or p42 MAP kinase (39Park J.H. Levitt L. Blood. 1993; 82: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in enhanced expression of a variety of cytokine genes in T cells and macrophages (37Reimann T. Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. Baccarini M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5740-5749PubMed Google Scholar, 39Park J.H. Levitt L.

Blood. 1993; 82: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the above results provide the first indication that p42 MAP kinase regulates antigen-mediated production of TNFα in a mast cell line and that p38 MAP kinase may negatively regulate the p42 MAP kinase/cytokine pathway. We can, for the first time, broadly define the regulatory pathways for all three functional responses of mast cells to antigen as follows. Along with elevated [Ca2+]i, the additional primary signals are as follows: for degranulation (6Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2119780153,"The elicitation of an oxidative burst in phagocytes rests on the assembly of a multicomponental complex (NADPH oxidase) consisting of a membrane-associated flavocytochrome (cytochrome b 559), representing the redox element responsible for the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxygen to superoxide (O·̄2), two cytosolic components (p47phox, p67phox), and the small GTPase Rac (1 or 2). We found that 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), an irreversible serine protease inhibitor, prevented the elicitation of O·̄2 production in intact macrophages and the amphiphile-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system, consisting of solubilized membrane or purified cytochrome b 559 combined with total cytosol or a mixture of recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1. AEBSF acted at the activation step and did not interfere with the ensuing electron flow. It did not scavenge oxygen radicals and did not affect assay reagents. Five other serine protease inhibitors (three irreversible and two reversible) were found to lack an inhibitory effect on cell-free activation of NADPH oxidase. A structure-function study of AEBSF analogues demonstrated that the presence of a sulfonyl fluoride group was essential for inhibitory activity and that compounds containing an aminoalkylbenzene moiety were more active than amidinobenzene derivatives. Exposure of the membrane fraction or of purified cytochrome b 559, but not of cytosol or recombinant cytosolic components, to AEBSF, in the presence of a critical concentration of the activating amphiphile lithium dodecyl sulfate, resulted in a marked impairment of their ability to support cell-free NADPH oxidase activation upon complementation with untreated cytosol or cytosolic components. Kinetic analysis of the effect of varying the concentration of each of the three cytosolic components on the inhibitory potency of AEBSF indicated that this was inversely related to the concentrations of p47phox and, to a lesser degree, p67phox. AEBSF also prevented the amphiphile-elicited translocation of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane. These results are interpreted as indicating that AEBSF interferes with the binding of p47phox and/or p67phox to cytochromeb 559, probably by a direct effect on cytochromeb 559.

The production of reactive oxygen radicals represents the major microbicidal mechanism of phagocytes (1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 541-588Google Scholar). Oxygen radicals are also generated, in lesser amounts, by some nonphagocytic cells, sharing the enzymatic machinery characteristic of phagocytes (2Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and, under certain conditions, by plant cells (3Dwyer S.C. Legendre L. Low P.S. Leto T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interest in reactive oxygen species has also been stimulated by accumulating evidence for their involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases, ranging from respiratory distress syndrome to ischemia-reperfusion injury in several organs (4Halliwell B. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The primordial oxygen radical produced by phagocytes is superoxide (O·̄2). 1The abbreviations used are: O·̄2, superoxide; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; AEBSNH2, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonamide; AEBSAc, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonic acid; MAEBSF, 4-(2-N-methylaminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; pABSF, 4-(amidino)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; octyl glucoside,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; fMLP, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; pAPMSF, 4-(amidino)-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TPCK,n-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; DCIC, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; LiDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate. It is generated, in response to appropriate stimuli, by NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, a reaction catalyzed by a membrane-bound heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b 559) (reviewed in Refs. 5Chanock S.J.

Cytochrome b 559contains two redox centers, FAD and heme, and electron flow from NADPH to oxygen in initiated by the interaction of cytochrome with two cytosolic proteins, p47phox and p67phox, and the small GTPase, Rac1 or Rac2 (reviewed in Ref. 8McPhail L.C.

In the intact cell, this interaction is made possible by the stimulus-dependent translocation of the cytosolic components to the plasma membrane, leading to the assembly of what is known as the NADPH oxidase complex. Activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in O·̄2 generation, can be reproduced in vitro by a cell-free system consisting of either phagocyte membranes and cytosol (9Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or of a mixture of purified or recombinant components, exposed to a critical amount of an anionic amphiphile (arachidonate or SDS) (11Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 12Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of inhibitors of the O·̄2 generating NADPH oxidase have been described (reviewed in Ref. 13Cross A.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 71-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The search for such inhibitors is propelled by two incentives: (a) to serve as tools for understanding the structure and mechanism of activation of the NADPH oxidase, and (b) their potential use as therapeutic agents in diseases associated with production of oxygen radicals at an inappropriate site or time. In most studies, inhibitors were tested for an effect on intact phagocytes. The main drawback of such an approach is that it does not permit a distinction between an effect on membrane receptors and signal transduction and a direct effect on the components of the NADPH oxidase complex. Alternative strategies rest on examining the effect of inhibitors on subcellular fractions originating from stimulated cells or on NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system. These latter approaches should allow the selection of inhibitors with a direct effect on the assembled complex or on individual components of the NADPH oxidase complex. So far, the only compound having gained wide acceptance as a relatively specific direct inhibitor of NADPH oxidase is diphenylene iodonium (14Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the present paper we report that 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF; also known as Pefabloc SC), originally developed as an irreversible serine protease inhibitor, prevents the activation of the O·̄2 generating NADPH oxidase in both intact stimulated macrophages and in cell-free systems. The effect is shared by some structurally related compounds, indicating that we are dealing with a new class of NADPH oxidase inhibitors. Evidence is presented in favor of the proposal that AEBSF interferes with the interaction of p47phox and/or p67phox with cytochrome b 559, probably by chemical modification of cytochrome b 559. AEBSF hydrochloride (>99% pure), lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS), and common laboratory chemicals (at the highest purity available) were from Merck. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonamide (AEBSNH2, 99% pure) was purchased from Aldrich. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonic acid hydrochloride (AEBSAc), 4-(2-N-methylaminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (MAEBSF), and 4-(amidino)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (pABSF) were synthesized by Pentapharm Ltd., Basle, Switzerland. n-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside) was a product of Pfanstiehl Laboratories. Aprotinin was obtained from Fluka. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) was purchased from Boehringer. The following chemicals were obtained from Sigma: NADPH (tetrasodium salt, 95% pure), ferricytochrome c (from horse heart, 95% pure), superoxide dismutase (from bovine blood), xanthine, xanthine oxidase (from buttermilk), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), calcium ionophore A23187, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 4-(amidino)-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (pAPMSF), benzamidine hydrochloride hydrate, leupeptin hemisulfate salt,n-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC). Protease inhibitors were dissolved in water at a concentration at least 50-fold higher than the highest concentration used in NADPH oxidase inhibition assays, witih the exception of PMSF, TPCK, and DCIC, which were dissolved in ethanol, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively. Macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs injected with mineral oil 5–6 days before cell harvest. The cells were washed and made erythrocyte-free, as described previously (10Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and suspended in Earle's balanced salt solution (2 × 108 cells/ml), for assays involving intact cells. The membrane and cytosol fractions were obtained from cells disrupted by sonication, as described before (15Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with some modifications (16Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were washed in 1 m KCl in cell homogenization buffer (15Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized in 40 mmoctyl glucoside, as described (17Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use in the cell-free assay, solubilized membrane was diluted in detergent-free solubilization buffer, to bring the concentration of octyl glucoside to 4–5 mm. Cytochrome b 559 was purified from the original solubilized membrane and relipidated by a modification (18Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) of our original method (19Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral analysis of cytochrome b 559 preparations was performed as described in Ref. 19Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Baculoviruses carrying cDNAs for human p47phox and p67phox were kind gifts of Dr. Thomas L. Leto (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Suspension cultures of Sf9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml), grown in serum-free medium (SF-900 II SFM, Life Technologies) were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses and harvested 72 h after infection. The recombinant proteins were prepared as described by Leto et al. (20Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were disrupted by sonication using three 30-s pulses, in a 250 watt apparatus (Sonics and Materials), centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The recombinant proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography of the high speed supernatants, referred to as “crude extracts.” Thus, crude extract, containing p47phox, was applied to a SP Sepharose column (HiLoad 16/10, Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 1 mm dithioerythritol, and was eluted with a 0–0.3m NaCl gradient in the same buffer (210 ml, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min). Crude extract, containing p67phox, was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (HiLoad 16/10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mm dithioerythritol, and eluted with a 0–0.5m NaCl gradient in the same buffer (210 ml, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min). Purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; p47phox was 99% pure, whereas p67phox was 90% pure. Recombinant Rac1 was isolated from Escherichia coli transformed with Rac1 cDNA subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T (a kind gift of Dr. Thomas L. Leto, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), as described by Kwong et al. (21Kwong C.H. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5711-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet of bacterial culture overexpressing the glutathioneS-transferase-Rac1 fusion protein was disrupted by sonication, by three pulses of 30 s, and the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The fusion protein was absorbed from the supernatant on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and Rac1 was cleaved from the resin-bound fusion protein by thrombin. Thrombin was removed by absorption on benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purified Rac1 was loaded with GTPγS, as described before (22Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Macrophages (107 cells), in a volume of 50 μl, were added to 940 μl of Earle's balanced salt solution (containing 1.8 mm CaCl2), supplemented with 80 μm ferricytochrome c, in disposable spectrophotometer cuvettes. Inducers of an oxidative burst were added in a volume of 10 μl and the cuvettes placed in the thermostatted (37 °C) cuvette holder of a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments). Stimulus-dependent O·̄2 production was assayed by the continuous recording of superoxide dismutase inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction, measured at 550 nm, and the maximal rate was calculated from the linear sector of the change in absorbance curve (23Markert M. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Anionic amphiphile (LiDS)-activated O·̄2 production in vitro was assayed by ferricytochrome c reduction in mixtures consisting of solubilized membrane and either total cytosol or a combination of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS, as described (10Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the membrane was replaced by purified relipidated cytochrome b 559. Cell-free assays were performed either by the “one-step” method, in which activation by LiDS and NADPH-dependent O·̄2 production occur simultaneously, or by the “two-step” method (24Aharoni I. Pick E. J. Leuk. Biol. 1990; 48: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) permitting, at least partial, separation of the activation and catalytic stages of the reaction. LiDS-dependent NADPH oxidation by cell-free mixtures, of a composition identical to those utilized in the O·̄2 production assays, was measured as described in Ref.25Shaag D. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1989; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. LiDS- and NADPH-dependent oxygen consumption by cell-free mixtures, consisting of membrane and recombinant cytosolic components, was assayed with the aid of a Clark oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments), as described (26Pick E. Bromberg Y. Shpungin S. Gadba R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16476-16483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of p47phox and p67phoxto the membrane fraction of macrophages was studied in the LiDS-activated cell free system. Macrophage membranes (equivalent to 1.6 × 107 cells) were mixed with total macrophage cytosol (equivalent to 1.5 × 107 cells) in a total volume of 1 ml of NADPH oxidase assay buffer (10Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not containing ferricytochrome c, and incubated for 5 min at 24 °C, in the absence or presence of 185 μm LiDS (a concentration found to induce maximal O·̄2 production under these conditions). The mixture was centrifuged at 15,800 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C and, after careful removal of the supernatant, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of NADPH oxidase assay buffer and recentrifuged at 15,800 × g for 15 min. After removal of the supernatant, the sedimented membranes were resuspended in 30 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, as described (19Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were probed with a mixture of goat polyclonal anti-recombinant p47phox and anti-recombinant p67phox antibodies (20Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kind gifts of Dr. Thomas L. Leto, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The reactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, using reagents manufactured by Amersham International, and exposure to Rx medical x-ray film (Fuji). O·̄2 production can be elicited in guinea pig peritoneal macrophages by a variety of stimulants (27Pick E. Keisari Y. Cell. Immunol. 1981; 59: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We chose three stimulants (PMA, fMLP, and the calcium ionophore, A23187), known to activate NADPH oxidase in intact cells by distinct transductional mechanisms, and used these at concentrations found to elicit maximal O·̄2 generation in cells in suspension at 37 °C. In the presence of AEBSF, a dose-dependent inhibition of O·̄2 production elicited by 2 μm PMA was observed (Fig. 1 A). When AEBSF was added just before the addition of PMA, the IC50 was close to 1 mmand inhibition was almost complete at 5 mm AEBSF. At the latter concentration, AEBSF also caused a total suppression of O·̄2 production elicited by 1 μm fMLP or 10 μm A23187 (results not shown). This result was compatible with three interpretations: (a) AEBSF acts as a scavenger of O·̄2; (b) it acts on a signal transduction path shared by all three stimulants; and (c) it has a direct effect on the NADPH oxidase complex. We examined the effect of AEBSF on the ability to measure O·̄2 generation by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system, using the ferricytochromec reduction assay. AEBSF (0.5–5 mm) did not interfere with the detection of O·̄2 generated by xanthine (0.2 mm) and xanthine oxidase (0.018 units/ml); the difference between O·̄2 detection in the absence or presence of AEBSF (up to 5 mm) was less than 10% of the control value. NADPH oxidase can be activated in a cell-free system by certain anionic amphiphiles, a mechanism which circumvents the transductional pathways active in the intact phagocyte (9Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of AEBSF on O·̄2 production in several forms of cell-free activation systems. The simplest one consisted of solubilized macrophage membranes and unfractionated cytosol, both derived from unstimulated cells. AEBSF was found to exhibit a concentration-related, inhibitory influence on LiDS-induced O·̄2 production, with an IC50 of 0.206 ± 0.014 mm (n = 8) (Fig. 1 B). We next investigated the effect of AEBSF on a semi-recombinant cell-free system (11Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 12Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consisting of either solubilized macrophage membrane or purified cytochrome b 559, incorporated in phospholipid liposomes, combined with recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS. AEBSF was found to act as an inhibitor of O·̄2 production in this system, too, composed of four purified NADPH oxidase components in the virtual absence of any other protein (Fig. 1 C). In the course of the latter experiments we became aware of an unexpected variability in the inhibitory potency of AEBSF which was not found in the cell-free system consisting of solubilized membrane and unfractionated cytosol. Analysis of this phenomenon revealed that, in the presence of a constant amount of membrane or purified cytochrome b 559, the inhibitory effect of AEBSF was inversely related to the concentration of p47phox. A more detailed exploration of the mechanism of this correlation is provided in the penultimate section. To further ascertain that inhibition by AEBSF of O·̄2 production in the cell-free system is due to a direct effect on NADPH oxidase, we examined the influence of AEBSF on two additional indicators of NADPH oxidase activation. These were LiDS-elicited NADPH oxidation (25Shaag D. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1989; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and LiDS- and NADPH-dependent oxygen consumption (26Pick E. Bromberg Y. Shpungin S. Gadba R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16476-16483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by mixtures of membrane and cytosol or membrane and recombinant cytosolic components. We found that AEBSF suppressed NADPH oxidation in a concentration-related manner; when cell-free mixtures were analyzed in parallel by ferricytochrome c reduction, the IC50 of AEBSF values were identical in the two assays. Also, at 5 mm, AEBSF inhibited oxygen consumption by 95%. We concluded that AEBSF acts by interacting with one or more of the components of the NADPH oxidase complex. The O·̄2 generating NADPH oxidase has a K m for NADPH of 20–40 μm (6Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the enzyme activated by amphiphile under cell-free conditions exhibits the same kinetic characteristics (9Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of AEBSF (2 mm) on NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system was examined at concentrations of NADPH varying from 10 to 400 μm and analyzed by Michaelis-Menten plotting. This demonstrated that inhibition of AEBSF was noncompetitive with NADPH. Membrane solubilization and purification of cytochromeb 559 results in a partial loss of FAD from the cytochrome (11Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which explains the dependence of NADPH oxidase activation, in the cell-free system, on exogenous FAD (9Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether AEBSF interfered with the reflavination of cytochrome b 559, by assessing the effect of varying the concentration of exogenous FAD on the inhibitory effect of AEBSF. We found that the degree of inhibition by AEBSF (IC50) was independent of the concentration of exogenous FAD (from 10 to 100 μm). Finally, we explored the possibility that AEBSF competes with the activating amphiphile for interaction with a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. We found that increasing the concentration of LiDS, from the optimal activating range of 120–140 μm to up to 180 μm, did not reverse or reduce the inhibitory effect of AEBSF (see also Fig.4). Activation of NADPH oxidase, in intact cells and in broken cell preparations, is considered to be the result of the assembly of the individual components of the enzyme into a membrane-localized complex (reviewed in Ref. 8McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), this being followed by the induction of electron flow within the flavocytochromeb 559 dimer. The “activation” and “electron flow” stages can be separated in a two-step cell-free activation assay (24Aharoni I. Pick E. J. Leuk. Biol. 1990; 48: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This consists of exposing a mixture of NADPH oxidase components to an optimal concentration of activating amphiphile in a small volume (100 μl) for a fixed time interval, in the absence of substrate NADPH, followed by 10-fold dilution and the initiation of electron flow by addition of NADPH. The 10-fold dilution results in a reduction in the concentration of amphiphile to a subactivating level and causes the virtual interruption of further assembly of the enzyme complex. We utilized this approach to identify the event affected by the inhibitor, by adding AEBSF either to the activation mixture at time 0 or after the completion of activation. As apparent in Fig.2, AEBSF was a much more effective inhibitor when present during the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex than when added at the completion of assembly. The finding that AEBSF was not totally inactive when added at the end of step one is probably due to the fact that some enzyme assembly continues taking place in the course of the second step. The ability of AEBSF to suppress O·̄2production when added to the components of the NADPH oxidase complex, in the absence of electron flow, also indicates that its mechanism of action is distinct from that of diphenylene iodonium, which acted as an inhibitor only under reducing conditions, such as those generated by NADPH oxidase turnover (29Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Use was made of the two-step cell-free assay for determining whether inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation by AEBSF was reversible. For this purpose, activation mixtures were prepared in the absence and presence of a single concentration of AEBSF (2 mm) and incubated with an optimal concentration of LiDS for 5 min. Following this, the reaction mixtures were diluted in assay buffer to reduce the amphiphile concentration, and re-exposed or not to an activating concentration of LiDS for 3 min. The results illustrated in Fig. 3demonstrate that re-exposure to LiDS of mixtures treated with 2 mm AEBSF partially reverses the inhibition. Thus, O·̄2 production by activation mixtures treated with AEBSF was 22.67 ± 1.12%"
https://openalex.org/W2055143049,"SHP-1 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase associated with inhibition of activation pathways in hematopoietic cells. The catalytic activity of SHP-1 is regulated by its two SH2 (Src homology 2) domains; phosphotyrosine peptides that bind to the SH2 domains activate SHP-1. The consensus sequence (I/V)XYXX(L/V) is present in the cytoplasmic tails of several lymphocyte receptors that interact with the second SH2 domain of SHP-1. In several of these receptors, there are two or three occurrences of the motif. Here we show that the conserved hydrophobic amino acid preceding the phosphotyrosine is critical for binding to and activation of SHP-1 by peptides corresponding to sequences from killer cell inhibitory receptors. The interaction of most SH2 domains with phosphopeptides requires only the phosphotyrosine and the three residues downstream of the tyrosine. In contrast, the shortest peptide able to bind or activate SHP-1 also included the two residues upstream of the phosphotyrosine. A biphosphopeptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of a killer cell inhibitory receptor with the potential to interact simultaneously with both SH2 domains of SHP-1 was the most potent activator of SHP-1. The hydrophobic residue upstream of the tyrosine was also critical in the context of the biphosphopeptide. The contribution of a hydrophobic amino acid two residues upstream of the tyrosine in the SHP-1-binding motif may be an important feature that distinguishes inhibitory receptors from those that provide activation signals.

The contribution of a hydrophobic amino acid two residues upstream of the tyrosine in the SHP-1-binding motif may be an important feature that distinguishes inhibitory receptors from those that provide activation signals. Receptor-mediated activation of cellular responses is often initiated by the activation of tyrosine kinases. The signal is propagated by the sequential recruitment of proteins to the phosphorylated targets of the kinases. SH2 (Srchomology 2) domains are protein modules that specifically bind to phosphotyrosine residues and are found in a variety of proteins such as protein kinases and adapter molecules. A general feature of all SH2 domains is a conserved pocket that binds the phosphotyrosine moiety. The specificity of the interaction between individual SH2 domains and particular phosphoproteins is generally determined by three to six residues following the phosphotyrosine and often incorporates a hydrophobic residue at the third position (reviewed in Ref. 1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). This specificity is provided by specific pockets that bind the phosphotyrosine and +3 residues as revealed by structural studies of several SH2 domains complexed with phosphopeptides (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar).A small family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases contain SH2 domains. This family is composed of mammalian SHP-1 and SHP-2 and theDrosophila homologue of SHP-2, corkscrew. These protein-tyrosine phosphatases are important regulators of many cellular signaling processes (reviewed in Ref. 2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is broadly expressed and is important for activation signals through several different growth factor receptors. In contrast, SHP-1 is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells and has been implicated in inhibition of signaling through growth factor, cytokine, and antigen receptors. These protein-tyrosine phosphatases contain two SH2 domains in tandem and a single catalytic domain. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity is negatively regulated by the SH2 domains in that their removal or occupancy by phosphopeptides increases the phosphatase activity of the catalytic domain (3Townley R.

The SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are more closely related to each other than to any other SH2 domains known, with their next closest relatives being the SH2 domains of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase C-γ1 (9Songyang Z.

The predictive value of these motifs was supported by the presence of appropriate sequences in several receptors that bind to the SH2N domain of SHP-1, such as c-Kit, and erythropoietin and interleukin-3 receptors. Due to a strong sequence similarity to the SH2N domains of both SHP-1 and SHP-2, the second SH2 domain (SH2C domain) of SHP-1 is predicted to have a similar preference for hydrophobic residues at positions +1 and +3 (10Songyang Z.

Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides derived from Ly-49 interact with the SH2 domains of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 (20Olcese L. Lang P. Vély F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Bléry M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretto L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory receptors expressed in natural killer cells, including human KIR and NKG2, as well as the mouse inhibitory receptors Ly-49 and gp49 also share the sequence QEVT just upstream of the tyrosine.Several recent observations have raised questions about the specificity of the interaction of receptors with the (I/V)XYXX(L/V) motif and SHP-1. SHP-1 was implicated in the inhibitory signals of FcγRIIB because of a defect in the receptor's signaling in B cells from SHP-1-deficient mice (13D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that FcγRIIB functions in mast cells independently of SHP-1 and associates with the inositol phosphatase SHIP, which also contains an SH2 domain (21Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive SHP-1 acts as a dominant-interfering molecule for the inhibitory signals delivered by KIR (11Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M. Wagtmann N. Rajagopalan S. Berrada K. Yi T. Kinet J.P. Long E.O. Immunity. 1996; 4: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and SHP-1 associates with the receptor upon tyrosine phosphorylation (11Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M.

Med. 1996; 184: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, it remained possible that the dominant-interfering mutant of SHP-1 exerted its effect by preventing the association of a different protein with tyrosine-phosphorylated KIR, which was itself important in providing the inhibitory signal. In addition, studies with metabolically labeled cells show the association of KIR with a protein that corresponded in size to SHP-1 as well as several unidentified proteins (23Campbell K.S. Dessing M. Lopez-Botet M. Cella M. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we have analyzed proteins that bind to synthetic phosphotyrosine peptides corresponding to cytoplasmic tail sequences of KIR and FcγRIIB.To determine whether the amino acids identified in the consensus sequence (I/V)XYXX(L/V) are important for interaction with SHP-1, we have examined the specificity of the interaction of sequences containing this motif with SHP-1 and the contribution of these residues to the activation and binding of SHP-1. The data established a critical role for the amino acid two residues upstream of the tyrosine in SHP-1 binding and activation.DISCUSSIONPhosphopeptides corresponding to KIR-pY1 or KIR-pY1pY2 bound a single major protein in lymphocyte lysates that comigrated with SHP-1. These observations support the conclusion that a dominant-interfering form of SHP-1 prevents KIR function by specifically competing with SHP-1 (11Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M. Wagtmann N.

In contrast, a phosphopeptide corresponding to the FcγRIIB cytoplasmic tail bound two major proteins, one of which comigrated with SHP-1 and one with the inositol phosphatase SHIP. These results support the reports of FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition by either SHP-1 or SHIP (13D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 21Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). More important, these results indicate that the (I/V)XYXXL consensus motif contains elements that are important for binding and activation of SHP-1, but not SHIP.Short peptides corresponding to the KIR-pY1 sequence showed that the minimal consensus sequence (I/V)XYXXL was sufficient to confer most of the activity of the KIR-pY1 peptide. The short peptide VTpYAQL activated SHP-1, whereas pYAQL did not, indicating a need for the upstream residues in the peptide to interact with SHP-1. Studies with analogues of KIR-pY1 indicated that position −2 is the most influential position upstream as only KIR-pY1 analogues with Val/Ile/Leu hydrophobic residues at this position were able to activate the SHP-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Position −2 also influences binding of the KIR-pY1 sequence to the isolated SH2C domain, indicating that it is involved in the peptide binding to this SH2 domain. The utilization of upstream residues in a phosphotyrosine-binding motif is reminiscent of phosphotyrosine-binding domains, which are not related to SH2 domains, but similarly bind phosphotyrosine in a pocket created by conserved amino acids. The fine specificity of phosphotyrosine-binding domain binding is controlled by amino acids exclusively upstream of the phosphotyrosine,e.g. the motif PNXpY (reviewed in Ref. 1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). The (I/V/L)XYXXL motif for activation of SHP-1 is unique in that it involves residues on both sides of the tyrosine.The importance of residue −2 was clear in the context of the highly active biphosphopeptide pY1pY2. This result is particularly relevant because a long peptide is more likely than a short one to adopt the conformation of the actual protein. In fact, the peptide tested included 45 of the 76 amino acids of the KIR cytoplasmic tail. Although short peptides rarely exhibit a fixed conformation in aqueous environments (29Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 519-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), it is possible that the upstream residues invoke a conformation favorable for the interaction of the peptide and the SH2 domain. However, such an explanation is unlikely because pYAQL was not able to activate SHP-1.The crystal structure of the SH2 domains of the related protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 complexed with phosphopeptides suggest how position −2 may be involved in peptide binding to the SH2 domains of SHP-1. These structures revealed that the peptide-binding groove accommodates residues −2 to +5 relative to the phosphotyrosine (30Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trüb T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast to a peptide complexed with the SH2 domain of Src (32Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), residue −2 is in contact with the SH2 domains of SHP-2 (30Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trüb T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Based on their sequence similarity to SHP-2, the SH2 domains of SHP-1 are likely to share the feature of an extended peptide-binding groove relative to prototypic SH2 domains. The peptide from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor crystallized with SHP-2 has a valine at position −2. In the structure, the side chain of the valine caps the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. Although not all the peptides that bind to SHP-2 contain a similar residue at position −2, the valine at position −2 in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor peptide has been shown to be important for binding and activation of SHP-2 (33Huyer G. Li Z.M. Adam M. Huckle W.R. Ramachandran C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that the interaction with the tyrosine ring and the side chain of residue −2 provides an entropic contribution for binding. Such an interaction may be required in general for the binding of peptides to the SH2C domain of SHP-1. The phosphotyrosine position in the SH2 domains of SHP-2 is different than in typical SH2 domains (30Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the need for the extra interactions. Alternatively, a hydrophobic pocket in the SH2C domain of SHP-1, but not present in SHP-2, could explain how Ile/Val/Leu at position −2 contributes to the binding of peptides to the SHP-1 SH2C domain. Perhaps these interactions compensate for a lack of interaction with position +1 and become necessary for the sequences from the lymphocyte receptors that lack a hydrophobic residue at position +1. Of note, there are interactions reported for KIR- and Ly-49-derived peptides with SHP-2, but these interactions are quite weak (20Olcese L. Lang P. Vély F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Bléry M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretto L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534PubMed Google Scholar).A long groove for peptide binding can impose stringent requirements for many of the residues downstream of a phosphotyrosine. In the structural studies of SHP-2, interactions of both crystallized peptides with the protein occurred for side chains +3 and +5 (30Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Such a long groove may exclude the majority of peptides due to steric interference. In support of this notion, the upstream portion of pY1 did not confer activity to the downstream portions of KIR-pY2 and ζ-pY5 in terms of SHP-1 activation. This suggests that ζ-pY5 and KIR-pY2 could lack other necessary residues downstream of the tyrosine. The lack of consensus at any of these positions in the sequences that do bind suggest that ζ-pY5 and KIR-pY2 possess residues that are detrimental to the interaction. Whereas the two residues between the tyrosine and the leucine are likely culprits, residues beyond position +3 have also been implicated for high affinity binding of phosphopeptides to the related SH2N domain of SHP-2 (34Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10467-10474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The issue of which SH2 domain is involved with recognition of residue −2 is intriguing. A specific interaction of the peptides with the SH2N domain alone was not observed. Thus, it is tempting to presume that the SH2C domain is the only relevant domain. However, the ability of the biphosphopeptide to produce such strong activation as compared with the monophosphopeptides suggests that both tyrosines and both SH2 domains are involved in the interaction. The interaction with the SH2N domain may be of low affinity and therefore is not detected in isolation. However, when the two phosphotyrosines are linked, a high avidity interaction is generated. An even more dramatic example of enhanced activation by biphosphopeptides has been observed for SHP-2 (7Pluskey S. Wandless T.J. Walsh C.T. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). More important, substitution with alanine at position −2 drastically decreased the ability of the biphosphopeptide to activate SHP-1.We have provided evidence that the consensus residues (I/V/L)XYXX(L/V) are critical amino acids for binding and activation of SHP-1. Ile/Val/Leu at position −2 differentiates the YXXL sequences of inhibitory receptors from the YXXL sequences in the immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of lymphocyte-activating receptors. This motif differs from the usual binding motifs of SH2 domains by the inclusion of upstream residues. Receptor-mediated activation of cellular responses is often initiated by the activation of tyrosine kinases. The signal is propagated by the sequential recruitment of proteins to the phosphorylated targets of the kinases. SH2 (Srchomology 2) domains are protein modules that specifically bind to phosphotyrosine residues and are found in a variety of proteins such as protein kinases and adapter molecules. A general feature of all SH2 domains is a conserved pocket that binds the phosphotyrosine moiety. The specificity of the interaction between individual SH2 domains and particular phosphoproteins is generally determined by three to six residues following the phosphotyrosine and often incorporates a hydrophobic residue at the third position (reviewed in Ref. 1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). This specificity is provided by specific pockets that bind the phosphotyrosine and +3 residues as revealed by structural studies of several SH2 domains complexed with phosphopeptides (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). A small family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases contain SH2 domains. This family is composed of mammalian SHP-1 and SHP-2 and theDrosophila homologue of SHP-2, corkscrew. These protein-tyrosine phosphatases are important regulators of many cellular signaling processes (reviewed in Ref. 2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is broadly expressed and is important for activation signals through several different growth factor receptors. In contrast, SHP-1 is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells and has been implicated in inhibition of signaling through growth factor, cytokine, and antigen receptors. These protein-tyrosine phosphatases contain two SH2 domains in tandem and a single catalytic domain. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity is negatively regulated by the SH2 domains in that their removal or occupancy by phosphopeptides increases the phosphatase activity of the catalytic domain (3Townley R.

https://openalex.org/W2014598325,"Antimitogenic stimuli such as environmental or genotoxic stress, transforming growth factor-β, and the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 activate two extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-based signaling pathways: the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway and the p38 pathway. Activated p38 phosphorylates transcription factors important in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, including activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), Max, cAMP response element-binding protein-homologous protein/growth arrest DNA damage 153 (CHDP/GADD153). In turn, p38 lies downstream of the Rho family GTPases Cdc42Hs and Rac1, as well as at least three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK-kinases (MEKs): MAPK kinases-3, -6, and SAPK/ERK-kinase-1. Although many of the stimuli that activate p38 can also inhibit cell cycle progression, a clear-cut role for the p38 pathway in cell cycle regulation has not been established. Using a quantitative microinjection approach, we show here that Cdc42Hs, but not Rac1 or RhoA, can inhibit cell cycle progression at G1/S through a mechanism requiring activation of p38. These results suggest a novel role for Cdc42Hs in cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, these results suggest that although both Cdc42Hs and Rac1 can activate p38in situ, the effects of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 on cell cycle progression are, in fact, quite distinct. Antimitogenic stimuli such as environmental or genotoxic stress, transforming growth factor-β, and the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 activate two extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-based signaling pathways: the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway and the p38 pathway. Activated p38 phosphorylates transcription factors important in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, including activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), Max, cAMP response element-binding protein-homologous protein/growth arrest DNA damage 153 (CHDP/GADD153). In turn, p38 lies downstream of the Rho family GTPases Cdc42Hs and Rac1, as well as at least three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK-kinases (MEKs): MAPK kinases-3, -6, and SAPK/ERK-kinase-1. Although many of the stimuli that activate p38 can also inhibit cell cycle progression, a clear-cut role for the p38 pathway in cell cycle regulation has not been established. Using a quantitative microinjection approach, we show here that Cdc42Hs, but not Rac1 or RhoA, can inhibit cell cycle progression at G1/S through a mechanism requiring activation of p38. These results suggest a novel role for Cdc42Hs in cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, these results suggest that although both Cdc42Hs and Rac1 can activate p38in situ, the effects of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 on cell cycle progression are, in fact, quite distinct.

Typically these pathways consist of a three-tiered core of protein kinases wherein MAPK-kinase-kinases (MAPKKKs) activate MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), which, in turn, activate ERKs (1Kyriakis J.M.

In simple eukaryotes, these pathways are activated by a variety of stresses, including nutrient withdrawal and osmotic shock (3Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In mammals and other multicellular eukaryotes, ERK/MAPK pathways are activated by both environmental stresses and more complex physiologic stimuli such as mitogens, developmental cues, neurotransmitters, vasoactive peptides, and inflammatory cytokines (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs, also referred to as JNKs) and p38 are the ERK components in two mammalian signaling pathways activated by a broad array of environmental stresses as well as by inflammatory cytokines (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Once activated, the SAPKs and p38 are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors necessary for the stress response including c-Jun, ATF2, Max, and CHOP (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

The signaling components upstream of the SAPKs and p38 which have been identified thus far suggest a complex cell- and stimulus-dependent regulation consistent with the diversity of extracellular stimuli that activate these pathways. Several chromatographically distinct MEKs, including SEK1/MKK4, SAPK-kinase (SAPKK)4, and SAPKK5 can activate the SAPKs in situ andin vitro. (6Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SAPKK4 and SAPKK5 are specific for the SAPKs, whereas SEK1 can also activate p38. By contrast, MKK3 and MKK6 are specific p38 activators (8Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Dérijard B.

Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Four families of MAPKKKs have also been implicated in SAPK and p38 regulation. MEK kinases (MEKKs) 1 and 2, as well as the mixed lineage kinase SH3 domain-containing, proline-rich kinase (SPRK), can activate the SAPK pathway via direct activation of SEK1 (11Yan M. Dai T.

MEKK2 can also activate the mitogenic MAPK/ERK1 and 2 pathway by directly phosphorylating the ERK1/2 upstream activator MEK1 (11Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Tpl-2 the rat homolog of the human cot proto-oncogene product, like MEKK2, can activate both SEK1 and MEK1 (14Salmerón A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D. Narsimhan R.P. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). MEKK3 can activate both the SAPK and MAPK pathways, although SEK1 is not a MEKK3 substrate (11Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In addition, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) can activate p38 in situ and has been implicated as a transforming growth factor-β-activated MAPKKK upstream of SEK1, MKK3, and MKK6 (15Yamaguchi K.

Finally, the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and germinal center kinase (GCK), mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae STE20 and SPS1, respectively, can activate the SAPK and p38 pathways, although their mechanisms of action are unclear (17Pombo C.M.

Genetic epistasis studies in yeast as well as biochemical and transfection experiments employing mammalian cells have identified members of the Ras superfamily as upstream elements regulating the core protein kinases in ERK signaling cascades (1Kyriakis J.M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammalian cells, the Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42Hs can activate the p38 and SAPK pathways. This activation may involve the direct binding of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs to the PAKs. This binding results in PAK activation (18Bagrodia S. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). A complete picture of the biological functions of these stress-activated pathways is only beginning to emerge. Recent data have implicated the SAPK and p38 pathways in the induction of apoptosis in response to nerve growth factor withdrawal in PC-12 cells, as well as heat shock, genotoxic chemotherapeutics (cis-platinum), and signaling pathways, which stimulate the generation of ceramide from membrane sphingomyelin (25Xia Z.

However, induction of apoptosis may not be the only biological consequence of activation of the SAPKs and p38. Moreover, the specific biological roles of the SAPK and p38 pathways in signaling mediated by Rac1 and Cdc42Hs have not been elucidated. In this study, we used quantitative microinjection to begin to characterize the biological consequences of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 activation of p38. Here we report that Cdc42Hs is a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression, arresting cells at the G1/S transition point. In addition, we demonstrate that this inhibition is mediated by elements of the p38 pathway. Rac1 and the SAPKs, although able to induce characteristic cellular and biochemical responses, do not inhibit cell cycle progression significantly. NIH-3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips and synchronized in G0 by serum withdrawal for 24 h. After this period, less than 1% of the cells incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) during an additional 24 h of incubation. The arrested cells were released from serum starvation by readdition of 10% calf serum and were microinjected in early G1 with expression vectors harboring the HA-tagged or FLAG-tagged cDNAs, using a Zeiss automated microinjection system (28Pepperkok R. Pagano M. Cell Cycle: Materials and Methods.in: Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 75-86Google Scholar). As a control, cells were microinjected with the empty vector together with an inert rabbit antibody marker to identify the injected cells. S phase entry was monitored by BrdUrd (100 μm) incorporation into cellular DNA (28Pepperkok R. Pagano M. Cell Cycle: Materials and Methods.in: Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 75-86Google Scholar, 29Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Pagano M. Cell Cycle: Materials and Methods.in: Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 15-28Google Scholar). Cells were fixed at the indicated time after release from serum starvation as described. Cells stained for phospho-p38 or phospho-c-Jun were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Injected DNA concentrations were: 100 ng/μl for HA-p38, HA-SAPK, HA-p44MAPK, HA-p70S6 kinase, HA-MKK3, HA-MKK3-KR, HA-SEK1, HA-SEK1-KR, HA-MKK6, M2-FLAG-GCK, and empty pMT3; 240 ng/μl for empty pMT3, HA-MKK3-KR, or HA-SEK1-KR in the dominant negative experiments shown in Figs. 1, 3, and 4; and 80 ng/μl for Rho family GTPases.Figure 3Strong activation of SAPK does not promote G1 arrest. GCK inhibits cell cycle progression at G1/S via a p38-dependent mechanism. Cells were injected with the indicated plasmids and assayed for cell cycle progression. For each injection set, the ratios of S phase cells/total expressing cells were: empty plasmid: 53/85, 67/96, 80/117, 53/73: GCK: 16/59, 9/44, 15/33, 6/29; GCK plus KR-MKK3: 37/62, 47/78, 19/40, 9/17; GCK plus SAPK plus KR-MKK3: 21/42, 25/43, 11/21, 12/25.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of expression of p38-activating MEKs on cell cycle progression: requirement for active p38 for G1 arrest.

For each injection set the ratios of S phase cells/expressing cells were: empty plasmid: 80/113, 33/48, 64/101; p38: 6/27; 8/30, 6/32; p38 plus KR-MKK3: 18/30, 19/32, 18/27; p38 plus KR-SEK1: 14/20, 18/26, 16/28. Part C, immunostaining of cells coinjected with the HA tagged p38 and KR-MKK3 cDNAs. Expression of both proteins is shown in panel A. That the S phase transition was due to the inhibitory effect of KR-MKK3 and not a lack of expression of p38 was verified by directly staining the expressed p38 protein (panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fixed coverslips were stained with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody or anti-M2-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody, followed by biotinylated anti-mouse antibody and streptavidin-Texas Red staining as described previously (28Pepperkok R. Pagano M. Cell Cycle: Materials and Methods.in: Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 75-86Google Scholar, 29Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Pagano M. Cell Cycle: Materials and Methods.in: Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 15-28Google Scholar). The coinjected rabbit IgG was detected with a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody, followed by streptavidin-Texas-Red staining. The incorporated BrdUrd was detected by anti-BrdUrd rat monoclonal antibody and anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 dye (1 μg/ml). To quantitate cells in S phase, BrdUrd-positive cells were scored blindly as a percent of the number of injected cells expressing the tagged cDNAs. To stain for p38 following anti-HA staining, rabbit anti-p38 antibody was used followed by a 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine conjugated anti-rabbit antibody staining. The phosphorylated portion of the expressed HA-p38, the endogenous p38 protein, or c-Jun protein was detected by anti-phospho-p38 or anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies, followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and streptavidin-9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine or streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining. Actin stress fibers were stained with fluorescein phalloidin as described (30Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). Membrane ruffling was detected by staining as described (31Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). MKK3 and MKK6 were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from human B cell (RAMOS) cDNA. p38, SAPK, MKK3, and SEK1 cDNAs were expressed from the pMT3 (HA-tagged) vector. GCK, MKK6, Cdc42Hs, Rac1 and RhoA plasmids were expressed from the pCMV5-M2-FLAG vector. Murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were rendered quiescent by serum withdrawal and synchronized in G1 by serum readdition. Cells were microinjected in early G1 with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged p38, SAPK-p46βI, p44-MAPK, p70 S6 kinase, or empty vector. Entry into S phase was monitored by incorporation of BrdUrd into DNA. After 24 h, expression of the relevant constructs was verified by immunostaining, and the expressing cells were scored blindly for S phase entry. Cells injected with the empty vector were identified by staining for coinjected rabbit IgG. Cells were also counterstained with bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) to visualize all nuclei and assess any abnormal nuclear morphology. Fig.1 shows representative photomicrographs of the stained cells. Expression of p38 resulted in a striking 77.5% inhibition of S phase entry compared with cells injected with empty plasmid (Fig.2 a). Similar results were obtained using mink lung Mv1Lu cells (data not shown). The inhibition of S phase entry by p38 is likely due to the presence of increased amounts of active p38 in the microinjected cells. Staining of the injected cells with an antibody specific for the active, phosphorylated form of p38 (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) revealed that the p38-expressing cells contained greater amounts of phosphorylated p38 than did the uninjected cells (Fig.2 b). The ability of p38 to arrest cells in G1 was specific, with other signaling kinases having little or no effect on cell cycle progression. p44-MAPK is an integral component of the mitogenic pathway recruited by Ras, and constitutive activation of this pathway is sufficient to transform NIH-3T3 cells (4Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, expression of p44-MAPK modestly enhanced G1/S progression (91% of p44-MAPK-expressing cells in S phase versus 69% of empty plasmid-injected cells, Fig. 2 a). p70 S6 kinase is also activated by mitogens through mechanisms involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and FRAP/RAFT/TOR (32Weng Q.-P.

Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Expression of p70 S6 kinase from microinjected plasmid had no significant effect on G1/S transition (Fig. 2 a). SAPKs are preferentially activated by the same antimitogenic stimuli as is p38 (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To our surprise, however, expression of injected SAPK, which increased intracellular SAPK activity and, consequently, substantially elevated the level of phosphorylated c-Jun (a SAPK substrate) in the injected cells (Fig.2 b), resulted in only modest inhibition of S phase entry (55% in S phase; Fig. 2 a). In view of this result, we explored the effects on cell cycle progression of strong activation of the SAPKs. GCK is a mammalian homolog of S. cerevisiae SPS1 which, when expressed transiently, is constitutively active (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

At low levels of expression, GCK activation of SAPK is specific, with no p38 or ERK1 activation seen (17Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sánchez I. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At high levels of expression, however, GCK can activate p38 modestly. 2T. Yuasa and J. M. Kyriakis, manuscript in preparation. Injection of GCK into NIH-3T3 cells resulted in inhibition of G1/S transition to a degree commensurate with that obtained upon injection of p38 alone (25% in S phase versus 67% in S phase for cells injected with empty vector, Fig. 3). If KR-MKK3, a kinase-dead dominant inhibitory mutant of MKK3, which specifically blocks p38, but not SAPK activation (9 and see Fig. 4) is coinjected with GCK, this G1 arrest is abolished completely whether or not SAPK is coinjected with the GCK (Fig. 3). Thus, SAPK activation likely does not contribute to GCK-mediated cell cycle arrest. To investigate further the role of activation of p38 in inhibition of G1/S transition, we asked if components known to lie upstream of p38 in stress signaling cascades could block S phase entry. MKK3, MKK6, and SEK1 are three mammalian MEKs that can activate p38in situ and in vitro (9Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu L.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Although MKK3 and MKK6 are apparently specific for p38, SEK1 is also a strong SAPK activator (6Sánchez I. Hughes R.T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Expression of HA-tagged, wild-type SEK1, MKK3, or MKK6 from microinjected plasmids strongly inhibited S phase entry (14% in S phase for SEK1, 17% in S phase for MKK3, 15% in S phase for MKK6, 69% in S phase for empty plasmid). By contrast, expression of kinase-inactive mutant SEK1 or MKK3 plasmids, wherein the lysine residue critical for ATP binding has been mutated to arginine (KR mutants), was without significant effect (Fig. 4 a). Despite the lack of intrinsic activity, however, kinase-inactive SEK1 and MKK3 mutants can act as dominant inhibitors of coexpressed p38 activation and biological activity and can thus be used to assess the requirement for p38 activation for a particular biological function (6Sánchez I.

Accordingly, to test whether activation of p38 was necessary for p38-mediated cell cycle arrest, we coinjected p38 with KR-MKK3 or KR-SEK1. Consistent with a requirement for active p38, both KR-SEK1 and KR-MKK3 completely inhibited the ability of p38 to block S phase entry (Fig. 4 b) without preventing p38 expression (Fig. 4 c). Cdc42Hs, a member of the Rho subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, is a human homolog of S. cerevisiae CDC42 (36Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R.A.

PtdIns 4-kinase activity is conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes. Multiple isoforms of mammalian PtdIns 4-kinase have been purified, and the activities have been detected in almost all subcellular locations. We previously reported the cloning and characterization of the first mammalian PtdIns 4-kinase named PI4Kα (Wong, K., and Cantley, L. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28878–28884). Alternatively spliced forms of PI4Kα have also been identified from several sources including bovine brain (Gehrmann, T., Vereb, G., Schmidt, M., Klix, D., Meyer, H.

The metabolism of phosphoinositides is a key event in transmitting mitogenic and developmental signals in response to a variety of hormones and growth factors. Two signal transduction pathways, each utilizing distinct phosphoinositide derivatives, have been characterized. In one pathway, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HA, hemagglutinin; BiP, binding protein; TGN, trans-Golgi network; IRS, insulin receptor substrate. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HA, hemagglutinin; BiP, binding protein; TGN, trans-Golgi network; IRS, insulin receptor substrate.-4,5-P2 is hydrolyzed by receptor-activated phospholipase C enzymes to generate the signaling molecules inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (4Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 have also been shown to mediate actin rearrangement by directly regulating actin-binding proteins (5Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a distinct pathway, phosphoinositides are phosphorylated at the C-3 position to generated a family of lipid messengers (7Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These lipids, PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 are not substrates for phospholipase C but are implicated in mitogenesis (8Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar), intracellular trafficking (9Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) as well as actin rearrangement (10Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M.

Feeding into both PtdIns pathways is the precursor PtdIns-4-P, synthesized by PtdIns 4-kinases. The subcellular distribution of mammalian PtdIns 4-kinases has been studied. The majority of PtdIns 4-kinase activity in human cells is membrane-bound (12Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PtdIns 4-kinase activity is detected in most membrane structures, including plasma membrane (13Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), nuclear envelope (14Smith C.D. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9368-9373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysosome, Golgi apparatus (15Jergil B. Sundler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7968-7973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and endoplasmic reticulum (16Cockcroft S. Taylor J.A. Judah J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PtdIns 4-kinase activity is also detected in coated vesicles, glucose transporter-containing vesicles (17Del Vecchio R.L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several specialized organelles, such as chromaffin granules (18Husebye E.S. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and secretory vesicles from mast cells (19Kurosawa M. Parker C.W. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 22-616Google Scholar). In addition, cytosolic PtdIns 4-kinases have been described (20Husebye E.S. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In view of such a wide subcellular distribution, it has long been speculated that different isoforms, targeted to different intracellular compartments, perform different physiological functions. While there is some evidence suggesting that distinct isozymes of PtdIns 4-kinase may be targeted to distinct organelles and be independently regulated, previous studies have been limited by lack of cDNA clones and isoform specific antibodies. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, only two PtdIns 4-kinase isoforms are found in the entire genome. PIK1, the first PtdIns 4-kinase to be cloned, encodes a nuclear-associated PtdIns 4-kinase of 125 kDa that is indispensable for cell growth (21Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Garcia B.J. Marini F. Stevenson I. Frei C. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutants arrest in G2 due to defects in cytokinesis. A second yeast gene, STT4, encodes a 200-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase that appears to be cytosolic and is dispensable for growth. Genetic studies of STT4 suggest its involvement in the protein kinase C pathway (23Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, the yeast PtdIns 3-kinase, Vps34, is required for vesicle trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole (9Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Interestingly FAB1, a yeast gene that is homologous to the mammalian PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase, is required for normal vacuole function and morphology (25Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because PtdIns 4-kinase generates PtdIns-4-P, the precursor for subsequent phosphorylation by downstream PtdIns kinases, PtdIns 4-kinases must play either a direct or an indirect role in vesicular trafficking (26Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the cloning and characterization of the first mammalian PtdIns 4-kinase, named PI4Kα (1Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is highly homologous to the yeast STT4 enzyme. Northern blot analysis of the poly(A)+ mRNAs from human tissues and cell lines revealed multiple alternatively spliced transcripts. A 230-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase made from an alternatively spliced form of the rat PI4Kα has recently been described (27Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A bovine gene encoding a 170–200-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase that shares more than 95% identity with the human PI4Kα in the overlapping region has also been reported (2Gehrmann T. Vereb G. Schmidt M. Klix D. Meyer H.E. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It represents probably another splice variant of PI4Kα. More recently, we isolated another human cDNA that encodes a 110-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase (named PI4Kβ) that is more homologous to the yeast PIK1 gene. PI4Kβ is wortmannin-sensitive and may be the same enzyme recently reported to be involved in the hormone sensitive pools of inositol phospholipids (28Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To determine the relative roles of these enzymes in producing phosphoinositides for membrane trafficking, hormone sensitive PtdIns turnover, growth factor-dependent PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, it is first important to determine the subcellular locations of these enzymes. PtdIns, [γ-32-P] ATP, and silica gel plates were purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL), DuPont NEN, and E. Merck (Germany), respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5, reactive to the influenza virus hemagglutinin, was purchased from BabCo. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PI4Kα antibody 3334 was raised to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 501–512, KPYPKGDERKKA, coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin (1Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide antibodies were affinity-purified prior to immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining experiments. Anti-PI4Kβ antibody was raised against a GST-fusion protein that was generated by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers that generate amino acids 410–538 of PI4Kβ (3Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Anti-BiP and anti-γ-adaptin were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. and Sigma, respectively. The 2.6-kilobase pair PI4Kα was tagged at the amino terminus with a 9-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin by insertion into Bluescript encoding the epitope sequence. The tagged cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). The construct was transiently transfected into CHO or HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacture's procedures. The tagged cDNA was also subcloned into a baculoviral expression vector. Recombinant viruses were generated with the linear AcMNPV transfection module (Invitrogen) and were plaque-purified prior to use. The GST-PI4Kβ construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction as described in detail elsewhere (3Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and was expressed in Escherichia coliby standard procedures. The fusion protein is predicted to be 120 kDa since it lacks the amino-terminal 82 amino acids of PI4Kβ. Adherent parental CHO-IRS or CHO-IRS cells transfected with PI4Kα were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmEDTA and 1 mm EGTA. Cells were pelleted and then resuspended in homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After swelling for 15 min on ice, the cells were Dounce-homogenized (25–35 strokes). Nuclei and unbroken cells were spun out at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a SW55Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). The membrane pellet was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in homogenizing buffer. The cytosolic and particulate fractions were adjusted to equal volume. Fractionation procedures were performed according to Storrie and Madden (29Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-IRS cells transfected with PI4Kα were disrupted by low pressure nitrogen cavitation in 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.4, containing various proteinase inhibitors. After centrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min, the postnuclear supernatant was collected and overlaid on a hybrid percoll/metrizamide discontinuous density gradient (5 ml of 6% Percoll, 2 ml of 17% metrizamide, 2 ml of 35% metrizamide). The step gradient was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a SW44Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). Interfaces were sequentially removed from the top of the gradient as follows: first the top of the gradient, followed by the postnuclear supernatant in 0.25 m sucrose, the sucrose/Percoll interface, the 6% Percoll/17% metrizamide interface where lysosomes sediment, and finally the 17%/35% metrizamide interface where mitochondria sediment. Alkaline phosphodiesterase, cytochrome c oxidase, β-hexosaminidase, and α-mannosidase II were used as the marker enzymes for plasma membrane, mitochondria, lysosomes, and Golgi apparatus, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase was used as a cytosol marker. Each of the enzyme assays was performed as described previously (29Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized and nonspecific reactive sites were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% normal goat and donkey serum. Cells were then incubated with the appropriate primary PtdIns 4-kinase isoform-specific antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were detected by species-specific secondary antibodies, namely CyTM3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. ER was identified by staining BiP, a resident ER protein. Golgi was visualized using anti-γ-adaptin. The immunostained cells were observed by either conventional light or confocal microscopy. PtdIns kinase assays were performed as described previously (30Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 0.3% Triton X-100, 50 μm ATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated lipids, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) per sample. Assays were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and then stopped with 25 μl of 5 n hydrochloric acid. The lipid was extracted with 160 μl of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol. The organic layer was collected and analyzed by both thin layer chromatography and HPLC as described in detail elsewhere (31Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 155-162Google Scholar). Since the 97-kDa form of PI4Kα and the PI4Kβ enzyme have similar mobilities on SDS-gels, it is critical to verify that the antibodies raised against the highly divergent regions of these two enzymes indeed do not cross-react. We assessed the isozyme specificity of the PtdIns 4-kinase antibodies by immunoblotting the recombinant PI4Kα and PI4Kβ that were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and in E. coli, respectively. Fig.1 shows that PI4Kα antibody detected a single band of 97-kDa protein only in Sf9 cells expressing PI4Kα (left panel, lane 3). No immunoreactivity was observed in either Sf9 cells expressing wild-type viral proteins (left panel, lane 4) or in E. coli expressing PI4Kβ (left panel, lane 2). Conversely, when the blot was reprobed with anti-PI4Kβ antibody, it reacted with the 120-kDa GST-PI4Kβ only in cells subjected to the induction of expression (right panel, lane 2) and not in the nontransformed E. coli (right panel, lane 1). The immunoreactivity was specific to PI4Kβ and not to the GST motif, since the GST-cleared antibodies still detected the 120-kDa PI4Kβ fusion protein (3Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the antibodies are highly specific, and therefore suitable for immunocytochemical localization of PtdIns 4-kinase isozymes. CHO cells were selected to investigate the locations of PtdIns 4-kinases because these cells have been well characterized in subcellular fractionation studies and because they are convenient for transient gene expression. Since the PI4Kα and PI4Kβ genes are almost ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (1Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and since the antibodies raised against these enzymes react with the respective proteins in other mammalian tissues (not shown), we first investigated the ability of these antibodies to blot proteins in CHO cells. The anti-PI4Kα antibodies did not detect a 97-kDa PI4Kα isoform in the parental CHO cells (Fig. 2 A, left panel), but strongly reacted with an approximately 180-kDa protein (p180) of the size expected for the high molecular weight alternative splice of PI4Kα (2Gehrmann T. Vereb G. Schmidt M. Klix D. Meyer H.E. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the ubiquitous expression of the 7.5-kilobase pair message for PI4Kα (1Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

The PI4Kβ antibody reacted with an approximately 110-kDa band (Fig.2 A, right panel), consistent with the size of this protein previously detected in Jurkat cells (3Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The postnuclear supernatants from the PI4Kα transfected cells were separated into soluble and particulate fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g. The 97-kDa PI4Kα was predominantly associated with the particulate fraction (Fig. 2 B, left panel), as was p180. p110 PI4Kβ was found predominantly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B, right panel). To further investigate the intracellular localization of PtdIns 4-kinase isoforms, cells overexpressing PI4Kα were fractionated using the hybrid Percoll/metrizamide discontinuous density gradient as described previously (29Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This gradient allows the isolation of lysosomes, mitochondria, and partial separation of plasma membrane from cytosol and organelles such as ER and Golgi. Interfaces sequentially collected from the top of the step gradient were adjusted to the same volume. Equal portions of individual fractions were then used for organelle marker enzyme assays, and for Western blot analysis with the anti-PtdIns 4-kinase antibodies. Monitoring the β-hexosaminidase activities, we found 85% of the lysosomes sedimented at the interface of Percoll/17% metrizamide as expected (Table I). The cytochrome c oxidase assays indicated that 69% of the mitochondria sedimented to the 17%/35% metrizamide interface, and 22% remained in the Percoll/17% metrizamide interface. Western blot revealed no significant amounts of anti-PI4Kα or anti-PI4Kβ reactive protein present in these two fractions. Instead, p97 PI4Kα, PI4Kβ, and the anti-PI4Kα reactive p180 concentrated at the top of the gradient and in the 0.25 m sucrose fraction (Fig.3), where over 95% of Golgi apparatus and 40% of plasma membrane cofractionated (Table I). About 40% of the plasma membrane marker activity was also present at the sucrose/Percoll interface, but PI4Kα and β were not detected in this fraction, suggesting that they are not associated with this fraction of the plasma membrane.Table ISummary of organelle marker enzyme assays and the distribution of PtdIns 4-kinase isozymesTop fractionSucroseSucrose/PercollPercoll/17% metrizamide17%/35% metrizamide%Alkaline phosphodiesterase I (plasma membrane)182239183α-Mannosidase II (golgi apparatus)4454110β-Hexosaminidase (lysosome)0312850Cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondria)1262269Total PtdIns 4-kinase activity2130341504C5G inhibitable activity15212611097-kDa PI4Kα++−−−p180-kDa form++−−−PI4Kβ++−−−Fractions of subcellular organelles obtained from the hybrid Percoll/metrizamide gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”) were assayed for organelle-specific enzyme activities.

The data shown represent the averages of three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Fractions of subcellular organelles obtained from the hybrid Percoll/metrizamide gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”) were assayed for organelle-specific enzyme activities. The percentage of total activity of each organelle marker is presented. Fractions from the same experiment were also assayed for lipid kinase activity. The PtdIns-4-P products generated in individual organelles were separated by TLC, quantified by a PhosphoImager (BioRad), and expressed as the percentage of total activity. The data shown represent the averages of three separate experiments. The various subcellular fractions were also assayed for total PtdIns 4-kinase activity. Although half of the PtdIns 4-kinase activity was detected in the upper two factions where cytosol, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum partition, and where both PI4Kα and PI4Kβ fractionate (Fig. 3), a substantial amount of activity was detected in the region where plasma membranes sediment (34%) and where lysosomes sediment (15%) (Table I). The assay was carried out under conditions in which PtdIns 3-kinase is inactive (0.3% Triton X-100). HPLC analysis of the deacylated products generated under these conditions verified the absence of PtdIns-3-P (Fig. 4). The PtdIns 4-kinase activity was not significantly inhibited by 1 μmwortmannin, indicating that the wortmannin-inhibitable PI4Kβ is not a major component of total activity in these fractions (data not shown). Consistent with previous studies, an inhibitory antibody, 4C5G, raised against the 55-kDa type II PtdIns 4-kinase caused about 75% inhibition of the plasma membrane PtdIns 4-kinase (sucrose/Percoll fraction, TableI). This antibody also substantially inhibited PtdIns 4-kinase activity in other fractions. The 55-kDa type II PtdIns 4-kinase was previously shown to be the major PtdIns 4-kinase in red cell plasma membrane (32Graziani A. Ling L.E. Endemann G. Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in other cells. Thus, the results in Table I indicate that the membrane bound forms of PI4Kα and PI4Kβ are in compartments of the cell consistent with Golgi apparatus and/or endoplasmic reticulum, and that the major PtdIns 4-kinase activity in plasma membrane and lysosome is due to a type II PtdIns 4-kinase distinct from the PI4Kα isoforms and from PI4Kβ. To further discern the intracellular localization of PI4Kα and β, cytoimmunofluorescence studies were performed using both conventional and confocal microscopy. We chose HeLa cells for these studies since they grow better on coverslips and are hence more suitable for immunofluorescent staining experiments. HeLa cells transiently expressing HA-tagged PI4Kα were double stained with anti-PI4Kα (Fig. 5 A) and anti-HA epitope antibodies (Fig. 5 B). The two antibodies yielded identical patterns, suggesting that the staining obtained using anti-PI4Kα antisera was specific. The anti-HA antibody did not stain non-transfected cells (not shown). The anti-PI4Kα antibodies revealed punctate staining near the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, a pattern similar to that expected for ER. To determine whether PI4Kα is present in the ER, we double stained an ER resident protein Bip (Fig. 5 C) and PI4Kα (Fig. 5 D) in parental HeLa cells. Overlap of PI4Kα with the ER marker was clearly observed after merging the two images by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5 E). However, the colocalization was not complete; some punctate staining of PI4Kα in the peripheral regions was not observed to superimpose with BiP staining. As in CHO cells, the major endogenous protein in HeLa cells that reacts with the anti-PI4Kα antibody is the p180 protein (not shown), so this protein appears also to be located in the ER. Immunofluorescent studies with anti-PI4Kβ antibody revealed a pattern characteristic of the Golgi apparatus. Specifically, we noted a crescent of staining on one side of the nucleus (presumably the TGN), and some punctate staining within the cytoplasm which may represent the buds from extended TGN tubules (Fig. 5 G). The Golgi localization was confirmed by double staining γ-adaptin, which has previously been shown to be localized in the TGN and the late endosomes (Fig. 5 F) (33Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this case, complete colocalization was observed (Fig. 5 H). Staining could be eliminated by preincubation of the primary antibody with the immunizing GST-PI4Kβ and not by GST alone (not shown), indicating that the observed signal is generated by PI4Kβ-specific antibodies. Our observation that much of the PI4Kβ protein is in the supernatant of a 100,000 ×g spin (Fig. 2 B) is consistent with several possibilities. First, the lysis and homogenization procedures dislodge some of this protein from the particulate fraction. Second, the cytosolic fraction is partially lost during cell fixation, or last, this fraction is not as easily visualized because of dilution. We compared the subcellular distribution of known mammalian PtdIns 4-kinases. The results demonstrate the differential localization of different isoforms and provide support for the hypothesis that individual members of this family of PtdIns kinases are targeted to distinct subcellular compartments and hence are performing different cellular functions. PI4Kα is detected predominantly in the particulate fraction, and PI4Kβ is present in the cytosol and to a lesser extent in the particulate fraction. Fractionation of CHO-IRS cells revealed that neither the α nor β isoform is located in the lysosomes or mitochondria, and probably not in the plasma membrane. Immunocytofluorescence studies demonstrate that PI4Kα is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, and PI4Kβ is localized to the Golgi region. While this work was in progress, Nakagawa et al. (27Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported the cloning and characterization of an alternative splice of rat PI4Kα gene that generates a protein predicted to be 230 kDa. Gehrmann et al. (2Gehrmann T. Vereb G. Schmidt M. Klix D. Meyer H.E. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) also isolated a partial bovine cDNA encoding a 170–200-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase, that is almost certainly another splice variant of PI4Kα. The carboxyl-terminal half of both high molecular weight proteins contains the domains necessary for lipid catalysis, and share greater than 95% identity with the human p97 PI4Kα. We also noted an alternative splice of PI4Kα from human tissues that is predicted to encode a larger protein (1Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nakagawaet al. (27Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) found that the 97-kDa PI4Kα and the higher molecular weight form colocalize, and the later is predominantly associated with the particulate fraction. These results are consistent with our finding that the p180 and p97 cofractionate and colocalize. It is unlikely that they are integral membrane proteins, since neither splice variant contains a predicted transmembrane domain. However, it is clear from our studies that the membrane association does not require the extended amino-terminal sequence of the higher molecular weight form of PI4Kα. Nakagawa et al. (27Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that Flag-tagged versions of both forms of PI4Kα localize to the Golgi membrane in COS cells. In our study, both the exogenously expressed p97 PI4Kα and the endogenous p180 localize to the ER rather than the Golgi of HeLa cells. The discrepancy cannot be explained by the cell type, since we also obtained ER staining when PI4Kα was expressed in COS cells (not shown). The possibility that the HA-tag affected localization is unlikely, since the endogenous p180 exhibited the same location as the HA-tagged p97. By separating intracellular structures on a step gradient and assaying each fraction for PtdIns kinase activity, we have shown that the lysosomal and plasma membrane-associated PtdIns 4-kinase activities are unlikely to be the result of PI4Kβ or any splice variants of PI4Kα. A plausible candidate is the previously described 55-kDa type II PtdIns 4-kinase. Historically, PtdIns 4-kinases are classified into two categories, types II and type III, on the basis of their molecular sizes, and the differences in their sensitivity to adenosine and nonionic detergent (13Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The type II PtdIns 4-kinase is dramatically activated by nonionic detergent but is potently inhibited by both adenosine and the 4C5G monoclonal antibody (32Graziani A. Ling L.E. Endemann G. Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Type II PtdIns 4-kinase has been purified from erythrocyte membrane (32Graziani A. Ling L.E. Endemann G. Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and also copurified with the epidermal growth factor receptor (35Cochet C. Gill G.N. Meisenhelder J. Cooper J.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2553-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as with the lymphocyte CD4 antigen (36Pertile P. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additional findings have also demonstrated that it is recruited to and activated by epidermal growth factor receptor upon ligand stimulation (37Kauffmann-Zeh A. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Prosser S. Cunningham E. Cockcroft S. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1995; 2685: 1188-1190Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have extensively investigated the possibility that the type II 55-kDa enzyme is a proteolytic product of the 97-kDa PI4Kα since they share similar enzymatic properties. However, we are unable to detect proteins of 55 kDa resulting from the processing of the 97-kDa PI4Kα. Thus, the 55-kDa type II PtdIns 4-kinase appears to be encoded by a distinct but related gene. The finding of the differential ER and Golgi localization of PI4Kα and PI4Kβ suggests a direct role of PI4Kα and β in ER and Golgi function, as opposed to the ligand-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover at the plasma membrane. The finding that PI4Kβ is wortmannin-sensitive (IC50, 140 nm) and is located in the Golgi apparatus should caution future studies employing wortmannin inhibition as the standard of implicating the role of PtdIns 3-kinase in targeting proteins from Golgi apparatus to lysosome. Finally, our results do not exclude other sites of PtdIns 4-kinase function. For example, the colocalization of ER marker was not complete for PI4Kα. We also noticed a significant amount of PI4Kα in the particulate fraction that could not be extracted with detergent, implicating cytoskeletal association. Future studies with dominant negative forms or gene knockouts will elucidate the roles of these enzymes in mammalian cell function.

Nedd2/ICH-1 (caspase-2) stands alone in the third caspase subfamily, and to date no systematic study has been carried out to evaluate its activation during apoptosis. Once activated, the caspases cleave a range of cellular substrates. The DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) was one of the first identified cellular substrates cleaved during apoptosis (30Kaufmann S.H.

Overexpression of Nedd2 induces apoptosis in various cell types (2Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 37Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J.

FEBS Letters. 1995; 368: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, an alternatively spliced form of Nedd2 that encodes a truncated protein has been shown to protect against cell death induced by serum withdrawal in Rat-1 and NIH-3T3 cells (37Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 40Kumar, S., Kinoshita, M., Dorstyn, L., and Noda, M. (1997) Cell Death & Differ., in press.Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Nedd2 mRNA has been observed in response to ischaemia-induced cell death in the Mongolian gerbil (41Kinoshita, M., Tomimoto, H., Kinoshita, A., Kumar, S., and Noda, M. (1997) J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar), whereas down-regulation of Nedd2 has been observed during gonadotropin-promoted follicular survival (42Flaws J.A. Kuju K. Trbovich A.M. DeSanti A. Tilly K.I. Hirshfield A.N. Tilly J.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5042-5053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Nedd2 has been shown to associate via its pro-domain with RAIDD, a death adaptor molecule that is thought to be involved in death signaling through the TNF-R1 complex via association with the death domain proteins RIP and TRADD (43Duan and Dixit Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). An analogous association occurs between the pro-domain of MACH/FLICE/Mch5 and the death adaptor molecule MORT1/FADD, which recruits MACH/FLICE/Mch5 to the Fas/Apo1 signaling complex in response to Fas-induced apoptosis (23Boldin M.P.

This suggests that MACH/FLICE/Mch5 activation is the most upstream enzymatic event in the Fas/Apo1 signaling pathway and that MACH/FLICE could subsequently activate other downstream caspases, resulting in apoptotic death. In a similar manner, Nedd2 activation may be an early, upstream event in TNF-R1-induced apoptosis. In this report we show that proNedd2 is rapidly cleaved to generate active enzyme subunits in response to various apoptotic stimuli and that Nedd2 activation precedes the activation of CPP32. These observations demonstrate that Nedd2/ICH1 is a caspase that is activated early in the apoptotic cascade. The human megakaryoblastic cell line Mo7e was maintained in suspension culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml (Amgen). The Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL30A and BL30K were maintained in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing either 20% (BL30A) or 10% (BL30K) fetal calf serum. Cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by withdrawal of IL-3 and/or serum or by exposure to either etoposide (40 μm) or 30 Gy of γ-irradiation from a 137Cs source. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared essentially as described (44Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farchon D.M. Wong H.G. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended (100 μl/107 cells) in ice-cold cell extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 20 min and then lysed by freeze/thawing twice. Cell lysis was confirmed by trypan blue uptake. Lysates were centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were then removed and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The clear cytosol was removed and either used immediately or stored at −70 °C. Cytoplasmic extracts (50 μg of total protein) were boiled in protein loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue) for 5 min and then centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 5 min. The denatured proteins were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (DuPont NEN). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. Blots were probed with either an anti-ICH-1Lpolyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech., Inc.) at a 1:500 dilution for 4 h, anti-Mch3 polyclonal antiserum (kindly donated by Dr. G. Cohen) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 2 h, an anti-PARP polyclonal antiserum (Boehringer Mannheim) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h, or an anti-CPP32 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Labs.) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 4 h at room temperature. This was followed by incubation with anti-rabbit (ICH-1L, Mch3, and PARP) or anti-mouse (CPP32) IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) for 1 h. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Cytoplasmic extracts (10 μg of total protein) were incubated with 100 μm DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin or YVAD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (both from Enzyme Systems Inc.) at 37 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 20 μl in cleavage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS). The tetrapeptide inhibitors DEVD-CHO and YVAD-CHO (Bachem) used at a final concentration of 1 μm were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with cytoplasmic extracts in a 10-μl volume prior to the addition of fluorogenic substrate. Fluorescence was quantified using an Aminco Bowman Luminescence Spectrophotometer (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). The cDNA construct pBS hPARP encompassing a truncated region of human PARP cDNA from nucleotide 93 to nucleotide 1156 (amino acids 1–339 containing the DEVD cleavage site at amino acid residues 211–214) was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primer 5′-CGGAATTCTAGGTCGTGCGTCGG-3′ was designed to contain an EcoRI site (underlined), and the downstream primer used was 5′-GGAATATACGGTCCTGCT-3′. The pBS hPARP construct was used as a template for the production of [35S]methionine (ICN)-labeled PARP protein using the Promega TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System. 5 μl of labeled product was incubated in proteolysis assays at 37 °C for 1 h with cytoplasmic extracts from apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells (10 μg of total protein) in cleavage buffer in a total volume of 20 μl. Cleavage products were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (DuPont NEN) using a semi-dry apparatus (Hoeffer), and visualized by autoradiography. To investigate the magnitude and specificity of protease activity induced by various apoptotic stimuli, the tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates DEVD-AFC and YVAD-AFC were utilized. The fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AFC mimics the cleavage site at which CPP32 and CPP32-like caspases cleave PARP, whereas the YVAD-AFC substrate is specific for caspases closely related to ICE. Cleavage of these substrates by cellular cytoplasmic extracts is thus indicative ofin vivo proteolytic activation of these caspases in response to apoptotic signals. We initially studied caspase activation in the factor-dependent hemopoietic cell line Mo7e, which undergoes apoptosis in response to the removal of IL-3 and serum from its growth medium. Following withdrawal of IL-3 and serum from Mo7e, there was a significant, time-dependent increase in the level of DEVD-AFC cleavage, indicating the progressive activation of CPP32 and/or its close relatives in these cells. This activation reflected the progressive increase in the number of apoptotic cells as measured by trypan blue exclusion and nuclear staining (not shown), although an increase in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity was obvious prior to any significant cell death (Fig. 1 A). Cleavage of DEVD-AFC by cytoplasmic extracts from factor-deprived Mo7e cells was completely inhibited by preincubation of the cell extracts with the tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor of CED-3-like caspases, DEVD-CHO. No cleavage of YVAD-AFC was observed at any time after IL-3 and serum withdrawal, indicating that ICE and its closest relatives are not activated in response to this stimulus in these cells (data not shown). Exposure of Mo7e cells to 40 μm etoposide or 30-Gy γ-irradiation also resulted in a progressive increase in CPP32-like activity that correlated with the increase in the number of apoptotic cells as measured by trypan blue exclusion and nuclear staining (Fig.1, B and C). As previously observed, significant substrate cleavage activity was evident before any morphological appearance of apoptosis. DEVD-AFC cleavage activity of cell extracts was inhibited by preincubation of the extracts with 1 μmDEVD-CHO. Once again, there was no increase in caspase activity on the YVAD-AFC substrate (data not shown). In addition to the Mo7e cell line, we studied the activation of caspases in two isogenic Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines that are sensitive (BL30A) and resistant (BL30K) to the induction of apoptosis by genotoxic agents (45Khanna K.K. Wie T. Song Q. Burrows S.R. Moss D.J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Lavin M.F. Cell Death & Differ. 1996; 3: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar). As for Mo7e cells, the treatment of BL30A cells with 40 μmetoposide induced a progressive increase in the magnitude of apoptotic cells and CPP32-like activity. In contrast, BL30K cells that remain viable following etoposide treatment did not show any increase in CPP32-like activity, confirming that the activation of CPP32-like caspases occurs during cell death (Fig. 2 A). In a similar manner, BL30A cells treated with 30-Gy γ-irradiation exhibited a time-dependent increase in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity, whereas BL30K cells were resistant to apoptosis and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from these cells did not display any increase in CPP32-like caspase activity (Fig. 2 B). We consistently observed a low level of DEVD-AFC cleavage in untreated Mo7e and BL30A cells. This may be a consequence of the low percentage of apoptotic cells in the normal cell population (approximately 3%). To further investigate the proteolytic activity in apoptotic and nonapoptotic extracts from Mo7e, BL30A, and BL30K cells, we examined the cleavage of PARP both in vitro and in vivo. It has been previously shown that CPP32, Mch3, and Mch2 cleave PARP efficiently (16Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18715-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts from Mo7e cells following factor withdrawal or treatment with etoposide or γ-irradiation cleaved in vitrotranslated [35S]methionine-labeled PARP at the CPP32-like caspase recognition sequence, liberating 24- and 14-kDa polypeptides from the truncated 38-kDa PARP substrate (Fig. 1, A,B, and C). Similarly, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from BL30A cells following treatment with apoptosis inducing stimuli contained PARP cleavage activity, whereas those prepared from BL30K cells did not (Fig. 2, A and B). As previously seen in fluorogenic substrate cleavage experiments, a marginal base-line level of CPP32-like activity was observed in untreated cells. These experiments confirm that activation of CPP32-like proteases occurs in both Mo7e and BL30A cells early during apoptosis. Western analysis indicated that in Mo7e cells, PARP was rapidly cleavedin vivo to 89- and 24-kDa products in response to IL-3 withdrawal, etoposide, and γ-irradiation, with the 115-kDa precursor completely cleaved within the first 4 h following IL-3 withdrawal and within the first 2 h following etoposide treatment or γ-irradiation (Fig. 3). The complete proteolysis of PARP significantly preceded the appearance of apoptotic cells, suggesting that caspase activation occurs prior to the morphological changes of apoptotic cell death. Activation of Nedd2 requires the cleavage of the 51-kDa precursor molecule into subunits of 19 and 12 kDa (47Harvey N.L. Trapani J.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Kumar S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 48Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Having established that the cytoplasmic extracts from cells treated with apoptotic stimuli contained CPP32-like caspase activity, we investigated whether proNedd2 is cleaved to generate the p19 and p12 subunits in response to apoptotic stimuli. We examined the activation of Nedd2 by Western blotting with an antiserum against the p12 subunit of human Nedd2 that recognizes both p12 and p51 proNedd2. In Mo7e cells, IL-3/serum withdrawal and etoposide or γ-irradiation treatment resulted in the cleavage of p51 and the appearance of p12 (Fig. 3, A,B, and C). From time course studies, the activation of Nedd2 appears to be rapid, detectable as early as 4 h after IL-3 and serum withdrawal and as early as 2 h following exposure to etoposide and γ-irradiation. This correlates well with the first significant increase in fluorogenic substrate cleavage and PARP cleavage, both in vitro and in vivo (Figs.1, 2, 3). In BL30A cells, but not in apoptosis-resistant BL30K cells, progressive proteolysis of p51 proNedd2 over time was observed in response to treatment with both etoposide and γ-irradiation (Fig.4, A and B). Although the majority of activity on DEVD-AFC observed in our experiments is probably due to CPP32 and caspases closely related to it, we and others have observed the ability of Nedd2 to cleave the DEVD substrate (49Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). 2N. L. Harvey and S. Kumar, unpublished observations. Therefore, it is possible that some DEVD-AFC cleavage may be attributed to activated Nedd2, the optimal substrate of which is thus far unknown. To investigate at which stage in the apoptotic pathway Nedd2 activation occurs in relation to that of other caspases, we assessed the activation of CPP32 by Western blotting using an anti-CPP32 monoclonal antibody that detects both proCPP32 and the p17 subunit. We did not observe significant cleavage of CPP32 in Mo7e cells subjected to IL-3/serum withdrawal or treated with either etoposide or γ-irradiation at time points where proNedd2 was completely cleaved (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). In later time points some cleavage of proCPP32 was evident (data not shown). These results indicate that in the apoptotic pathway, Nedd2 activation occurs upstream of CPP32 activation in Mo7e cells. Activation of CPP32 was clearly observed in BL30A cells following treatment with both etoposide and γ-irradiation (Fig. 4, Aand B). The appearance of the CPP32 p17 subunit was visible approximately 3 h post treatment with etoposide, once again a later stage than the initial activation of Nedd2, visible 2 h post treatment (Fig. 4 A). An analogous situation was observed in response to γ-irradiation (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, no cleavage of CPP32 precursor was seen in extracts from the nonresponsive BL30K cells treated with etoposide or γ-irradiation. Because no early activation of CPP32 was observed in Mo7e cells, we investigated the activation of Mch3, the caspase most homologous to CPP32. Western blotting with an anti-Mch3 polyclonal antiserum revealed that proMch3 is rapidly processed, as evident by the disappearance of the precursor, in response to all apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 3, A–C). In our experiments, the activation of Mch3 appears to occur concurrently with that of Nedd2 and correlates with the cleavage of PARP we observed in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have demonstrated the activation of CPP32, Mch2, and ICE-LAP3 caspases in response to various apoptotic stimuli (20Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M.

We sought to investigate whether the Nedd2/ICH1 caspase is activated in response to various apoptosis inducing stimuli and at what stage in the protease cascade pathway this occurs. Here we show that Nedd2 is activated early in the passage of events that leads to the execution of cell death, preceding the activation of CPP32. In the megakaryoblastic cell line Mo7e, the activation of Nedd2 occurred much before the activation of CPP32; however, in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL30A, CPP32 activation followed Nedd2 activation much more rapidly. It is becoming clear that in addition to the division of the caspases into subfamilies by virtue of their relatedness, caspases can be divided into two classes based on the length of their amino-terminal pro-domains and their position in the caspase heirachy. Proteases containing a long pro-domain include CED-3, Nedd2/ICH-1, Mch4, MACH/FLICE/Mch5, ICE, TX, and ICErel-III, whereas those with very short or absent pro-domains include CPP32, Mch2, Mch3, and Mch6. The pro-domains of Nedd2 and MACH/FLICE/Mch5 have been shown to contain protein motifs that mediate their association with similar motifs present in the amino termini of RAIDD and MORT1/FADD, respectively (23Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 24Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A.

The carboxyl termini of the RAIDD and MORT1/FADD molecules harbor a “death domain,” a motif first identified in TNF-R1 (50Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) and Fas/Apo1 receptors (51Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that serves to mediate homo- and heterotypic protein associations necessary for cell death. A death domain also mediates the association of MORT1/FADD with TRADD, an adaptor protein involved in the TNF-R1 cell death pathway (52Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two cell death pathways may be linked. Mch4 also contains a long pro-domain that harbors death effector domains (22Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Kreb J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Mch4 and Mch5 have both been shown to activate all known caspasesin vitro, although they differ with respect to their inhibition by CrmA (53Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), suggesting that several parallel pathways to cell death may exist that utilize the same effector machinery but are initialized by different upstream caspases in response to different stimuli. From our data obtained in Mo7e, it appears that CPP32 may not be involved in the apoptotic pathway in these cells. Instead, the function of CPP32 may be replaced by Mch3, which we observed to be rapidly cleaved following apoptotic stimuli. Mch3 may be the caspase responsible for PARP cleavage in these cells. It is not known whether Nedd2 is responsible for Mch3 cleavage in Mo7e cells or whether another caspase member such as Mch4 or Mch5 is activated in response to these stimuli and proceeds to activate Mch3. We have previously shown that Nedd2 is unable to cleave CPP32 in vitro (47Harvey N.L. Trapani J.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Kumar S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which suggests that another protease that is activated early in the caspase cascade such as Mch4 or Mch5 may be responsible for the cleavage of CPP32 we observed in BL30A cells. Alternatively, Nedd2 may activate an unidentified caspase, which in turn activates CPP32. These results lend weight to the classification of caspases in a hierarchy based on their sequence of activation in response to apoptotic stimuli. It appears that caspases containing long pro-domains that mediate their direct physical coupling to signal transduction machinery constitute the first class of proteases to be activated in response to apoptotic signals and that they in turn activate the second class of caspases, which are the cell death effectors. Our results show that Nedd2/ICH-1 is activated in response to various apoptotic stimuli and that this activation occurs at an earlier stage in the caspase hierarchy than that of CPP32, suggesting that Nedd2 belongs to the first group of caspases activated in response to apoptotic stimuli. The interaction of Nedd2 with RAIDD suggests that Nedd2 might be activated in response to TNF or Fas-mediated apoptosis, but our results demonstrate that Nedd2 activation also occurs in response to other apoptosis inducing stimuli. Nedd2 may therefore also comprise part of the signaling complex that transduces death signals from stimuli such as factor withdrawal, drug treatment, and γ-irradiation, although the identity of the other components of this complex and their location in the cell is currently not known. In future studies it will be interesting to examine if Nedd2, once activated, can further process other members of the caspase family, thereby initiating the proteolytic cascade characteristic of the execution phase of apoptosis. It will also be interesting to see whether the Nedd2 prodomain can interact with other, as yet unidentified, adaptor molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2009942259,"Snake venom hemorrhagic metalloproteinase toxins that have metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains are significantly more potent than toxins with only a metalloproteinase domain. The disintegrin-like domains of these toxins differ from the disintegrin peptides found in crotalid and viperid venoms by the nature of their different disulfide bond structure and, in lieu of the disintegrins' signature Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin binding sequence, there is an XXCD disulfide-bonded cysteinyl sequence in that region. Due to these apparent differences, the contribution to the overall function of the hemorrhagic metalloproteinases by the disintegrin-like domain has been unknown. In this investigation we have expressed in insect cells the disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich (DC) domains of the Crotalus atrox hemorrhagic metalloproteinase atrolysin A and demonstrated that the recombinant protein (A/DC) can inhibit collagen- and ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation. Using synthetic peptides, we have evidence that the region of the disintegrin-like domain that is positionally analogous to the RGD loop of the disintegrins is the site responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation. For these synthetic peptides to have significant inhibitory activity, the -RSECD- cysteinyl residue must be constrained by participation in a disulfide bond with another cysteinyl residue. The two acidic amino acids adjacent to the middle cysteinyl residue in these peptides are also important for biological activity. These studies emphasize a functional role for the disintegrin-like domain in toxins and suggest structural possibilities for the design of antagonists of platelet aggregation.

These studies emphasize a functional role for the disintegrin-like domain in toxins and suggest structural possibilities for the design of antagonists of platelet aggregation. The distinctive characteristic of envenomation by a crotalid or viperid snake is local and in severe cases systemic hemorrhage. The profuse hemorrhage observed is usually due to the synergistic action of a large number of toxins in the venom (1Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Teng C.-M. Huang T.-F. Platelets. 1991; 2: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the toxins primarily responsible for hemorrhage are snake venom zinc metalloproteinases (SVMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: SVMPs, snake venom metalloproteinases; Acm, acetoamidomethyl; AcNMPV: A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus; ADAMs, adisintegrin-like andmetalloproteinase proteins; A/DC, recombinant disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich protein from atrolysin A; MALD-TOF, matrix assisted laser desorption-time of flight; MDCs,metalloproteinase disintegrin-likecysteine-rich proteins; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. which are members of the reprolysin subfamily of the M12 family of metalloproteinases (3Bjarnason J.B.

These toxins, as isolated from crude venom, belong to one of three related structural classes, P-I, -II, and -III, which primarily differ from one another by the presence of additional domains on the carboxyl side of the metalloproteinase domain (4Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The P-I class has only a metalloproteinase domain, whereas the P-II class has a disintegrin or disintegrin-like domain carboxyl to the proteinase domain. The P-III class metalloproteinases have yet another domain, the cysteine-rich domain, which is found carboxyl to the disintegrin-like domain. The P-III class of venom metalloproteinases is related to the ADAMs/MDCs group of type I integral membrane protein. These protein groups have homologous proteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain structures, and these proteinases are classified as members of the reprolysin subfamily of metalloproteinases (5Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, the ADAMs/MDC proteinases possess additional carboxyl-terminal structures comprised of epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains (6Primakoff P. Hyatt H.

The biological function of many of the ADAMs/MDCs proteins is unclear, except for the fertilins α and β, which are involved in egg-sperm fusion (10Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A., M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), meltrins, which are involved in myoblast fusion (11Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y.-I. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and KUZ, a Drosophila protein which participates in neurogenesis (12Rooke J. Pan D. Xu T. Rubin G.M. Science. 1996; 273: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the case of the fertilins, which are the most functionally characterized of the group, the disintegrin-like domain of fertilin is thought to modulate egg-sperm fusion by interaction of the disintegrin-like domain of the sperm fertilin with the α6β1 integrin on the egg (13Myles D.G. Kimmel L.H. Blobel C.P. White J.M. Primakoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4195-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The structural features of the disintegrin-like domain important in this interaction are not known with certainty but may involve a specific sequence of the disintegrin-like domain of fertilin (13Myles D.G. Kimmel L.H. Blobel C.P. White J.M. Primakoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4195-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Disintegrins are peptides, isolated from the venoms of crotalid and viperid snakes, and range in length from 49 to 84 amino acid residues. They function as potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation (14Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloczewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gould R.J.

The RGD sequence in a 13-residue β-loop structure (the RGD loop) is the critical structural moiety responsible for biological activity and is central to the interaction of the disintegrins with the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (17Dennis M.S. Carter P. Lazarus R.A. Proteins. 1993; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Lazarus R.A. McDowell R.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The disulfide bond structure of these peptides also contributes to the activity of the disintegrins (19Calvete J.J. Schäfer W. Soszka T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5225-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Gan Z.-R. Gould R.J. Jacobs J.W. Friedman P.A. Polokoff M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19827-19832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disintegrins are derived from homologous precursors of the P-II class of snake venom metalloproteinases by the processing of precursors comprised of pre-, pro-, metalloproteinase, and disintegrin domains (21Au L.-C. Chou J.-S. Chang K.-J. Teh G.W. Lin S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The homologous region of the class P-III SVMPs differs from the disintegrins and their P-II precursors in several ways. Due to these differences, we have termed them “disintegrin-like” domains. Disintegrin-like domains have two additional cysteinyl residues compared with the disintegrins, and therefore the disulfide bond arrangement is likely to be different. We hypothesize that one of these cysteines is involved in a disulfide bond with a region amino-terminal to the disintegrin-like domain (the spacer region) which links the disintegrin-like domain with the proteinase domain (Fig.1). The other cysteinyl residue is thought to be in a disulfide bond linkage with a cysteinyl residue in the cysteine-rich domain carboxyl to the disintegrin-like domain (22Fox J.W. Bjarnason J.B. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 47-82Google Scholar). This would form the spacer region, the disintegrin-like domain, and cysteine-rich domain into one continuous, disulfide bond-interconnected structure. The other notable difference between the disintegrin-like domains of the SVMPs and the disintegrin peptides is that while most disintegrins contain the RGD integrin-binding consensus sequence, to date no disintegrin-like domain of the class P-III SVMPs has been reported with the RGD consensus sequence. Furthermore, the additional cysteinyl residue found in theXX CD sequence described above for disintegrin-like domains lies in the middle of the loop where in the disintegrins the RGD sequence is located. Therefore, the topology of the disintegrin-like domain in this area is probably very different from that observed in the disintegrins proper (23Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1749-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Adler M. Carter P. Lazarus R.A. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This would certainly be the case if that cysteinyl residue were involved in a disulfide bond. Since the class P-III hemorrhagic proteinases are significantly more potent than the class P-I toxins, we hypothesize that the additional carboxyl domains in the P-III toxins make an important contribution to the overall higher potency of this class of hemorrhagic toxins (22Fox J.W. Bjarnason J.B. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 47-82Google Scholar). To explore this concept, we have expressed in insect cells the combined disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains (A/DC) of atrolysin A, the most potent hemorrhagic toxin from the western diamondback rattlesnakeCrotalus atrox. We now report on the ability of the recombinant A/DC protein as well as synthetic peptides designed from the SECD sequence region of the disintegrin-like domain to inhibit platelet aggregation. The structural role of the middle cysteinyl residue and adjacent acidic residues in the SECD loop region of disintegrin-like domains is also described. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to clone the A/DC fragment into the baculovirus pMbac vector (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). The DNA fragment encoding the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of atrolysin A was generated by polymerase chain reaction from an atrolysin A cDNA clone (4Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers were designed for the polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning. The upstream primer was 5′-CAATGACCCGGGGCAAACAGATATAATTTCAC-3′ and the downstream primer used was 5′-GATCTGGATCCTCAAATCTGAGAGAAGCCAGA-3′. These two primers were designed to include SmaI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, for in-frame insertion into theSmaI/BamHI-linearized pMbac vector. The pMbac vector contains the signal sequence for melittin so that the recombinant protein should be secreted into the media. Prior to ligation into the pMbac vector, the A/DC polymerase chain reaction fragment (657 base pairs) was ligated into the pCR II TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) for propagation and then restriction withSmaI/BamHI. The accuracy and frame information of A/DC in the pMbac vector was confirmed by complete DNA sequence and restriction analysis of the insert (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by co-transfection of Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells with the pMbac vector containing the A/DC insert (pMbac/A/DC) and AcNMPV nuclear polyhedrosis virus according to manufacturer's instructions (BaculoGold Transfection Kit, PharMingen). Plaque assays were performed, and following three rounds of plaque purification a population of homogeneous, recombinant A/DC baculovirus particles were obtained. Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2–3 × 10−6 cell/ml were transfected with the recombinant baculovirus at a ratio of 10 plaque-forming units per insect cell. The infected cells were harvested after 4 days by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 3000 rpm. The pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then disrupted in a French press. The suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 × g and the resultant supernatant dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 at 4 °C. The dialyzed solution was then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange column (1.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with dialysate buffer, and the column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl in the equilibration buffer. Fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1979; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and by Western blot analysis using an anti-atrolysin A polyclonal antibody (27Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). The fractions identified as containing A/DC were pooled and dialyzed against the standard equilibration buffer. This dialyzed solution was then applied to a MonoQ 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the column was developed with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in the equilibration buffer. Pooled fractions containing A/DC were concentrated using a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon) and then loaded onto a Sephacryl S200 (Pharmacia) column (1.5 × 150 cm) developed with a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions containing the A/DC protein, which were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis following this chromatography, were pooled, concentrated with a Centricon-30 cartridge, and stored at −20 °C. Isolated A/DC protein was subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis on an ABI 470A protein sequencer operated according to manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass of A/DC was determined by MALD-TOF mass spectrometry using a Finnigan Lasermat 1000 mass spectrometer with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Atrolysin A and recombinant A/DC were alkylated under nonreducing conditions with [14C]iodoacetate (53 mCi/mmol, DuPont NEN) in a 6m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, alkylation buffer. Following alkylation, the proteins were desalted by reverse-phase chromatography on a C-8 (5 μm) column (5 × 30 mm) with a two-buffer gradient elution (buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and buffer B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% CNCH3 and 20% H2O). Fractions containing14C-labeled A/DC were detected by absorbance at 214 nm, SDS-PAGE/autoradiography and by scintillation counting. AnotherC. atrox hemorrhagic metalloproteinase, atrolysin E, which has been demonstrated to contain a free cysteinyl residue (28Hite L.A. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was subjected to the same alkylation procedure for use as a positive control. All peptides were synthesized at the 50-μmol scale on a Symphony multiple peptide synthesizer (Rainin) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as suggested by the manufacturer and modified according to individual peptide sequences (29Pöschl E. Fox J.W. Block D. Mayer U. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Peptide amide linker resin with 0.37 mmol/g substitution (PerSeptive Biosystems) was used as the solid support. Cleavage and deprotection of the peptides were performed on the synthesizer using 88% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% diisopropylsilane, 5% H2O, and 5% phenol. Following cleavage, the ether-extracted crude peptide product was desalted and purified on a preparative C18 reverse-phase column (250 × 21.4 mm, Rainin) using a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O buffer with a gradient in acetonitrile (5–80%). The purity of all peptides was assessed by analytical reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography and MALD-TOF mass spectrometry using previously established methods (29Pöschl E. Fox J.W. Block D. Mayer U. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Only peptides deemed greater than 98% pure by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography were used in the platelet aggregation studies. Following synthesis, all peptides were lyophilized and stored under N2 at −30 °C until used. In peptide 1 (see Table I) the carboxyl-terminal cysteinyl residue was protected with an Acm group, and the cysteinyl residues at positions 1 and 8 were protected with trityl groups that were removed during cleavage of the peptide from the resin. A disulfide from Cys1 to Cys8 was introduced by air oxidation. Similarly, peptide 2 was synthesized by protection of cysteinyls 8 and 14 with trityl groups and cysteinyl 1 with an Acm group.Table IInhibition of platelet aggregation by recombinant A/DC and synthetic peptidesInhibitorPlatelet stimulantCollagen (0.5 μg/ml)ADP (1 μm)IC 50 [μm] ± S.E.Atrolysin A0.11 ± 0.01 (4)0.24 ± 0.16 (3)Recombinant A/DC0.47 ± 0.05 (6)0.32 ± 0.06 (4)Peptide1Ac­-CRPARSEC⏜DIAESC(Acm)-­NH2218 ± 42 (6)ND2Ac-C(Acm)RPARSECDIAESC⏜-NH2391 ± 31 (3)ND3Ac-C(Acm)RPARSEC(cm)DIAESC(Acm)-NH2NINI4Ac-C(Acm)RPARSESDIAESC(Acm)-NH2NINI5Ac-CRPARSAC⏜DIAESC(Acm)-NH2546 ± 146 (3)ND6Ac-CRPARSEC⏜AIAESC(Acm)-NH2∼1000 (3)ND7Ac-CRPARSAC⏜AIAESC(Acm)-NH2>>1000 (3)ND8Ac-C(Acm)RPARGDADIAESC(Acm)-NH2156 ± 34 (3)65 ± 3 (3)NI, no inhibition; Acm, acetoamidomethylated cysteine; Ac, acetylated amino terminus; ND, not determined.

Peptide 3 was synthesized by protection of Cys1and Cys14 with Acm groups and Cys8 with a trityl group. Following cleavage and deprotection, Cys8 was alkylated with iodoacetic acid (30Crestfield A.M.

Peptide 4, is based on the peptide 3 sequence except that the cysteinyl residue at position 8 is substituted by serine. Peptide 5 is based on peptide 1 structure except that the glutamyl residue at position 7 is substituted with an alanyl residue.

Peptide 8 is the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ala-substituted form of Arg-Ser-Glu-Cys sequence in peptide 3. Human blood was obtained from healthy donors who had not taken any medications within the previous 10 days. Blood was drawn into Becton Dickinson VACUTANER 228 containing 0.129 m sodium citrate with a final ratio of buffer to blood of 1:9. The tube was then centrifuged at 500 × gfor 5 min. The platelet-rich plasma was transferred into a clean tube. Platelet concentration was measured with a Cell-Dyn-3000 cell counter (Abbott Diagnostics). The assay for platelet aggregation was conducted at 37 °C in an aggregometer (Payton, CO). The concentration of platelets used in each assay was 250,000 cells/μl at a final assay volume of 0.5 ml. The extent of platelet aggregation was quantitated by measuring the total amplitude at a predetermined time interval following addition of the platelet stimulant (collagen, 0.5 μg/ml, or ADP, 1 μm; ChronoLog Corp.). To assay for the ability of atrolysin A, the recombinant protein A/DC or the synthetic peptides, to inhibit platelet aggregation, the antagonists were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2 immediately before use. The antagonist solution was preincubated with platelet-rich plasma for 4 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation of platelet aggregation by collagen or ADP. The extent of the inhibition of platelet aggregation was assessed by comparison with the maximal aggregation induced by the control dose of agonist (1 μm ADP or 0.5 μg/ml collagen) and then expressed as a percentage. IC50 values were determined from dose-response curves generated from the various concentrations used for the antagonists. All experiments were performed in triplicate on blood from at least three different donors. The translated DNA sequence for A/DC that was inserted into the pMbac vector is shown in Fig. 2. The expression of recombinant A/DC in transfected Sf9 cells was followed over time, and it was determined by Western blot analysis of Sf9 cells that day 4 post-transfected cells yielded the most product (Fig.3). Little product was observed secreted into the medium even though a secretion expression vector had been used.Figure 3Western blot analysis of the time course of A/DC expression observed in Sf9 cells and secreted into the media. C1, C2, C3, and C4 and M1, M2, M3, andM4 represent the relative amounts of A/DC found in lysed Sf9 cells and secreted into the media on days 1–4, respectively, following transfection.

The experimental mass was determined to be 24,479 (M+H ion) compared with 24,154 for the calculated mass, a difference of approximately 300 mass units or 1.3%. The explanation for this small discrepancy is unclear; however, there is a possibility for glycosylation of this protein. From protein sequence studies of atrolysin A, there are two N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences in the cysteine-rich domain, GSNVT and SGNNS (Fig. 2 and Ref. 4Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of A/DC with N-glycanase (Genzyme) caused a decrease in mass of approximately 278 mass units (data not shown) suggesting that glycosylation at one or both of those sites gives rise to the difference in the experimental versus the calculated mass of A/DC. The peak at 12314 mass units is the M2+H ion. 14C-Carboxymethylation of nonreduced A/DC yielded product with no incorporation of label. Atrolysin E, which is known to have one “free” cysteine, incorporated approximately 26 mCi of14C per mmol, which relates to 0.8 cysteines/molecule of atrolysin E. This was similar to the 30 mCi of 14C per mmol found in atrolysin A. The complete sequence of mature atrolysin A also has an odd number of cysteinyl residues (4Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since both atrolysin E and atrolysin A were approximately equally labeled, we concluded that atrolysin A has a single free cysteine. Furthermore, based on the lack of counts associated with the alkylation of A/DC, it was therefore concluded that all the cysteinyl residues of recombinant A/DC are involved in disulfide bonds and that the unpaired cysteinyl residue in atrolysin A resides in the metalloproteinase domain. As seen in Figs. 7 A and8 A and Table I, the hemorrhagic metalloproteinase atrolysin A was a potent inhibitor of collagen and ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation. The recombinant A/DC protein was also a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation (Figs. 7 Band 8 B and Table I) but not to the same extent as atrolysin A, having a 4.3-fold greater IC50 value than atrolysin A for collagen-stimulated platelets. The IC50 of A/DC was of the same order of magnitude as observed for the disintegrins. Reduction and carboxyamidomethylation of A/DC caused a loss of all inhibitory activity (data not shown).Figure 8Concentration dependence of atrolysin A and A/DC inhibition of ADP-induced (2 μm) (A) or collagen I-induced (0.5 μg/ml) (B) human platelet aggregation.

Pretreatment of Rat-1 cells with either cycloheximide or sodium orthovanadate had little effect on the early peak of ERK1 activity but potentiated the sustained phase. Cycloheximide also potentiated ERK1 activation in Rat-1 cells expressing ΔRaf-1:ER, an estradiol-regulated form of the oncogenic, human Raf-1. Since cycloheximide did not potentiate MEK activity but abrogated the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP-1) normally seen in response to EGF and LPA, we speculated that the level of MKP-1 expression may be an important regulator of ERK1 activity in Rat-1 cells. Inhibition of LPA-stimulated MEK and ERK activation with PD98059 and pertussis toxin, a selective inhibitor of Gi-protein-coupled signaling pathways, reduced LPA-stimulated MKP-1 expression by only 50%, suggesting the presence of additional MEK- and ERK-independent pathways for MKP-1 expression. Specific activation of the MEK/ERK pathway by ΔRaf-1:ER had little or no effect on MKP-1 expression, suggesting that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is necessary but not sufficient for MKP-1 expression in Rat-1 cells. Activation of PKC played little part in growth factor-stimulated MKP-1 expression, but LPA- and EGF-induced MKP-1 expression was blocked by buffering [Ca2+]i, leading to a potentiation of the sustained phase of ERK1 activation without potentiating MEK activity. In Rat-1ΔRaf-1:ER cells, we observed a strong synergy of MKP-1 expression when cells were stimulated with estradiol in the presence of ionomycin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or okadaic acid under conditions where these agents did not synergize for ERK activation. These results suggest that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is insufficient to induce expression of MKP-1 but instead requires other signals, such as Ca2+, to fully reconstitute the response seen with growth factors. In this way, ERK-dependent and -independent signals may regulate MKP-1 expression, the magnitude of sustained ERK1 activity, and therefore gene expression.

One of the major signal pathways responsible for regulating reentry into the cell cycle leads to activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (also called mitogen-activated protein kinase or MAP kinase); BAPTA-AM, (1,2-bis(2)aminophenoxy)ethaneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl ester); EGF, epidermal growth factor; JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MBP, myelin basic protein MEK, MAP kinase, or ERK kinase; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; β-E2, β-estradiol; PKC, protein kinase C; FBS, fetal bovine serum. 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (also called mitogen-activated protein kinase or MAP kinase); BAPTA-AM, (1,2-bis(2)aminophenoxy)ethaneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl ester); EGF, epidermal growth factor; JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MBP, myelin basic protein MEK, MAP kinase, or ERK kinase; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; β-E2, β-estradiol; PKC, protein kinase C; FBS, fetal bovine serum. p44ERK1 and p42ERK2 (also called mitogen-activated protein kinases or MAP kinases) (1Cobb M.H.

J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several observations demonstrate the importance of this signaling pathway in cell growth. First, activating mutations in Ras (17Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), Raf (9Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar) are sufficient to activate ERK, induce gene expression, or cause oncogenic transformation. Second, inhibition in this signaling pathway is associated with inhibition of ERK activation and cell growth (19Pagés G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Méloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Third, among the substrates for ERK1 and ERK2 are transcription factors of the Ets family, Elk-1 and Sap1a (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 22Gille H.

Opin. Genet. Devel. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Finally, many growth factors stimulate the sustained activation of ERKs (20Vouret-Craviari V. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Scimeca J.C. Van Obberghen E. Pouysségur J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. J.

Biochem J. 1996; 320: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is temporally associated with their accumulation in the nucleus (25Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

In this way, the ERK cascade provides a link between receptor signaling events at the plasma membrane and regulated gene expression in the nucleus. Whereas much attention has focused on the mechanisms by which this cascade is activated by growth factors and oncoproteins, several studies have turned to the question of which protein phosphatases are responsible for dephosphorylating and thereby inactivating each kinase in the cascade. In the case of ERK, dephosphorylation and inactivation is of considerable interest because the activating phosphorylations are on both threonine and tyrosine (6Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and because sustained ERK activation, which seems to be important for proliferative signaling (20Vouret-Craviari V.

Biochem J. 1996; 320: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), is compartmentalized within the nucleus (25Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagés G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell.

Recent work has identified a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate both the tyrosine (Tyr183) and threonine (Thr185) residues on ERK (28Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 29Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 30Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The prototype of this family is MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) (which is encoded by human CL100 and mouse3CH134 or erp genes, which are immediate early genes induced by oxidative stress and mitogenic stimulation (28Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 29Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar,32Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.-G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). Overexpression of MKP-1 blocks activation of ERK (31Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) and cell cycle reentry (33Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 34Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, to block de novo expression of MKP-1, is able to potentiate sustained ERK activation by serum in NIH3T3 cells (31Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Since MKP-1 appears to be expressed exclusively in the nucleus, a simple model envisages growth factor-stimulated activation and nuclear accumulation of ERK leading to increased MKP-1 expression, which in turn accumulates in the nucleus and inactivates ERK, affording exquisite fine tuning of the sustained phase of ERK activation (35Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 647-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This model has been challenged by the observation that in PC12 cells and endothelial cells MKP-1 is induced but may not be the phosphatase that regulates ERK activity; it was suggested that PP2A and an unidentified PTPase were responsible for dephosphorylation of ERK (36Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In Rat-1 fibroblasts, there is a strong correlation between sustained ERK activation and DNA synthesis in response to mitogenic stimulation with LPA (24Cook S.J. McCormick F. Biochem J. 1996; 320: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); factors that regulate this sustained ERK activation are therefore of great interest. In this report, we demonstrate a role for MKP-1 or a closely related molecule in regulating sustained ERK activity in Rat-1 cells and characterize the pathways regulating expression of MKP-1 in response to growth factor stimulation. Induction of MKP-1 clearly reflects activation of the MEK/ERK cascade, but this pathway alone is insufficient; maximal expression of MKP-1 requires synergistic activation of the ERK pathway and additional ERK-independent signals including Ca2+. In addition, we show that preventing Ca2+-dependent MKP-1 expression potentiates sustained ERK activation, suggesting that MKP-1 is a focus for regulatory cross-talk to the ERK pathway from other signal pathways.

The MEK inhibitor PD98059 was prepared by Cheri Blume and Dr. Dan Rogers in the Chemistry Group at ONYX Pharmaceuticals and confirmed by NMR analysis. The Rat-1 cells used in this and previous studies (15Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 24Cook S.J. McCormick F.

Rat-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed once in serum-free medium and then placed in fresh serum-free medium for at least 24 h prior to the experiments described herein. Pretreatments with various agents were as follows: 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 45 min prior to growth factor addition, 100–1000 μm sodium orthovanadate for 30 min prior to growth factor addition, 40 μm PD98059 for 30 min prior to growth factor addition, and 100 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 18 h prior to growth factor addition. The derivation and characterization of R1ΔRaf-1:ER-4 cells will be described elsewhere. 2S. J. Cook, M. McMahon, and F. McCormick, manuscript in preparation. These are a clone of Rat-1 cells expressing the conditional form of oncogenic human Raf-1 in which the catalytic domain of Raf-1 is fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (38Samuels M.H. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), allowing estrogen-dependent activation of MEK and ERK independently of Ras. R1ΔRaf-1:ER-4 cells were maintained in the same medium as Rat-1 cells but supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. G418 selection was maintained throughout and only removed during serum deprivation for the last 24 h. For ERK1 assays, experiments were performed upon six-well plates of confluent, quiescent cells that had been serum-starved for 24–36 h. Following the addition of the indicated drug or inhibitor, cells were stimulated by the addition of 10 × solutions of growth factors, and stimulations proceeded at 37 °C for the time indicated. Incubations were terminated by aspiration and the addition of ice-cold TG lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm Pefabloc, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin).

However, we have derived a Rat-1 cell line that stably expresses physiological levels of a Myc epitope-tagged version of ERK2. In all experiments performed, we have noted that ERK1 and MycERK2 are regulated identically in response to the agents used in this study. 3K. A. Cadwallader and S. J. Cook, unpublished results. Confluent 10-cm dishes of Rat-1 cells were serum-starved in 5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h before being treated and stimulated as indicated. Cells were then washed briefly in ice-cold PBS before the addition of ice-cold TG lysis buffer. Following removal of detergent-insoluble material, the clarified supernatant was boiled in sample buffer, and equal amounts of cell lysate were resolved on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels until the 30-kDa marker approached the bottom. Gels were transferred to PVDF using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus, and the filter was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm equal loading of lanes. Filters were washed thoroughly in 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) and then “blocked” overnight in TPBS, 5% (w/v) Carnation powdered milk (TPBS/milk). Filters were then probed at room temperature for 1 h in TPBS/milk with anti-peptide antiserum that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated, activated versions of ERK1 and ERK2 or MEK1 and MEK2. Following five 5-min washes with TPBS, the second antibody, goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, was used at a 1:5000 dilution in TPBS/milk for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes in TPBS, the filter was dried and incubated with Amersham ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions; exposures to hyperfilm were typically 1–2 min. In addition, duplicate blots were probed with conventional, nonphosphospecific monoclonal antibodies to ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 to confirm that equal amounts of these proteins were present in each sample. Cell samples were fractionated, transferred to PVDF and “blocked” in TPBS/milk as described above. Filters were then probed at room temperature for 1 h in TPBS/milk with a 1:500 dilution of crude antiserum Alb-1 raised against the C-terminal peptide of mouse3CH134 (40Brondello J.M. Brunet A.

Following five 5-min washes with TPBS, the second antibody, goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, was used at a 1:4000 dilution in TPBS/milk for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes in TPBS, the filter was dried and incubated with Amersham ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions; exposures to hyperfilm were typically 10–30 s. Results are from single experiments representative of between three and six experiments giving similar results. For ERK1 MBP kinase assays, results are expressed as raw cpm of 32P incorporated into MBP from single point assays. This is a sensitive and highly reproducible assay (15Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B.

In addition, some cells were stimulated and assayed in duplicate and gave identical results with errors generally less than 10%. Data were pooled for statistical analysis by student's t test. Experiments involving Western blotting were performed at least three or four times with identical results; a representative experiment is shown in each case. Stimulation of Rat-1 cells with 100 μm LPA resulted in a biphasic increase in ERK1 activity, which peaked at 5–10 min before declining rapidly until 30 min, after which a smaller second phase persisted above basal level for up to 3 h (Fig.1 A). Pretreatment of cells with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 45 min followed by challenge with LPA had no effect on the magnitude of peak ERK1 activity or the rapid decline after 10 min of stimulation but did potentiate the sustained phase of ERK1 activity from 60 min onward (Fig. 1 A). For example, the magnitude of LPA-stimulated ERK1 activity, measured as a percentage of the maximum response at 10 min, was 27 ± 15% after 120 min in control cells but 135 ± 28% after 120 min in cycloheximide-treated cells; the difference between the control and cycloheximide-treated values was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained when EGF was the stimulus (Fig. 1 B). Prolonged treatment with cycloheximide alone had a small, poorly reproducible effect on ERK1 activity (see Fig. 1 C). We also examined the effect of cycloheximide on ERK1 activation by ΔRaf-1:ER (38Samuels M.H. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) in the R1Raf-1:ER-4 cell line. Activation of ΔRaf-1:ER by β-estradiol (β-E2) results in the rapid activation of MEK and ERK in these cells, thereby circumventing the other pathways activated by receptor signaling. The ability of ΔRaf-1:ER to activate ERK1 was greatly potentiated by pretreatment with cycloheximide (Fig.1 C). These results suggest that a labile protein acts as a negative regulator of sustained ERK1 activity, whether stimulated by a receptor tyrosine kinase, a G-protein-coupled receptor, or the conditional form of the human c-Raf-1 protooncogene. This effect was not confined to ERK1. Western blotting with a phosphospecific antibody that only recognizes the activated versions of ERK1 and ERK2 (phosphorylated at Tyr185 in the TEY motif) confirmed that both ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms were activated in a strongly sustained manner in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, duplicate blots probed with a phosphospecific antibody that only recognizes activated MEK1 and MEK2 confirmed that cycloheximide did not amplify or prolong LPA-stimulated MEK activation under these conditions (Fig. 1 D). These results demonstrate that cycloheximide exerts its effect at the level of ERK, not MEK, by preserving the activating phosphorylation sites of ERK1 and ERK2. Since these sites are substrates for MKP family phosphatases, we were interested in seeing if MKPs were expressed in response to growth factors in these cells. We investigated the expression of MKP-1 in response to LPA, EGF, and serum in Rat-1 cells by Western blotting whole cell lysates with an antibody raised to the C terminus of human 3CH134 (Alb-1) (40Brondello J.M.

As a control for the MKP-1 antiserum, we immunoblotted samples from COS cells transfected with empty vector (EXV) or EXV-CL100. Transfected cells were lysed and Western blotted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We detected a strong immunoreactive band of 39–40 kDa in lysates from CL100-transfected cells that was absent in the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig.2 A). A band of similar molecular weight was strongly induced in quiescent Rat-1 cells stimulated with LPA (Fig.2 A). This protein is consistent with the molecular weight of MKP-1 and indicates that antiserum Alb-1 recognizes both recombinant MKP-1 and endogenous MKP-1 induced by growth factor stimulation. The ability of LPA, EGF, or FBS to induce MKP-1 protein expression was completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide (Fig.2 B), indicating that MKP-1 expression is a growth factor-stimulated eve"

The oncogenic potential of these proteins is due, at least in part, to their ability to interfere with the function of two cellular tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb. The E6 protein binds to the cellular p53 protein and promotes its ubiquitin-dependent degradation (17Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M.

The natural host cell of these viruses, the keratinocyte, is immortalized by the efficient expression of E7 protein (22Halbert C.L. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 473-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the E6 protein cannot independently immortalize these cells, it greatly augments the biological activity of the E7 protein (23Barbosa M.S. Schlegel R. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1529-1532PubMed Google Scholar), induces resistance to signals for terminal differentiation (24Sherman L. Schlegel R. J.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the expression ofE6in primary human keratinocytes leads to an activation of telomerase (26Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K.

The telomeric ends of chromosomes consist of a stretch of tandemly repeated sequences complexed with DNA-binding proteins that position chromosomes within the nucleus, protect chromosomal ends, and prevent chromosomal fusion that can occur in late-passage or senescent cells (27Blackburn E.H. Szostak J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 28Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3042) Google Scholar, 31Zakian V.A.

West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.L. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6515) Google Scholar). In contrast to primary somatic cells, immortalized cells generally retain telomere length during in vitropropagation. The DNA polymerase telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex, is capable of elongating the 3′ lagging DNA strand by adding tandemly repeated sequences to this DNA strand. The ribonucleoprotein complex uses parts of its RNA molecule as a template for the polymerization of telomeric tandem repeats, counteracting the shortening of telomeres during the replication of DNA by DNA polymerase α. We observed that early-passage keratinocytes contained detectable telomerase activity that was lost at later passage numbers (between passages 2 and 6). Because both E6 and E7 genes can enhance and prolong human primary keratinocyte growth in vitro, we evaluated whether they might also induce alterations in chromosomal processing and maintain telomeres in a lengthened state. The analysis of primary human foreskin keratinocytes expressing the HPV-16 E6, E7, or E6+E7 (E6/7) genes revealed that E6- and E6/7-expressing cells were telomerase-positive, independent of their passage number.E7-expressing cells, like vector-infected control cells, demonstrated an activated telomerase at early-passage numbers that was rapidly lost during cell passaging. The detectable telomerase activity in precrisis E6- and E6/7-expressing cells, however, did not result in the maintenance of telomere length. All cells, independent of their expression of HPV oncogenes and telomerase, equally shortened their telomeres. However, E7-expressing cells demonstrated partial restoration of telomeric length without the concomitant activation of telomerase during their extended life span. Primary human keratinocytes were derived from neonatal foreskins as described (10Schlegel R. Phelps W.C. Zhang Y.L. Barbosa M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and grown in KSF medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with gentamycin. The primary cells were infected with derivatives of the amphotrophic LXSN retrovirus expressing the various HPV-16 open reading frames (E6, E7, and E6+E7). The retroviruses were generated as described (39Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) using existing recombinant vectors (24Sherman L. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3269-3279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retrovirus-infected cells were selected in G418 (100 μg/ml medium) for 10 days. G418-resistant colonies were pooled from each transduction and passaged every 3–4 days (ratio of 1:5). A modified telomeric amplification protocol (TRAP) was performed as described by Kim et al. (38Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.L. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6515) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by a wash in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to inactivate trypsin. The cells were washed a second time in phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at −70 °C. Cell pellets (≈5 × 106) were lysed in 800 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio)-1-propanesulfonate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were then centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g (4 °C), and 600 μl of the supernatant were removed. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). RNase inhibitor (RNasin from Promega Corp.) was added afterward to a final concentration of 10 units/ml. The remaining nuclear pellet was digested with proteinase K and treated with phenol; chromosomal high molecular weight DNA was isolated by standard techniques for Southern blot analysis. The TRAP assay was performed in a 0.2-ml MicroAmp reaction tube (Perkin Elmer) containing 98 μl of a reaction mixture composed of 1 × Taq polymerase buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mm KCl, and 0.02% Tween 20), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 ng of TS primer (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′), 200 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 0.05–6 μg of protein extract. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The samples were then heated to 80 °C, and 1 μl (100 ng/μl) of CX primer (3′-AATCCCATTCCCATTCCCATTCCC-5′) and 0.5 μl of Taqpolymerase (UlTima DNA polymerase, 6 units/μl; Perkin Elmer) were added before the samples were heated to 94 °C for 90 s. The polymerase chain reaction was performed for 28 cycles under the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Ten % of the polymerase chain reaction product was separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (1 × TBE), and the gel was stained with a Gelcode color silver stain kit (Pierce). To demonstrate telomerase specificity, control samples were either digested for 20 min at 37 °C with 1 μg of RNase A and 1 μg of RNase H or the samples were heated for 10 min to 100 °C prior to the telomerase reaction. Three or 10 μg of chromosomal high molecular weight DNA were restricted with the indicated restriction endonucleases for telomere Southern blot analysis or HPV copy number analysis, respectively. The restricted DNA samples were separated on 1 × TAE agarose gels (0.5–1.0%) and blotted onto a nylon membrane. A 32P kinase-labeled primer, (TTAGGG)3, was used under standard high stringency hybridization conditions (T m −15 °C) to detect the telomeric ends. A random-primed 32P-labeled HPV-16E6/7 DNA fragment was used to detect the various HPV open reading frames using high stringency conditions. Primary human foreskin keratinocytes were infected with amphotropic retroviruses expressing either the HPV-16 E6, E7, E6/7 genes or the neomycin resistance gene (control). Cells were selected in serum-free keratinocyte medium containing G418 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and passaged at a ratio of 1:5. Keratinocytes infected with control retrovirus ceased proliferation at passages 10–12, whereas those transduced with E6/7 established into cell lines. Keratinocytes expressing either E6 or E7 alone exhibited extended life span and continued to proliferate beyond passage 26. We observed, in three independent experiments, thatE6 retroviruses generated human keratinocyte strains with significant telomerase activity at early passage (e.g.passages 4 and 6, Fig. 1 A), similar to the recently published results of Klingelhutz et al. (26Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The concomitant expression of the E6/7 genes gave similar results. Although low levels of telomerase were observed in control keratinocytes and in E7-expressing cells at early passages (passages 4 and 6), this activity was absent at later passages (passages 8 and 10), presumably reflecting the loss of basal epithelial “stem” cells in the neonatal human foreskin keratinocyte population. The detection of telomerase activity in normal keratinocytes was dependent upon the isolation procedures and the number of cell divisions needed to establish the primary culture and was normally detected up to passages 2–3 but never after passage 6. Mixing experiments (Fig. 1 B) using a telomerase-negativeE7 cell extract (Fig. 1 A; E7 passage 8) and telomerase-positive cell extracts (Fig. 1 A; E6, E6/7 passage 8, and a cell extract from an HPV-16 immortalized keratinocyte line) demonstrated that the loss of TRAP assay activity inE7 extracts was not due to the presence of an inhibitor of telomerase or polymerase activity. Thus, the gradual passage-dependent loss of telomerase activity inE7-expressing cells represents a true loss of enzymatic activity. To determine whether the observed activation of telomerase in E6-transduced keratinocytes (Fig.1 A) was accompanied by altered processing of the chromosome telomeres, we harvested nuclei from keratinocytes at the indicated passages and performed Southern blotting on isolated cellular DNA with a telomeric probe to evaluate average telomere length (Fig.1 C). Cells were evaluated until passage 10 when the HPV-negative control cells reached crisis. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that regardless of the HPV genes transfected, all cells exhibited shortened telomeres similar to control-transduced cells. During the first 10 passages, the average telomere length decreased from approximately 10 to 8.5 kb, which represents an average loss of 60–80 base pairs per population doubling. This is in agreement with previous studies in primary human fibroblasts (32Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4587) Google Scholar, 34Allsopp R.C. Vaziri H. Patterson C. Goldstein S. Younglai E.V. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10114-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar) and human embryonic kidney cells. The correlation between the loss of keratinocyte growth potential (at 30–40 population doublings) and the shortening of telomeres by 1.5–2.0 kb also resembles the differences in telomere length seen in vivo between fibroblasts from human embryos and late-age individuals (30Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 33Hastie N.D. Dempster M. Dunlop M.G. Thompson A.M. Green D.K. Allshire R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). We also compared the telomerase activity of retrovirus-infected keratinocytes at passage 26, far past the time when the HPV-negative control cells had undergone crisis and lost their proliferative potential (passage 10). The TRAP assay depicted in Fig. 2 A demonstrates thatE6-transduced cells continued to display telomerase activity throughout passaging, whereas the vector- and E7-transduced cells were negative. The expression of the E6 or E7 protein leads to an extended keratinocyte life-span in vitro in comparison to noninfected or vector-infected control cells (25Klingelhutz A.J. Barber S.A. Smith P.P. Dyer K. McDougall J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In one of our experiments,E6-transduced cells proliferated beyond passage 26. Despite the continued presence of telomerase activity in these late-passage cells (Fig. 2 A), we observed a further shortening of the mean telomere length to ≈5 kb (decreased from ≈8.5 kb at passage 10) (Fig. 2 B). E6-transduced cells lost an estimated 60–80 base pairs per population doubling. The correspondingE7-expressing cells also demonstrated a similar loss of telomeric length between passages 10 and 21 (Fig. 2 B). However, from approximately passage numbers 21 to 26, theE7-transduced keratinocytes showed an increase in telomere length (Fig. 2 B), although there was no detectable telomerase activity in these cells (Fig. 2 A). In contrast,E6-transduced cells at passage 26 continued to shorten their telomeres. The increase in telomere length of E7-expressing cells might indicate, as observed in other tissue culture systems (40Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar), that the cells have reached immortalization crisis. Although all keratinocyte strains were isolated following G418 selection and should consist only of cells transduced with HPV genes, we performed Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA from the indicated keratinocyte strains to verify the presence of viral genes. Keratinocytes transduced with E6, E7, or E6/7were assayed at passages 4 and 10 to determine the average copy number of HPV genes in the cell population. Fig. 3 Ademonstrates that all keratinocyte strains contained at least one copy of the transduced HPV gene per cell at both early and late passages. This result suggests that the observed shortening of telomeres inE6-transduced cells is not the consequence of inefficient gene transduction or HPV gene instability. Evidence that most or all of the E6-transduced keratinocytes are expressing telomerase is derived from the comparative analysis of telomerase activity in transduced cells and clonally derived cell lines immortalized by either HPV-16 or HPV-18 DNA or by SV40 virus (Fig.3 B). The telomerase activities of the tested HPV-immortalized cell lines were equivalent to the telomerase activity of HeLa cells (data not shown). The extracts of nonimmortalized, transduced cell strains exhibited telomerase activity that was similar to that observed in several independent clonal cell lines, suggesting that the transduced keratinocyte population (like the clonal cell lines) consists mostly of cells expressing telomerase. To demonstrate that the polymerase chain reaction-based TRAP assay was indeed measuring telomerase activity rather than the contamination of cytoplasmic extracts with chromosomal telomeric DNA, we treated the cell extracts with RNase A and H for 20 min at 37 °C or with 100 °C exposure for 10 min. In both cases, telomerase activity was completely abolished, indicating that the riboprotein telomerase was responsible for the observed results (Fig.4 A). Serial dilution of cell extracts demonstrated thatE6-transduced cells had telomerase activity similar toE6/7-expressing cells and that the sensitivity of the TRAP assay was sufficient to detect activity in approximately 100 cells (Fig. 4 B). This is consistent with the sensitivity of the assay using established cell lines (e.g. HeLa cells), further supporting our previous findings that theE6-transduced keratinocyte population was composed predominantly of cells expressing telomerase (Fig.3 B). The ability of the E6 protein to extend the precrisis life span of human keratinocytes and to activate telomerase is in agreement with the recent independent finding of Klingelhutz et al. (26Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, by simultaneously measuring telomere length and telomerase activity during sequential passages, we have demonstrated that the E6-dependent activation of telomerase has no detectable effect on the normal shortening of telomeres during in vitrocell passaging. In addition, we have also demonstrated thatE7-transduced cells lengthen telomeres after prolonged passaging (potentially at cellular immortalization) and that this telomere elongation occurred independent of detectable telomerase activity. The finding that E7-transduced cells elongate telomeres without detectable telomerase activity is in agreement with a study of Bryan et al. (41Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) describing immortal human cell lines without detectable telomerase activity. Although the elongation of telomeres during and after cell crisis normally coincides with a high degree of chromosomal aberrations, keratinocytes immortalized byE6/7 typically display few or limited chromosomal abnormalities (42Pei X.F. Qin N.G. Meck J.M. Schlegel R. Pathobiology. 1994; 62: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 43Popescu N. DiPaolo J.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1316-1323PubMed Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that the E6-dependent increase in telomerase activity is rapid and occurs by the time the retrovirus-infected keratinocytes have been selected in G418. However, it is unclear whether this increase in enzymatic activity represents the induction of telomerase, the activation of telomerase, or possibly the selection of telomerase-positive stem cells. Thus, it remains a possibility that, following the infection of primary keratinocytes by the E6 retrovirus, the E6 oncogene selectively augments the growth of telomerase-positive cells. This selection would result in the amplification of a keratinocyte population containing high telomerase activity. It is also possible that all of the primary keratinocytes express telomerase activity and that E6 functions to maintain this phenotype. However, it is believed that telomerase activity is, in general, not present in somatic cells but is restricted to germ-line cells and tumor cells (30Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 38Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.L. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6515) Google Scholar). The telomerase activity detected in E6-transduced keratinocytes is presumed to represent the activity of all cells in the population rather than a minor subpopulation for two reasons: (a) Southern blot analysis indicates that, on the average, each keratinocyte contains at least one copy of the transduced HPV gene(s). Thus, it is likely that most of the transduced cells are expressing E6 and are, therefore, altered in telomerase activity. Unfortunately, however, there are no in situ techniques to evaluate whether E6 protein (or telomerase) is expressed in each cell; and (b) the level of telomerase detected in the G418-selected, E6-transduced keratinocyte population is equivalent to the telomerase level observed in a clonal keratinocyte cell line that was immortalized by E6/7 (Fig. 3). Although only the E6 protein increases cellular telomerase activity, both E6 and E7 are able to extend the keratinocyte life span in vitro, suggesting that prolongation of keratinocyte proliferation is not necessarily dependent upon telomerase activity. In addition, our findings indicate that telomere length is not the critical determinant for the cessation of keratinocyte proliferation in vitro because E6- and E7-transduced cells have shorter telomeres than control (vector-transduced) cells. Finally, our results demonstrate that increased or sustained telomerase activity is insufficient to induce cellular immortalization because E6-transduced genital keratinocytes do not establish into cell lines. The experimental finding that E7-transduced cells elongate telomeres after prolonged passaging indicates that there must beE6-independent, telomerase-independent mechanisms for the elongation of telomeres in E7-transduced cells. Our results, therefore, support the findings of Bryan et al. (41Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), who postulate that a mechanism exists for the elongation of telomeres that is not accompanied by detectable levels of telomerase. It is interesting that the observed lengthening of telomeres inE7-expressing cells appears to coincide with the onset of cell crisis, suggesting a potential role in cell immortalization.

To hold their cholesterol constant, cells regulate its biosynthesis; its uptake in LDL 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase; 25-HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum. 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase; 25-HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum.; its sequestration in droplets of cholesterol esters; and, in specialized tissues, its conversion to steroid hormones, bile acids, and plasma lipoproteins (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1985: 404-474Google Scholar). Cholesterol feeds back upon these processes, principally at the level of gene transcription, the synthesis and degradation of regulatory proteins, and the activities of rate-determining enzymes (acting both through their covalent modification and through the limitation of their substrate) (2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 342: 425-430Crossref Scopus (4537) Google Scholar, 3Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How the abundance of cell cholesterol is sensed and signaled to these control elements is obscure (2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 342: 425-430Crossref Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Several of these key regulatory activities are associated with the ER and, in some cases, the associated outer nuclear membrane. These include cholesterol esterification by ACAT (4Reinhart M.P.

Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). All of these proteins respond to changes in cell cholesterol. In particular, a regulated pool of cholesterol in the ER might serve as a control element in cholesterol homeostasis (16Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lange Y. Steck T.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 205-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The validation of this hypothesis calls for a demonstration that the aforementioned regulatory activities vary quantitatively with the magnitude of the ER cholesterol pool. This pool is small, however, and not easily determined (18Reinhart M.P. Experientia ( Basel ). 1990; 46: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19van Meer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Allan D. Kallen K.-J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 195-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Liscum L. Underwood K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For example, a high resolution sucrose density gradient analysis indicated that the rough ER fraction contained ∼4% of cell cholesterol, but also a similar amount of plasma membrane markers (22Beaufay H. Amar-Costesec A. Thines-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Correction for contamination by plasma membrane suggests that the ER cholesterol pool is negligible (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Beaufay H. Amar-Costesec A. Thines-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is paradoxical, given that the ER is the site of cholesterol biosynthesis, esterification, and regulation. Electron microscopic cytochemical analysis using filipin as a cholesterol stain suggested that the concentration of cholesterol in the rough ER of a mutant cell line, UT-1, was ∼3% of that in the plasma membranes (10Orci L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Garcia-Segura L.M. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1984; 36: 835-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, this value did not vary with the feeding of LDL to the intact cells, as expected for a regulated compartment (see below). Furthermore, quantitation of membrane cholesterol by filipin staining has limitations (18Reinhart M.P. Experientia ( Basel ). 1990; 46: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is reason to consider that the small pool of cholesterol associated with the ER at the moment of homogenization might be estimated by determining its esterification in vitro with a radioactive fatty acid. Cholesterol esterification appears to be a unique attribute of the rough ER (4Reinhart M.P. Billheimer J.T. Faust J.R. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9649-9655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol esterification in vitro varies with the availability of cholesterol to the undersaturated enzyme (3Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Doolittle G.M. Chang T.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Cheng D.

Furthermore, a parallel has been demonstrated between the rate of cholesterol esterification in vivo and that in the corresponding unfractionated membranes from cells treated with LDL (6Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), progesterone (28Goldstein J.L. Faust J.R. Dygos J.H. Chorvat R.J. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1975; 250: 4025-4027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While these results are consistent with the premise that in vitroesterification manifests the pool of cholesterol in the ER, other mechanisms could obscure this relationship. For example, there are intracellular inhibitors and activators of ACAT (30Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Schissel S.L. Beatini N. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10463-10473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Axelson M. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15102-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the well documented activation of cholesterol esterification by exogenous 25-HC could reflect modulation of the available cholesterol pool, a direct effect on the enzyme, or both (26Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X.M. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To validate the proposed assay of ER cholesterol as that esterified in homogenates, the following should be established. (a) ACAT activity should be uniquely associated with ER fragments. (b) Cholesterol not associated with ACAT-bearing membranes should not be esterified in the in vitro reaction. (c) All the cholesterol in the ACAT-bearing membranes should be esterified in the in vitro reaction. The assay should therefore be allowed to run to completion so that the amount of cholesterol in the pool rather than the initial rate of its esterification is determined. (d) The amount of cholesterol esterified in vitro should be discrete and vary with the rate of esterification in the parent cells under different conditions. Testing this approach was the goal this study. [1,2-3H]Cholesterol (46 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Life Science, Inc. [oleoyl-1-14C]Coenzyme A (53.3 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. LPDS was prepared from fetal bovine serum (33Lange Y. Matthies H.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14624-14630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were derived from primary explants and used between passages 4 and 11 (33Lange Y. Matthies H.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14624-14630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Chinese hamster ovary cell lines 25-RA and AC-29 (34Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. T.-Y. Chang (Dartmouth Medical School). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μg/ml gentamycin. Two approaches were employed to assay cholesterol esterification in vitro. In the first, fibroblasts were washed, allowed to swell, and homogenized (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenates were cleared of large particles by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatants made 1 mm in dithiothreitol and 1 mg/ml in bovine serum albumin. The esterification reaction was started by the addition of 25 μm[14C]oleoyl-CoA. After incubation at 37 °C for the times indicated in the legends, cholesteryl esters were isolated, and their radioactivity was determined as described (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of total cell cholesterol esterified was calculated from the radioactivity incorporated in vitro using the specific activity of the added [14C]oleoyl-CoA and the measured mass of cholesterol. In the second assay, [3H]cholesterol was added to intact cells that had been washed and suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated for 10 min on ice to allow the probe to circulate to the ER and then homogenized and assayed with unlabeled oleoyl-CoA as described above. (The time that elapsed between the addition of label and homogenization was ∼30 min.) Other methods were as described in the legends and in Ref. 5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Normal human fibroblasts were prepared under different conditions known to alter their cholesterol metabolism. Their homogenates were reacted with [14C]oleoyl-CoA under optimized conditions; then, the cholesterol ester product was isolated and analyzed. Fig. 1 A shows a prototypic experiment. It makes these points. (a) The esterification reaction is well described as a first-order exponential process. These are the kinetics expected for the reaction to completion of a single pool of cholesterol. This finding also supports the supposition that ACAT is far from saturated with cholesterol in situ (3Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (b) Esterification leveled off after ∼30 min. (Unless indicated otherwise, all subsequent data were gathered using a 1-h incubation to ensure that we recorded the total extent rather than the initial rate of the reaction.) In earlier studies, in vitroesterification under similar conditions was observed to slow after 5–10 min on the one hand (26Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X.M. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and to proceed linearly for 2 h on the other (29Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4025-4027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (c) Only ∼1% of total cholesterol was esterified, in line with independent determinations of ER cholesterol (see the Introduction). (d) The apparent size of the esterifiable pool responded in the appropriate direction (2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 342: 425-430Crossref Scopus (4537) Google Scholar) to prefeeding LDL to the cells. That the cessation of cholesterol esterification during the incubation shown in Fig. 1 A was not the result of a loss of ACAT activity was verified by demonstrating that the assay system remained fully active throughout (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, supplying additional oleoyl-CoA after 30 min of incubation did not revive the esterification reaction. Thus, the early cessation of the esterification reaction in vitromay signify the exhaustion of a small discrete pool of substrate cholesterol, presumably that present in the ACAT-bearing membrane fragments in the homogenate. (Control experiments showed that the hydrolysis of cellular cholesteryl esters was negligible during the 1-h reaction and therefore could not have contributed significantly to the pool esterified in vitro.) We checked the method of analysis using a second approach (TableI). Cells were prelabeled with exogenous [3H]cholesterol and then incubated to allow the surface label to circulate through the cells prior to homogenization and initiation of the in vitro cholesterol esterification described above. The same hyperbolic time course was observed for esterification of the exogenous [3H]cholesterol as obtained with [14C]oleoyl-CoA added in vitro(data not shown). We compared the extent of esterification in the two assays. In the former calculation, we used the specific activity of whole cell [3H]cholesterol since the ACAT-associated pool appears to equilibrate rapidly with that in the plasma membrane (see below). In the latter calculation, we used the specific activity of the added [14C]oleoyl-CoA, the concentration of which vastly exceeds the endogenous pool; this is the usual practice (e.g. Ref. 28Goldstein J.L.

Cholesterol mass was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of cholesterol esterified in vitro was calculated from the amount of each isotope incorporated using the specific activity of whole cell [3H]cholesterol and the calculated specific activity of the added [14C]oleoyl-CoA. The small amount of [3H]cholesterol ester formed during the labeling of the cells was subtracted. Values are averages of triplicate determinations that agreed to within 3%. Open table in a new tab Fibroblasts were labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and homogenates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Esterification was assayed after the addition of [14C]oleoyl-CoA and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Cholesterol mass was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of cholesterol esterified in vitro was calculated from the amount of each isotope incorporated using the specific activity of whole cell [3H]cholesterol and the calculated specific activity of the added [14C]oleoyl-CoA. The small amount of [3H]cholesterol ester formed during the labeling of the cells was subtracted. Values are averages of triplicate determinations that agreed to within 3%. The results shown in Table I make these points. First, the amount of cholesterol esterified was similar to the plateau values in Fig.1 A. Second, although there was a wide variation among the results obtained in individual experiments, close agreement was observed in each experiment between the values obtained using the two labels. This finding helps to validate the method. Third, the ratio of the pairs of estimates obtained with [3H]cholesterol and [14C]oleoyl-CoA should, in principle, equal the degree to which the cholesterol available to ACAT had equilibrated with the plasma membrane prior to homogenization. Since this ratio was virtually unity in each experiment, the data in Table I support the premise that the pool associated with ACAT is rapidly replaced by plasma membrane cholesterol in vivo such that most of the cholesterol in the former is derived from the latter (17Lange Y. Steck T.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 205-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes bear most of the cholesterol in human fibroblasts and other mammalian cells, whereas the ER contains only a trace (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Beaufay H. Amar-Costesec A. Thines-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the in vitroesterification reactions shown in Fig. 1 utilized bulk cellular cholesterol, then separating ACAT from the plasma membranes should greatly reduce the plateau value for the in vitro esterification reaction. We therefore employed sucrose density gradient centrifugation to resolve ACAT from most of the more buoyant plasma membranes, as described previously (5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then determined the pool of esterifiable cholesterol in each gradient fraction by reaction to completion with [14C]oleoyl-CoA. As shown in Fig. 2, the gradient profile of the cholesterol esters produced in vitro closely paralleled that of RNA, taken as a marker of the rough ER (4Reinhart M.P. Billheimer J.T. Faust J.R. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9649-9655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If ACAT had access to cholesterol in other membranes, the level of run-off cholesterol esterification would have been very high in the buoyant fractions bearing the plasma membranes. In fact, the fractional esterification of the cholesterol in the most buoyant fraction of the gradient was 12 times lower than that in the most dense fraction. Finally, the sum total of the cholesterol esterified in the gradient fractions (namely, 240 pmol) matched that in the corresponding unfractionated input (250 pmol). Since separating the bulk of the cholesterol from ACAT did not reduce the total cholesterol esterified in vitro, but rather enriched the degree of esterification in the ER fractions, the data support the premise that the assay reaction in whole homogenates utilized the small amount of cholesterol physically associated with the membranes bearing ACAT and not cholesterol in other membranes. We also showed that washing the membranes of homogenates did not significantly reduce in vitro esterification. Thus, no soluble (e.g. transfer) factors contributed to the observed results. Another test of whether exogenous membrane cholesterol was a substrate for ACAT was performed with mixtures of homogenates from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, 25-RA, and a mutant line derived therefrom, AC-29, which lacked ACAT (34Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that in mixtures of their homogenates, ACAT from the 25-RA cells esterified the [3H]cholesterol in its own membranes, but did not esterify appreciably the radiolabel introduced into the plasma membranes of the mutant AC-29 cells (Table II). Hence, ACAT did not appear to have access to cholesterol in the other membranes in the homogenate (see also Ref. 5Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IITransfer of [3H]cholesterol between membranes in mixtures of homogenatesLabeled homogenateUnlabeled homogenate[3H]Cholesterol esterified%/10 minWild typeWild type0.93Wild typeMutant0.32MutantMutant0.01MutantWild type0.02Cells of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (25-RA) and a derived mutant cell line lacking ACAT activity (AC-29) were suspended and washed; a portion of each was labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and homogenates were prepared as described in the legend to Table I. Roughly equivalent aliquots of labeled and unlabeled homogenates (measured as cholesterol mass) were mixed. Esterification was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures”; an incubation time of 10 min was used to obtain initial rates.

It is not known why adding unlabeled mutant homogenate reproducibly reduced the esterification of [3H]cholesterol in labeled wild-type homogenates.

It is not known why adding unlabeled mutant homogenate reproducibly reduced the esterification of [3H]cholesterol in labeled wild-type homogenates. If the plateau values for the cholesterol esterified in homogenates reflect a local physiological pool rather than a nonspecific artifact of analysis, then their magnitude should vary with appropriate pretreatments of the intact cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined the response of LDL-starved cells to the feeding of serum over prolonged time periods. As previously established, feeding cells LDL gradually increased the rate of cholesterol esterification in vivo (Fig. 3). Even though the time course of this stimulation was variable among experiments (e.g. compareA and B), the rate of esterification in vivo was closely paralleled by the total amount of cholesterol esterified in the corresponding homogenate. Typically, overnight incubation of cells with serum increased the esterification of cholesterol in vitro ∼4-fold (Table III), and purified human LDL elicited a similar response (data not shown).Table IIIEffect of pretreatments of intact cells on esterification in homogenatesPreincubationCholesterol esterifiedRelative mean ± S.D.% of totalExp. 15% LPDS0.181.010% serum0.654.0 ± 0.8 (6)5% LPDS + mevinolin0.080.43 ± 0.1 (2)Exp. 25% LPDS0.271.05% LPDS + 25-HC1.764.1 ± 1.7 (6)Exp. 310% serum0.411.010% serum + SMase3-aSMase, sphingomyelinase; CO, cholesterol oxidase.0.742.5 ± 0.7 (3)Exp. 45% LPDS0.141.05% LPDS + CO0.100.79 ± 0.05 (3)Fibroblasts were incubated for 18–48 h in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or 5% LPDS plus mevinolin (18 μm) in Experiment 1 or 25-HC (50 μm) in Experiment 2.

https://openalex.org/W1971946365,"In yeast glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 is essential for synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycerol and is osmotically regulated via the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG1) kinase pathway. Homologous protein kinases, p38, and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) are hyperosmotically activated in some mammalian cell lines and complement HOG1 in yeast. In the present study we asked whether p38 or SAPK/JNK signal synthesis of the osmoprotectant sorbitol in rabbit renal medullary cells (PAP-HT25), analogous to the glycerol system in yeast. Sorbitol synthesis is catalyzed by aldose reductase (AR). Hyperosmolality increasesAR transcription through an osmotic response element (ORE) in the 5′-flanking region of the AR gene, resulting in elevated sorbitol. We tested if AR-ORE is targeted by p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways in PAP-HT25 cells. Hyperosmolality (adding 150 mmNaCl) strongly induces phosphorylation of p38 and of c-Jun, a specific target of SAPK/JNK. Transient lipofection of a dominant negative mutant of SAPK kinase, SEK1-AL, into PAP-HT25 cells specifically inhibits hyperosmotically induced c-Jun phosphorylation. Transient lipofection of a dominant negative p38 kinase mutant, MKK3-AL, into PAP-HT25 cells specifically suppresses hyperosmotic induction of p38 phosphorylation. We cotransfected either one of these mutants or their empty vector with an AR-ORE luciferase reporter construct and compared the hyperosmotically induced increase in luciferase activity with that in cells lipofected with only the AR-ORE luciferase construct. Hyperosmolality increased luciferase activity equally (5–7-fold) under all conditions. We conclude that hyperosmolality induces p38 and SAPK/JNK cascades in mammalian renal cells, analogous to inducing the HOG1 cascade in yeast. However, activation of p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways is not necessary for transcriptional regulation of ARthrough the ORE. This finding stands in contrast to the requirement for the HOG1 pathway for hyperosmotically induced activation of yeastGPD1.

This finding stands in contrast to the requirement for the HOG1 pathway for hyperosmotically induced activation of yeastGPD1. Homeostasis of intracellular inorganic ion concentrations and cell volume is essential for proper function of all cells. This is achieved by selective, energy-consuming electrolyte transport processes at the cell membrane (1Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers, and Pumps: An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990Google Scholar) and by metabolic regulation of organic osmolyte levels in the cytoplasm (2Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar). In situations of osmotic stress, cells adaptively osmoregulate by means of adjusting membrane water/ion fluxes and organic osmolyte levels. Such adaptive osmoregulation presumably is preceded by sensory and signaling events that monitor changes in osmotic strength and transduce this information to target genes and proteins of osmoprotective value. Recent work employing yeast genetics provides a wealth of information about the nature of osmosensing signal transduction in these primitive eukaryotic cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae senses hyperosmolality through autophosphorylation of a sensor histidine kinase, SLN1, that is homologous to two-component sensor kinases common in bacteria (3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). A second osmosensor protein, SHO1, has also been identified in this species (4Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Both osmosensors regulate the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG1) 1The abbreviations used are: HOG1, high osmolarity glycerol; STRE, stress-response element; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, environmentally regulated protein kinase; AR, aldose reductase; GPD1, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1; ORE, osmotic response element; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; phOx, 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase. response pathway, which is a kinase cascade that induces a stress-response element (STRE) 5′ upstream of a number of yeast genes (5Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). One target of the HOG1 pathway is the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GPD1) (6Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). GPD1 is essential for production of glycerol, which is a major organic osmolyte in yeast, and is accumulated in response to hyperosmotic stress to restore cell volume and intracellular inorganic ion concentrations to norm values. The HOG1 pathway is necessary for this response. At present, two mammalian protein kinases have been described that are functionally homologous to yeast HOG1. These are p38 (CSBP=RK=MXI2=MPK2) and SAPK/JNK. p38 appears to be the closest mammalian homologue of HOG1 based on functional complementation, overall sequence similarity, and a shared glycine residue in the conserved dual phosphorylation motif TGY (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Both p38 and SAPK/JNK are osmotically regulated in one or another mammalian cell line,e.g. p38 in murine cell lines of monocytic origin (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) and SAPK/JNK in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In addition, other environmentally regulated kinases (ERKs) are activated upon osmotic stress in certain mammalian cell lines, e.g. ERK1 in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts (9Matsuda S. Kawasaki A. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12781-12786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, only p38 and SAPK/JNK functionally complement HOG1 in yeast. HOG1 deletion mutants are rescued from lethality in hyperosmotic medium when expressing either mammalian p38 (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) or SAPK/JNK (8Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, important targets of p38 include mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinases 2 and 3 that phosphorylate the small heat shock protein HSP27 (10Clifton A.D. Young P.R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SAPK/JNK targets include transcription factors that are products of immediate early genes (e.g. c-jun) (11Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, unlike in yeast, no target genes or proteins of known osmoprotective value have thus far been shown to be osmotically regulated via p38, SAPK/JNK, or ERKs in mammalian cells. Osmoregulated genes in mammalian cells include those encoding transporters for compatible osmolytes (betaine, taurine, and inositol) and the enzyme aldose reductase (AR), which catalyzes production of the compatible osmolyte sorbitol from glucose (12Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These four organic osmolytes and glycerophosphocholine (but not glycerol) predominate in renal medullary cells. Analogous to the GPD1/glycerol system in yeast,AR transcription is up-regulated in rabbit renal medullary (PAP-HT25) cells exposed to hyperosmolality, resulting in elevated sorbitol (13Smardo Jr., F.L. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperosmolality increases AR transcription through an osmotic response element (ORE) in the 5′-flanking region of the AR gene (14Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.-Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated whether mammalian p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways are activated by hyperosmolality in PAP-HT25 cells. In addition, we asked if increased synthesis of the osmoprotectant sorbitol via hyperosmotic induction through AR-ORE is signaled via p38 or SAPK/JNK cascades, analogous to the glycerol system in yeast. The results of this study are discussed in a comparative context and with emphasis on the role and specificity of osmosensitive kinase cascades as part of the general cellular defense machinery against osmotic stress. Cell culture media were composed as described previously (15Bagnasco S.M. Murphy H.R. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C788-C792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protease inhibitors Pefabloc® and leupeptin, as well as Tween 20, bovine serum albumin, and protein A-alkaline phosphatase were provided by Boehringer Mannheim.

Sodium fluoride, sodium azide, glycine, and thimerosal were from Sigma. Dithiothreitol, Tris base, and the protease inhibitors pepstatin A and aprotinin were purchased from ICN. SDS was from Digene, and the enhanced luciferase assay kit was from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory. Glycerol, methanol, and sodium chloride were obtained from J. T. Baker, and bromphenol blue, Blotto®, and prestained SDS-PAGE broad range standards were from Bio-Rad. PhosphoPlus™ p38 (P-Tyr182 #9211S) and PhosphoPlus™ c-Jun (P-Ser73 #9164S) phosphospecific antibodies and regular p38 (#9212) and c-Jun (#9162) antibodies as well as Phototope® Star ECL Western detection reagents were provided by New England Biolabs. Lipofectamine™, OPTI-MEM® reduced serum medium, and X-gal were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Mallinckrodt. PAP-HT25 cells between passages 63–76 were used for all experiments. Hyperosmotic stimulation of cells was achieved by substitution of hyperosmotic medium (600 mosmol/kg H2O) for isosmotic medium (300 H2O). Hyperosmotic medium was prepared by the addition of NaCl to regular growth medium. For assaying p38 and c-jun phosphorylation, cells were kept up to 60 min in hyperosmotic medium before extracts were prepared. For assaying luciferase activity, cells were treated for 24 h under hyperosmotic conditions before extract preparation. Controls in which cells were treated with isosmotic instead of hyperosmotic medium were always included. At the end of treatment, cells were lysed on ice with cell lysis buffer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory catalog number 1820 plus the following additives: 5 μm microcystin LR, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmsodium metavanadate, 4 mm Pefabloc® SC, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The soluble components were separated from cellular debris by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. 50-μl aliquots of supernatants were stored frozen at −80 °C for later analysis of p38 and c-Jun phosphorylation or used immediately for luciferase and protein assays. SDS-PAGE was performed under standard denaturing conditions in a NOVEX MiniCell using 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels and Tris-glycine buffer system. Prestained, broad-range SDS-PAGE standards served as molecular weight markers. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μm, Millipore) by semi-dry transfer in a Pharmacia Multiphor II Novablot unit. We used a continuous buffer system (25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine, 20% v/v methanol) for 90 min at 100 mA constant current to achieve optimal transfer of proteins around 40 kDa. For immunodetection, membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C and processed according to the instructions of the manufacturer of the p38 and c-Jun antibodies and the Phototope® Star ECL reagents (New England Biolabs). Protein A-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used instead of secondary antibody. Blots were exposed to Hyperfilm™-ECL (Amersham) between 1 and 45 min, and the films were developed using a M35A X-Omat automatic film processor (Kodak). Films were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer (model PDSI-P90), and the volume of the bands (area × intensity) was quantified in the same area for all bands using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The volume of the bands was automatically corrected for film background and expressed as densitometric volume units by the software. Expression vectors of dominant negative mutants SEK1-AL (Ser204 → Ala and Ser207 → Leu) and MKK3-AL (Ser231 → Ala and Thr235 → Leu) as well as pMT2 plasmid were generous gifts from Dr. James Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute) (16Zanke B.W.

Luciferase reporter construct ARL(−1170/−894) carrying a 277-base pair fragment that contains the aldose reductase osmotic response element (AR-ORE) has been described previously (14Ferraris J.D.

PAP-HT25 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ and OPTI-MEM® medium generally according to the manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) instructions. Specifically, 1 μg/ml of each plasmid was transfected at a Lipofectamine™ concentration of 6 μl/ml. During the initial 5 h, lipofected cells were incubated in the presence of OPTI-MEM® serum-reduced medium and were incubated thereafter in a 1:1 mixture of OPTI-MEM® serum-reduced medium and PAP-HT25 growth medium containing 2 × serum. Transfection conditions (five per experiment) were run simultaneously in six 60-mm dishes per each condition (30 dishes per experiment). After 24 h the medium in all dishes was exchanged with isosmotic PAP-HT25 growth medium. After another 24 h the medium of three dishes per condition was exchanged with the same isosmotic medium (controls), whereas the remaining three dishes were subjected to hyperosmotic stress (PAP-HT25 growth medium + 150 mm NaCl). After a final 24-h incubation period under these conditions, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline of respective osmolality. Aliquots of cells that were cotransfected with pcDNA3/His/lacZplasmid were used for determination of transfection efficiencies by staining with X-gal solution overnight and counting of blueversus unstained cells. The remaining cells were lysed by the addition of 300 μl of cell lysis buffer/dish. Cell lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatants were immediately used for assaying luciferase activity and protein content. Samples were assayed in duplicate for luciferase activity using an enhanced luciferase assay kit from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured with a Monolight® 2010 luminometer in dual-ejection mode (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). For determination of protein content a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit from Pierce was used. Absorbance of protein samples was measured with a UV/Vis-1601 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Calibrations and protein assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity is represented as relative light units/μg of protein. To separate the transiently transfected cells from nontransfected cells we utilized the Capture-Tec™ pHook™-1 kit (Invitrogen). PAP-HT25 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg/ml pHook™-1 plasmid encoding a single-chain antibody (sFv) against the hapten 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one (phOx). This antibody is expressed and displayed on the cell surface of transfected cells and specifically binds to Capture-Tec™ magnetic beads coated with the hapten phOx. Following transfection, cells were processed according to the instructions of the Capture-Tec™ pHook™-1 kit (Invitrogen). Incubations in the presence of Capture-Tec™ beads were done either at isosmotic or at hyperosmotic conditions for 60 min at room temperature on a LabQuake tube rotator (PGC Scientific). Identical incubations were done in the absence of Capture-Tec™ beads (unselected). Beads covered with cells were separated using a magnetic stand (Invitrogen). Both unselected and selected cells were pelleted, lysed in 25 μl of cell lysis buffer, and stored at −80 °C until used for protein assays and Western blots. Selection efficiency was determined in separate experiments by cotransfection of pHook™-1 and pcDNA3/His/lacZ plasmids followed by X-gal staining of selected versus unselected cells. Analysis of the data was done using ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls analysis to test for significant differences between group means. The significance threshold was set atp < 0.05. All statistical analysis was carried out using StatMost™ 32 software (DataMost™ Corp.). Time series experiments during which PAP-HT25 cells were exposed to hyperosmotic medium (600 mosmol/kg H2O) or isosmotic control conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O) were conducted to test for induction of p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways in mammalian kidney cells. Four identical aliquots from each cell lysate were processed in parallel by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. They were developed using PhosphoPlus™ p38 P-Tyr182 antibody (Fig. 1 A), nonphosphospecific p38 antibody (Fig. 1 B), PhosphoPlus™ c-Jun P-Ser73 antibody (Fig. 1 C), or nonphosphospecific c-Jun antibody (Fig. 1 D). Western blots of cell lysates probed with PhosphoPlus™ p38 P-Tyr182antibody demonstrated a strong increase in p38 phosphorylation after hyperosmotic shock (Fig. 1 A). This increase in p38 phosphorylation was detectable as early as after 1 min of hyperosmotic shock, was maximal after 20 min of hyperosmotic shock, and was not induced under isosmotic control conditions (Fig. 1 A). Increased phosphorylation of c-Jun, a specific target of SAPK/JNK, was also detectable as early as 1 min after hyperosmotic shock and not apparent in isosmotic control samples (Fig. 1 C). c-Jun phosphorylation reached a maximum level slightly later (after 40 min) than p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). Absolute levels of p38 (Fig. 1 B) and c-jun (Fig. 1 D) did not change within 60 min of hyperosmotic treatment. Lipofection of PAP-HT25 cells using Lipofectamine™ resulted in very high transfection efficiencies. The efficiency of transfection using this method did not depend on medium osmolality, at least not for incubations up to 24 h, which were the longest incubation periods in hyperosmotic medium used in this study (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, transfection efficiencies did not depend on medium osmolality when cells were simultaneously transfected with two different kinds of plasmids and either selected using Capture-Tec™ bead technology or just treated comparably without adding Capture-Tec™ beads (unselected, Fig.2 B). Very close to 100% of transfected cells were successfully selected in both isosmotic and hyperosmotic medium (Fig.2 B). The effectiveness and specificity of dominant negative MKK3-AL and SEK1-AL mutants was checked by cotransfecting PAP-HT25 cells with a mutant together with pHook™-1 plasmid (whose expression can be used to select transfected cells) and incubating cells for 60 min in hyperosmotic medium before lysis. Part of transfected cells were selected during this 60-min incubation period using the Capture-Tec™ system, and the remainder was incubated in the absence of Capture-Tec™ magnetic beads (unselected cells). Four samples from each cell lysate were processed in parallel by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and developed using PhosphoPlus™ p38 P-Tyr182 antibody (Fig.3 A), nonphosphospecific p38 antibody (Fig.3 B), PhosphoPlus™ c-Jun P-Ser73 antibody (Fig.3 C), or nonphosphospecific c-Jun antibody (Fig.3 D). Phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun is significantly increased by hyperosmolality (p < 0.001) both in nontransfected cells (Fig. 3, A and C,lanes b, and Table I) and in cells transfected with pHook™-1 only (Fig. 3, A andC, lanes 1, and Table I). However, in cells cotransfected with MKK3-AL and pHook™-1 hyperosmotic p38 phosphorylation is significantly inhibited (p < 0.001)(Fig. 3 A, lane 3, and Table I). Under these conditions, p38 phosphorylation is significantly partially inhibited even without selection of transfected cells (p < 0.05)(Fig. 3 A, lane 2, and Table I). The degree of inhibition by MKK3-AL in nonselected cells (40.4–46.1%, Table I) is comparable with the transfection efficiency (45.9–50.1%, Fig. 2). p38 phosphorylation is not significantly different between isosmotic controls and hyperosmotically shocked, selected cells that contain MKK3-AL (Table I). In contrast, MKK3-AL has no effect on hyperosmotic phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and3, and Table I). Conversely, cotransfection of cells with SEK1-AL and pHook™-1 prevents hyperosmotic phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 5). In nonselected cells this inhibition is significant (p < 0.05) and with 45.7–51.6% (Table I) similar to the transfection efficiency (45.9–50.1%, Fig. 2). For selected cells c-Jun phosphorylation is not significantly different between isosmotic controls and hyperosmotically shocked cells containing SEK1-AL (TableI). On the other hand, SEK1-AL does not prevent hyperosmotic phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and5, and Table I). Absolute levels of p38 and c-Jun did not differ under any of the conditions tested (Fig. 3, B andD, and Table I). These data demonstrate that MKK3-AL and SEK1-AL are very efficient dominant negative mutants in transiently transfected PAP-HT25 cells. Moreover, MKK3-AL specifically blocks hyperosmotic activation of the p38 pathway, whereas SEK1-AL specifically blocks hyperosmotic activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway.Table IDensitometric quantification of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated p38 and c-JunIsosmotic1-aTreatment of cells for 60 min at isosmotic control conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O) or hyperosmotic conditions (600 mosmol/kg H2O).+Hyperosmotic1-aTreatment of cells for 60 min at isosmotic control conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O) or hyperosmotic conditions (600 mosmol/kg H2O).++++++MKK3-AL++SEK1-AL++Selected1-bSelected for transfection using the Capture-Tec™ pHook™-1 system (see “Experimental Procedure”).+++Phospho-p3868 ± 19846 ± 194765 ± 106456 ± 10941 ± 15744 ± 241727 ± 107p381,055 ± 1341,138 ± 232852 ± 981,112 ± 276867 ± 521,035 ± 95935 ± 106Phospho-c-jun54 ± 631,364 ± 2611,588 ± 1811,384 ± 2001,609 ± 191769 ± 257266 ± 118c-jun752 ± 149673 ± 129795 ± 100693 ± 117758 ± 94792 ± 99793 ± 93Values represent the means ± S.E.

To examine whether hyperosmotic induction through the AR-ORE is signaled via p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways, we transfected PAP-HT25 cells with AR-ORE luciferase reporter construct alone or together with either MKK3-AL, SEK1-AL, pcDNA3 (empty MKK3-AL vector), or pMT2 (empty SEK1-AL vector). Neither MKK3-AL nor SEK1-AL prevented the hyperosmotic induction through AR-ORE. The increase of luciferase activity was similar under all conditions, ranging approximately between 5- and 7-fold over their respective isosmotic controls (Fig.4). The experiment shown in Fig. 4 was repeated four times with independent batches of cells yielding comparable results. The lack of an effect of MKK3-AL and SEK1-AL on hyperosmoticAR-ORE induction indicates that in mammalian kidney cellsAR-ORE is not targeted by the p38 or by the SAPK/JNK kinase cascade even though both of these pathways are strongly activated after hyperosmotic shock. We show that two mammalian phosphorylation cascades, the p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways, are hyperosmotically activated in mammalian renal medullary cells. Even though this has been shown using p38 and SAPK/JNK expression vectors for other mammalian cells (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar, 8Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), this is the first confirmation of hyperosmotic activation of intrinsic p38 and SAPK/JNK in renal medullary cells. An important unique feature of renal medullary cells is that they are routinely exposed to large osmotic fluctuationsin vivo. Hyperosmotic activation of p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways is potentially of great physiological significance for these cells. Yeast studies have demonstrated that p38 and SAPK/JNK, but not other MAPKs, complement mutants that lack the HOG1 gene and rescue mutants from lethality in hyperosmotic medium (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar, 8Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 and SAPK/JNK are structurally very similar to HOG1 and take the same positions within the homologous mammalian kinase cascades. p38 displays overall amino acid identity of 52% to HOG1 (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Amino acid identity between SAPK/JNK and HOG1 is 41% (8Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The elements of MAPK cascades have been conserved throughout evolution from yeast to mammals and include MAPK (yeast HOG1, mammalian p38, and SAPK/JNK), MAPK kinase (yeast PBS2, mammalian SEK1/MKK4, and MKK3), and MAPK kinase kinase (yeast SSK2/SSK22 and mammalian MEKK1). The closest mammalian homologue of HOG1 is p38, judging by their high sequence similarity and identical dual phosphorylation motif (Thr-Gly-Tyr) (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Sience. 1994; 265: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). In other ERKs amino acids other than Gly separate the two phosphorylation sites. Thus, hyperosmolality activates functionally and structurally homologous protein kinase cascades in yeast and mammalian cells. This finding raises the question whether functionally similar elements upstream and downstream of these pathways are also conserved between yeast and mammals. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, one target downstream of the HOG1 pathway is the gene encoding GPD1, which is necessary for survival of yeast at high osmolality (17Larsson K. Ansell R. Eriksson P. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hyperosmotic activation of GPD1 depends on the HOG1 pathway and leads to increased transcription and translation of GPD1 (6Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). This results in enhanced synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate by NAD+-dependent, GPD1-catalyzed reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This reaction is of specific adaptive value because it is the semifinal and rate-limiting step in the production of glycerol, which is a major organic osmolyte in yeast. Osmotic stress has been shown to be mediated via the HOG1 pathway to positively regulate a STRE in the 5′-flanking region of several genes (18Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) notably also TPS2, which encodes trehalose phosphate phosphatase, an enzyme that is important for synthesis of the compatible osmolyte trehalose (5Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Among the different MAPK pathways described in yeast only the HOG1 pathway affects transcription via STRE, and the proteins MSN2 and MSN4 are thought to be the positive transcription factors that induce STRE in situations of hyperosmotic stress (19Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). In the mammalian renal inner medullary cell line, PAP-HT25, transcription and translation of aldose reductase, an enzyme catalyzing synthesis of the osmoprotectant sorbitol from glucose, is increased by hyperosmotic stress (20Garcia-Perez A. Martin B. Murphy H.R. Uchida S. Murer H. Cowley Jr., B.D. Handler J.S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular sorbitol levels via its synthesis is comparable with regulation of yeast glycerol. Glycerol is not an important osmolyte in mammalian cells, but sorbitol is one of five major osmolytes in kidney cells, the others being glycine-betaine, myoinositol, taurine, and glycerophosphocholine. In contrast to sorbitol, cellular levels of glycine-betaine, myoinositol, and taurine are regulated via active transport across the plasma membrane, and glycerophosphocholine concentration is regulated by degradation (12Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In analogy to the positively regulated osmosensitive STRE in yeast, a positive ORE has been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the mammalian AR gene (14Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.-Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast to the extensive knowledge in yeast, little is known about signaling events that mediate hyperosmotic activation of AR-ORE. Because of the similarity between yeast glycerol and mammalian sorbitol systems, it seemed likely thatAR-ORE might be targeted by the p38 pathway, but our results are not consistent with this possibility. The second mammalian protein kinase capable of functionally complementing yeast HOG1 deletion mutants, SAPK/JNK, apparently is also not involved in signaling hyperosmotic stress to AR-ORE. Therefore, hyperosmotic activation of AR transcription apparently is regulated via a different pathway than hyperosmotic activation of yeastGPD1. In light of the strong homology between mammalian p38, SAPK/JNK, and yeast HOG1 and the analogy in hyperosmotic regulation and osmoprotective function of the yeast glycerol and the mammalian sorbitol systems, this finding seems somewhat surprising. However, no strictly comparable targets of yeast HOG1 and mammalian p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways have been identified thus far. Similarly, no homologous activators of yeast HOG1 and mammalian p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways upstream of the respective MAPK kinase kinase are reported. The yeast HOG1 pathway is directly regulated by a two-component osmosensor phosphorelay system consisting of the osmosensor SLN1 (21Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), the phosphorelay protein YPD1 (22Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), and the response regulator SSK1 (3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar,23Brewster J.L. De Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Despite considerable efforts, no animal homologues of two-component systems have been reported. A second yeast transmembrane osmosensor, SHO1, activating the HOG1 pathway by direct interaction with PBS2 has no known mammalian homologues (4Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In contrast to the specific osmosensor pathway in yeast, activation of mammalian p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways apparently is signaled via a less specific mechanism. Recently, it was found that hyperosmolality and UV-B irradiation lead to SAPK/JNK activation that is mediated by unspecific clustering of different kinds of growth factor receptors and cytokine receptors in the absence of ligands (24Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The biophysical principles underlying receptor clustering have not yet been uncovered, but it seems possible that rearrangements in membrane lipid order and conformational changes in membrane proteins may be involved. Physical perturbation of the plasma membrane may also induce cytoskeletal rearrangements. These have been shown to activate small RHO-like GTPases RAC and CDC42, which in turn are potent activators of PAK, a MAPK kinase kinase kinase activating p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways (25Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar,26Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Based on our current knowledge it seems that despite high evolutionary conservation of yeast HOG1 and mammalian p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways, elements upstream and downstream of these kinase cascades differ considerably between yeast and mammals. Because p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways are hyperosmotically activated in mammalian cells but do not induceAR-ORE, they could have other targets of adaptive value after hyperosmotic shock. These targets may be of general importance for protection against a variety of cellular stresses and not be limited to osmoprotection. Consistent with this idea, p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways are also strongly induced by other environmental stresses and by anti-inflammatory cytokines (11Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones are induced by a variety of cellular stresses, including hyperosmolality, and are of particular importance for protecting and refolding proteins during stressful conditions (27Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Hyperosmotic activation of HSP25/27 is conferred via phosphorylation in a p38-dependent fashion (28Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins are also osmotically activated via increased transcription (12Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Heat shock factor 1 is activated and binds heat shock element in 3T3 cells upon hyperosmotic shock (29Alfieri R. Petronini P.G. Urbani S. Borghetti A.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another important part of the machinery that protects against stress is the proteolytic system that degrades and removes defective cellular proteins. Internalization and proteolysis of growth factor and cytokine receptors is preceded by clustering of these proteins at the cell surface (24Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Perhaps the resultant activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway helps induce the cellular proteolytic system. Also, SAPK/JNK and p38 pathways induce apoptosis of some mammalian cells (30Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar, 31Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and cell cycle delay and cellular repair in others (11Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether targets of p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways mediate these responses and to compare the response with those in yeast, considering that the yeast HOG1 pathway induces DNA damage-responsive gene (DDR2) and a gene encoding cytoplasmic catalase T (CTT1) via STRE (5Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Our results are not consistent with the theory that the ORE is targeted by p38 or SAPK/JNK pathways. In principle, AR transcription could be regulated by p38 or SAPK/JNK via a different DNA element. If so, then this would presumably be in cooperation with the ORE, because the ORE is the only element known independently to confer hyperosmotic AR induction (14Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.-Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is not obvious why a signaling pathway proceeding from specific cell surface receptors to the nucleus should be employed by cells for osmotic regulation of genes and proteins. In contrast to growth factors, cytokines, or other small signaling molecules, osmotic stress may change the volume or ionic concentration of all cell compartments. Thus, no specific cell surface receptors may be required, which would eliminate the need for more distant signaling steps. DNA, RNA, and protein structure and interactions of these molecules are directly influenced by osmotic strength (32Douzou P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Egli M. Portmann S. Usman N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8489-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 34Timasheff S.N. Annu.

A. 1996; 93: 4754-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The question remains, however, as to how such direct effects could signal specific osmoregulatory responses. In conclusion, although homologous MAPK pathways are activated by hyperosmolality in yeast and mammalian cells, there seems to be considerable divergence upstream and downstream of these cascades.

Yeast has 10 such intron-containing tRNA gene families (of the approximately 45 total tRNA gene families) (see Ref. 1Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 99-141Google Scholar for review), and humans have at least one intron-containing tRNA gene family (2van Tol H. Beier H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1951-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since all known eukaryotic nuclear-encoded tRNATyr genes contain introns, it is likely that tRNA splicing is essential in all eukaryotes for processing of tRNA genes. tRNA introns are invariably located 1 base 3′ of the anticodon, and this location is critical for the the first step of splicing. In both Xenopus and yeast the endonuclease binds the mature domain of the precursor tRNA, measures the length of the anticodon stem to locate the intron (3Reyes V.M. Abelson J.

The products of the reaction are exons bearing 2′-3′ cyclic phosphates and 5′-hydroxyl groups at their ends, as shown in Fig. 1 (7Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J.

The ligase from yeast catalyzes four distinct chemical steps to effect ligation: the 2′-3′ cyclic phosphate at the end of the 5′ exon is opened to a 2′-phosphate by a cyclic phosphodiesterase activity; the 5′-OH at the beginning of the 3′ exon is phosphorylated by a polynucleotide kinase activity in the presence of GTP; the 5′-phosphate is activated by adenylylation from ATP; and then ligation occurs with loss of the adenylate moiety (9Greer C.L.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) also generates splice junctions with a 2′-phosphate, and the wheat germ protein is very similar in catalytic activities to the yeast enzyme (16Pick L. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6684-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pick L. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6694-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since removal of the 2′-terminal phosphate prevents the yeast ligase from working in vitro (10Westaway S.K. Belford H.G. Apostol B.L. Abelson J. Greer C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2435-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Knapp G. Ogden R.C. Peebles C.L. Abelson J. Cell. 1979; 18: 37-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the 2′-phosphate is likely formed at the splice junction when this ligase acts in vivo. The yeast ligase is known to be responsible for tRNA splicing in yeast, since conditional ligase mutants accumulate unligated tRNA exons under nonpermissive conditions (19Phizicky E.M. Consaul S.A. Nehrke K.W. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a second ligase, which uses a completely different chemical reaction and does not generate a splice junction 2′-phosphate, has been implicated in tRNA splicing in humansin vitro (20Filipowicz W. Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1983; 32: 547-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Laski F.A. Fire A.Z. RajBhandary U.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1981; 145: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Removal of the splice junction 2′-phosphate occurs by a highly unusual reaction: a 2′-phosphotransferase transfers the splice junction phosphate to NAD, forming the novel NAD derivative, ADP-ribose 1“-2” cyclic phosphate (Appr>p) 1The abbreviations used are: Appr>p, ADP-ribose 1“-2” cyclic phosphate; r>p, ribose 1,2-cyclic phosphate; ORF, open reading frame; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (23Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillman M. Kierzek R. Michaud N. LaReau R.D. Turner D.H. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence support the claim that the yeast enzyme catalyzes this step in the cell (24McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Zillmann M. Gorovsky M.A. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10289-10294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, the phosphotransferase is highly specific for substrates bearing an internal 2′-phosphate; an oligonucleotide bearing an internal 2′-phosphate is efficiently dephosphorylated, whereas oligonucleotides terminating with 5′-, 3′-, 2′-, or 2′-3′ cyclic phosphates are not detectably dephosphorylated. Second, this is the only activity detected in crude extracts that can efficiently remove the 2′-phosphate from ligated tRNA. A similar 2′-phosphotransferase has been described in HeLa cell extracts; like the yeast enzyme the HeLa enzyme is highly specific for substrates with internal 2′-phosphates and is the only activity that can efficiently dephosphorylate 2′-phosphorylated ligated tRNA (25Zillmann M. Gorovsky M.A. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10289-10294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it is likely that the phosphotransferase can act in vivo on tRNA substrates: Xenopus oocytes injected with 2′-phosphorylated ligated tRNA catalyze formation of Appr>p concomitant with dephosphorylation (23Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillman M. Kierzek R. Michaud N. LaReau R.D. Turner D.H. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To begin to study the role of the phosphotransferase in yeast, we have purified the protein and cloned its structural gene (TPT1;tRNA 2′-phosphotransferase). Phosphotransferase was purified ∼28,000-fold, the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined, and the appropriate DNA was isolated by colony hybridization of a yeast genomic library. The identified ORF was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to catalyze 2′-phosphotransferase activity, implying that phosphotransferase is a single catalytic polypeptide. 2′-Phosphotransferase is essential for vegetative growth in yeast, as demonstrated by analysis of strains with chromosomal deletions in the TPT1 gene. The sequence of the phosphotransferase does not reveal any obvious binding or catalytic motifs. Several significantly similar ORFs are identified by searches of the data base, including a particularly strong one inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Ligated tRNAPhewith a 32P-labeled splice junction 2′-phosphate was prepared by in vitro endonucleolytic cleavage and ligation (with partially purified enzymes) of an [α-32P]ATP-labeled pre-tRNAPhe transcript (26McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11986-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled pre-tRNAPhe transcript (340 Ci/mmol) was derived from T7 RNA polymerase transcription of a plasmid-borne copy of the end-matured pre-tRNAPhe gene (27Reyes V.M. Abelson J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transfer of the 2′-phosphate from ligated tRNA to NAD to form Appr>p was performed as described by McCraith and Phizicky (26McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11986-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 10 μl reaction mixtures in phosphotransferase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.4% Triton X-100) containing 1–4 fmol of ligated tRNA, 1 mm NAD, and 1 μl of 2′-phosphotransferase diluted in Buffer B containing 100 μg/ml BSA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and applied to polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates that were developed in 2m sodium formate, pH 3.6, to separate Appr>p from the tRNA (26McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11986-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity corresponds to the amount of phosphotransferase required to transfer 50% of the 2′-phosphate from 1 fmol of ligated tRNA to NAD in 20 min, determined by serial dilution. Yeast strains YM4126 (SC724) (MATa, ura 3–52, his 3Δ200, ade2–101,lys2–801 leu2–3, 112, trp1–903 GAL +), YM4127 (SC725) (MATa, ura3–52, his3-Δ200, ade2–101, lys2–801, leu2–3, 112, trp1–903 tyr1–501 GAL +), YM4128 (SC726) (MATα,ura3–52, his3-Δ200, ade2–101, lys2–801 leu2–3, 112, trp1–903 GAL +), and YM4129 (SC727) (MATα, ura3–52, his3-Δ200, ade2–101, lys2–801, leu2–3, 112, trp1–903 tyr1–501 GAL +) were obtained from Mark Johnston (Department of Genetics, Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO). YM4126 was crossed with YM4129 to create the diploid SC759 (picked from the zygotes), and YM4127 was crossed withYM4128 to create the diploid SC758. SC804 (TPT1 +/tpt1-Δ1) was derived from SC759 by one-step gene replacement with pGMC22 (tpt1-Δ1::LEU2), and SC805 (TPT1 +/tpt1-Δ2) was derived from SC758 by one-step gene replacement with pGMC17 (tpt1-Δ2::LEU2). SC466 (MATα, ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, his3-Δ200 lys2–801) was described previously (28Robinson M.K. van Zyl W.H. Phizicky E.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3634-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and JHRY-20-2Ca (Mata, his3-Δ200, leu2–3, 112, ura 3–52, pep4::URA3) was obtained from Tom Stevens (Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR). YP medium contains 1% yeast extract and 2% peptone, minimal medium is described by Sherman (29Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), and 5-fluoroorotic acid medium is described by Boeke et al.(30Boeke J.D. La Croute F. Fink G.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Strain JHRY-20-2Ca was grown in a 100-liter fermentor (New Brunswick model IF130) at 30 °C to an A 600 of 4 in YP medium containing 2% glucose, 0.083 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.033 μg/ml penicillin, 0.5% ethanol, and 0.17% polyethylene glycol, and cells were chilled with ice and harvested in a Westfalia Clarifier (Centrico Inc., Northvale, NJ). To measure phosphotransferase expression, strain JHRY-20-2Ca transformed with either the 2μLEU2 vector yEPlac181 or with pGMC5 (yEPlac181TPT1 +) was grown at 30 °C in minimal medium lacking leucine to A 600 = 0.45. SC466 transformed with either the GAL10 promoter vector pBM150 (CEN URA3 PGAL10) or with pGMC21 (pBM150 PGAL10-TPT1) was grown overnight in minimal medium containing 2% raffinose and lacking uracil, and cells were inoculated directly into 75-ml cultures of YP + 2% galactose or YP + 2% glucose and grown for 2.5 generations. Cells were harvested, washed, resuspended, and made into extracts as described below for the purification of phosphotransferase. The vectors yCPlac33, yEPlac195, and yEPlac 181 were constructed by Geitz and Sugino (31Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The TPT1 gene was isolated by E. coli colony hybridization of a yeast genomic library (32Briggs M.W. Butler J.S. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 318-328Google Scholar), using the 5′32P-oligomer CCGCTGTATGTCGAAGCAGATATG (an antisense oligomer corresponding to nucleotides 79–56 of Fig. 4 A), as a probe. Large fragments encompassing the TPT1 gene (see Fig. 4 B) from the isolated plasmid (pEMP981) were ligated into the multicloning sites of the URA3 CEN vector yCPlac33 to construct pGMC1 (EcoRI-SacI fragment), theURA3 2-μm vector yEPlac195 to construct pGMC4 (EcoRI-PstI fragment), the LEU2 2-μm vector yEPlac181 to construct pGMC5 (EcoRI-PstI fragment), and pSP72 vector to construct pGMC7 (EcoRI-HpaI fragment of EMP981 ligated into theEcoRI and PvuII vector fragment). Disruptions of the TPT1 gene were generated by insertion of a LEU2 HindIII fragment (obtained from a polylinker-insertedLEU2 SspI chromosomal fragment, modified to containHindIII ends) into one of two positions within theTPT1 gene, as illustrated in Fig. 4 B: to replace the HindIII fragment of 226 nucleotides around the ATG translation start of pGMC7, generating pGMC22 (tpt1-Δ1::LEU2), or to replace the 744 base pair HindIII-AflII fragment of pGMC7, after filling in the AflII end and adding aHindIII linker, generating pGMC17 (tpt1-Δ2::LEU2). pGMC10 contains the TPT1 ORF bounded by engineeredEcoRI sites, ligated into pSP72. It was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the TPT1 gene from the ATG of the ORF to a site 240 nucleotides downstream of the TAA termination codon (see Fig. 4 B), using Taqpolymerase and primers dP-1 (AGAGGAATTCACAGGTGGCCGAAGGTGCTGCC) and dP-2 (GACGAATTCATGCGCCAGGTACTACAAAAAG), followed by EcoRI digestion, ligation into the vector, and sequencing of transformants to identify an otherwise unaltered gene. The EcoRI fragment of pGMC10 was inserted into pBM150 (34Phizicky E.M. Schwartz R.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2978-2986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to place the TPT1 gene under control of the yeast GAL10 promoter (pGMC21) and into pKK223-3 (34Phizicky E.M. Schwartz R.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2978-2986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to place the TPT1 gene under control of the E. coli tac promoter (pGMC9). E. colistrain RZ510 (relevant genotype lac i SQ) was transformed with pKK223-3 vector or with pGMC9 to express theTPT1 gene. 50-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C in L broth to an A 600 of 0.8, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h, and cells were harvested, resuspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 450 mmNaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol, and sonicated on ice in 10 s bursts for 1 min. Extracts obtained after centrifugation (12.5 mg/ml) were aliquoted, frozen, and thawed to measure phosphotransferase activity. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Polypeptides were visualized after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by silver staining, as described (35Marhall T. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2.5 kg (wet weight) of frozen yeast were thawed, washed with 5 liters of Wash Buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm DTT), resuspended in 1.25 liters of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1m NaCl, 1.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.2 μg/ml pepstatin A), and lysed with 0.5-mm glass beads using a Bead-Beater, as described by McCraith and Phizicky (24McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Crude extract was obtained by passing the mixture through a coarse sintered glass funnel, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 40 min. Protein was precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation, followed by centrifugation at 14,700 ×g for 45 min. The protein pellet was washed with 2 liters of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 59% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 2′-phosphotransferase activity was recovered by two successive extractions of the 59% pellet with 2 liters of Buffer A containing 46% saturated ammonium sulfate, followed by centrifugation to remove the pellet. Protein in the combined supernatants was reprecipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate (to 80% saturation) and centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 350 mm NaCl, and dialyzed overnight against 20 liters of this buffer. Dialyzed protein was applied to a 250 ml blue Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in the same buffer, washed, and active fractions (700 ml) flowed through the column. These fractions were pooled, diluted 2-fold with Buffer B lacking NaCl, reapplied to the blue Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer B containing 0.175 m NaCl, and retained protein was eluted with a 2-liter linear gradient of Buffer B from 0.175 to 2m NaCl. 2′-Phosphotransferase eluted at 450–500 mm NaCl. Active fractions (350 ml) from the blue Sepharose column were dialyzed against Buffer B containing 40 mm NaCl, applied to a 250-ml heparin-Sepharose column, and activity was eluted with a gradient of Buffer B containing 40–900 mm NaCl. Active fractions (25 ml) were loaded directly onto a 15-ml hydroxylapaptite column (DNA grade Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer C (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaCl), and phosphotransferase activity was eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer C containing 0–0.25 m K2HPO4 (pH 7.5 with phosphoric acid). Peak fractions from the hydroxylapatite column (8 ml) were dialyzed against Buffer B containing 40 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol, applied to a 0.5-ml orange A Sepharose column (Amicon Division, W. R. Grace & Co., Beverly, MA), and 2′-phosphotransferase was eluted with a gradient of Buffer B from 40 to 700 mm NaCl. Active fractions, (250 μl each), were dialyzed individually against Buffer B containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and 55 mm NaCl and subsequently stored at −20 °C. Little loss of activity was observed over 3 months. A streamlined purification yielded material that was about 4-fold less pure. Crude extracts were dialyzed against Buffer B containing 0.15m NaCl, loaded directly on a 500-ml blue Sepharose column, and retained protein was eluted with a 2.5-liter gradient of Buffer B containing 150 mm to 1.5 m NaCl. Active fractions (which elute at higher salt concentration (0.6 m) than in the preparation above) were then subjected to chromatography on heparin-agarose, hydroxylapatite, and orange A Sepharose as described above. 100–200 pmol of purified phosphotransferase was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, and used for sequencing essentially as described by Matsudaira (36Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer was done in a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus at room temperature for 4 h at 0.65 mA/square cm or 300 mA in transfer buffer containing 39 mmglycine, 48 mm Tris base, and 20% methanol. RNA-protein cross-linking reactions were assembled in 15 μl of phosphotransferase assay buffer containing 200 μg/ml BSA, 180,000 cpm of spliced tRNA, 750 units (approximately 5 ng) of 2′-phosphotransferase from the orange A column peak, 5 mmAMP, and no NAD. Reaction mixtures were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and proteins were cross-linked to RNA for 10 min at room temperature, using a UV source at 254 nm (UV-C Bleit 155 lamp, Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY) with an intensity of 2 milliwatts/cm2. Samples were supplemented with 55 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and digested with 7.5 units of ribonuclease T1 at 50 °C for 45 min. Proteins were precipitated at −20 °C by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%, followed by centrifugation to pellet the protein, washing with ice cold acetone, resuspension in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, boiling for 15 min, and electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The purification of 2′-phosphotransferase yields a prominent polypeptide of 30 kDa, which comigrates with activity. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, in which fractions from the final purification step were analyzed for both polypeptides and phosphotransferase activity. The amount of 30-kDa polypeptide closely parallels phosphotransferase activity in different fractions, both across the final orange A column (compare fractions 20–36 in Figs. 2,A and B) and in the peak fractions from the heparin-agarose and hydroxylapatite columns of the purification (Fig.2 A). Three other minor polypeptides are visible in this preparation of 2′-phosphotransferase activity, with apparent molecular masses of 52, 45, and 20 kDa. Neither of the chromatographic profiles of the 52-kDa or the 45-kDa polypeptides corresponds to the observed activity peak from the orange A column (Fig. 2); however, the profile of the 20-kDa polypeptide does appear to correspond to the observed activity peak from this column. The same 30-kDa polypeptide, but not the 20-kDa polypeptide, also copurifies with activity using a streamlined purification procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”), and if the material from the penultimate step of this streamlined procedure is chromatographed on DEAE or on another heparin-agarose column (with isocratic elution) instead of the orange A column. Thus it seemed likely that the 30-kDa polypeptide is the limiting component responsible for 2′-phosphotransferase activity. The suggestion that the 30-kDa polypeptide is a component of the phosphotransferase is supported by the observation that it can be cross-linked to its substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, ligated tRNA bearing a 2′-phosphate, prepared from [α-32P]ATP-labeled pre-tRNA transcript, is cross-linked to a polypeptide of 30 kDa (band B1) from the peak orange A fraction, as visualized after RNase T1 treatment of the sample and subsequent electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This cross-linking requires both phosphotransferase and UV illumination. No UV-dependent cross-linking is observed to BSA, which was deliberately present at a 600-fold higher concentration than 2′-phosphotransferase and to the contaminating 52- and 45-kDa polypeptides. A band migrating at around 20 kDa (band B2) was present in all lanes, and thus represents an RNase T1-resistant background. Based on the apparent molecular mass of the cross-linked polypeptide (band B1), we conclude that the 30-kDa polypeptide comigrating with activity in the purification is the cross-linked protein. Separate experiments with less purified fractions demonstrate that the interaction of the 30-kDa polypeptide with tRNA is specific: cross-linking occurs with ligated tRNA bearing a 2′-phosphate, but not with dephosphorylated ligated tRNA (data not shown). Furthermore, cross-linking is inhibited by an excess of unlabeled synthetic substrate (UppU, which contains a 2′-phosphate) (23Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillman M. Kierzek R. Michaud N. LaReau R.D. Turner D.H. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Kierzek R. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1994; 13: 1757-1768Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 50 μm, but is not inhibited by the corresponding nonsubstrate (UpU) at a concentration of 10 mm (data not shown). Since the same size polypeptide copurifies with activity and cross-links to tRNA substrate, it is likely that this is one of the components of the phosphotransferase. Since, in addition there is reasonably good yield at each step of the purification (see Table I), and there is only one major copurifying polypeptide, it is likely that this polypeptide is the only catalytic subunit of the phosphotransferase. This conclusion is substantiated further below.Table IPurification of yeast 2′-phosphotransferase proteinFractionVolumeActivityProteinSpecific activityFold purification, step (overall)Yield, step (overall)mlunitsmgunits/mg%Extract18206.7 × 108136,0004.9 × 10346–59% (NH4)2SO410403.5 × 10817,3002.0 × 1044.1 (4.1)52Blue Sepharose #114002.4 × 1089,8002.4 × 1041.2 (4.9)69 (36)Blue Sepharose #2354.2 × 1071233.4 × 10514 (69)17 (6.3)Heparin Agarose256.6 × 10721.83.0 × 1068.9 (620)160 (9.9)Bio-Gel-HTP8.22.6 × 1071.172.2 × 1077.3 (4500)39 (3.9)Orange A Sepahrose1.11.1 × 1070.0801.4 × 1086.2 (28,000)42 (1.6) Open table in a new tab To clone the structural gene for the phosphotransferase, we sequenced the N-terminal end of the 30-kDa protein in the final orange A column, after transfer of the polypeptides to polyvinylidene difluoride paper and excision of the appropriate region. We obtained 14 amino acids of N-terminal sequence. The same sequence was also obtained from two other experiments with equivalent, but less pure, material obtained from the streamlined purification procedure, which contained slightly different contaminants. Furthermore, the yield of amino acids obtained from the initial steps of the sequencing run corresponded roughly to the number of moles of 30-kDa polypeptide subjected to sequencing. Thus, we were likely sequencing the major polypeptide present at 30 kDa and not a minor contaminant. The 2′-phosphotransferase gene (TPT1) was isolated by reverse genetics. The sequence of 14 amino acids was compared with the information in the yeast data base, and a single perfect match was found at the N-terminal end of an ORF of 26.2 kDa, located on chromosome XV. The sequence of this ORF is shown in Fig.4 A. No other near matches were found in the yeast data base. An oligonucleotide probe was designed from the data base DNA sequence, and this probe was used to isolate the gene from a yeast genomic library by colony hybridization, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A schematic of a portion of chromosome XV that was isolated is illustrated in Fig. 4 B, showing the position of the TPT1 ORF and neighboring ORFs. Plasmids containing the phosphotransferase gene, constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were then used to confirm that the gene encodes 2′-phosphotransferase. Overproduction of Tpt1 protein in yeast results in overproduction of 2′-phosphotransferase activity. This was established in two experiments, which are summarized in Table II. First, high gene dosage results in overproduction of activity. Extracts made from a strain bearing a high copy plasmid containing the gene and its regulatory regions (2-μmTPT1) have about 55-fold more phosphotransferase activity than extracts from the same strain bearing the plasmid vector alone (Table II). Second, placing the open reading frame under control of a regulatable promoter in yeast results in regulated overproduction of the phosphotransf"
https://openalex.org/W2005649052,"Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar RNA-binding protein that seems to be involved in many aspects of ribosome biogenesis. Nucleolin contains four copies of a consensus RNA-binding domain (CS-RBD) found in several other proteins. In vitroRNA-binding studies previously determined that nucleolin interacts specifically with a short RNA stem-loop structure. Taken individually, none of the four CS-RBDs interacts significantly with the RNA target, but a peptide that contains the first two adjacent CS-RBDs (R12) is sufficient to account for nucleolin RNA-binding specificity and affinity. The full integrity of these two domains is required, since N- or C-terminal deletion abolishes the specific interaction with the RNA. Mutation of conserved amino acids within the RNP-1 sequence of CS-RBD 1 or 2 drastically reduces the interaction with the RNA, whereas mutation of the analogous residues in CS-RBDs 3 and 4 has no effect in the context of the R1234G protein (which corresponds to the C-terminal end of nucleolin). Our results demonstrate that nucleolin RNA-binding specificity is the result of a cooperation between two CS-RBDs (RBDs 1 and 2) and also suggests a direct or indirect involvement of the RNP-1 consensus sequence of both CS-RBDs in the recognition of the RNA target. Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar RNA-binding protein that seems to be involved in many aspects of ribosome biogenesis. Nucleolin contains four copies of a consensus RNA-binding domain (CS-RBD) found in several other proteins. In vitroRNA-binding studies previously determined that nucleolin interacts specifically with a short RNA stem-loop structure.

Many aspects of the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression involve specific RNA-protein interactions (1McCarthy J. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem.

Selective RNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins is achieved through a variety of conserved protein motifs (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). One of the most common RNA binding motifs is the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence, also called RNA recognition motif or consensus RNA-binding domain (CS-RBD). 1The abbreviations used are: CS-RBD, consensus RNA-binding domain; NRE, nucleolin recognition element; CD, circular dichroism; hnRNP, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NS, nonspecific; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. 1The abbreviations used are: CS-RBD, consensus RNA-binding domain; NRE, nucleolin recognition element; CD, circular dichroism; hnRNP, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NS, nonspecific; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment.

In the first class, CS-RBDs interact specifically with single-stranded RNA sequences. These proteins include hnRNP A1 (11Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

This structure appears to be well conserved in other members of the CS-RBD gene family (27Görlach M. Wittekind M. Beckman R.A. Mueller L. Dreyfuss G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2852-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs are located in two adjacent β-strands, and conserved amino acids within these two motifs have been shown to be implicated in direct nucleotide contacts (31Jessen T.-H. Oubridge C. Teo C.H. Pritchard C. Nagai K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3447-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 32Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R.

This was conclusively demonstrated with the crystal structure of the U1A protein complexed with a variant of hairpin II of U1 snRNA (35Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.-H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The 10-nucleotide RNA loop binds to the surface of the β-sheet and interacts extensively with the conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs and with the C-terminal domain of the protein (31Jessen T.-H. Oubridge C. Teo C.H. Pritchard C. Nagai K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3447-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 36Allain F.H.T. Gubser C.C. Howe P.W.A. Nagai K. Neuhaus D. Varani G.

However, since the RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs are very conserved in a large number of CS-RBD proteins, they probably do not distinguish between different RNA target sequences; thus, determinants of RNA-binding specificity must reside in the more variable region or outside the CS-RBD motifper se (39Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Indeed, RNA-binding specificity determinants were found in the sequence adjacent to the CS-RBD for hnRNP C1, U1-snRNP (70 kDa), and Tra2 proteins (12Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

An interesting situation is found with proteins that contain multiple CS-RBDs like Sxl (16Kanaar R. Lee A. Rudner D.Z. Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), ASF/SF2 (14Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 42Caceres J.F.

For these proteins, the RNA-binding specificity of the full-length protein seems to require the cooperation of several CS-RBD domains.Nucleolin, which contains four CS-RBDs (45Lapeyre B. Bourbon H.

We showed previously that mouse and human nucleolin interact specifically with pre-rRNA and with in vitro selected RNAs that contain a hexanucleotide motif U/GCCCGA within a short stem-loop structure (21Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this study, we determine the minimal domain of nucleolin responsible for this specific interaction. We show that two CS-RBDs (CS-RBDs 1 and 2) are necessary and sufficient to account for the specific interaction of nucleolin with its RNA target. A recombinant protein corresponding to these 2 domains has the same binding properties as full-length nucleolin. Mutagenesis of the conserved amino acid residues within the RNP-1 motifs of domain 1 or 2, or deletion at either the N- or C-terminal extremities of domain 1 and 2, respectively, abolished the specific interaction with the RNA target. Furthermore, isolated CS-RBDs 1 and 2 possess no significant binding activities. Our results demonstrate that the RNA-binding specificity of nucleolin arises from a cooperation between two CS-RBDs.DISCUSSIONWe have analyzed the interaction between mouse nucleolin and an RNA target. We previously identified an RNA (NRE), which binds with high affinity to nucleolin (21Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 54Serin G. Joseph G. Faucher C. Ghisolfi L. Bouche G. Amalric F. Bouvet P. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and our present purpose is to determine the origin of the RNA-binding specificity of nucleolin. Binding studies with the four isolated nucleolin CS-RBDs (each individual domain is defined here from the beginning of the β1 strand to the C terminus of the β4 strand) indicate that none of them was able to interact significantly with the nucleolin RNA target (K d > 10 μm; Fig. 2). The low binding affinity of these isolated CS-RBDs seems to be common to most CS-RBDs (63Abdul-Manan N. O'Malley S.M. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3545-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 64Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To identify the minimal region of nucleolin involved in specific RNA recognition, we performed N- and C-terminal deletions on the R1234G protein (Fig. 2), which retains the RNA-binding specificity of full-length protein. A region of the protein containing two CS-RBDs (RBDs 1 and 2) is required for the specific interaction with the NRE RNA sequence (Fig. 2). A recombinant protein, which contains these two CS-RBDs separated by a 12-amino acid linker, interacts with the same affinity and specificity as full-length protein. Deletions at either end of this bi-RBD peptide completely abolish the high affinity interaction (Fig. 3). Our results strongly suggest that these two domains cooperate in the recognition of the RNA sequence. A cooperation between two CS-RBDs has also been suggested for other multiple RBD-containing proteins, like hnRNPA1 (11Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 57Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pelligrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), ASF/SF2 (14Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 42Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4715-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), Sxl (16Kanaar R. Lee A. Rudner D.Z. Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and PABP (43Kühn U. Pieler T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 64Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Comparison of the poly(A)-binding protein with nucleolin is interesting since both proteins have four CS-RBDs. As in the case of nucleolin, it has been proposed that the RNA-binding specificity of PABP arises from the first two RBDs (43Kühn U. Pieler T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 64Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). RBD 1 of PABP has no RNA binding activity by itself, but improves the discriminatory ability in combination with the other domains (44Nietfeld W. Mentzel H. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it should be pointed out that the RNA-binding specificity of PABP seems to be less restricted to these two RBDs than in nucleolin since RBDs 3 and 4 of PABP interact also with the specific RNA target (poly(A) sequence) with only a 10-fold decreased binding affinity compared with RBDs 1 and 2 (44Nietfeld W. Mentzel H. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, nucleolin RBDs 3 and 4 (R34, Fig. 2 A) do not interact significantly with the NRE sequence at the protein concentration used in this study. Compared with RBDs 1 and 2, the binding affinity of RBDs 3 and 4 for the NRE sequence is decreased at least 1000-fold.Effect of Mutations within the RNP-1 Motifs on RNA BindingThe three-dimensional structures of the hnRNP C, Sxl, and of the U1-SnRNP A N-terminal CS-RBDs suggest that solvent-exposed aromatic residues in RNP-1 and RNP-2 sequences contribute to RNA binding through ring-stacking interactions with the bases (16Kanaar R. Lee A. Rudner D.Z. Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues at positions 3 and 5 of the RNP-1 motif has been shown to drastically reduce the binding affinity of the corresponding CS-RBD (32Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 33Brennan C.A. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17296-17305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Merrill B.M.

To determine which nucleolin CS-RBD was involved in the specific recognition of NRE RNA, we introduced several mutations at these positions within each of the four CS-RBDs (Fig. 5). Binding studies with these chimeric proteins show that mutation of the RNP-1 motif within the CS-RBDs 3 and 4 does not affect the binding affinity and specificity, which demonstrates that these domains are not involved in recognition of this specific RNA. It is not clear now if these two domains are involved in other RNA-specific interactions, since a SELEX experiment with the full-length nucleolin identified only the consensus sequence (NRE) (21Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) used in this study. In contrast, substitution of the analogous residues within CS-RBDs 1 and 2 drastically reduced the binding affinity of the mutated protein. When the same substitutions were introduced within the R12 peptide (Fig. 4), we also observed that mutation of the RNP-1 sequences of RBD 1 or RBD 2 abolished the specific high affinity interaction with the NRE RNA sequence. This result clearly demonstrates the involvement of both CS-RBDs in the specific recognition of NRE RNA.We also observed that mutations in CS-RBD 1 (Figs. 4 and 5) had a more drastic effect than the analogous mutations in CS-RBD 2, suggesting a preponderant role for RBD 1 in RNA recognition. Binding studies with N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of the R12 protein (Fig. 3) indicate that RBD 1 displays a higher basal binding affinity (K d of 1 μm) than RBD 2 (K d > 10 μm). These isolated RBDs are not able to discriminate specific versus nonspecific RNA sequences. We therefore suggest that RBD 1 binds first to the RNA, then this interaction is stabilized further by the second RBD. This stabilization most likely involves specific contacts between both RBDs and the RNA sequence. This mechanism of interaction of a bi-RBDs peptide with a single RNA target could also explain how the hnRNPA1 and Sxl proteins interact with their targets. We also tested whether the binding specificity and affinity of the R12 peptide for the NRE sequence could be obtained when both individual RBDs are mixed together (data not shown). Under these conditions, no interaction could be detected even at high peptide concentration (>5 μm), showing that these two domains must be present on the same peptide to interact with the RNA target. The requirement for a cisarrangement of the 2 CS-RBDs of Sxl has also been suggested for their site-specific interaction (16Kanaar R. Lee A. Rudner D.Z. Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The affinity of the individual RBDs for the RNA target is significantly lower, and they lose the ability to discriminate between the specific and nonspecific RNA sequence. However, the nonspecific binding activity of the first RBD is about 100-fold higher than for RBD 2, suggesting also that RBD 1 will be the first one to interact with the RNA target. An analogous situation is found in hnRNP A1 where two CS-RBDs are required for a strong specific interaction (11Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 32Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies (34Merrill B.M. Stone K.L. Cobianchi F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3307-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mutational analysis of the RNP-1 motif of each domain (32Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) also suggested a preponderant role for the first RBD. An interesting characteristic of the binding properties of a 2-RBD peptideversus the corresponding isolated domains is that the binding affinity of the bi-RBD protein is significantly less than the product of the binding affinity of the two isolated domains (32, 57, this study). For hnRNPA1, this difference could be explained by theoretical models in which the two independent binding domains are connected by a flexible linker (57Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pelligrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 65Crothers D.M. Metzger H. Immunochemistry. 1972; 9: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this model, when the RBD with the highest binding affinity is bound to the RNA target, the local concentration of the second domain is lower than that required for its efficient interaction with the RNA sequence. These theoretical considerations (57Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pelligrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 62Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Williams K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) could also explain why the binding affinity of the R12 peptide for the NRE sequence (K d of 20–50 nm) is significantly less than the product of the affinities of RBD 1 and RBD 2 (K d > 10 μm for each domain). Our observation that the RNP-1 motif of each RBD is involved in RNA interaction, together with the fact that binding of RBDs 1 and 2 is nonadditive, suggests that the simultaneous binding of both RBDs to the RNA target is required for a high affinity and specific interaction.CD analysis has allowed us to address two main concerns: the independent folding of the two RBDs (Fig. 7) and the lack of major restructuration after mutation in their respective RNP-1 sequences. The fact that the overall structure of the R12 peptide was maintained permits an unbiased diagnosis of the role of the mutated aromatic residues in RNA binding. That both sets of aromatic residues appear essential to RNA binding should be more fully investigated. As mentioned above, it is likely that the RNP-1 aromatic residues from RBD 1 play a preponderant role in the first step of RNA binding. What would then be the role of the RNP-1 aromatic residues from the second RBD? Preliminary modeling studies of the R12 peptide indicate a spatial proximity of both sets of aromatic residues. Although undetected in our conditions of CD experiments, which are mostly sensitive to the secondary structure of the polypeptide, the hydrophobic core formed by these aromatic residues, could play a major role in holding in close vicinity determinants of specificity coming from both RBDs. Many aspects of the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression involve specific RNA-protein interactions (1McCarthy J. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Selective RNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins is achieved through a variety of conserved protein motifs (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). One of the most common RNA binding motifs is the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence, also called RNA recognition motif or consensus RNA-binding domain (CS-RBD). 1The abbreviations used are: CS-RBD, consensus RNA-binding domain; NRE, nucleolin recognition element; CD, circular dichroism; hnRNP, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NS, nonspecific; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. 1The abbreviations used are: CS-RBD, consensus RNA-binding domain; NRE, nucleolin recognition element; CD, circular dichroism; hnRNP, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NS, nonspecific; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment.

A. (1995) Cell Growth Differ. 6, 1367–1373). We report here that in v-Src-transformed cells PKC δ co-immunoprecipitates with v-Src and is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ had reduced enzymatic activity relative to the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ from v-Src-transformed cells. The association between Src and PKC δ was dependent upon both an active Src kinase and membrane association. The association between c-Src Y527F and PKC δ was substantially enhanced by mutating a PKC phosphorylation site at Ser-12 in Src to Ala indicating that PKC δ phosphorylation of Src at Ser-12 destabilizes the interaction, possibly in a negative feedback loop. These data demonstrate that upon recruitment of PKC δ to the membrane in v-Src-transformed cells there is the formation of a Src·PKC δ complex in which PKC δ becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine and down-regulated. In response to the kinase activity of v-Src there is an increase in the membrane association of the novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoform PKC δ (Zang, Q., Frankel, P., and Foster, D. A.

Protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; DG, diacylglycerol; Tyr(P), phosphotyrosine; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; SH2, Src homology 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. has been implicated in a wide variety of signaling mechanisms (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). There are several isoforms of PKC that fall into three major categories based on differential Ca2+ and lipid requirements. The α, δ, ε, and ζ PKC isoforms are predominant in fibroblasts (3Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). The conventional α PKC isoform requires both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DG). The novel δ and ε isoforms require DG but not Ca2+, and the atypical ζ isoform is insensitive to both DG and Ca2+. The activation of several transcriptional promoters by the oncogenic tyrosine kinase v-Src is dependent upon PKC (5Alexandropoulos K. Qureshi S.A. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 803-807PubMed Google Scholar, 6Qureshi S.A. Joseph C.K. Rim M.-H. Maroney A. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 995-999PubMed Google Scholar, 7Qureshi S.A. Alexandropoulos K. Rim M. Joseph C.K. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17635-17639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that in both murine and rat fibroblasts transformed by the oncogenic tyrosine kinase v-Src there is an increased membrane association of the α and δ but not the ε or ζ PKC isoforms (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). Since the δ and ε PKC isoforms both belong to the Ca2+-independent class of PKC, the preferential increase in membrane association of the δ over the ε isoform could not be explained by Ca2+ and suggested that regulation of this class of PKC isoform involved more than simply elevating DG levels. The selective increase in membrane association of the δ over the ε isoform of PKC in v-Src-transformed cells was also surprising because of previous reports that overexpression of PKC δ inhibits cell proliferation and that overexpression of PKC ε enhances cell growth (8Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol.

These observations suggested the possibility that PKC δ might have a different effect in v-Src-transformed cells than in the non-transformed parental cells. Alternatively, membrane association of PKC δ in v-Src-transformed cells may not correlate with an activation of its kinase activity since it has been demonstrated that PKC isoforms α and ε can affect phospholipase D (10Conricode K.M.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ in response to several different stimuli has recently been reported (13Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ is unclear. It has been reported that tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ has a reduced kinase activity in Ras-transformed cells (13Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, epidermal growth factor receptor activation also resulted in a decrease in the kinase activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ (16Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKC δ that was phosphorylated on tyrosine by either Fyn or the insulin receptor in vitro had elevated kinase activity (14Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to antigen activation of the IgE receptor, PKC δ becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, and phosphorylation apparently alters its substrate specificity (15Haleem-Smith H. Chang E.-Y. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9112-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on PKC δ activity is apparently complex and may involve other cellular factors. The tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for PKC δ phosphorylation are not known. In vitro studies have shown that PKC δ can be phosphorylated by Src family and receptor tyrosine kinases (14Li W.

In this report, we describe a functional interaction between Src and PKC δ in cells transformed by v-Src. 3Y1 and v-Src-transformed 3Y1 rat fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was added at 200 nm for 30 min to activate PKC or 800 nm for 24 h to deplete cells of PKC. 3Y1 cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/100-mm dish 18 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the vendor's instructions. The plasmid expression vectors contained the G418 resistance marker, and transfected cultures were selected in 400 ng/ml G418 for 8–10 days at 37 °C. At that time colonies were examined for morphology, picked, and expanded for additional analysis. The c-Src mutants transfected into 3Y1 cells are as follows: c-Src Y527F has a mutation of Tyr to Phe at position 527 (18Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar); c-Src Y527F/S12A has an additional change at Ser-12 to Ala (19Yaciuk P. Choi J.K. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the LN mutation has 4 additional amino acids at the amino terminus (MAAA) (20Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1464-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and was placed in the c-Src Y527F context as described for the S12A mutation (19Yaciuk P. Choi J.K. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the SH2 deletion of c-Src Y527F-ΔSH2 has a disruption of the SH2 domain in which amino acids 148–187 have been deleted (21Seidel-Dugan C. Meyer B.E. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and this mutation was placed in the c-Src 527 context as with the LN and S12A mutations (19Yaciuk P. Choi J.K. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All Src constructs were in the pEVX expression vector (22Johnson P.L. Coussens P.M. Danko A.V. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 1073-1083Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Kriegler M. Perez C.F. Hardy C. Botchan M. Cell. 1984; 38: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology) was used for Western blots, and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) (Transduction Laboratories) was used for immunoprecipitations. For Src, a monoclonal antibody from Oncogene Sciences was used for Western blots, and a monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology was used for immunoprecipitations. For PKC δ, a polyclonal antibody obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. was used for Western blots and a polyclonal antibody obtained from Calbiochem was used for immunoprecipitations. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Cells grew to approximately 85% confluence in 150-mm culture dishes and then were shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% serum for 24 h. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold isotonic buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 136 mmNaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 4.2 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2). For subcellular fractionation, cells from 150-mm dishes were washed and then scraped into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were then disrupted with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle), and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The membrane pellet was suspended in the same volume of homogenization buffer with 1% Triton X-100. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as the membrane fraction. For whole cell lysates, cells were treated with 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and used as the whole cell lysate. Cell lysates or cell fractions prepared as described above were incubated with appropriate antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered using protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitations with mouse monoclonal antibodies, rabbit anti-mouse IgG was added to the lysates for an additional hour of incubation prior to recovery with protein A. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100). Samples were normalized to contain equal amounts of protein in the total cell lysates or from cytosolic and membrane fractions prior to immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an 8% acrylamide separating gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose as described previously (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar, 24Joseph C.K. Qureshi S.A. Wallace D.W. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1327-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking at 4 °C overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS buffer, nitrocellulose filters were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies. Depending on the origin of the primary antibodies, either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG was used for detection using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) or the super signal system (Pierce). PKC activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ was determined according to protocols described by Denning et al. (13Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates from v-Src-transformed cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were recovered with protein A-agarose beads. The supernatant was used as the source of non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ. The anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitate pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 30 mm phenylphosphate to release the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The antibodies were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as the source of tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ. Both the tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated preparations were then immunoprecipitated with anti-PKC δ antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mmMgCl2 followed by resuspension in 100 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml histone type IIIS, 60 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and TPA at 1 μm if included). [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol) was present at 100 μm. PKC activity was then determined as described previously (24Joseph C.K. Qureshi S.A. Wallace D.W. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1327-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKC δ levels in the assays was determined by Western blot analysis, and activity was normalized to these levels. In v-Src-transformed 3Y1 cells, the δ isoform of PKC is preferentially associated with the membrane relative to the parental 3Y1 cells (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that PKC δ can be phosphorylated on tyrosine (13Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ in v-Src-transformed 3Y1 rat fibroblasts, where the expression of v-Src results in increased membrane association of PKC δ. 3Y1 cells and v-Src-transformed 3Y1 cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against either phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) or PKC δ. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blot analysis using either anti-Tyr(P) or anti-PKC δ antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, anti-Tyr(P) antibody precipitated a protein from v-Src-transformed 3Y1 cells that could be recognized by the anti-PKC δ antibody, and reciprocally, the 80-kDa protein precipitated by the anti-PKC δ antibody from the v-Src-transformed cells was recognized by the anti-Tyr(P) antibody. These results were observed only in the v-Src-transformed cells. As expected, PKC depletion by prolonged treatment with phorbol ester abolished precipitation of PKC δ by the anti-Tyr(P) antibody, and treatment with phenyl phosphate (a phosphotyrosine analog) abolished precipitation of PKC δ by anti-Tyr(P) antibody. As expected, the peptide used to generate the PKC δ antibody abolished the ability of the anti-PKC δ antibody to precipitate PKC δ. To establish that the data shown in Fig. 1 A was not due to contamination with a co-precipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kDa protein, we repeated the experiments using denatured cell lysates in which protein-protein interactions were disrupted. As shown in Fig.1 B, the same results as observed in Fig. 1 A were obtained using lysates that were treated with 1% SDS and heated at 100 °C for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation. We concluded that PKC δ is tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed 3Y1 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC isoforms α and ε was not detected in similar experiments (data not shown), suggesting that the v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is specific for the δ isoform of PKC. We demonstrated previously that there is an increased membrane association of PKC δ in v-Src-transformed cells (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we wished to determine whether the tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ is preferentially membrane-bound. v-Src-transformed cells were fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions, and lysates from each fraction were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKC δ antibody and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Tyr(P) or anti-PKC δ antibody. As shown in Fig.2, when the anti Tyr(P) antibody was used to identify the PKC δ, the majority of PKC δ (∼70%) was associated with the membrane fraction. In contrast, when the PKC δ antibody was used there was an excess of PKC δ (∼60%) in the cytosolic fraction. As a control, cells were stimulated with TPA for 30 min to shift all of the PKC δ to the membrane fraction. These data indicate that the tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ is preferentially associated with the membrane. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ has been reported to both enhance (14Li W. Mischak H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) the kinase activity of PKC δ. We therefore compared the kinase activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ. Sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-PKC δ antibodies was used to separate tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ isolated from v-Src-transformed cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We then examined the in vitro kinase activity as described previously (24Joseph C.K. Qureshi S.A. Wallace D.W. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1327-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the kinase activity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ was reduced to about 33% of the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ for both basal and TPA-induced enzymatic activity. Consistent with tyrosine phosphorylation having an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of PKC δ, treatment of the tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B restored the kinase activity to about 70% of that observed in the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ (Fig. 3). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ reduces the enzymatic activity of PKC δ in v-Src-transformed cells. Since v-Src was shown previously to be able to phosphorylate PKC δ directly in vitro (17Gschwendt M. Kielsbassa K. Kittstein F. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we further explored the possibility that PKC δ may be a substrate of v-Src in vivo by examining it for an association between PKC δ and v-Src. The results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments are shown in Fig. 4. When cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with v-Src antibody and then Western-blotted with anti-PKC δ antibody, PKC δ was detected in v-Src immunoprecipitates from v-Src-transformed 3Y1 cells, but not the parental 3Y1 cells. In the reciprocal experiment, where anti-PKC δ immunoprecipitates were Western-blotted with anti-v-Src antibody, the PKC δ antibody co-precipitated v-Src protein. v-Src was not detected in anti-PKC ε immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). The amount of v-Src in the anti-PKC δ immunoprecipitates is estimated to be about 1–2% of the total v-Src, and the amount of PKC δ in the anti-v-Src precipitates is also estimated to be about 1–2% of the total PKC δ. To further investigate the interaction between Src and PKC δ, we characterized the interaction between PKC δ and Src in cells overexpressing c-Src and several c-Src mutants (Fig. 5 A). Cell lines that overexpress the c-Src genes were established and expression levels of the c-Src proteins were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 B). We first examined the interaction between PKC δ and c-Src and an activated mutant of c-Src that has the Tyr at 527 converted to Phe (c-Src Y527F) (18Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 20Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1464-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 C, very little Src protein was present in anti-PKC δ immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing c-Src. Consistent with this observation, little or no tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ was detected in the c-Src-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, activated c-Src Y527F was associated with PKC δ, and PKC δ was tyrosine-phosphorylated, although not quite to the level observed in cells expressing v-Src. However, c-Src Y527F was as active as v-Src in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ if TPA was added to stimulate membrane association of PKC δ. We also investigated the effect of a mutation at Ser-12, a phosphorylation site for PKC (25Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Cooper J.A. Buss J.E. Shalloway D. Hunter T. Cell. 1985; 42: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown, changing Ser-12 of c-Src 527 to Ala (c-Src 527-S12A) substantially enhanced the association between PKC δ and Src and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ. A mutation to the SH2 domain of c-Src 527 had little or no effect upon either tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ or the association between Src and PKC δ (Fig. 5 C). Lastly we examined the effect of an amino-terminal modification of c-Src 527 that prevents membrane association but not kinase activity. This mutant protein (c-Src 527-LN) failed to associate with PKC δ and did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ. These data indicate that the interaction between Src and PKC δ requires both Src tyrosine kinase activity and membrane localization. Phosphorylation of Src at Ser-12 may lead to the dissociation of a Src·PKC δ complex, since a mutation at this site increased the Src-PKC δ interaction. We have demonstrated that in cells transformed by v-Src, PKC δ is phosphorylated on tyrosine and is associated with v-Src. This interaction requires active, membrane-localized Src kinase. The association between Src and PKCδ was not significantly affected by SH2 deletion but was greatly enhanced by a mutation to the PKC phosphorylation site on Src at Ser-12. The tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ had reduced kinase activity relative to the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ. We previously reported that PKC δ becomes preferentially associated with the membrane in response to the kinase activity of v-Src (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in membrane association of PKC isoforms has been widely used to demonstrate PKC isoform activation. The finding here that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ inhibits its kinase activity suggests that regulation of novel PKC isoforms involves more than DG-mediated recruitment to the membrane. It was previously reported that PKC δ could be phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to phorbol esters that activate PKC (14Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in 3Y1 cells and in 3Y1 cells overexpressing wild type c-Src or activated c-Src that was not membrane-localized (c-Src Y527F-LN), we did not see an increase in PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TPA. On the other hand, in cells expressing activated membrane-bound c-Src Y527F, we did detect a TPA-induced increase in PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ in response to TPA is dependent upon an active membrane-bound tyrosine kinase and is consistent with the hypothesis that TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ is a secondary effect of TPA-induced membrane localization. Overexpression of PKC δ has previously been reported to inhibit cell growth (8Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous observation that PKC δ became membrane-associated in response to the mitogenic stimuli of v-Src (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar) was surprising since membrane association of PKC isoforms has been widely used to imply activation. The finding here that PKC δ becomes phosphorylated and has a reduced kinase activity in v-Src-transformed cells is perhaps consistent with the previous reports that PKC δ is an inhibitor of cell growth. The increased DG levels observed in response to v-Src (26Song J. Pfeffer L.M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4903-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) may reflect a requirement for activation of the α PKC isoform, which also becomes membrane-bound in response to v-Src (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). PKC α has been reported to phosphorylate Raf, which contributes to the activation of Raf (27Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Since Raf is required for transformation by v-Src (28Qureshi S.A. Joseph C.K. Gupta R. Hendrickson M. Song J. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it is possible that activation of PKC α and phosphorylation of Raf is required for the mitogenic signals activated by the tyrosine kinase activity of v-Src. The increased DG needed for PKC α activation may be causing the PKC δ recruitment to the membrane. However, since PKC δ is inhibitory for mitogenic signals, there may be a mechanism whereby tyrosine phosphorylation, which correlates well with mitogenic signals, results in down-regulation of the enzymatic activity of PKC δ. Although PKC δ becomes membrane-associated in v-Src-transformed cells, there is no change in the subcellular distribution of the ε PKC isoform, which is also a DG-dependent Ca2+-independent PKC isoform (4Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential increase in membrane association of PKC δ over PKC ε observed in v-Src-transformed cells suggests that there may be some functional significance for the observed membrane association of PKC δ in response to v-Src. Several recent reports have suggested kinase-independent roles for PKC isoforms (10Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Jiang Y. Lu Z. Zang Q. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29529-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible that increased membrane association of PKC δ and down-regulation of its enzymatic activity indicate a kinase-independent function for PKC δ. Alternatively, Src could be a critical substrate for PKC δ and that upon phosphorylation of Ser-12 there is a reciprocal tyrosine phosphorylation that serves as a negative feedback control mechanism for PKC δ. A mutation to c-Src at Ser-12 was previously shown to be required for the enhanced responsiveness to β-adrenergic agonists in cells overexpressing c-Src (29Moyers J.S. Bouton A.H. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between Src and PKC δ may also be important for regulating other indirect effects of Src. The effect of the Ser-12 mutant on both association and tyrosine phosphorylation further supports the hypothesis that PKC δ is a direct substrate of Src. The dependence of the association on an active kinase suggests that interaction occurs only when Src has been activated. It is still not clear as to what role(s) c-Src plays in cell physiology, and while the data presented here with cells overexpressing activated forms of Src do not prove that PKC δ is a normal cellular target of c-Src, the data do show that PKC δ could be regulated by Src or perhaps a related Src family kinase. Perhaps more importantly, the data presented here in cells transformed by v-Src demonstrate that v-Src can associate with and down-regulate a protein kinase that has been strongly associated with inhibiting cell growth. The ability to down-regulate this inhibitory PKC isoform may be important for the transforming ability of v-Src."

In an attempt to determine specific interactions between ATPases of the human RC, we have employed a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. In this report, we show that S4, S6, S10b, and S6′ bind specific subunits within the regulatory complex. The specific interactions observed on filters were confirmed by the co-sedimentation of in vitro-translated ATPases on sucrose gradients. Truncation experiments demonstrate that the NH2terminus of S4 is responsible for its interaction with S7. Based on the presence of putative coiled-coils in the amino termini of the ATPases, we propose that coiled-coil interactions are involved in assembly of the regulatory complex. Human 26 S protease was partially purified from 20 units of outdated blood as described by Dubiel et al. (25Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, packed and washed human erythrocytes were lysed with 4 volumes of 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) in water. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 1 h at 10,000 rpm. Glycerol was added to the supernatant fraction to a final concentration of 20%, and the lysate was then mixed overnight with 1.7 liters of Fractogel TSK DEAE 650 m equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 20% glycerol. The DEAE/lysate mixture was poured into a 2-liter column and washed with 2 column volumes of 75 mm KCl in TSDG (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 75–400 mmKCl in TSDG and assayed for ATP-dependent peptidase activity using succinyl-LLVY-aminomethylcoumarin (Sigma) as substrate (41Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the regulatory complex is eluted last from the column (above 240 mm KCl) relative to MCP and the 26 S protease (20Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active fractions containing 26 S protease or regulatory complexes were pooled and concentrated to 70 ml using an XM300 membrane in a large AmiconTM cell. The concentrates were clarified by centrifugation and applied to a Fractogel TSK HW55 gel filtration column equilibrated in TSDG. Fractions (20 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min, assayed for ATP-dependent peptidase activity (26 S protease) as described above, or analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (regulatory complex) as described by Hoffman et al. (20Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using 10% separating and 4.5% stacking gels as described by Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of O'Farrell (43O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, purified 26 S protease was separated in 12.5-cm isoelectric focusing tube gels consisting of 9.2 murea, 4% acrylamide, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 2% ampholines, pH 3–10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Bottom buffer (anode) consisted of 20 mm phosphoric acid and top buffer (cathode) consisted of 40 mm sodium hydroxide. Proteins were focused for 10,000 V-h after which the gels were layered perpendicularly over an SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel consisting of 4.5% stacking and 10% separating gel. Alternatively, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of purified 26 S protease was performed in a Bio-Rad mini-Protean®II 2-D cell using 3% ampholines pH 2–11 (Serva) and a mini-Protean®II slab gel system as recommended by the manufacturer. After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose (see below). Plasmids pBS-S4 (pBS, pBluescript SK+; Stratagene) and pBS-S8 were used for transcription of S4 and S8, respectively. Plasmids pB1-TBP1 and pB1-TBP7 (gifts from Craig Rosen, Roche Research Center) were used for transcription of S6′ and S6, respectively. A plasmid encoding the sequence of mouse MSS1 (pBS-MSS1) was a gift from Colin Gordon (Medical Research Council, Edinburgh, UK) and was used to transcribe S7. A plasmid, pBS-S10b, encoding the sequence of S10b was a gift from Robert Benezra (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). S4 and S7 transcripts were initiated from the T7 promoter of pBS, whereas transcripts for S6, S8, S10b, and S6′ were initiated from the T3 promoter of pB1 or pBS. Transcription of the NH2-terminal deletion product S4-(85–440) was performed using the plasmid pBS-S4RI generated by subcloning the EcoRI fragment (bp 290–1599) from pBS-S4 into pBS. Nested COOH-terminal deletions of S4 were generated with appropriate restriction endonucleases that cut at unique sites within the S4 sequence as follows: BstXI (base pair 1010) for S4-(1–315),SspI (base pair 689) for S4-(1–208), and BamHI (base pair 562) for S4-(1–167). Linearized plasmid DNA (3 μg) was precipitated with ethanol and used directly for transcription reactions utilizing the Stratagene mRNA Capping Kit® according to the manufacturer's directions. Capped RNA transcripts were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and used directly for in vitro translation reactions. Translation reactions (50 μl) containing 3 μg ofin vitro transcribed RNA were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) for 2 h at 30 °C. Alternatively, transcription and translation of RC ATPase subunits were performed in a single reaction using the TNT T7/T3 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems® according to the directions of the manufacturer (Promega). After incubation, the translation reactions were passed over 0.7–0.9-ml Sephadex-G25 (Sigma) columns equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to remove unincorporated methionine. Fractions (2 drops each) were collected manually and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing full-length proteins were pooled and used directly without further purification in binding or sucrose gradient sedimentation assays. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose overnight at 100 mA according to the procedure of Towbin et al. (44Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). After transfer, membranes were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein subunits, cut into strips, and washed with TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 15 min at 4 °C. The membrane strips were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 10% nonfat dried milk in TBST and stored in this buffer at 4 °C until used. To incubate 26 S subunits with in vitro translated [35S]ATPases, strips were removed from blocking buffer and washed 2 × 10 min with TBST at 4 °C. The membrane strips were then sealed in plastic bags and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1–2 × 106 cpm of radiolabeled protein in 5% blocking buffer. Following incubation, the strips were washed five times for 5 min in TBST, air-dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager® screen (Molecular Dynamics) or x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.) for autoradiography. Polyclonal antiserum against recombinant S4 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe was prepared in a New Zealand White rabbit injected intramuscularly with 63 μg of protein emulsified in TiterMax® adjuvant (Vaxcel). Immune serum was obtained from blood collected 31 days after injection and used for immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated S4 proteins as described by Harlow and Lane (45Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 464-466Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots (3 μl) of35S-labeled translation products were diluted to 500 μl with radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). S4-specific antiserum (1 μl) was then added to each sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubating the samples with 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. The sedimented beads were washed 5 times with radioimmune precipitation buffer at 4 °C and applied to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized on a PhosphorImager screen or x-ray film. Following transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose and staining with Ponceau S, membranes were blocked for 6 h at 4 °C in TBS containing 10% nonfat dried milk. The blocked filters were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of anti-S10b (a gift from R. Benezra), anti-centractin (a gift from Sean Clark), or anti-p50 (a gift from Bryce Paschal) antibodies in TBS containing 5% nonfat milk. Antibody binding was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham or NEN DuPont) using secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Cappel). 35S-Labeled ATPases prepared in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were sedimented through sucrose gradients as described (46Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (1–2 × 106 cpm in a volume of 100 μl) were layered atop 4.9-ml 5–20% sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected from the bottom using a peristaltic pump, and 30-μl aliquots were applied to SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid in water, dried under vacuum, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The distribution of 35S-labeled ATPases in the gradients was compared with protein standards (catalase, aldolase, and bovine serum albumin (BSA); Pharmacia) to estimate their size. Prediction of coiled-coil regions in S4-like ATPases was carried out as described by Carr and Kim (47Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) using the computer program described by Lupas et al. (48Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar) (version 2.1) using a window size of 28 residues. The human red blood cell RC is composed of at least 15 distinct subunits with molecular masses between 25 and 110 kDa. A typical two-dimensional map of purified RCs is shown in Fig.1. Using the simple nomenclature introduced by Dubielet al. (49Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the regulatory complex subunits are designated S1–S13. The subunits can be classified into ATPases and non-ATPases. Five ATPases are clearly present in our preparations: S4, S6, S7, S8, and S10b (Table I). A sixth nucleotidase, TBP-1, has been indirectly identified in the course of these studies (see below). Since the migration of TBP-1 and S6 is identical on two-dimensional gels, we have designated TBP-1 as S6′. The non-ATPases include S1–S3, S5a, S5b, S9, S10a, and S11-S13 (Table I). One of these proteins, S5a, binds Ub-lysozyme conjugates (50Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits Ub-mediated proteolysis by the 26 S protease (51Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The remaining non-ATPase subunits have unique sequences with limited homology to each other or other classes of proteins (49Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol.

To examine protein-protein interactions between ATPases and other components in the regulatory complex, we translated S4, S6, S6′, S7, S8, and S10b in the presence of [35S]methionine and used the resulting radiolabeled proteins in solid phase binding assays. Fig.2 A shows a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the translation products used in this study. Each full-length radiolabeled protein migrated on SDS-PAGE with a mobility expected for its molecular mass. The smaller radioactive products are presumably generated by initiation from internal methionines or by proteolysis. Translation of the S6′ sequence consistently produced two bands of approximately 48 and 46 kDa; both products were found to be active in the binding assays (see below). The radiolabeled translation products were also characterized by centrifugation on 5–20% sucrose gradients (Fig. 2 B). About 90% of full-length S6′ and S6, and about 70% of S4 and S10b sedimented slower than BSA, consistent with their being monomers (TableII). By contrast, S7 and S8 sedimented as larger species (Fig. 2 B). S7 partitioned between a f"

A majority of the mutant enzymes were either completely or severely deficient in RNA priming activity, but, with only one exception, were able to efficiently extend DNA versions of the same primers. The mutant enzymes were able to bind to RNA primers, indicating that the defect in RNA priming was not simply a loss of binding activity. Mutations at positions 229, 233, and 235 dramatically reduced the amount of specific RNase H cleavage at the 3′ terminus of the polypurine tract, which is required for primer removal. An alanine substitution at position 232 led to loss of cleavage specificity, although total activity was close to the wild-type level. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that there are residues in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase which are specifically involved in protein-nucleic acid interactions with RNA primers.

During the replicative cycle of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, primer binding site; PPT, polypurine tract; WT, wild-type; nt, nucleotide(s). and other retroviruses, reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzes the conversion of single-stranded genomic RNA into linear double-stranded DNA, which is ultimately integrated into the host chromosome (Ref. 1Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs. 2Varmus H. Swanstrom R. Weiss R. Teich N. Varmus H. Coffin J.

Reverse transcription begins with initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis from a cellular tRNA primer (reviewed in Refs. 5Wilson S.H. Abbotts J. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. Pirtle R.M. Transfer RNA In Protein Synthesis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-21Google Scholar and 6Marquet R. Isel C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B.

Coffin J. Molecular Biology of Tumor Viruses, RNA Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 369-512Google Scholar). In this step, RT must recognize and extend an RNA primer annealed to an RNA template (7Leis J. Aiyar A. Cobrinik D. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 33-47Google Scholar,8Yusupova G. Lanchy J.-M. Yusupov M. Keith G. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis requires recognition of a purine-rich viral RNA sequence known as the polypurine tract (PPT). After specific RNase H cleavage at its 3′ end, the PPT serves as the primer for extension on a minus-strand DNA template (for review, see Ref. 9Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar). The specificity of this reaction is provided, in part, by the inability of RT to prime plus-strand synthesis with RNA fragments lacking the PPT sequence (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Randolph C.A. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

Thus, to initiate synthesis of each DNA strand, RT specifically recognizes RNA primers, which have exacting sequence requirements and are extended on defined templates. In the case of HIV, formation of a specific (minus-strand) initiation complex between tRNALys3, genomic RNA, and RT is followed by transition to an elongation mode of synthesis (14Arts E.J. Li Z. Wainberg M.A. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Isel C. Lanchy J.-M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Elongation of minus-strand DNA involves extended interactions between the RNA template and tRNA primer (15Isel C. Lanchy J.-M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and also requires binding of RT to the 3′-OH of the growing DNA chain. As RT traverses the genomic RNA, it occasionally dissociates from the primer-template. To continue synthesis, it must therefore bind to different DNA primers on what is essentially a continuously-changing RNA template. Similarly, as elongation of plus-strand DNA proceeds, RT interacts with various DNA primers on a continuously changing DNA template. Thus, during elongation reactions, RT must be able to recognize DNA primers without regard to nucleotide sequence or configuration of the template. These considerations make it clear that at different steps in reverse transcription, RT is presented with primer-template combinations having different helical structure, geometry, and nucleic acid composition. In view of these variations, it is conceivable that RT may have evolved different mechanisms or structural features to selectively recognize RNA and DNA primers. Analysis of the x-ray crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with a short duplex DNA primer-template indicates that the residues which interact with nucleotides at the 3′ end of the primer constitute the β12-β13 hairpin in the p66 palm known as the ;primer grip; (Fig. 1; Refs. 18Jacobo-Molina A.

Interestingly, there are no nevirapine-resistant mutants with changes at residues Phe-227, Trp-229, and Leu-234. This suggests that these residues may be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the primer grip. Additionally, it has been shown that mutation of residues Trp-229, Met-230, Gly-231, and Tyr-232 results in alterations of both polymerase and RNase H activities (22Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D.W. Ottman M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8553-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In earlier work on the determinants of HIV-1 plus-strand priming, we showed that nucleotides at the 3′ end of the HIV-1 PPT primer are critical for initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacing the four G nucleotides at the 3′ end of the PPT with four C nucleotides, rendered the PPT completely inactive as a primer for plus-strand synthesis. In view of the proximity of the primer grip to the 3′ end of the primer (18Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A.

Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), these findings suggested that the primer grip may have a specific role in RT-catalyzed initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis. The present study is focused on identification of residues that might be involved in unique interactions with the PPT primer. Our approach was to test the effect of introducing alanine substitutions within the primer grip on plus-strand priming. Our results show that mutations in this region can profoundly affect the ability of HIV-1 RT to extend an RNA PPT primer, while having little or no effect on priming with a DNA version of the PPT. Interestingly, most of these same mutations dramatically affect the ability of RT to initiate minus-strand DNA synthesis with an RNA oligonucleotide containing the 3′ 18 terminal nucleotides of the tRNALys3 primer (RNA PBS primer). With only one exception, these mutations do not have a significant effect on extension of a DNA PBS primer. Thus, it appears that residues in the primer grip region play a specific role in recognition and extension of RNA primers. RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). Other materials were used as described previously (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D.W. Ottman M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8553-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions in residues Glu-224 to His-235 in HIV-1 RT were constructed using BcgI cassette mutagenesis as described previously (23Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26472-26478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p66 subunits of mutant RTs were expressed separately and reconstituted with wild-type (WT) p51 to form p66/p51 heterodimers; thus, the mutation in each RT was present solely in the p66 subunit (24Le Grice S.F.J. Grüninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25Le Grice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reconstituted heterodimers were purified by metal chelate (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose) chromatography followed by ion exchange over S-Sepharose (26Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The L234A mutant RT failed to reconstitute into a heterodimer (22Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D.W. Ottman M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8553-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and was not studied further. The final RT preparations were stored in a 50; glycerol-containing buffer at −20 °C (26Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ability of each RT to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis was tested in an assay using synthetic RNA and DNA oligonucleotides, as described previously (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four primer-template combinations (Table I) were used (see schematic representation at the bottom of Fig. 2). The templates were all 35-nt DNA oligonucleotides. The primers were as follows. (i) A 15-nt RNA PPT already containing the 3′ end normally generated after specific cleavage by the RNase H activity of WT RT was used to test the ability of RT to extend the PPT without requiring prior cleavage. (ii) A 20-nt RNA PPT containing the PPT sequence and the five bases immediately downstream of the PPT was used to test the ability of RT to specifically cleave the PPT prior to extension. (iii) Downstream RNA, a non-priming sequence was used. This RNA oligonucleotide contains the 15-nt sequence immediately downstream of the PPT. It does not function as a primer with WT HIV-1 RT (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and serves as a negative control. (iv) A 15-nt DNA version of the PPT was used to test for primer extension with a DNA primer. Each reaction contained 1 pmol of primer-template and 10 pmol of WT or mutant HIV-1 RT. The products were internally labeled by addition of [α-32P]dATP during synthesis. The reactions (total volume, 15 μl) were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min and were terminated by addition of formamide STOP solution. Reaction products were then heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading on an 8; sequencing gel and visualization by autoradiography.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyDesignationSequenceType15-nt PPT5′-AAAAGAAAAGGGGGGRNA20-nt PPT5′-AAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACUGGRNADNA PPT5′-AAAAGAAAAGGGGGGDNAPPT template3′-TTTTCTTTTCCCCCCTGACCTTCCCGATTAAGTGADNABand shift template3′-TTTTCTTTTCCCCCCTGADNADownstream RNA5′-ACUGGAAGGGCUAAURNADownstream template3′-TGACCTTCCCGATTAAGTGAGGGTTGCTTCTGTTCDNARNA PBS primer5′-GUCCCUGUUCGGGCGCCARNADNA PBS primer5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCADNA Open table in a new tab Catalytic rate constants for primer extension with a 15-nt RNA or DNA PPT primer were determined for WT RT and mutants E224A, P225A, and L228A. The time course for RNA PPT primer extension was performed essentially as described under ;Oligonucleotide Assays for Initiation of Plus-strand DNA Synthesis,; except that the reaction volume was increased 3-fold to 45 μl and 5-μl aliquots were removed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 15 min. Each 5-μl aliquot was added to 2 μl of formamide STOP solution. Since primer extension with a DNA PPT was very rapid (<1 min to reach completion) under the conditions of enzyme excess used in our standard assay, it was necessary to dilute each enzyme by 1:50 (0.2 pmol); this results in a molar ratio of enzyme to primer-template of 1:5. Dilutions of RT greater than 1:50 were not used since low enzyme concentrations are associated with an increase in pausing (data not shown). Reactions were carried out as described above with the RNA PPT primer. However, in reactions with WT RT and the DNA PPT primer, time points were also taken at 15, 30, and 45 s to provide a more accurate curve-fit. Samples were analyzed on an 8; sequencing gel, as described under ;Oligonucleotide Assays for Initiation of Plus-strand DNA Synthesis.; The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the 20-nt DNA product for the RNA PPT or the 35-nt product for the DNA PPT was determined by phosphorimaging, using the Molecular Dynamics STORM system. Values were converted to picomoles incorporated by comparison of the counts at each time point to counts from a control reaction containing WT RT incubated with the DNA PPT primer for 15 min (under standard assay conditions). Under these conditions, maximal incorporation is achieved in <1 min. Since 1 pmol of template is used in each reaction and each template is extended by 20 nt, the total incorporation is 20 pmol of nucleotides. The values from three independent experiments were averaged and then plotted as picomoles of nucleotides incorporated versus time in min. The resulting data were then fit to a single exponential equation, using the general curve-fitting routines found in the Macintosh program KaleidaGraph. Rate constants were determined as described by Beard and Wilson (27Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), based on a model for DNA polymerase I developed by Bryant et al. (28Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since the rate constants for the RNA PPT primer extension were determined under conditions of 10-fold enzyme excess and represent the relatively slow rate of initiation, the values are independent of enzyme concentration. In this case, the rates are expressed only as the derived rate constants from the exponential fit. However, initiation was not as slow for DNA PPT-primed extension and the reaction conditions had to be altered (see above). In this case, primer-template is in excess and the rate constants represent the apparent turnover rates (k =v i/[RT]), where v i is the initial rate determined from the curve-fit and [RT] is enzyme concentration in picomoles. Binding to primer-template duplexes was investigated with two types of bandshift assays, essentially as described by Guo et al. (29Guo J. Wu W. Yuan Z.Y. Post K. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5018-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (i) The first type was binding only. One pmol (∼2 × 104 total counts per min) of 5′ end labeled ;band-shift DNA template; (Table I) was annealed to 10 pmol of the 15-nt RNA or DNA PPT primers. Binding conditions for the band-shift assay were the same as those used in the oligonucleotide assay, except that dNTPs and [α-32P]dATP were omitted. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20; (v/v) and 10-μl portions of each reaction were loaded onto a 6; native polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature for 60 min at a constant voltage of 200 V in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl and 162 mm glycine, pH 8.0. (ii) The second type was binding plus extension. Binding and extension were tested in the same band-shift assay by incubating an unlabeled DNA PPT primer-template (Table I) under the conditions used in the oligonucleotide assay, except that [α-32P]dATP was the only dNTP added. The first base downstream from the PPT is a thymidine (see Table I). Thus, in this assay only primer-template that has been extended by one base will be labeled (29Guo J. Wu W. Yuan Z.Y. Post K. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5018-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since most of the mutant RTs were unable to extend the RNA PPT primer, an assay was developed to test for the ability to catalyze specific cleavage at the 3′ terminus of the PPT intrans. The 15-nt PPT primer was annealed to the PPT template (Table I) and extended using T4 DNA polymerase and internal labeling with [α-32P]dATP, as described previously (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where specified, 10 pmol of WT or mutant RT was then added intrans and incubated with 1 pmol of substrate in a final volume of 15 μl for 15 min at 37 °C. The products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described above under ;Oligonucleotide Assays for Initiation of Plus-strand DNA Synthesis.; The ability of each mutant to initiate minus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis was tested using a PBS-containing RNA template (30Arts E.J. Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Ehresmann B. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9054-9061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) annealed to either an RNA or DNA primer which is complementary to the PBS. The conditions used were the same as those previously described (22Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D.W. Ottman M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8553-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), except that the enzyme concentration was increased to achieve a 10:1 molar ratio of RT to primer-template. Synthesis was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C. Production of full-length strong-stop DNA on this RNA template results in a 192-nt DNA product (see Fig. 7). In an earlier study, we developed a simple oligonucleotide assay to test for the ability of HIV-1 RT to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis from the 3′ PPT (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this assay to screen alanine-scanning mutants of the primer grip (residues 224–235; Fig. 1; Ref. 18Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) with four different primer-template combinations (see Table I and the bottom of Fig. 2): (i) a 15-nt RNA PPT primer, to measure specific extension; (ii) a 20-nt RNA PPT primer, to measure specific cleavage and subsequent extension; (iii) a non-PPT containing RNA oligonucleotide, which serves as a negative control; and (iv) a 15-nt DNA version of the PPT. The results are shown in Fig. 2 as lanes 1–4, respectively, for each enzyme. WT HIV-1 RT readily extended both the 15- and 20-nt RNA PPT oligonucleotides to produce a specific 20-nt plus-strand DNA product (Fig. 2, WT, lanes 1 and 2 and the schematic shown below). In the case of the 20-nt primer, cleavage of the five additional downstream bases occurs prior to extension (13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously observed (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Randolph C.A. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19207-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fuentes G.M. Rodrı́guez-Rodrı́guez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HIV-1 RT was unable to extend an RNA primer consisting of a non-PPT containing downstream sequence (Fig. 2,WT, lane 3). A DNA version of the PPT was efficiently extended, forming a 35-nt product consisting solely of DNA (Fig. 2, WT,lane 4). When we tested the primer grip mutants using these same assays, we found that 8 of the 11 mutants (i.e. P226A, F227A, W229A, M230A, G231A, Y232A, E233A, and H235A) lost the ability to extend an RNA PPT primer (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2 for each enzyme). In the case of P226A, a very small amount (<5; of WT) of plus-strand DNA product was detectable. All mutants, with the exception of W229A, extended a DNA version of the PPT primer as efficiently as WT under standard assay conditions (Fig. 2, lane 4 for each enzyme). The W229A mutant was previously reported to have defective polymerase activity with a primer-template containing non-viral sequences (23Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26472-26478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that mutations at positions 226, 227, 229, 230–233, and 235 have a specific effect on recognition of the RNA PPT primer. As is the case for the WT enzyme, none of the mutants was able to extend the non-PPT containing RNA oligonucleotide (lane 3 in each set; Ref. 13Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in reaction conditions such as an increase in incubation time (up to 60 min) or concentration of the enzymes (up to a 60:1 ratio of RT to primer-template) had no effect on the amount of plus-strand product made by mutants that were inactive in the standard assay (data not shown). This suggests that the specific defect in ability of these RTs to recognize the RNA PPT is not kinetic in nature, but instead represents a loss in ability to add a base to the primer terminus. Mutants E224A, P225A, and L228A behaved essentially like WT HIV-1 RT in our standard end point assay (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4 ofE224, P225, and L228). However, kinetic analysis of priming activities with the 15-nt RNA PPT primer revealed that the catalytic rate constants determined for mutants P225A and L228A were approximately 4- and 6.5-fold lower, respectively, than the value for WT RT, k = 0.52 min−1; the rate constant for mutant E224A was very similar to that for the WT (Fig. 3 A). Results from this analysis also revealed that, although the overall time for completion of the reaction is relatively long (on the order of min), no intermediate-size products were observed (data not shown). This suggests that once the RNA primer is extended, subsequent elongation and cleavage must occur very rapidly. Similar analysis of the time course of primer extension with the 15-nt DNA PPT primer indicated that under our standard conditions where RT is in excess, reactions with mutants E224A, P225A, L228A, and WT RT proceeded too rapidly for determination of rate constants (data not shown). Thus, for these determinations, we modified the assay conditions and reduced the amount of each enzyme by 50-fold; this results in a 1:5 ratio of enzyme to primer-template. The catalytic rates for each of the mutant enzymes with the DNA PPT primer were similar (k ≅ 1.30 min−1) and were approximately 4-fold lower than that determined for WT RT (Fig.3 B). To test the possibility that the primer grip mutants which could not prime plus-strand DNA synthesis with the RNA PPT are unable to bind to unextended primer-template, we performed band-shift assays (29Guo J. Wu W. Yuan Z.Y. Post K. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5018-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the RNA and DNA PPTs as primers (Fig.4). We tested each mutant for the ability to form a stable complex under the same conditions used in the standard assay for plus-strand DNA synthesis (i.e. at a 10:1 ratio of RT to primer-template). All of the primer grip mutants were able to form at least small amounts of a stable complex with the RNA PPT primer-template, although the fraction of shifted complex obtained with the mutant RTs was not as great as that seen with WT RT (Fig. 4 A). In the case of mutant Y232A, the complex was barely detectable (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, variation in binding of the different mutant RTs to the RNA PPT primer-template did not strictly correlate with their ability to extend this primer. For example, mutants E224A and P225A could extend the RNA PPT (Fig. 2), but the extent of binding seen with these RTs was similar to that of F227A (Fig. 4 A), which could not extend the RNA PPT (Fig. 2). The reduction in binding efficiency of the mutants to the DNA PPT primer-template was similar to that found with the hybrid containing the RNA PPT (Fig. 4 B). In addition, when the ratios of enzyme to primer-template were increased above 10:1 for these mutants, most of the RNA primer-template could ultimately be shifted to a stable complex (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the defect in the ability to extend the RNA PPT is not simply a loss of ability to bind to the primer-template, but a loss in the ability to extend the bound primer. Some mutants (i.e. P226A, M230A, G231A, Y232A, and H235A; Fig. 4 B) showed relatively poor binding to the DNA PPT primer-template but were able to efficiently extend the DNA PPT primer (see Fig. 2). To investigate a possible correlation between the amount of stable complex formed in the band-shift assay with the ability to prime from the DNA PPT, we performed the band-shift assay under conditions in which binding and extension were tested in the same experiment (Fig. 5). The experimental conditions were the same as those used in the DNA PPT band-shift experiment (Fig.4 B), except that the primer-template was unlabeled and [α-32P]dATP was included to allow labeling by incorporation of dA at the +1 position. In this case, the primer-template is labeled only if the enzyme is able to bind to an extent necessary for incorporation of a single, labeled base (29Guo J. Wu W. Yuan Z.Y. Post K. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5018-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More pronounced differences between the primer grip mutants were observed with this assay. While all of the label incorporated by WT RT was present in bound pri"

To identify factors involved and to investigate their role in cholesterol uptake, we studied the effect of Viokase®, a porcine pancreatic extract, on cholesterol uptake into human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Viokase is capable of facilitating cholesterol uptake into these cells such that the level of uptake is 5-fold higher in the presence of solubilized Viokase. This stimulation is time-dependent and is dependent on the presence of bile salt. However, bile salt-stimulated pancreatic cholesterol esterase, which has been proposed to mediate cholesterol uptake, is not fully responsible. The major cholesterol transport activity was purified and identified as pancreatic phospholipase A2. Anti-phospholipase A2 antibodies abolished virtually all of the phospholipase A2 and cholesterol transport activity of solubilized Viokase. We demonstrate that both phospholipase A2 and cholesterol esterase increase cholesterol uptake by hydrolyzing the phosphatidylcholine that is used to prepare the cholesterol-containing micelles. In the absence of cholesterol esterase or phospholipase A2, uptake of cholesterol from micelles containing phosphatidylcholine is not as efficient as uptake from micelles containing phospholipase A2-hydrolytic products. These results indicate that phospholipase A2 may mediate cholesterol absorption by altering the physical-chemical state of cholesterol within the intestine.

These results indicate that phospholipase A2 may mediate cholesterol absorption by altering the physical-chemical state of cholesterol within the intestine. The serum cholesterol level is determined mainly by cholesterol synthesis in the liver and clearance of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins and also by the amount of cholesterol absorbed from the intestine. This is demonstrated by the fact that inhibition of cholesterol absorption can decrease serum cholesterol, specifically low density lipoprotein cholesterol (1Gylling H. Miettinen T.A. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 117: 305-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Schaefer E.J. Levy R.I. Shepherd J. Packard C.J. Miller N.E. Pharmacological Control of Hyperlipidemia. Prous, Barcelona1986: 119-132Google Scholar). The intestinal cholesterol pool has two sources; typically one-third comes from the diet, and the remainder is endogenous cholesterol from bile (3Wilson M.D. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 943-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grundy S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1983; 3: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cholesterol absorption is not complete and varies widely among individuals; in humans, the percent of cholesterol load absorbed in the intestine has been estimated to vary from 15 to 75% (4Grundy S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1983; 3: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and individuals respond differently to changes in dietary cholesterol (5Katan M.B. Beynen A.C. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1987; 125: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This variation suggests that metabolic or genetic factors regulate absorption. Although cholesterol absorption has been widely studied, the multiple factors involved are not fully understood. However, the absolute requirement for bile is established; bile salts are necessary for solubilization of cholesterol from the oil phase into micelles, from which it is available for absorption (6Siperstein M.D. Chaikoff I.L. Reinhardt W.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 198: 111-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Borja C.R. Vahouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1964; 206: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pancreatic secretions also appear to be required. Many studies have shown that giving pancreatic enzymes as a dietary supplement increases fat absorption in patients with pancreatic insufficiency, and one report has specifically demonstrated that enzyme supplementation increases cholesterol absorption in these patients (8Vuoristo M. Väänänen H. Miettinen T. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 647-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatectomized dogs and humans have low plasma cholesterol, which can be increased by feeding raw pancreas or pancreatin, a pancreatic extract preparation (9Chaikoff I.L. Kaplan A. J. Biol.

CEase has a wide substrate specificity, hydrolyzing tri-, di-, and monoglycerides and phospholipids in vitro (11Rudd E.A. Brockman H.L. Borgström B. Brockman H.L. Lipases.

Its role in absorption of free cholesterol has been under debate for many years with conflicting evidence regarding its importance in vivo (13Gallo L.L. Clark S.B. Myers S. Vahouny G.V. J.

In vitro, human intestinal Caco-2 cells have been used as a model for cholesterol uptake into the intestinal mucosa. Lopez-Candales et al.(15Lopez-Candales A. Bosner M.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12085-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that CEase stimulated cholesterol uptake from egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles by Caco-2 cells, whereas Huang and Hui (16Huang Y. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2029-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found no stimulation using a similar system. However, the latter study was performed at suboptimal concentrations of bile salt (15Lopez-Candales A. Bosner M.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12085-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Shamir et al. (17Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Zolfaghari R. Lee H.S. Fisher E.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6351-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) also found no indication that CEase increased unesterified cholesterol uptake from egg PC or monoolein vesicles. Disruption of the CEase gene in mice confirmed the role of CEase in hydrolysis of cholesterol ester but found no evidence of a role for CEase in the absorption of free cholesterol (18Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The demonstrated importance of pancreatic proteins, combined with increasing data against a role for CEase in unesterified cholesterol uptake, motivated this study to investigate the presence in pancreas of proteins other than CEase which facilitate absorption of free cholesterol. A commercially available porcine pancreatic extract, Viokase®, was used to study cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Viokase has been used to increase lipid absorption in patients with pancreatic insufficiency (19Marotta F. O'Keefe S.J.D. Marks I.N. Girdwood A. Young G. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1989; 34: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We describe the identification of the major cholesterol transport activity in the extract as pancreatic phospholipase A2 and investigate the mechanism by which this enzyme facilitates cholesterol uptake in this model system. Colonic adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. 10–20% polyacrylamide Tricine gels were from NOVEX, Novel Experimental Technology. Fast Stain was purchased from Zoion Biotechnology. Viokase brand of pancrelipase USP was obtained from A. H. Robins (0.7 g contained 16,800 USP units of lipase, 70,000 USP units of protease, and 70,000 USP units of amylase). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates used were UniplateTMSilica Gel G from Analtech Inc. Porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, egg yolk 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (egg PC), 1-palmitoyl, sn-glycero-3-PC, l- andd-dipalmitoyl PC, bovine serum albumin, Sephadex G-100, S-Sepharose, and heparin-agarose were all from Sigma Chemical Co. Tissue culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine pancreatic CEase was purified to homogeneity, and anti-bovine CEase antibody was prepared in rabbits as described previously (20Spilburg C.A. Cox D.G. Wang X. Bernat B.A. Bosner M.S.

Cholesterol was purchased from Steraloids Inc. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl,sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. [1,2-3H]Cholesterol (53.8 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc.l-3-Phosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl (50–62 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. The phospholipase assay kit was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company. Viokase (10 g) was solubilized in 100 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1.25 μm pepstatin, and 0.2 mm EDTA and stirred on ice for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 9,500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant collected for use. The yield was usually 20 mg/ml protein. If not used immediately, aliquots were stored frozen at −80 °C. Because of the high concentrations of protease in Viokase, protease inhibitors were required to maximize the recovery of cholesterol esterase activity during the solubilization step. Caco-2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C with 5.0% CO2. For transport assays, cells were plated into 24-well dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2. Cells were used 4–6 days after plating, which was 2–4 days after reaching confluence. Vesicles were prepared by drying 0.25 ml of egg PC (150 mm in hexane), 0.0174 ml of cholesterol (2.6 mm in chloroform), and 30 μCi of [3H]cholesterol under N2. To the dried lipids, 2.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was added and the mixture sonicated (Branson sonicator, setting 3) for 45 min at 4 °C. The preparation was centrifuged at 9,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the vesicles were decanted and stored at 4 °C. When other phospholipids were used, the same method was employed, and the final concentration of phospholipid was maintained unless otherwise stated. Preparation of cells for the assay was carried out with the cells on ice. Growth media were discarded and cells washed with 1.0 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution containing 0.02 m Hepes, pH 7.4, and the wash discarded. Each well received 0.25 ml of buffer (final concentrations 1 × minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmtaurochenodeoxycholate) containing 0.06 μCi of cholesterol/egg PC vesicles (0.3 mm PC) and the indicated amount of enzyme or control buffer (25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the specified time, usually 1.5 h, then placed on ice. Incubation media were removed, cells washed twice with 1.0 ml each of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, then twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilized by incubation with 0.2 ml of 1.0 n NaOH at room temperature for 10 min. Aliquots were assayed for protein concentration and for radioactivity by scintillation counting after neutralization with an equal volume of 1.0 n HCl. The effects of anti-phospholipase A2 antibodies on [3H]cholesterol uptake were assessed by preincubating the assay mixtures described above with 33.0 μg/ml solubilized Viokase, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm leupeptin, and the concentrations of antibodies listed in the figures. After 15 min at 4 °C, the [3H]cholesterol vesicles were added, the mixtures placed on the cells, and the uptake of [3H]cholesterol was measured as described above. In some experiments, Caco-2 cells were pretreated with 37 nm phospholipase A2 or 100 nmCEase, or buffer alone in a final volume of 0.25 ml of uptake buffer (final concentrations 1 × minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmtaurochenodeoxycholate, and 0.3 mm egg PC). After 1.5 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed extensively, and the uptake of radiolabeled cholesterol was determined by the cholesterol transport assay in the presence and absence of 37 nmphospholipase A2 or 100 nm CEase as described above. Release of [14C]oleic acid over a 5- or 10-min period from vesicles containing cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate and egg yolk PC was measured in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 8 mmtaurocholate, as described previously (21Cox D.G. Leung C.K.T. Kyger E.M. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide 10–20% gradient gels were run in SDS running buffer (24 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS). For recovery of protein, two samples of approximately 12 μg each were electrophoresed and half of the gel stained with Fast Stain. From the lane loaded on the unstained half of the gel, 0.5- or 1.0-cm slices were excised and placed in separate tubes. The slices were mashed with a pipette tip, and 60 μl of 25 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.1, was added. The slices were incubated at 4 °C overnight and then centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 5 min. The protein-containing supernatant was used in the cholesterol transport assay. Immunoblotting of phospholipase A2 and Viokase with anti-phospholipase A2 antibodies was carried out as described previously (20Spilburg C.A. Cox D.G. Wang X. Bernat B.A. Bosner M.S. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15532-15538Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A sample of 12.5 ml (20 mg/ml) of Viokase solubilized in PBS containing protease inhibitors was applied to a 500-ml Sephadex G-100 column (100 × 2.5 cm) and eluted with approximately 600 ml of PBS at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Protein eluted in three well separated peaks, and fractions were tested for cholesterol transport activity. All activity was found in the first peak, just after the void volume, which was estimated to contain less than 5% of total protein. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed in 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1, and approximately 3 mg of total protein was applied to an S-Sepharose column (25-ml bed volume). The column was washed with 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1, then washed with a gradient of buffer containing 0–1,000 mmNaCl (total wash volume 200 ml) at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Four peaks of protein eluted with approximately 60, 180, 270, and 370 mm NaCl. Fractions were tested for cholesterol transport activity, and the peaks eluting with 180 and 370 mm NaCl were found to have transport activity. The active fractions eluting with 180 or 370 mm NaCl were pooled separately (pool 1 and pool 2) and contained 400 and 250 μg of protein, respectively. Both pools were dialyzed in 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1. Each of the two pools was then applied separately to a 10-ml bed volume heparin-agarose column in 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1, at a flow rate of 15 ml/h and washed with buffer at the same rate. For pool 1, 380 μg of protein was loaded, and the activity did not bind to the heparin column. From the 20-ml flow-through a 10-μl sample was active in the transport assay. Hereafter, this protein is referred to as Hep-P1. With pool 2, 225 μg of protein was applied to the heparin column. The activity bound to the heparin column and was eluted with a step wash of buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Antibodies to Hep-P1 were raised in rabbits by Josman Laboratories, and the IgG fraction of immune and nonimmune serum was prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE Affi-Gel Blue according to standard procedures (22Cooper H.M. Paterson Y. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.L. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 11.13.1-11.13.4Google Scholar). The antibodies reacted with both the major and minor isoforms of porcine phospholipase A2. In some experiments, the active fractions from the Sephadex G-100 column were extracted by shaking for 3 min with 2 volumes of ice-cold diisopropylether:n-butyl alcohol (1.5:1.0, v:v). After phase separation by centrifugation, the solvent phase was recovered and dried under N2 at 40 °C. Residue was dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform and was subjected to TLC as described below. Cholesterol transport assays were performed as described above. After the specified time, incubation medium was removed from each well and placed on ice. Chloroform:methanol (5.0 ml of 2:1, v:v) and 1.0 ml of acid H2O (H2O containing 0.1% H2SO4 and 1% chloroform:methanol, 2:1, v:v) was added and the mixture shaken well. The layers were separated by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. The lower organic layer was recovered and dried under N2 at 40 °C. Residue was dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform and was chromatographed using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (65:35:8:4) until the solvent front was halfway up the plate. The plate was dried and then placed in a second chamber containing hexane:ether:acetic acid (86:16:1) until the solvent front was at the top of the plate. The plate was dried, and the lipids were stained with I2 vapor. Vesicles containing 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl PC were prepared by mixing 2.0 μCi of radiolabeled phospholipid with 12.5 mg of unlabeled 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PC and drying the mixture under N2. A volume of 2.5 ml of 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added and the mixture was sonicated, centrifuged, and the supernatant stored at 4 °C. The specific activity of the vesicles was approximately 4 × 105 dpm/mg phospholipid. Reaction mixtures contained a final volume of 0.25 ml of Hanks' buffered salt solution supplemented with 2.0 mm taurochenodeoxycholate, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, 150 μg of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl PC vesicles, and the indicated amount of enzyme diluted in PBS. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, each sample was extracted for total lipids, as described above, after the addition of 20 μg each of lyso-PC and oleic acid as carriers. The lipids were separated by TLC using the two solvent system described above, the lipid-containing areas were visualized with I2 vapor, scraped, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The effects of anti-phospholipase A2 antibodies on 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl PC hydrolysis were assessed by preincubating the assay mixtures described above with 12.0 μg/ml solubilized Viokase, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm leupeptin, and the concentrations of antibodies listed in the figures. After 15 min at 4 °C, the radiolabeled phospholipid vesicles were added, and hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl PC was measured as described above. Cell protein was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Phospholipids were measured by the method of Bartlett (23Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino-terminal protein sequence was obtained at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility of Stanford University School of Medicine. Statistical analyses were performed using the computer program InStat 2.01 and an unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In the Caco-2 model system used, with cholesterol presented in mixed micelles of egg PC and bile salt, there is a background level of uptake of cholesterol using buffer alone. Stimulation of cholesterol uptake above this background level is referred to as cholesterol transport activity. The ability of Viokase to stimulate uptake of cholesterol into Caco-2 cells was examined by performing the cholesterol transport assay in the presence of increasing amounts of solubilized Viokase. Uptake was stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at approximately 5-fold stimulation over buffer alone with 6 μg of Viokase protein (Fig. 1 A). The effect was dependent on presence of a narrow range of bile salt concentrations (Fig. 1 B) and was rapid, with stimulation of uptake seen within 15 min; at time points up to 4 h, facilitated transport was maintained at 5-fold over background (Fig. 1 C). Pancreatic CEase has been shown to stimulate cholesterol uptake in this model system (15Lopez-Candales A. Bosner M.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12085-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is expected to be present in Viokase. Therefore, a series of studies was performed to evaluate whether the transport activity was the result of CEase. The bile salt-dependent cholesteryl oleate hydrolytic activity of both purified bovine CEase and Viokase was assessed. On a mass basis, purified bovine pancreatic CEase was found to be about 1,000-fold more active than the impure Viokase (Fig. 2 A). To test whether this hydrolytic activity in Viokase corresponded to cholesterol transport activity, equivalent amounts of cholesteryl oleate hydrolytic units of both purified bovine CEase and Viokase were used to measure cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. With increasing amounts of hydrolytic activity, Viokase stimulated cholesterol uptake whereas even at the highest amount of hydrolytic units used, equivalent to 0.2 nm enzyme, CEase showed no stimulation above background (Fig. 2 B). Thus, CEase, measured by cholesteryl oleate hydrolytic activity, does not account for all of the cholesterol transport activity of solubilized Viokase. Further evidence that cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis and cholesterol transport are distinct activities in the pancreatic extract was a difference in sensitivity to boiling. Solubilized Viokase and purified bovine pancreatic CEase were diluted into 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1, and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. This inactivated the cholesteryl oleate hydrolytic activity of both preparations and also the cholesterol transport activity of CEase, whereas there was little reduction of Viokase-facilitated cholesterol transport (TableI). These combined results suggested that cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis and cholesterol transport activity were exhibited by different proteins.Table IEffect of elevated temperature on cholesterol uptake and cholesteryl oleate hydrolytic activities of Viokase extract and purified CEaseAdditionTemperatureUptake of [3H]cholesterolHydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate°Cdpm/μg cell proteindpm/10 minNone24.447Viokase496.72,265Viokase10085.842CEase476.41,358CEase10022.449Viokase (160 μg of protein) or CEase (34 μg of protein) was incubated for 10 min at either 4 °C or 100 °C in 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1. Precipitated protein was removed by low speed centrifugation, and aliquots, containing 3 μg of Viokase or 1.7 μg of CEase, were removed for measurement of [3H]cholesterol uptake in Caco-2 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of Viokase or CEase were removed for measurement of hydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent the average of duplicate determinations and are representative of two separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Viokase (160 μg of protein) or CEase (34 μg of protein) was incubated for 10 min at either 4 °C or 100 °C in 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1.

Sequential column chromatography was used to purify the cholesterol transport activity from Viokase. The first step was size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100 in which the cholesterol transport activity eluted from the column just after the void volume. The active fractions were pooled and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose. Two separate peaks of cholesterol transport activity eluted, one with 180 mm NaCl and the second with 370 mm NaCl. Only the peak eluting with 370 mm NaCl exhibited cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis activity. When the first peak was further purified by chromatography on heparin-agarose, cholesterol transport activity did not bind to the column. The active flow-through fractions were pooled and designated Hep-P1. In contrast, cholesterol transport activity from the second S-Sepharose peak bound to heparin-agarose and was eluted with 200 mm NaCl (designated Hep-P2). Hep-P1 and Hep-P2 were analyzed by immunoblotting with bovine CEase antibody, and immunoreactivity was demonstrated in Hep-P2 but not Hep-P1. Thus, the heparin-binding cholesterol transport activity was attributed to CEase (but see later in this section). Bovine CEase has previously been shown to bind to heparin-agarose (21Cox D.G. Leung C.K.T. Kyger E.M. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When the Hep-P1 fraction was concentrated and a sample (12 μg) electrophoresed under denaturing conditions, only one major band, with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa, was observed (Fig.3 A). To confirm that this band represented the cholesterol transport activity, slices were excised from an unstained SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and protein recovered from each slice was used to measure cholesterol transport. Only the slice corresponding to the 14-kDa band stimulated uptake of cholesterol into Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the 14-kDa band was responsible for the observed cholesterol transport activity. A sample (approximately 100 pmol) of Hep-P1 was subjected to amino-terminal sequencing and was identified as the minor isoform of phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 is secreted from the pancreas as a zymogen, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the amino-terminal 7 amino acids. Pig pancreas has two isoforms of phospholipase A2 which differ by only 4 residues, of which 2 occur within the amino-terminal 17 residues of the mature protein (24Puijk W.C. Verheij H.M. Wietzes P. de Haas G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 580: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequence obtained corresponded exactly to the 17 amino-terminal amino acids of the active, minor isoform, which is about 5% by weight of total pancreatic phospholipase A2(24Puijk W.C. Verheij H.M. Wietzes P. de Haas G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 580: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To confirm the result that phospholipase A2 was responsible for cholesterol transport, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 antiserum was performed and revealed an immunoreactive band of 14 kDa from both Hep-P1 and phospholipase A2 purchased from Sigma. Phospholipase A2 (Sigma) was tested for cholesterol transport activity, and both this and Hep-P1 showed a 5-fold stimulation of cholesterol uptake with an EC50 of 6–10 nm. Sigma phospholipase A2 gives multiple bands on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This material was further purified by hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose eluted with an inverse gradient of (NH4)2SO4, followed by affinity chromatography on hepari"

Schizosaccharomyces pombe Wee1 is a large protein, consisting of a C-terminal catalytic domain of ∼350 amino acids preceded by a N-terminal domain of ∼550 residues. The functional properties of the Wee1 N-terminal domain were investigated by expressing truncated forms of Wee1 in S. pombe. Both positive and negative regulatory domains were identified. Sequences important for Wee1 function were mapped to a central region (residues 363–408). This region is not required for kinase activity or nuclear localization, suggesting it may be involved in substrate recognition. The negative regulatory domain resides in the N-terminal third of Wee1, Wee1 constructs lacking this domain are more effective at delaying mitosis than wild-type Wee1. The negative regulatory domain contains clusters of potential Cdc2 phosphorylation sites. Investigations to monitor the abundance of Wee1 mRNA and protein during the cell cycle were also carried out.

A key aim of cell cycle investigations has been to fully describe the control mechanism that regulates the onset of mitosis, which is often referred to as the mitotic control. In recent years major advances have been made in understanding the mitotic control, largely as a result of the confluence of several experimental approaches, in particular genetic and in vivo biochemical studies carried out with the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe andin vitro biochemical studies carried out with extracts made from oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis (1Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These studies have led to the following understanding of the mitotic control. The initiation of mitosis is brought about by Cdc2 serine/threonine kinase, acting in obligatory association with one or more B-type cyclins. B-type cyclins that are involved in promoting mitosis are periodically destroyed upon exit from M-phase, thus progression through S and G2 is accompanied by a steady increase in the abundance of Cdc2-cyclin B complex. Activation of Cdc2 also requires phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the T-loop region (threonine 167 in S. pombe Cdc2), although this phosphorylation does not appear to have an important role in regulating the periodic activation of Cdc2 (2Gould K.L. Moreno S. Owen D.J. Sazer S. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3297-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cdc2-cyclin B is maintained in a repressed state during interphase due to phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the N-terminal lobe of Cdc2 (3Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In S. pombe phosphorylation of Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 is performed by Wee1 and Mik1 tyrosine kinases, with Wee1 having the dominant role (4Nurse P.

Wee1 and Cdc25, two of the major regulators of Cdc2-cyclin B kinase, are themselves regulated by phosphorylation (1Dunphy W.G.

In S. pombe, Nim1 serine/threonine protein kinase contributes to the induction of mitosis by carrying out inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1 (27Coleman T.R. Tang Z. Dunphy W.G.

In Xenopus oocytes and human tissue culture cells, Wee1 is the subject of a separate form of inhibitory phosphorylation that occurs during M-phase (15Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 32Tang Z. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33McGowan C.H. Russell P.

This second mechanism of inhibitory regulation of Wee1 is either directly or indirectly controlled by Cdc2-cyclin B kinase. Cdc25 phosphatase undergoes activating phosphorylation during M-phase, also by a mechanism that is either directly or indirectly controlled by Cdc2 (35Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

This type of Cdc25 regulation has been demonstrated in mammalian tissue culture cell, Xenopus oocyte extracts, and S. pombe. It has been proposed that the activating phosphorylation of Cdc25 and inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1 that occurs during M phase may play an important part in promoting the onset of mitosis (1Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this positive feedback model, activation of a small fraction of Cdc2-cyclin B can be rapidly amplified into total activation by a process in which Cdc2-Cyclin B catalyzes stimulatory phosphorylation of Cdc25 and inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1 (1Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The rod-shaped fission yeast presents one of the best experimental systems to test this positive feedback model of mitotic control. In S. pombe the size at which cells initiate mitosis and undergo cell division is quite sensitive to the gene dose of wee1 +,cdc25 +, and nim1 +, thus determination of cell length at division provides an easy measurement of mitotic timing (4Nurse P. Nature. 1975; 256: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 23Russell P. Nurse P.

In rich growth medium wild-type cells divide at ∼15 μm in length, wee1 − cells undergo division at approximately half the length of wild-type and exhibit a wee phenotype, whereas cells that have extra copies ofwee1 + undergo division at longer cell lengths that are directly related to wee1 + gene dose (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). This report deals with the function and regulation of Wee1 in S. pombe. Fission yeast Wee1 is a large protein, having a molecular mass of ∼107 kDa (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The protein kinase catalytic domain is confined to the C-terminal ∼35 kDa of Wee1. Interestingly, the protein sequences of the large N-terminal domains of Wee1 homologs fromS. pombe, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,Xenopus, and humans are highly divergent (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 15Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 44Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar,45Igarashi M. Nagata A. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. Nature. 1991; 353: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For this reason very little is known about which regions of Wee1 other than the catalytic domain are required for function in vivo. In vitro studies have shown that a truncated form of Wee1 containing only the ∼35-kDa catalytic domain, produced in insect cells, is unable to phosphorylate Cdc2, although it is able to phosphorylate enolase, suggesting that some part of the N-terminal domain is important for substrate interaction (8Parker L.L. Atherton-Fessler S. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). One feature that appears to be shared among Wee1 proteins from different species is a preponderance of serine-proline and threonine-proline dipeptides. SP and TP are the minimal consensus sequences for phosphorylation catalyzed by Cdc2 (46Nigg E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), thus one attractive model is that Cdc2 or another proline-directed protein kinase promotes the initiation of mitosis by carrying out inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1. A key prediction of this model is that elimination of phosphorylation sites, either by truncation or mutation, should make Wee1 resistant to inhibition by phosphorylation and as a consequence the initiation of mitosis should be delayed or prevented. S. pombe strains are all derived from972h − and 975h + (47Mitchison J.M. Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 131-146Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Procedures for genetic studies in S. pombe have been described (48Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). YES and synthetic EMM2 media were used to grow S. pombe cells (48Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). Cell size measurements were determined using an eyepiece micrometer attached to a Zeiss Axioskop 20 microscope with a 100 X objective. Thewee1 + open reading frame was amplified by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. from pWee1–1 (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) using the 5′ oligonucleotide 5′-CTCCATATGAGATCTTATGGCTTACGGCGGTCC-3′ (NdeI site underlined) and the 3′ oligonucleotide 5′-CAGCGGCCGCCAACATTCACCTGCCAATC-3′ (NotI site underlined). The wee1 + NdeI-NotI fragment was inserted downstream of the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter in pREP1-Ha6H (28Wu L. Russell P. Nature. 1993; 363: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 49Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). To create wee1-Δ1 and wee1-Δ3, 5′ primers 5′-CTCCATATGAGATCTAATGCATCTACTGGTGTA-3′ and 5′-CTCCATATGAGATCTTCCATGGACTTTTTGAGG-3′ (NdeI sites underlined) were used separately with the 3′ primer 5′-CAGCGGCCGCCAACATTCACCTGCCAATC-3′ (NotI siteunderlined) to amplify fragments ofwee1 +. The NdeI-NotI fragments were cloned into pREP1-Ha6H. pREP1wee1-Δ4, pREP1wee1-Δ5, and pREP1wee1-Δ11 plasmids were obtained by deletion of the region between two internal NcoI sites from pREP1wee1-Δ3, pREP1wee1-Δ1, and pREP1wee1+ plasmids, respectively. Plasmids pREP1wee1-Δ2, pREP1wee1-Δ6, and pREP1wee1-Δ10 plasmids were obtained by deleting the region between two internal NsiI sites from pREP1wee1-Δ1, pREP1wee1-Δ5, and pREP1wee1+ plasmids, respectively. To create pREP1wee1-Δ7, the wee1 933–1224 region from pREP1wee1-Δ2 was obtained by PCR using the 5′ oligonucleotide 5′-TAATGGACCTGTTAATCGAA-3′ which hybridized to the nmt1promoter and the 3′ oligonucleotide: 5′-CACCCATGGGTTTTGAAGGAGTACT-3′ (NcoI site underlined). TheNdeI-NcoI fragment from this PCR reaction was cloned into pREP1wee1-Δ4 that had been digested with NdeI and NcoI. To create pREPwee1-Δ8, the wee11089–1224 fragment was obtained by PCR using the 5′ primer 5′-CTCAGATCTGAGTTGTTAACTACTCCC (BglII siteunderlined) and the 3′ oligonucleotide: 5′-CACCCATGGGTTTTGAAGGAGTACT-3′ (NcoI site underlined). pREPwee1-Δ8 was constructed by inserting thewee1 1089–1224 BglII-NcoI fragment into pREP1wee1-Δ4. To create pREPwee1-Δ9, the wee11–933 fragment was obtained by PCR using the nmt1 promoter oligonucleotide 5′-TAATGGACCTGTTAATCGAA-3′ and the 3′ oligonucleotide: 5′-CAAAAAGTCCATGGATGCATCCTTA-3′ (NsiI andNcoI sites underlined). pREP1wee1-Δ9 was constructed by inserting the wee1 1–933 NdeI-NcoI fragment into pREP1wee1+. Plasmid pREP1wee1-Δ12 was constructed by blunt end ligation of pREP1wee1-Δ2 that had been digested with NcoI and NotI. Allnmt1:wee1 constructs were shuttled into pUR19-ars asPstI-EcoRI fragments. Plasmid pUR19-ars was created by removing the ClaI-ClaI ars fragment from pUR19. To generate single chromosomal copies of wee1constructs under the control of wee1 promoter,BglII-KpnI fragments from pREPwee1-Δ1, -Δ2, -Δ4, and -Δ7 were mobilized into pWee1–10 (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Then pWee1–10, -Δ1, -Δ2, -Δ4, and -Δ7 were digested with KpnI and integrated into a wee1–50/mik1::LEU2strain (strain PR265). The resulting strains are RA1264, RA1265, RA1263, RA1266, and RA1262, respectively. To create a strain in which genomic wee1 +encoded a protein having three copies of the HA epitope at the C terminus, we first created a plasmid encodingwee1 + -3HA. This plasmid, pSP72, has a 5.7-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment containingwee1 + -3HA. At the 3′ end of thewee1 open reading frame is the sequence, GTGATTGTTGGCGGCCGCATCTTTTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGACTATGCGGGCTATCCCTATGACGTCCCGGACTATGCAGGATCCTATCCATATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCTGTCGAC TAAACCTTT. The underlined sequence are NotI and SalI sites, respectively, which were created for the purpose of directional cloning of the 3HA sequence. The bold sequence encodes three consecutive copies of the HA epitope YPYDVPDYA (50Field J.-I. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), which was derived from pGTEP1 by PCR amplification. Sequence from wee1immediately flanks the NotI and SalI sites; the TAA termination codon is italicized. The 5.7-kbEcoRI/XhoI fragment from pSP72 was used to transform a wee1::ura4 + strain (PR47) along with the leu1–32 complementing co-transformation plasmid pART1. Ura− Leu+ transformants were identified and confirmed to have replacedwee1::ura4 + withwee1 + -3HA by Southern hybridization and immunoblotting. Strain LW1585 (wee1–3Ha leu1–32 ura4-D18) was used in this study. Frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in ice-cold LYSIS-1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). Chilled glass beads were added to the meniscus and cells were broken by vigorous shaking in a vortexer for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell extract was collected and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a Eppendorf Microfuge at 4 °C for 15 min. The concentration of cell extracts was estimated by determining OD280 and then normalized by adding LYSIS-1 buffer. Immunoblots were probed with anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibodies, anti-Wee1 (number 7451), or anti-Cdc2 (number 1267) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (51Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Immunoblots were subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies and signals were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Wee1-Ha6H protein was purified in denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. This involved breakage of cells in highly denaturing buffer G (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) and therefore no phosphatase or protease inhibitors were added. Cell pellets were resuspended in HE buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) and cells were lysed by vortexing at 4 °C in the presence of glass beads. Supernatants were transferred to tubes containing an equal volume of HES buffer (200 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 10 mmNa2EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 2% SDS) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in water and RNA concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Equivalent amounts of total RNA were loaded onto agarose/formaldehyde gels run and transferred to nylon membranes. Probe was made from the 8-kb genomic fragment containing wee1 and flanking sequences in the plasmid pWEE1–1 (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). A 30% (w/v) solution of paraformaldehyde was dissolved into 20 ml of PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgSO4) by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. This solution was diluted 10-fold into a growing culture to fix cells. After 1 h, cells were collected and washed in PEM. Cells were resuspended into PEMS (PEM + 1 m sorbitol) with 0.625 mg/ml Zymolyase-20T (20,000 units/g, Seikagaku Corp.), 0.1 mg/ml NovoZym™(Novo), and incubated for 0.5 to 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected and resuspended into PEMS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. Cells were then washed three times with PEM and incubated in PEMBAL (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide, 100 mml-lysine monohydrochloride, pH 6.9) for 1 h at room temperature. Affinity purified anti-Wee1 (number 7451) antibodies were added in PEMBAL and the samples were incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing three times with PEMBAL, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PEMBAL containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1/50 dilution) and RNase A (200 μg/ml). After the final wash with PEMBAL, samples were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% sodium azide and 4 μg/ml propidium iodide. SlowFade™ Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used for mounting. The major aim of this study was to evaluate the functional and regulatory roles of the N-terminal domain of Wee1. As shown in Fig. 1, the protein kinase catalytic domain of Wee1 occupies the C-terminal third of the 881-amino acid protein. There are 15 serine-proline or threonine-proline dipeptides located in the N-terminal 300 amino acids of Wee1; these are potential sites of inhibitory phosphorylation carried out by Cdc2-Cyclin B or other proline-directed kinases. A series of wee1 constructs encoding proteins having N-terminal truncations or internal deletions were produced (see “Experimental Procedures”) and placed under the control of the thiamine (vitamin B1)-repressiblenmt1 promoter (49Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing these constructs were integrated at the wee1 locus in wild-type andwee1–50 mik1::ura4 + strains, in each case leaving the genomic copy of wee1 + orwee1–50 intact. Note that wee1–50 is a temperature-sensitive mutation, thus wee1–50 mik1::ura4 + cells are viable and only slightly smaller than wild-type at the permissive temperature of 25 °C, but undergo mitotic catastrophe when incubated at temperatures above 30 °C (11Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Southern hybridization analysis confirmed that these strains contained a single integrated copy of the plasmids. At the outset we noticed that the full-length version ofnmt1:wee1 + caused a moderate cell elongation phenotype in the wee1–50 Δmik1 background when these cells grown in medium that represses the nmt1 promoter (Fig.1). Septated cells were ∼21 μm in length, versus ∼15 μm for wild-type cells. This suggests that the repressednmt1 + promoter is severalfold more active than the wee1 + promoter, underscoring the fact thatwee1 + expression is normally quite low. Most of the wee1 constructs caused cell cycle arrest when expressed from the induced nmt1 promoter in the wild-type and wee1–50 Δmik1 backgrounds. These included thewee1-Δ2 construct, which lacked the N-terminal 310 amino acids, as well as the wee1-Δ7 construct, which lacked the N-terminal 310 and internal 408–520 amino acids (Fig. 1). Constructs which failed to cause a cell cycle arrest when highly overexpressed included wee1-Δ3, which lacked the N-terminal 460 amino acids, wee1-Δ4, which lacked the N-terminal 520 amino acids, and wee1-Δ9, which lacked the internal 310–460 amino acids. The failure of constructs such as wee1-Δ3 to cause cell cycle arrest could not be attributed to a problem with protein expression; in fact, the amount of Wee1 protein detected in cells expressing inactive constructs such as wee1-Δ3 andwee1-Δ4 was much higher than in cells expressing active constructs such as wee1-Δ1 and wee1-Δ2 (Fig.2), which in turn expressed higher levels of Wee1 protein than cells expressing full-length wee1 +from the nmt1 promoter. 2R. Aligue and P. Russell, unpublished observations. It appears that cells expressing active Wee1 constructs experience growth defects caused by a massive increase in size long before the nmt1promoter is fully derepressed, this may explain why inactive Wee1 constructs appear to be more abundant that active Wee1 constructs. It is also possible the shorter Wee1 constructs are more stable proteins. Nor could the properties of inactive constructs be attributed to loss of kinase activity per se, as the minimal catalytic domain of Wee1 (residues 520–877, equivalent to wee1-Δ4), when produced in an insect cell expression system, retains vigorous autophosphorylation activity (8Parker L.L. Atherton-Fessler S. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed for thewee1-Δ3 and wee1-Δ4 constructs expressed inS. pombe, which also retained vigorous autophosphorylation activity.2 It should be noted that high overexpression of even the wee1-Δ3, wee1-Δ4, andwee1-Δ9 constructs caused a moderate elongation of cell length at division in wild-type cells and these constructs were able to rescue wee1–50 Δmik1 (Fig. 1), indicating that these truncated forms of Wee1 were not completely inactive in vivo. The inability of the wee1-Δ9 construct to cause cell cycle arrest when expressed from the nmt1 promoter strongly suggested that amino acids 310–460 are critical for Wee1 functionin vivo. Indeed, construct wee1-Δ6, which consists of the 310–460 region fused to the catalytic domain (residues 520–881), was able to cause cell cycle arrest when overexpressed from the nmt1 promoter (Fig. 1). The important sequences in the 310–460 region were further delineated by testing the activity of thewee1-Δ7 construct, which contained amino acids 310–408 fused to the catalytic domain (Fig. 1). This construct also was active, causing cell cycle arrest when overexpressed from the nmt1promoter and rescuing wee1–50 Δmik1 when cells were grown in nmt1 repressing medium. We finally tested the activity of construct wee1-Δ8, which contained amino acids 363–408 fused to C-terminal protein kinase domain. This construct also caused cell cycle arrest when expressed from the nmt1 promoter and rescued wee1–50 Δmik1 when cells were grown innmt1 repressing medium (Fig. 1). These findings indicate that N-terminal sequences that are critical for Wee1 function are located in the 363–408 amino acid region. Cdc2-Cdc13 complex is predominantly and perhaps exclusively localized in the nucleus during G2(52Booher R.N. Alfa C.E. Hyams J.S. Beach D.H.

We therefore expected that Wee1 would also be a nuclear protein. This was investigated by carrying out immunolocalization studies of Wee1. Anti-Wee1 antibodies produced no signal in wild-type cells, presumably because of the very low abundance of Wee1 protein. To circumvent this problem we overexpressed wee1-K596L, which encodes a catalytically inactive form of Wee1 (6Featherstone C. Russell P.

https://openalex.org/W2090614195,"QSR1 (quinol-cytochromec reductase subunit-requiring) is a highly conserved, essential gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that was identified through a synthetic lethal screen by its genetic relationship to QCR6, the gene for subunit 6 (Qcr6p) of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1complex. The function of the QSR1-encoded protein (Qsr1p) and its relationship to the QCR6-encoded protein are unknown.When yeast cell lysates are fractionated by density gradient centrifugation, Qsr1p separates from organelles and sediments with a uniformly sized population of particles that are similar to eukaryotic ribosomes upon velocity gradient centrifugation. When 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits are separated on velocity gradients, Qsr1p is found exclusively with the 60 S subunits, where it is a stoichiometric component. Extracts prepared from qsr1-1 cells are defective in in vitro translation assays relative to the wild type.In yeast cell lysates in which QCR6 rescues an otherwise lethal qsr1-1 mutation, Qcr6p is found only in mitochondria, both in respiratory-competent cells and in rho0 cells in which the bc 1 complex is no longer present. These results suggest that suppression of theqsr1-1 mutation by QCR6 occurs by atrans-relationship across the outer mitochondrial membrane. QSR1 (quinol-cytochromec reductase subunit-requiring) is a highly conserved, essential gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that was identified through a synthetic lethal screen by its genetic relationship to QCR6, the gene for subunit 6 (Qcr6p) of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1complex.

These results suggest that suppression of theqsr1-1 mutation by QCR6 occurs by atrans-relationship across the outer mitochondrial membrane. All cytochrome bc 1 complexes contain three redox proteins, cytochrome b, cytochromec 1, and an iron-sulfur protein, which are essential for the electron transfer and energy transduction functions of this enzyme in respiration and photosynthesis (1Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytochromebc 1 complexes of mitochondria also contain seven or eight additional subunits that lack prosthetic groups and that are not present in the bc 1 complexes of prokaryotes (2Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of these supernumerary subunits in the mitochondrial enzymes are largely unknown. QCR6 is the nuclear encoded gene for subunit 6 (Qcr6p) of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1 complex. Deletion of QCR6 does not impair growth of yeast on respiratory substrates at temperatures up to 35 °C, indicating that the supernumerary subunit 6 is not essential for respiration, although the deletion does result in a temperature-sensitive petite phenotype at 37 °C (3Yang M. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1270-1275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the deletion of QCR6 might be covered by another, functionally redundant gene, we screened for mutants that require the nonessential subunit 6 and identifiedquinol-cytochrome c reductasesubunit-requiring mutants in two complementation groups, which we named qsr1 andqsr2 (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the qsr mutants requireQCR6 to grow on either fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources. This suggests that subunit 6 of the cytochromebc 1 complex has a role outside of respiration. QCR6 suppresses an otherwise lethal missense mutation in aqsr1-1 mutant. We cloned QSR1 by complementing the qsr1-1 mutant for growth in the absence ofQCR6 and showed that QSR1 is an essential gene in yeast (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by QSR1 is highly conserved and has been identified in at least 10 different eukaryotic organisms (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Stanbridge E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the amino acid sequences have shown theQSR1-encoded proteins to be at least 60% identical between the most unrelated homologues (10Farmer A.A. Loftus T.M. Mills A.A. Sato K.Y. Neill J.D. Tron T. Yang M. Trumpower B.L. Stanbridge E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite being identified in numerous organisms, little is known about the function of theQSR1-encoded protein. For the most part, the only information available has been the details of the molecular cloning of these genes, and the deduced amino acid sequences give few clues as to Qsr1p function. In addition to showing that QSR1 is essential, we showed that Qsr1p is localized throughout the cytoplasm in a punctate staining pattern (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the relationship between Qcr6p and Qsr1p, we have investigated the localization of these two proteins. Here we report that Qsr1p is a 60 S ribosomal subunit protein and that Qcr6p is found only inside mitochondria in yeast cells in which QCR6 rescues the qsr1-1 mutation. Yeast extract, peptone, Tryptone, and yeast nitrogen base without amino acids were purchased from Difco. Dextrose was obtained from Fisher. Yeast lytic enzyme was from ICN Biochemicals.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 5 ml of H2O containing 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and centrifuged as before. Pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol and 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and transferred to a 250-ml flat-bottomed flask, and yeast lytic enzyme was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. The cell suspension was placed on a shaker at 30 °C for 20–30 min. Spheroplast formation was monitored by checking for osmotic lysis of 1 μl of cells diluted in 10 μl of H2O (14Wise J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C; resuspended in 15 ml of 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 500 mm sorbitol, pH 7.6; and centrifuged as before. Spheroplasts were then resuspended in 12 ml of 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 10% Nycodenz, pH 7.6, supplemented with 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 1 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate and transferred to a cold Dounce homogenizer. Spheroplasts were lysed on ice with 15 strokes of the loose plunger and 10 of the tight plunger. This resulted in ∼90% lysis as judged by viewing the lysate under a light microscope. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min to clear debris and unlysed cells. The supernatant was removed, and samples were saved for SDS-PAGE, 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein determinations, and enzyme assays. The lysate cleared of debris and unlysed cells was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min to sediment intact nuclei and plasma membranes. Samples of this medium-speed supernatant were taken for SDS-PAGE, protein determinations, and enzyme assays. Nycodenz density gradients were prepared by adding a 6-ml aliquot of HEND15 buffer (HEND15, HEND20, HEND25, HEND30, and HEND35 buffers contain 25 mm HEPES; 1 mm EDTA; 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35% Nycodenz, respectively; and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.6) to the bottom of a centrifuge tube. This buffer was then underlaid with HEND20 buffer, which was in turn underlaid with HEND25, HEND30, and HEND35 buffers. A 6-ml sample of the medium-speed supernatant was layered on top of this gradient and centrifuged at 120,000 × g in an SW 28 rotor for 10 h. The bottom of the centrifuge tube was punctured; 25 × 1.4-ml fractions were collected; and aliquots were taken for SDS-PAGE, protein determinations, refractometry, and enzyme assays (15Kolling R. Hollenberg C.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Rexach M.F. Latterich M. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fractions containing Qsr1p from the equilibrium density gradient were combined, and the Nycodenz concentration was adjusted to 35% by adding stock 80% Nycodenz. Two ml of this sample was used to underlay a gradient composed of 2 ml each of HEND30, HEND25, HEND20, and HEND15. This gradient was centrifuged at 180,000 × g in an SW 40 rotor for 16 h, after which 10 × 1-ml samples were collected, and aliquots were withdrawn for SDS-PAGE, protein determinations, refractometry, and enzyme assays (16Rexach M.F. Latterich M. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The markers for soluble cytosolic proteins, mitochondria, vacuoles, and endoplasmic reticulum were Hxk1p/Hxk2p (both isoforms), Atp2p (F1β), Pho8p, and Sec61p, respectively. These markers were assayed by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Qsr1p was detected by Western blotting with antiserum diluted 1:1000 (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For quantitation, Western blots were repeated with three different protein dilutions to control for saturation of the nitrocellulose and visualized with the Lumiglo chemiluminescent system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) at multiple time points to control for saturation of the band intensity on the film. Band intensities on blots were determined by scanning the film with an Apple Color One™ scanner, and the densities were quantified with the program NIH Image 1.52. Activity is defined as pixels, and relative activities were calculated by scaling the maximum activity for each marker to 100%. The GDPase marker for the Golgi apparatus was assayed enzymatically (19Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the maximum activity was scaled to 100%. Marker recoveries were calculated as activity per μl × volume divided by activity per μl of lysate × volume of lysate for each marker. Nycodenz concentrations were determined on an Abbe refractometer, and protein determinations were performed by the Bio-Rad method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Velocity gradient centrifugations of lysates were done essentially as described by Ramirez et al. (20Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lysates of W303-1B cells were prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min to remove debris and most organelles. Supernatant equivalent to 35 absorbance units at 600 nm was loaded onto 5–47% sucrose gradients prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin. The gradients were then centrifuged at 220,000 × g for 3 h and 45 min in an SW 40 rotor and were collected in 20 × 0.5-ml fractions. Absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. Yeast lysates and gradient buffers were supplemented with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 10 mmMgCl2, or 0.5 m KCl where indicated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Qsr1p or mouse monoclonal antibodies to the ribosomal L3 protein (diluted 1:2500). The relative amounts of Qsr1p and L3 associated with 60 S subunits, 80 S ribosomes, and polysomes were determined by scanning Western blots of fractions from a gradient of polysomes from yeast cells in which protein synthesis was arrested by addition of cycloheximide. Band intensities of the two proteins were quantified with the NIH Image program as described above. Ribosomes were isolated as described by Raue et al. (21Raue H.A. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 453-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 60 S subunits equivalent to 2 absorbance units at 260 nm were treated with 20 μg/ml trypsin for 0, 5, 15, and 30 min, either in the absence or presence of equimolar amounts of 40 S subunits as indicated. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer preheated to 95 °C. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on W303-1B cells as described previously (8Marty I. Brugidou C. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. Plant J. 1993; 4: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the L3 protein were used at a dilution of 1:200. S100 extracts were prepared from wild-type or qsr1-1 mutant cells (23Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and stored at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Thawed extracts were treated with nuclease, and reactions were carried out at 20 °C at a final protein concentration of 6 mg/ml in the reaction buffer described by Leibowitzet al. (24Leibowitz M.J. Barbone F.P. Georgopoulos D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA was prepared from spheroplasts using the RNeasy midikit from QIAGEN Inc., and poly(A)+ RNA was purified on oligo(dT)-cellulose (12Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by spotting on trichloroacetic acid-soaked filter paper. Filters were washed extensively with 10% trichloroacetic acid and ethanol and dried, and incorporation of [35S]methionine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was quantitated by liquid scintillation. DNA manipulations were carried out according to the manufacturers' directions and standard procedures (11Goldring E.S. Grossman L.I. Krupnick D. Cryer D.R. Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced with the Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit from Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI) or the modified FS kit. Reactions were analyzed on an ABI 373 automated sequencer at the Dartmouth Molecular Biology Core Facility, and the data were interpreted using Sequence Editor™ (ABI). The plasmid pLK57 was obtained from the original library screening to complement the qsr1-1 mutant (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was identified as aQCR6-containing suppressor because it contains theQCR6 genomic 1.9-kilobase SphI fragment. pLK13, which expresses the glutathione S-transferase-QCR6p fusion, was constructed by amplifying the QCR6 open reading frame by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction mixtures were initially denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and then cycled 25 times at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, and the resulting product was subcloned into the EcoRI sites of pGEX-1λT. The primers used were 1QCR6 (5′-GAA TTC ATG TTG GAA CTA GTT GGT GAG-3′) and 2QCR6 (5′-GAA TTC CTA CTT TAA TTT GTC AAA TAA TCT AGG-3′). Antibodies to a glutathioneS-transferase-Qcr6p fusion protein were raised in rabbits (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and used at a dilution of 1:500. Lysates of wild-type andqsr1-1 mutant strains were prepared by resuspending cells from a 5-ml culture in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 400 mm mannitol, and 2 mm EDTA and vortexing with glass beads. Mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min in a microcentrifuge. Samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared from the supernatant (cytosol) and the pellet (mitochondria). Mitochondria with bound polysomes were purified with the buffers adjusted to pH 6.0 to minimize contamination by microsomes (25Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Ades I.Z. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9918-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet fraction containing mitochondria with bound polysomes was loaded onto a 30–80% sucrose step gradient in buffer containing 200 μg/ml cycloheximide and centrifuged at 120,000 × gfor 16 h, and gradients were fractionated as described above. Mitochondria were treated with proteinase K as described by Hartlet al. (27Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The punctate cytoplasmic localization of Qsr1p (4Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

When lysates from exponentially grown yeast cells were centrifuged to remove nuclei, plasma membranes, and larger organelles, 95% of the Qsr1p was recovered in the supernatant (TableI). When this medium-speed supernatant was fractionated on a Nycodenz gradient, Qsr1p sedimented as a uniform population as shown in Fig. 1. The distribution of Qsr1p overlaps with, but does not exactly match that of Sec61p, an integral membrane protein that is part of the protein translocation complex of the endoplasmic reticulum.Table IRecovery of Qsr1p and organelle markers after fractionation of yeast cell lysatesMarkerOrganelle/compartmentMarker recoveryLysateMSS1-aMSS, medium-speed supernatant (described under “Experimental Procedures”).Pool 1Pool 2%Qsr1p100958583Sec61pEndoplasmic reticulum1002660Atp2pMitochondria1003452HxkpCytosol1009500GDPaseGolgi1009500Pho8pVacuole1005540Recoveries were calculated by dividing the activity per μl × volume for each marker by the activity per μl × volume of the lysate.

Open table in a new tab Recoveries were calculated by dividing the activity per μl × volume for each marker by the activity per μl × volume of the lysate. The percent recovery of each marker in the lysate is scaled to 100 for comparison. Pool 1 is fractions 11–15 from the first Nycodenz gradient (Fig. 1), and Pool 2 is the bottom two fractions from the flotation gradient described under “Experimental Procedures.” To investigate the possibility that Qsr1p is associated with a subpopulation of endoplasmic reticulum, the fractions containing Qsr1p from the first Nycodenz gradient were combined and applied to the bottom of a flotation gradient. In this procedure, membranes floated up through the gradient until they came to equilibrium, while denser proteins and protein complexes remained on the bottom. Under these conditions, Qsr1p remained at the bottom of the gradient while Sec61p floated up (data not shown). Qsr1p was thus separated completely from all markers, except for 2% of the Atp2p mitochondrial marker, which was recovered at the bottom of the second gradient (Table I). That Qsr1p did not float in the second gradient indicates that it is not associated with any membranes. During the 10-h centrifugation of the first density gradient, membranes will reach their equilibrium density, but proteins and protein complexes will still be sedimenting toward their equilibrium position at the bottom of the tube and will be recovered according to their sedimentation rate rather than density. Since Qsr1p is predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence to be ∼25 kDa and the cytosolic markers Hxk1p and Hxk2p are 100-kDa dimers in solution (28Barman T.E. Enzyme Handbook. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1969: 377-378Google Scholar), Qsr1p appears to be part of a large complex that sediments significantly faster than Hxk1p/Hxk2p in the first density gradient (Fig. 1). Quantitation of the amount of Qsr1p relative to that in the initial lysate (Table I) indicates that >80% of the Qsr1p was recovered after the second density gradient centrifugation as a large membrane-free complex under the standard conditions used to lyse and fractionate yeast cells. The size of the putative particle identified by the density gradient centrifugations was investigated by velocity gradient centrifugation and determined to be between 80 and 100 S under conditions that maintain association of ribosomal subunits (data not shown). This size estimate led us to investigate whether Qsr1p is associated with ribosomes. Rapidly sedimenting organelles and membranes were removed from yeast cell lysates by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 ×g (20Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), after which polysomes were separated by gradient centrifugation. The distribution of 40 and 60 S subunits, 80 S ribosomes, and polysomes was monitored by absorbance at 254 nm, and the distribution of Qsr1p and L3, a large ribosomal subunit protein (29Woolford Jr., J.L. Adv. Genet. 1991; 29: 63-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was monitored by Western analysis. The association of large and small ribosomal subunits is dependent upon the presence of Mg2+, and cycloheximide arrests ribosomes during translation on an mRNA template (20Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We thus varied these parameters to test the association of Qsr1p with ribosomes. As shown in Fig. 2 a, when protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide and Mg2+ was included, there were small amounts of 40 S and 60 S subunits followed by larger amounts of 80 S ribosomes and polysomes. L3 was localized to the 60 S and 80 S peaks and with the polysomes, as expected. A small amount of Qsr1p was with the 60 S subunit, and its distribution in 80 S and polysome fractions matched that of L3. When Mg2+ was omitted from the buffers and cycloheximide was included, 40 S and 60 S subunits dissociated, and no polysomes were detected as shown in Fig. 2 b. Under these conditions, L3 marked the 60 S subunit, and the distribution of Qsr1p matched that of L3, indicating that it is also a 60 S subunit protein. The experiment depicted in Fig. 2 c was performed to determine whether Qsr1p associates with the 40 S subunit prior to initiation of translation. With the omission of cycloheximide and inclusion of Mg2+, the ribosomes were able to finish translating in lysates, and translation initiation factors like Gcn2p are associated with the 40 S subunit (20Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Qsr1p was found with the 60 S subunit, 80 S ribosomes, and polysomes with the same distribution as the large ribosomal subunit marker L3. Quantitative Western blots indicate that Qsr1p constitutes between 0.1 and 0.5% of total cell protein (data not shown), which is in agreement with the abundance of other ribosomal proteins (29Woolford Jr., J.L. Adv. Genet. 1991; 29: 63-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although Qsr1p was consistently found in 60 S subunits, visual comparison of the relative amounts of L3 and Qsr1p in the 60 S subunits and 80 S ribosomes in Fig.2 (a and c) indicated that proportionately less Qsr1p than L3 was present in free 60 S subunits. To investigate the stoichiometry of Qsr1p on 60 S subunits, the amounts of Qsr1p and L3 were quantitated by Western analysis of fractions from a gradient identical to that in Fig. 2 a. As shown in Fig.2 d, the ratio of Qsr1p to L3 was relatively constant and was close to 1 in fractions containing 80 S ribosomes and polysomes. In fractions 10 and 11, which included the 60 S subunits, Qsr1p was diminished ∼5-fold relative to L3. This suggests that although Qsr1p is quantitatively recovered with the ribosomal fraction (Fig. 1 and Table I), a portion of free 60 S subunits lack Qsr1p. To further characterize the association of Qsr1p with the large ribosomal subun"

Kinetic and binding studies of purified MiaA were performed with several substrates, including synthetic wild-type tRNAPhe, the anticodon stem-loop (ACSLPhe) of tRNAPhe, and bulk tRNA isolated from a miaA mutant. Gel filtration shift and steady-state kinetic determinations showed that affinity-purified MiaA had the same properties as native MiaA and was completely active for tRNAPhe binding. MiaA had aK mapp (tRNA substrates) ≈3 nm, which is orders of magnitude lower than that of other purified tRNA modification enzymes, aK mapp (DMAPP) = 632 nm, and ak catapp = 0.44 s−1. MiaA activity was minimally affected by other modifications or nonsubstrate tRNA species present in bulk tRNA isolated from a miaA mutant. MiaA modified ACSLPhe with ak catapp/K mappsubstrate specificity about 17-fold lower than that for intact tRNAPhe, mostly due to a decrease in apparent substrate binding affinity. Quantitative Western immunoblotting showed that MiaA is an abundant protein in exponentially growing bacteria (660 monomers per cell; 1.0 μm concentration) and is present in a catalytic excess. However, MiaA activity was strongly competitively inhibited for DMAPP by ATP and ADP (K iapp = 0.06 μm), suggesting that MiaA activity is inhibited substantially in vivo and that DMAPP may bind to a conserved P-loop motif in this class of prenyltransferases. Band shift, filter binding, and gel filtration shift experiments support a model in which MiaA tRNA substrates are recognized by binding tightly to MiaA multimers possibly in a positively cooperative way (K dapp ≈0.07 μm).

Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), MiaA can modify a 17-mer synthetic microhelix stem-loop substrate, in this case corresponding to the ACSL of tRNAPhe(wt) (Table II). Thus, the minimal recognition elements for the MiaA tRNA prenyl transfer reside in this limited ACSL structure. However, the kcatapp/ Kmappsubstrate specificity is reduced significantly by about 17-fold for the ACSLPhe(wt) microhelix compared with intact tRNA molecules (Table II) (or 34-fold if MiaA is catalytically active as a dimer for tRNA and as a monomer for ACSLPhe(wt) (below; see TableII)). In this regard, MiaA resembles the Tgt transglycosylases, whose Vmaxapp/ Kmappis 5–10-fold lower for an ACSLTyr microhelix compared with an intact tRNATyr substrate (58Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TrmA methyltransferase uses a T-loop microhelix as a substrate almost as well as intact tRNA molecules (reduction of kcatapp/ Kmapp≈2.5-fold; (51Gu D. Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11652-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). At the other extreme, the TrmD methyltransferase depends strongly on intact tRNA tertiary structures and does not efficiently modify an ACSL microhelix (reduction of Vmaxapp/ Kmapp≈300-fold (54Holmes W.M. Andraos-Selim C. Roberts I. Wahab S.Z. J. Biol.

The TrmA methyltransferase and other enzymes that modify the amino acid-accepting minihelix, which is composed of the acceptor and T-loop microhelices, generally do not depend on overall tRNA tertiary structure for their activities (61Grosjean H. Edqvist J. Straby K.B. Giege R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, TrmD methyltransferase and other enzymes that modify the anticodon minihelix, which is composed of the anticodon and D-loop microhelices, have been found to strongly depend on intact tRNA three-dimensional structure (see Ref. 61Grosjean H. Edqvist J. Straby K.B. Giege R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The exception to this classification scheme is bacterial Tgt transglycosylases, which modify ACSL microhelices moderately efficiently (see above) (58Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 62Curnow A.W. Kung F. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and interact strongly, but not exclusively, with the ACSL region of substrate tRNA molecules (57Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,63Mueller S.O. Slany R.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). MiaA also presents an exception to the strictest application of this classification scheme. However, the significantly reduced substrate specificity of MiaA for the ACSLPhe(wt) microhelix compared with intact tRNAPhe(wt) (Table II) suggests that interactions of MiaA with regions other than the ACSLPhe are important for optimal activity. This conclusion is further supported by binding studies discussed below. Compilations of the tRNA molecules that contain ms2i6A37 or i6A37 modifications led to a consensus ACSL that includes possible secondary structure and sequence-specific elements required for MiaA recognition and modification (1Tsang T.H. Buck M. Ames B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 741: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Grosjean H. Nicoghosian K. Haumont E. Söll D. Cedergren R. Nucleic Acid Res. 1985; 13(15): 5697-5706Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent experiments by Y. Motorin and H. Grosjean 3Y. Motorin and H. Grosjean, personal communication. using tRNASer isoaccepting species confirm that optimal MiaA activity may depend on primary, secondary, and tertiary interactions within tRNA substrates. The kinetic, binding, and footprinting properties of these and other mutant RNA substrates are currently being determined.One noteworthy difference between MiaA and other purified tRNA modification enzymes is its extremely low Kmapp for native and synthetic tRNA substrates (≈3 nm; Table II). By comparison, the Kmapp of the Tgt transglycosylases, TrmD methyltransferase, and TrmA methyltransferase for synthetic tRNA substrates is 2.0, 3.3, and 2.8 μm, respectively (51Gu D. Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11652-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 54Holmes W.M. Andraos-Selim C. Roberts I. Wahab S.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13440-13445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which are about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of MiaA (Table II). Likewise, the kcatapp or Vmaxapp of MiaA is about 10-fold greater for synthetic tRNA substrates than that of the TrmA and Tgt enzymes (51Gu D. Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11652-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 58Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Together, these results show that MiaA is a comparatively active enzyme with a high apparent affinity for its tRNA substrates. Consistent with this interpretation, the kinetic properties of MiaA for a synthetic, purified tRNAPhe(wt) substrate were very similar to those for bulk tRNA isolated from amiaA mutant (Table II). Thus, the presence of nonsubstrate, native tRNA molecules in the bulk tRNA preparations did not appreciably inhibit or affect MiaA substrate recognition or activity. This behavior contrasts with the purified HisT pseudouridine synthase (56Kammen H.O. Marvel C.C. Hardy L. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2255-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TrmD methyltransferase, 4W. M. Holmes, personal communication. which are strongly inhibited by nonsubstrate tRNA species. Moreover, the constancy of kinetic properties of MiaA for synthetic, unmodified tRNAPhe(wt) and hypomodified bulk tRNA from amiaA mutant implies that the other modifications present in tRNA molecules do not significantly affect MiaA activity. Transparency to other base modifications in tRNA was also documented for the Tgt transglycosylase (62Curnow A.W. Kung F. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).We used quantitative Western immunoblotting to determine that there are about 660 MiaA monomers per cell in bacteria growing exponentially in enriched minimal salts/glucose medium (Fig. 4). Previously, the cellular amounts of tRNA modification enzymes have been measured only indirectly by comparisons of specific activities (e.g. see Ref. 64Hjalmarsson K.J. Byström A.S. Björk G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1343-1351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these studies have led to the generalization that tRNA modification enzymes are present in few copies per cell (9Björk G.R. Söll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-205Google Scholar). To the contrary, our results show that MiaA is a relatively abundant cellular protein compared with other biosynthetic enzymes (see Ref. 41Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 883-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the kcatapp of MiaA for tRNA (Table II) and the number of MiaA monomers per cell, we calculate that the rate of i6A37 synthesis can approach 15,400 modifications per min per cell. The equation for the rate of MiaA substrate tRNA synthesis in exponentially growing cells is (65Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 1527-1542Google Scholar): d(tRNA)/dt = ((ln2)/(cell doubling time)) × (number of MiaA substrate tRNA molecules per cell) = (ln2/54 min) × (198,000 total tRNA molecules × 12.9% MiaA substrates (7Dong H. Nilsson L. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar)) = 328 MiaA substrate tRNA molecules synthesized per min per cell. Thus, there is about a 47-fold excess (15,400/328) of MiaA catalytic capacity in vivo. This calculation makes a number of necessary simplifying assumptions, including that MiaA substrates are not limiting in vivo, that MiaA activity is not subjected to additional regulation (below), and that the in vitro kinetic properties of MiaA can be extrapolated to the in vivo situation. We estimate that the in vivo steady-state concentration of MiaA is about 1.0 μm in these exponentially growing bacteria (see “Results”). By comparison, the steady-state in vivoconcentration of MiaA tRNA substrates can be calculated at about 42 μm, Kmapp(tRNA) of MiaA ≈3 nm (Table II), and Kdapp(tRNA) of MiaA ≈0.07 μm in the absence of DMAPP (below). Finally, we found that the cellular amount of MiaA was regulated and decreased about 3-fold as bacterial cells entered stationary phase (Fig. 4), which leads to a drop in the rate of tRNA synthesis (66Huisman G.W. Siegle D.A. Zambrano M.M. Kolter R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1672-1682Google Scholar).Early work indicated that MiaA activity was strongly inhibited by unknown compounds in some substrate preparations (37Rosenbaum N. Gefter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5675-5680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of E. coli tRNAPhe(wt) in E. colicaused the accumulation of hypomodified tRNA species lacking the ms2i6A37 or i6A37 modifications (21Wilson R.K. Roe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that MiaA activity can be saturated in vivo. We found that MiaA activity was strongly inhibited by ADP, ATP, and other NTPs (see “Results”; Fig. 7, A and B). This inhibition was classically competitive with the DMAPP substrate (Fig. 7) with a Kiapp of about 0.06 μm (Fig. 7, A and B).The comparatively large cellular amount of MiaA and its high activity and substrate affinities are likely needed to overcome inhibition by NTPs and NDPs in vivo. We can estimate this inhibition by first recalling that the number of MiaA substrate tRNA molecules synthesized per min is about 328 (see above) ≈0.54 μm(see “Results”). The Kmapp(tRNA) of MiaA ≈3 nm (Table II), so MiaA is saturated for its tRNA substrates. The inhibition of MiaA catalytic capacity can be calculated from the standard enzyme inhibition equation (v = Vmaxapp [S]/([S] + Kmapp (1 + ([I]/ Kiapp))) and will depend on the MiaA kinetic parameters for DMAPP (Table II) and the free, but not total, intracellular concentrations of NTPs, NDPs, and DMAPP.

Using a monoclonal antibody raised against the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, we identified that platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1 or CD31) was tyrosine phosphorylated in these cells. Aggregation of PECAM-1 did not induce a detectable increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation, nor did it result in degranulation. However, the minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in nonstimulated cells was dramatically increased after FcεRI aggregation. This receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was an early event, independent of Ca2+ influx or of the activation of protein kinase C and of cell adhesion. PECAM-1 is an adhesion molecule that is required for the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into sites of inflammation. Therefore tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may modulate its interaction with other molecules, thereby regulating the migration of basophils into inflammatory sites.

Mast cells and basophils accumulate at sites of inflammation and play pivotal roles in the initiation of the allergic response. Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) on these cells initiates a biochemical cascade that results in degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators (1Stevens R.L. Austen K.F.

Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells provide a useful experimental model to study these signal transduction pathways for degranulation in mast cells/basophils (2Beaven M.A. Metzger H. Immunol.

Here we report that a monoclonal antibody raised to these cells recognized a 130-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein. The phosphorylation of this protein was dramatically increased after FcεRI aggregation. Amino acid sequence analysis of purified protein suggested that this molecule was the rat homolog of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), 1The abbreviations used are: PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (also called CD31); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (also called CD31); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. also called CD31. This was confirmed by immunochemical studies.PECAM-1 is a member of the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on platelets, endothelial cells, and cells of the myeloid lineage such as leukocytes and basophils (reviewed in Refs. 10DeLisser H.M. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 490-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 11Muller W.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 localizes to intercellular junctions of endothelial cells or monolayer cultured cells in which it is expressed. It functions in interendothelial cell adhesion, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, transendothelial migration, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 10DeLisser H.M. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 490-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 can mediate both homophilic (i.e. PECAM-1 on one cell interacting with PECAM-1 on another cell) and cation-dependent heterophilic binding. The heterophilic ligands for PECAM-1 include cell surface glycosaminoglycans (12DeLisser H.M. Yan H.C. Newman P.J. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16037-16046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and αvβ3 integrin (13Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).PECAM-1 is a single chain molecule of 130 kDa containing six extracellular Ig-like domains of the C2 subclass, one transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (14Stockinger H.

The cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 consists of 118 amino acids that include numerous serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues that could potentially become phosphorylated. In fact, the phosphorylation on serine residues of PECAM-1 has been observed after activation of endothelial cells, platelets and T lymphocytes (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newman P.J. Hillery C.A. Albrecht R. Parise L.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Dunlop L.C.

This suggests that the phosphorylation state of PECAM-1 could be important in regulating its function. However, there have been no previous reports of receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1.Here we report that PECAM-1 is present on RBL-2H3 cells and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following FcεRI aggregation. Mast cells and/or basophils accumulate and play a critical role at sites of inflammation. This enhanced adhesion of activated cells to the endothelium of capillaries and their migration into sites of inflammation may be regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PECAM-1 molecule.DISCUSSIONUsing a monoclonal antibody to RBL-2H3 cells we identified the adhesion molecule PECAM-1 as one of the substrates that is tyrosine phosphorylated after FcεRI aggregation. The phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was an early event after receptor activation and was not seen when cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and did not require cell adherence. The FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was much stronger and persistent with anti-receptor antibodies than with IgE antigen. However, there was still variation in the extent of PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with different anti-FcεRI antibodies (data not shown). The varying efficiency of different FcεRI aggregation signals in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may be due to differences in the way these signals orient and aggregate the receptor (34Ortega E. Schweitzer-Stenner R. Pecht I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4101-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The present model for signaling by FcεRI suggests the cooperation between Lyn and Syk protein tyrosine kinases (29Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Receptor aggregation induces activation of a protein tyrosine kinase, probably Lyn, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits. Syk is then recruited by the tyrosine phosphorylated receptor subunits; its activation then propagates downstream signals including the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ and the rise in intracellular calcium. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in this cascade of events was partly independent of Syk, although it was enhanced by the presence of Syk. Tyrosine phosphorylation was also independent of the presence of calcium in the medium. Although FcεRI, Lyn, and Syk are all either membrane proteins or associated with the membrane at different stages of receptor activation, we could not detect any association by immunoprecipitation of these molecules with PECAM-1, another membrane protein (data not shown). Moreover, there was no kinase activity in the PECAM-1 immunoprecipitates. Nevertheless, tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may be due to Lyn, Syk, or other tyrosine kinases activated by receptor aggregation.The deduced amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of human, murine, and bovine PECAM-1 are very similar and have four (human) or five (bovine and mouse) tyrosine residues (16Newman P.J.

The murine sequence 702YSEIR contains a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site (18Xie Y. Muller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5569-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This sequence is identical among the three species except for a replacement of isoleucine with valine in the human sequence. The cytoplasmic domain also has a number of serines that could be phosphorylated. Stimulation of platelets and endothelial cells results in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 on serine residues (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newman P.J. Hillery C.A. Albrecht R. Parise L.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Dunlop L.C. Zhang J. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, activation with either phytohemagglutinin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces serine phosphorylation and down-regulation of the level of PECAM-1 on the cells but not in tyrosine phosphorylation (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results are the first report that PECAM-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells and that its phosphorylation is regulated by cell surface receptors.Basophils and mast cells have surface adhesion receptors that are involved in the binding of these cells to other cells or to the extracellular matrix (33Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 62-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding results in aggregation of adhesion receptors with the propagation of intracellular signals. RBL-2H3 cells bind through integrin receptors to surfaces coated with fibronectin, resulting in changes in the cytoskeleton, cell spreading, and a redistribution of the granules to the periphery of the cells (36Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar). At sites of attachment to the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasmic domains of the integrins form focal adhesion complexes that contain proteins in noncovalent association. These include talin, vinculin, α-actinin, filamin, pp125FAK, and other phosphoproteins (37Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Formation of the complexes is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as pp125FAK and of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin (38Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). In contrast, aggregation of PECAM-1, a member of the Ig superfamily of adhesion molecules, does not induce the formation of such focal adhesion complexes nor does it result in the tyrosine phosphorylation.The cytoplasmic domain controls the function of cell adhesion molecules such as integrins, selectins, or members of the Ig superfamily. Thus deletion of the cytoplasmic domain not only changes the capacity of these receptors to interact with the cytoskeleton but also can result in changes in ligand specificity (39Solowska J.

The activity of some adhesion molecules is regulated by the state of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain. For example, the phosphorylation of LFA-1 by either protein kinase C-dependent and/or -independent pathways regulates the binding affinity of this molecule to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (45Hibbs M.L.

For cells to leave the circulation and migrate into sites of inflammation they require multiple adhesive interactions with the endothelium. Thus, cell rolling is mediated by selectins, cell adhesion to the endothelium is a function of integrins, and transmigration is due to PECAM-1. PECAM-1 may exert both homophilic (PECAM-1 to PECAM-1) and heterophilic (PECAM-1 to other molecules such as glycosaminoglycan) interactions. These interactions may be important for the transmigration of cells into tissues.

Thus, phosphorylation of PECAM-1, either by inducing conformational changes or by functioning as a docking site, could modulate association of PECAM-1 with other molecules, including the cytoskeleton, and regulate its function.PECAM-1 may also be involved in regulating the function of other cellular proteins. For example, aggregation of PECAM-1 regulates the adhesive properties of β1 and β2 integrins on neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells (50Tanaka Y. Albelda S.M. Horgan K.J. Van Seventer G.A. Shimizu Y.

Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 could also influence its capacity to regulate the adhesive activity of integrins.In summary, we have found that PECAM-1 is present on RBL-2H3 cells and is tyrosine phosphorylated after receptor aggregation. Such modification of the molecule may be important for its physiological function. This is supported by evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 plays an important role. First, transfectants of PECAM-1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain are defective in aggregation (42DeLisser H.M. Chilkotowsky J. Yan H.C. Daise M.L. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J.

Second, alternatively spliced forms of PECAM-1 lacking the potential tyrosine phosphorylation site exhibit different aggregation properties (53Yan H.-C. Baldwin H.S. Sun J. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M.

Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may be crucial not only for the transmigration of basophils into inflammatory sites but also for the regulation of degranulation. Mast cells and basophils accumulate at sites of inflammation and play pivotal roles in the initiation of the allergic response. Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) on these cells initiates a biochemical cascade that results in degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators (1Stevens R.L. Austen K.F.

To understand the signaling cascade initiated by FcεRI aggregation, we are attempting to identify molecules that become tyrosine phosphorylated after receptor activation. Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells provide a useful experimental model to study these signal transduction pathways for degranulation in mast cells/basophils (2Beaven M.A. Metzger H. Immunol.

Here we report that a monoclonal antibody raised to these cells recognized a 130-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein. The phosphorylation of this protein was dramatically increased after FcεRI aggregation. Amino acid sequence analysis of purified protein suggested that this molecule was the rat homolog of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), 1The abbreviations used are: PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (also called CD31); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (also called CD31); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. also called CD31. This was confirmed by immunochemical studies. PECAM-1 is a member of the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on platelets, endothelial cells, and cells of the myeloid lineage such as leukocytes and basophils (reviewed in Refs. 10DeLisser H.M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 localizes to intercellular junctions of endothelial cells or monolayer cultured cells in which it is expressed. It functions in interendothelial cell adhesion, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, transendothelial migration, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 10DeLisser H.M. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 490-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 can mediate both homophilic (i.e. PECAM-1 on one cell interacting with PECAM-1 on another cell) and cation-dependent heterophilic binding. The heterophilic ligands for PECAM-1 include cell surface glycosaminoglycans (12DeLisser H.M. Yan H.C. Newman P.J. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16037-16046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and αvβ3 integrin (13Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 is a single chain molecule of 130 kDa containing six extracellular Ig-like domains of the C2 subclass, one transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (14Stockinger H. Gadd S.J. Eher R.

The cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 consists of 118 amino acids that include numerous serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues that could potentially become phosphorylated. In fact, the phosphorylation on serine residues of PECAM-1 has been observed after activation of endothelial cells, platelets and T lymphocytes (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newman P.J. Hillery C.A. Albrecht R. Parise L.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Dunlop L.C.

This suggests that the phosphorylation state of PECAM-1 could be important in regulating its function. However, there have been no previous reports of receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1. Here we report that PECAM-1 is present on RBL-2H3 cells and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following FcεRI aggregation. Mast cells and/or basophils accumulate and play a critical role at sites of inflammation. This enhanced adhesion of activated cells to the endothelium of capillaries and their migration into sites of inflammation may be regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PECAM-1 molecule. DISCUSSIONUsing a monoclonal antibody to RBL-2H3 cells we identified the adhesion molecule PECAM-1 as one of the substrates that is tyrosine phosphorylated after FcεRI aggregation. The phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was an early event after receptor activation and was not seen when cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and did not require cell adherence. The FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was much stronger and persistent with anti-receptor antibodies than with IgE antigen. However, there was still variation in the extent of PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with different anti-FcεRI antibodies (data not shown). The varying efficiency of different FcεRI aggregation signals in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may be due to differences in the way these signals orient and aggregate the receptor (34Ortega E. Schweitzer-Stenner R. Pecht I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4101-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The present model for signaling by FcεRI suggests the cooperation between Lyn and Syk protein tyrosine kinases (29Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Receptor aggregation induces activation of a protein tyrosine kinase, probably Lyn, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits. Syk is then recruited by the tyrosine phosphorylated receptor subunits; its activation then propagates downstream signals including the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ and the rise in intracellular calcium. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in this cascade of events was partly independent of Syk, although it was enhanced by the presence of Syk. Tyrosine phosphorylation was also independent of the presence of calcium in the medium. Although FcεRI, Lyn, and Syk are all either membrane proteins or associated with the membrane at different stages of receptor activation, we could not detect any association by immunoprecipitation of these molecules with PECAM-1, another membrane protein (data not shown). Moreover, there was no kinase activity in the PECAM-1 immunoprecipitates. Nevertheless, tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may be due to Lyn, Syk, or other tyrosine kinases activated by receptor aggregation.The deduced amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of human, murine, and bovine PECAM-1 are very similar and have four (human) or five (bovine and mouse) tyrosine residues (16Newman P.J.

The murine sequence 702YSEIR contains a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site (18Xie Y. Muller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5569-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This sequence is identical among the three species except for a replacement of isoleucine with valine in the human sequence. The cytoplasmic domain also has a number of serines that could be phosphorylated. Stimulation of platelets and endothelial cells results in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 on serine residues (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newman P.J. Hillery C.A. Albrecht R. Parise L.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Dunlop L.C. Zhang J. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, activation with either phytohemagglutinin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces serine phosphorylation and down-regulation of the level of PECAM-1 on the cells but not in tyrosine phosphorylation (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results are the first report that PECAM-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells and that its phosphorylation is regulated by cell surface receptors.Basophils and mast cells have surface adhesion receptors that are involved in the binding of these cells to other cells or to the extracellular matrix (33Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 62-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding results in aggregation of adhesion receptors with the propagation of intracellular signals. RBL-2H3 cells bind through integrin receptors to surfaces coated with fibronectin, resulting in changes in the cytoskeleton, cell spreading, and a redistribution of the granules to the periphery of the cells (36Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar). At sites of attachment to the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasmic domains of the integrins form focal adhesion complexes that contain proteins in noncovalent association. These include talin, vinculin, α-actinin, filamin, pp125FAK, and other phosphoproteins (37Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Formation of the complexes is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as pp125FAK and of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin (38Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). In contrast, aggregation of PECAM-1, a member of the Ig superfamily of adhesion molecules, does not induce the formation of such focal adhesion complexes nor does it result in the tyrosine phosphorylation.The cytoplasmic domain controls the function of cell adhesion molecules such as integrins, selectins, or members of the Ig superfamily. Thus deletion of the cytoplasmic domain not only changes the capacity of these receptors to interact with the cytoskeleton but also can result in changes in ligand specificity (39Solowska J.

The activity of some adhesion molecules is regulated by the state of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain. For example, the phosphorylation of LFA-1 by either protein kinase C-dependent and/or -independent pathways regulates the binding affinity of this molecule to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (45Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).

The murine sequence 702YSEIR contains a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site (18Xie Y. Muller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5569-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This sequence is identical among the three species except for a replacement of isoleucine with valine in the human sequence. The cytoplasmic domain also has a number of serines that could be phosphorylated. Stimulation of platelets and endothelial cells results in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 on serine residues (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol.

In Jurkat T cells, activation with either phytohemagglutinin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces serine phosphorylation and down-regulation of the level of PECAM-1 on the cells but not in tyrosine phosphorylation (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results are the first report that PECAM-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells and that its phosphorylation is regulated by cell surface receptors. Basophils and mast cells have surface adhesion receptors that are involved in the binding of these cells to other cells or to the extracellular matrix (33Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 62-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding results in aggregation of adhesion receptors with the propagation of intracellular signals. RBL-2H3 cells bind through integrin receptors to surfaces coated with fibronectin, resulting in changes in the cytoskeleton, cell spreading, and a redistribution of the granules to the periphery of the cells (36Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar). At sites of attachment to the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasmic domains of the integrins form focal adhesion complexes that contain proteins in noncovalent association. These include talin, vinculin, α-actinin, filamin, pp125FAK, and other phosphoproteins (37Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Formation of the complexes is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as pp125FAK and of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin (38Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). In contrast, aggregation of PECAM-1, a member of the Ig superfamily of adhesion molecules, does not induce the formation of such focal adhesion complexes nor does it result in the tyrosine phosphorylation. The cytoplasmic domain controls the function of cell adhesion molecules such as integrins, selectins, or members of the Ig superfamily. Thus deletion of the cytoplasmic domain not only changes the capacity of these receptors to interact with the cytoskeleton but also can result in changes in ligand specificity (39Solowska J.

The activity of some adhesion molecules is regulated by the state of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain. For example, the phosphorylation of LFA-1 by either protein kinase C-dependent and/or -independent pathways regulates the binding affinity of this molecule to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (45Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Activation of endothelial cells, platelets, or lymphocytes results in an increase in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 on serine residues (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newman P.J. Hillery C.A. Albrecht R. Parise L.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Dunlop L.C. Zhang J. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and association with the cytoskeleton. Basophils and mast cells accumulate at sites of inflammation. For cells to leave the circulation and migrate into sites of inflammation they require multiple adhesive interactions with the endothelium. Thus, cell rolling is mediated by selectins, cell adhesion to the endothelium is a function of integrins, and transmigration is due to PECAM-1. PECAM-1 may exert both homophilic (PECAM-1 to PECAM-1) and heterophilic (PECAM-1 to other molecules such as glycosaminoglycan) interactions. These interactions may be important for the transmigration of cells into tissues. Anti-PECAM-1 antibodies, by binding to leukocytes or to endothelial cells, block the transmigration of leukocytes without inhibiting the adherence of the cells to the endothelium (46Muller W.A. Weigl S.A. Deng X. Phillips D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 47Vaporciyan A.A. DeLisser H.M. Yan H.C. Mendiguren I.I. Thom S.R. Jones M.L. Ward P.A.

Thus, phosphorylation of PECAM-1, either by inducing conformational changes or by functioning as a docking site, could modulate association of PECAM-1 with other molecules, including the cytoskeleton, and regulate its function. PECAM-1 may also be involved in regulating the function of other cellular proteins. For example, aggregation of PECAM-1 regulates the adhesive properties of β1 and β2 integrins on neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells (50Tanaka Y. Albelda S.M. Horgan K.J. Van Seventer G.A. Shimizu Y.

The interaction of endothelial PECAM-1 with leukocyte or basophil PECAM-1 could result in up-regulation of the activity of integrins, which may provide the interaction necessary for transmigration through the endothelial cell junctions. Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 could also influence its capacity to regulate the adhesive activity of integrins. In summary, we have found that PECAM-1 is present on RBL-2H3 cells and is tyrosine phosphorylated after receptor aggregation. Such modification of the molecule may be important for its physiological function. This is supported by evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 plays an important role. First, transfectants of PECAM-1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain are defective in aggregation (42DeLisser H.M. Chilkotowsky J. Yan H.C. Daise M.L. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Second, alternatively spliced forms of PECAM-1 lacking the potential tyrosine phosphorylation site exhibit different aggregation properties (53Yan H.-C. Baldwin H.S. Sun J. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. DeLisser H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23672-23680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Third, phosphorylation of PECAM-1 on serines regulates its down-regulation (19Zehnder J.L. Hirai K. Shatsky M. McGregor J.L. Levitt L.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5243-5249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may be crucial not only for the transmigration of basophils into inflammatory sites but also for the regulation of degranulation. We thank Drs. Majed Hamawy, Mark Swieter, and Teruaki Kimura for helpful discussions and advice. We are grateful to Greta Bader for technical assistance in histamine analysis."

Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 203-271Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The trimeric Sec61 complex, the central constituent of these translocation sites (3Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), is involved in various functions directly linked to the transport of the nascent chain. Its α-subunit is a major part of the protein conducting channel, and during the co-translational mode of translocation, the majority of ribosome binding sites are provided by the Sec61 complex (4Mothes W. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3937-3982Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Kalies K.-U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, the Sec61 complex is reportedly involved in a second signal sequence recognition event that takes place in the membrane during the protein translocation (6Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent electronmicroscopic data demonstrate that the Sec61 complex forms pore-like structures in the ER membrane (7Hanein D. Metlack K.E.S. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.-U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition to trimeric Sec61 complexes, yeast contains a heptameric Sec complex consisting of the subunits of the Sec61p complex (Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sss1p) as well as of the subunits of the Sec62/63 subcomplex (Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p) (8Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This Sec complex is sufficient to translocate proteins post-translationally into reconstituted proteoliposomes in the presence of the luminal chaperone Kar2p (9Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Two other protein complexes that are part of the translocation site modify the nascent chain while being translocated, the oligosaccharyl transferase complex and the signal peptidase complex (SPC). The SPC cleaves the signal peptides of most secretory and many membrane proteins as soon as the lumenal domain of the translocating polypeptide is large enough to expose its cleavage site to the enzyme (10Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Mammalian signal peptidase has been purified from dog pancreas microsomes as a complex of five different polypeptide chains (11Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of all five subunits have been cloned and sequenced (12Shelness G.S. Kanwar Y.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17063-17070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Greenburg G. Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3925-3929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Remarkable differences exist between the topologies of these proteins within the ER membrane. Three of them, SPC18, SPC21, and the glycoprotein SPC22/23 are single-spanning membrane proteins with their amino termini facing the cytosol. The major part of these proteins is located within the lumen of the ER, and they all contain a second only moderately hydrophobic sequence close to their carboxyl termini (11Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,16Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPC18 and SPC21 show high homology to each other (12Shelness G.S. Kanwar Y.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17063-17070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, their sequences are related to leader peptidase (17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the enzyme responsible for signal sequence cleavage during translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane of bacteria (18Zwizinski C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7973-7977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these polypeptides may function as catalytic subunits. The functions of the SPC22/23, however, remains unclear. In contrast, SPC12 and SPC25 contain two membrane spanning segments with their amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytosol and almost no residues in the lumen of the ER. Therefore, it has been speculated, that SPC12 and SPC25 are involved in processes other than substrate binding or the actual enzymatic reaction. This assumption was supported by the fact that an active signal peptidase that comprises only an SPC18 homolog and an SPC22/23 homolog could be purified from hen oviduct (19Baker R.K. Lively M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8561-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Newsome A.L. McLean J.W. Lively M.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In yeast, the SPC contains four subunits (21YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Three of them have been characterized to date. The Sec11p is homologous to SPC18 and SPC21 (23Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as to leader peptidases of bacteria (17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).SEC11 is essential for cell viability. The essential nature of Sec11p is seen when haploid cells containing a temperature-sensitive allele of SEC11 are shifted to nonpermissive temperature. These cells rapidly accumulate precursors of secretory proteins and stop growing (25Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Spc1p and Spc2p, the other two subunits that were analyzed until now, are homologs of the canine SPC12 and SPC25, respectively. Both yeast proteins are nonessential for cell viability and signal peptide cleavage under normal growth conditions (22Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, they modulate the activity of yeast SPC as overproduction of Spc1p suppresses the sec11 temperature-sensitive phenotype and depletion of Spc2p results in a defect in signal peptidase activity in cells incubated at high temperature. In this paper, we analyze the function of the fourth subunit of yeast SPC, the Spc3p, which is revealed as the homolog of the canine SPC22/23. SPC3 is essential for cell viability. Its depletion leads to accumulation of precursors of secretory proteinsin vivo and to the loss of the signal peptidase activityin vitro. Overexpression of Sec11p does not suppress this phenotype. Therefore, in contrast to bacterial leader peptidases, the yeast enzyme requires a second subunit for its function. Media and cell growth conditions have been described elsewhere (9Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 27Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E.

The disruption of the SPC3 was performed according to the method of Schneider et al. (28Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 13: 1265-1274Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Two 60-mer DNA-oligos were designed with 40 bp complementary to the start or the end region of the SPC3 gene and 20 bp complementary to the sequence of a hemagglutinin tag. Using pMPY-3xHA as a template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a product containing a URA3 gene flanked by 3xHA tags and the 40-bp sequence complementary to the SPC3 gene regions was amplified. The diploid yeast strain DF5 was transformed with this PCR product and directly selected on ura− dropout plates. Correct integration of the URA3 gene was confirmed by PCR. Plating of cells onto 5-FOA selects for strains where recombination between flanking epitope sequences removed the URA3gene. The disruption of the SEC11 was performed according to Böhni et al. (25Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The pCBsec11::LEU plasmid is a generous gift from Dr. F. Kepes. The plasmid pHM1 used for complementation of the Δspc3 mutation was constructed as follows. SPC3 was amplified by a PCR reaction using a forward oligonucleotide (ATGTTCTCCTTTGTCCAAAGATTC) beginning with the start codon of SPC3 and a reverse primer (AAAGGTACCGAGGATAAGACGCAGTCCAG), which is located 420 bp downstream of the SPC3 stop codon. The PCR fragment was digested withKpnI, and the resulting fragment was cloned between theSmaI-KpnI site of plasmid pRS414 (29Sikorski R.A. Hieter P.

For pHM3,SEC11 was amplified by PCR using a primer beginning at the start codon of the gene (ATGAATCTAAGATTTGAATTGCAG) and a reverse primer (ATATGGTACCCATCGCGATGGATATTATATG) 400 bp downstream of the stop codon. The resulting fragment was digested with KpnI and cloned into pRS414 at SmaI-KpnI sites. A Gal1/Gal10 promoter was inserted using the BamHI site described above. For pHM4, the above-described PCR fragment containing the Sec11 gene was subcloned into the pUC19 SmaI-KpnI sites. A 0.65-kb HindIII-SacI fragment was excised and then inserted into a pRS426 (31Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.A. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P.

Isolation of the ER signal peptidase complex from yeast membrane was performed as described previously (26Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis was performed as described earlier (15Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3925-3929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 8 h, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Aliquots of cells growing in SD minimal medium were removed at distinct time points and were labeled with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine for 10 min at 30 °C (pulse). After incubation, the cells were stopped with 20 mm sodium azide, washed, and homogenized with glass beads in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 μl/ml leupeptin, 5 μl/ml chymostatin) using a Vortex mixer. The homogenate was diluted with 4 volumes of IP dilution buffer (1.25% Triton X-100, 190 mm NaCl, 60 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 6 mm EDTA, 10 μl/ml leupeptin, and 5 μl/ml chymostatin), and labeled proteins were precipitated with anti-Kar2p antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The ratio of the radioactivity in the preKar2p and Kar2p bands was determined by a phosphoimager (Fuji Bas 2000). The assay was performed according to YaDeau et al. (21YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Yeast cells of induced cultures were shifted to glucose (YPD or SD minimal medium) and were grown for various times. After harvesting the cells, membranes were isolated. To obtain comparable amounts of membranes, the samples were normalized to same amounts of Sec62p. Digitonin extract corresponding to 10 eq (membrane equivalent, see Ref. 3Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) membranes were prepared, and 210 μl of buffer was added. The final conditions of the assay were 50 mmtriethanolamine, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mg/ml phospatidylcholine, 0.01% SDS (from the SDS pre-treatment of the prepro-α-factor), 120 mm KAc, and 0.2% digitonin. The added prepro-α-factor was synthesized in a reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]methionine. After 2 h at 25 °C, the samples were precipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by a phosphoimager (Fuji Bas 2000). Antibodies against the amino termini of Sec11p and Spc1p as well as the antibody against the carboxyl terminus of Spc2p have been described earlier (26Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Anti-Spc3p antibodies were raised by the same methods using a recombinant expressed carboxyl-terminal part of the protein as antigen. Immunoblots were performed as described earlier (9Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). For immunoprecipitation, digitonin extracts corresponding to 50 eq of membranes were used and diluted with LD buffer (9Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 1.5% digitonin, 100 mm KAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgAc, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μl/ml leupeptin, 5 μl/ml chymostatin. 5 to 10 μl of purified antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a rotary shaker. After washing the beads, the proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS-sample buffer. To identify a possible yeast homolog of canine SPC22/23, we searched the GenBankTM data base for similar proteins. In addition to the already described chicken gp23 (20Newsome A.L. McLean J.W. Lively M.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we identified open reading frames in C. elegans,S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae (Fig.1) as well as expressed sequence tags of human, mouse,Drosophila melanogaster, Brugia malayi, Schistosoma mansoni, and Arabidopsis thaliana with significant homology to SPC22/23. Analysis of the yeast gene, hereafter designated asSPC3, with different computer programs predicted that it codes for a glycoprotein with 26% identity to canine SPC22/23. Spc3p has a membrane anchor close to its amino terminus like the other proteins of the family (Fig. 1). Because Spc3p is a glycoprotein (see below) that has potential sites for N-linked glycosylation only in the carboxyl-terminal part (Fig. 1), it is very likely that Spc3p has the same membrane topology as canine SPC22/23. To determine whether Spc3p is part of the yeast signal peptidase, we purified the SPC from S. cerevisiae as described earlier (26Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against the luminal part of Spc3p recognize a protein on Western blots that co-purifies with the already known yeast SPC subunits, Sec11p, Spc1p, and Spc2p (Fig.2 A). This immunoreactive band corresponds to a prominent protein in a fraction highly enriched in yeast SPC (Fig.2 B). To confirm its identity with Spc3p, the purified protein was subjected to Edman degradation. The obtained peptide sequence matches perfectly with the predicted protein sequence (Fig.1). To demonstrate the integrity of the complex by an independent method, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Spc1p antibodies using yeast membranes solubilized in digitonin as starting material. The analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting showed that under these conditions, Spc2p, Sec11p, and Spc3p are co-precipitated but the control protein Sec62p was not (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3). Spc3p contains two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (see Fig. 1). To determine whether Spc3p is indeed a glycoprotein, we analyzed a Western blot of the purified SPC which was then incubated with concanavalin A-peroxidase. As depicted in Fig.2 D, lane 1, a concanavalin A-binding protein co-migrates with Spc3p. To confirm this result and to check whether both potential sites of Spc3p might be used, purified yeast SPC was treated with the N-glycosidase F and then analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). Only Spc3p, but not Spc1p showed a shift in mobility during SDS-PAGE compared with mock-treated membranes (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2 and3). The size of the mobility shift of about 5 kDa indicates that both glycosylation sites are likely to be used. The double band inlane 3 is probably a result of uncomplete digestion. Next we tested the effect of the in vivodepletion of Spc3p. First, we disrupted one allele of SPC3in the diploid yeast strain DF5 according to the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Tetrade analysis of this strain revealed that the function of SPC3 is essential for cell viability. The cells could be rescued by introducing a plasmid that expresses Spc3p under control of the Gal10 promoter in the presence of galactose, confirming that the loss of SPC3 function is the reason for the observed phenotype. To analyze the function of Spc3p in more detail, we then cultivated the rescued strain in liquid culture and determined its growth rate under conditions that either induce (presence of galactose) or repress (presence of glucose) the promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). In different experiments, we found that the growth rate of the repressed culture starts to decrease after about 10 h (Fig.3 A). In a second set of experiments, cells were grown in glucose for various times and then analyzed for the occurrence of unprocessed Kar2p after 10 min of labeling in vivo (Fig. 3 B). After an 8-h repression of SPC3, precursors of Kar2p accumulated in the cells. As this strong defect in protein processing is preceding the decrease in growth rate, it is likely to be a direct effect of Spc3p depletion. To test this assumption further, we analyzed cells harvested at different time points after shifting to glucose for signal peptidase activity using an in vitro assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The amount of material used for the assay was calibrated by immunoblotting using anti-Sec62p-antibodies. Signal peptidase activity started decreasing after 6 h, a time point where repressed cells still have about the same growth rate as the control. After 15 h, signal peptidase activity of the repressed cells was about 10 times lower than that of DF5 control cells (Fig.4 A). In addition, the integrity of the yeast SPC during the Spc3p depletion was monitored by immunoblotting (Fig.4 B). Surprisingly, we found that, parallel to the loss of Spc3p also, the amount of Spc1p and Sec11p decreased below the detection level. The content of Spc2p decreased also, but in contrast to the other subunits, the amount of Spc2p appears to stabilize at a lower expression level. It should be noted that we never observed a complete loss of signal peptidase activity. Whether this is due to residual amounts of SPC that could not be detected by our antibodies or whether another protease with a substrate specificity similar to SPC was present in the samples (e.g. the mitochondrial inner membrane protease, a homolog of bacterial leader peptidase) remains open. Sec11p is known to be an essential yeast protein. Therefore, one may speculate that the loss of signal peptidase activity in response to the down-regulation of Spc3p is mainly due to the simultaneous loss of Sec11p. To test this, we tried to rescue theΔspc3 mutant by overexpression of Sec11p. SEC11was put under control of the Met3 promotor and introduced into an HMY1 yeast strain, which contained the plasmid pHM1 with SPC3under control of a Gal10 promoter. As a control, the Met3Sec11 containing plasmid was also introduced into theSEC11-deficient strain HMY2. Growth of these strains was then tested under conditions that induce the Met-promotor of Sec11p on agar plates either containing galactose or glucose (Fig.5 A). We found, that Sec11p alone is not able to rescue the depletion of Spc3p although Sec11p is strongly overproduced in these cells (Fig. 5 B). Another possibility is that Sec11p alone is sufficient to function as signal peptidase. In this scenario, Sec11p cannot suppress the depletion of Spc3p because Spc3p performs an essential function, different from the processing of signal peptides. To investigate this possibility, we set up the following experiment. HMY1 cells that contain the two plasmids pHM1 (Gal10Spc3) and pHM4 (Met3Sec11) were cultivated in liquid culture under conditions that were selective for both plasmids and and that induced both the Gal10 and the Met3 promotors. Cells were then shifted to a similar medium, which contained no galactose but glucose as carbon source, to repress the Gal10 promoter. At various time points, samples were taken and analyzed forin vitro signal peptidase activity, and the amount of the different yeast SPC subunits was monitored by immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a control, HMY1 cells containing only the pHM1 were grown using the same protocol with the only exception that uracil was added to the media. Under these conditions, the cells behaved similarly as in the experiments using complete media (Figs. 3 and 4) with respect to growth rate, signal peptidase activity, and stability of the different SPC subunits (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 6, we found that also in the Sec11p overexpressing strain, signal peptidase activity dropped in parallel to the loss of Spc3p. After 10 h, the cells of this strain contained still as much Sec11p as wild-type cells (Fig. 6 B), but the signal peptidase activity was about 5 times lower (Fig. 6 A), reaching an expression level that is almost identical to the level observed in the control strain that does not overexpress Sec11p (data not shown). This indicates that Sec11p alone is not sufficient to perform signal peptide cleavage. We have identified the yeast homolog of canine SPC22/23, Spc3p, which is identical with the last uncharacterized subunit of yeast SPC. Homologs of the other subunits of canine SPC have been identified in yeast earlier (22Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and it was shown that they are part of a heterotetrameric complex (21YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, the principle structure of the eucaryotic SPC turns out to be conserved from yeast to mammals. Spc3p is essential for cell viability. Its depletion results in accumulation of precursors of secretory proteins in vivo and loss of signal peptidase activity in vitro, a phenotype that is very similar to that observed in Δsec11 mutants (25Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2H.-A. Meyer, and E. Hartmann, unpublished results. Moreover, the depletion of Spc3p destabilizes the SPC. While the Spc1p and the Sec11p are not detectable in the ER in the absence of Spc3p, Spc2p seems to be more stable. The Spc3p may be directly involved in the cleavage of signal peptides. This is mainly indicated by the tight coupling of the loss of signal peptidase activity with the loss of Spc3p. Although Spc3p depletion leads to a simultaneouse loss of Sec11p, the overexpression of Sec11p is not able to rescue Δspc3 cells. Moreover, depletion of Spc3p in a strain overexpressing Sec11p revealed that, even in the presence of normal amounts of Sec11p, cells lose signal peptidase activity if Spc3p is absent. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decrease in signal peptidase activity observed during Spc3p depletion is caused by the parallel loss of Sec11p. It should be noted, that a simultaneous overexpression of Sec11p and Spc3p did not result in a significantly higher signal peptidase activity as measured in vitro. Although Spc1p and Spc2p are not essential in vivo, a limiting amount of one or both of these proteins could be the reason for this observation, as the dimeric subcomplex between Spc3p and Sec11p might be less stable under the conditions used for the in vitro assay than the complete SPC. Alternatively, it may well be that other parts of the translocon are needed for a correct assembly and for stabilization of the SPC. These findings shed a new light on the question of to what extent the eucaryotic signal peptidase of the ER and bacterial leader peptidase may be similar to each other. Signal peptidase activity of the bacterial plasma membrane is comprised of a single polypeptide, the leader peptidase. It has been shown that in contrast to this, the eucaryotic signal peptidase consists of several subunits that substantially differ from each other. However, the identification of regions in the bacterial leader peptidase and the eucaryotic SPC18, SPC21, and Sec11p, which display primary sequence similarity, raised the question of whether all of the eucaryotic subunits are directly involved in the cleavage of signal peptides (17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This notion has been supported by two other facts. 1) Enzymatically active signal peptidase may be purified from hen oviduct as a complex of only two subunits (SPC18 and gp23) (19Baker R.K. Lively M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8561-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and 2) neither the SPC12 homolog, Spc1p, nor the SPC25 homolog, Spc2p, is essential for viability or signal peptidase activity in S. cerevisiae. The identification of Spc3p as a second essential component of yeast SPC described above demonstrates that there must be indeed a substantial difference in the mode of signal peptide cleavage in eucaryotes and procaryotes. What could be the precise function of Spc3p in this process? It could well be, that the protein provides only a backbone for Sec11p to fold correctly. However, Spc3p could also be more directly involved in the proteolytic process. First, experiments indicate that the hydrophobic region at the carboxyl terminus that is conserved among all SPC22/23 homologs may be essential for the in vivo function of Spc3p.2 This domain could be involved in substrate binding, either alone or in combination with the similarly located second hydrophobic domain of the SPC18/SPC20/Sec11p subunit as proposed earlier by Shelness et al. (12Shelness G.S. Kanwar Y.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17063-17070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may even be that the SPC22/23 homolog is part of the catalytic center of the enzyme. One major way to answer this question will be the determination of the crystal structure of the Sec11p/Spc3p subcomplex. Why did this complex structure of SPC evolve in eucaryotes? One possibility is that the ER signal peptidase has a broader substrate specificity than the bacterial enzyme. For instance, in contrast to data reported for E. coli leader peptidase (33Nielsson I. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we did not find that yeast SPC activity is blocked in vivo if the substrate contains a proline immediatly after the cleavage site. 3K. Plath, and E. Hartmann, unpublished results. Another reason could be that the SPC is involved in other proteolytic processes like the digestion of signal peptides (34Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or the degradation of membrane proteins (35Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is also possible that protein translocation across the ER is more regulated than the related process in bacteria and that some SPC subunits are involved in this function. In this regard, it will be of interest to investigate also Archea signal peptidase as the possible ancestor to eucaryotic signal peptidase. To date, a gene having higher homology to eucaryotic SPC18/SPC20/Sec11p than to bacterial leader peptidases has been identified in Methanococcus jannaschii(36Bult C.J. Olsen G. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), 4E. Hartmann, unpublished results. and whether homologs of the other SPC subunits are also present in Archea is still open.

Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Although CD45 is encoded by a single gene, alternative splicing of the mRNA allows for the generation of at least eight distinct isoforms of the molecule based on variable usage of exons 4–6, which encode a region of the amino-terminal ectodomain. Of particular interest, and experimental utility, is the observation that these isoforms are expressed in a cell type-specific and differentiation stage-specific manner. The variable exon repertoire expressed by different isoforms is known to greatly influence the charge properties of CD45 since the region encoded by these exons contains multiple sites forO-linked glycosylation (2Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD45 also possesses 11–18 putative N-linked glycosylation sites, which are subject to cell-specific controls, conferring further microheterogeneity upon CD45 (3Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that approximately one third of the total molecular weight of mature CD45 is contributed by carbohydrates, which vary qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the particular cell and isoform(s) expressed (3Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is identical among all isoforms and encodes two tandem PTP domains, at least one of which possesses intrinsic activity (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). A series of studies in CD45-deficient cell lines (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and, more recently, in CD45 gene-disrupted mice (4Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A. Kundig T.M. Kawai K. Wakeham A. Timms E.

May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) have revealed that CD45 functions as a key regulator of maturation and activation pathways in lymphocytes. One mechanism through which CD45 appears to function is by regulating the activity of various members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Despite the advances that have been made, questions remain regarding many aspects of the biology of CD45. For example, it is not known whether certain, as yet unidentified, factors are responsible for regulating the PTP activity of CD45, possibly by directing the subcellular localization of the phosphatase. It is also not clear whether, in addition to its ability to regulate Src family kinases, CD45 performs additional functions in hematopoietic cells distinct from, and possibly more general than, its ability to regulate cellular activation pathways.One means through which insight can potentially be gained into the regulation and function of CD45 is to identify molecules with which it physically interacts. Previously, we described a 116-kDa glycoprotein of unknown identity that specifically associates with CD45 in a wide variety of hematopoietic cells (6Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have now employed affinity chromatography to purify this protein along with an additional CD45-associated protein of 80 kDa. Amino acid microsequence analysis of these proteins, followed by molecular cloning, has revealed that they are the mouse homologues of two proteins that copurify with glucosidase II activity from rat liver microsomes (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The characterization of the association of these molecules with CD45 may provide insight into novel aspects of the biology of this complex glycoprotein.DISCUSSIONGlucosidase II is a neutral exo-glucohydrolase that localizes primarily to the ER and transitional elements (40Ginna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8814-8818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lucocq J.M. Brada D. Roth J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2137-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and is involved in the processing of N-linked triantennary core glycans following their co-translational transfer to nascent polypeptide chains. Glucosidase II acts in sequence after glucosidase I has cleaved the terminal, α-1,2-linked glucose (Glc) from protein-conjugated Glc3(mannose)9(N-acetylglucosamine)2to hydrolyze the inner two α-1,3-linked Glc units (42Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar). The activity of glucosidase II in the ER is counteracted by that of a UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which can add back a single Glc linkage to (mannose)9(N-acetylglucosamine)2(7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The opposing activities of these two enzymes has been accounted for in a “quality-control” model of ER processing, whereby incompletely folded proteins must present a monoglucose moiety to be recognized by the folding chaperone calnexin (43Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 44Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A.

By removing the first α-1,3-linked Glc, glucosidase II allows nascent polypeptides to interact with calnexin, and by removing the innermost Glc, it regulates the dissociation of folded proteins from calnexin and allows for their egress from the ER.The design of lengthy purification protocols allowed several groups to isolate glucosidase II and characterize its activity (15Burns D.M.

However, the molecular identity of this enzyme was not revealed until recently, when Trombetta et al. reported the results of exhaustive microsequence analysis of two proteins that copurify as a heterooligomer with glucosidase II activity from rat liver microsomes (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We now report the cloning of two homologous mouse cDNAs that encode proteins that copurify with the transmembrane PTP, CD45, in T cells.The larger of these proteins (116 kDa in mouse, 110 kDa in rat) is a molecule that we partially characterized as a tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane glycoprotein that physically associates with CD45 in a wide variety of hematopoietic cell lines (6Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our present work reveals that the cDNA sequence encodes a nascent protein with a mass of 109 kDa that shares 90% sequence identity with the product of an uncharacterized human ORF (GenBank accession number D42041) that lacks an initiation codon and 5′-flanking sequences. An internal region near the carboxyl termini of these mouse and human proteins contains considerable sequence identity to Family 31 glycosyl hydrolases, including a highly conserved catalytic consensus sequence. This observation, combined with the finding that disruption of a gene homologous to our cDNA in S. cerevisiae resulted in the complete loss of glucosidase II activity (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggests that the protein encoded by this cDNA is the catalytic unit of glucosidase II (GIIα). We have also been able to detect glucosidase II activity in CD45 and GIIβ but not in class I MHC immunoprecipitates (data not shown); however, in the absence of an antibody to the catalytic subunit, it is difficult to determine if the activity that we observe is significant.The mouse cDNA encoding the smaller protein that we copurified with CD45 and that was copurified with glucosidase II activity by Trombettaet al. (80 kDa in mouse, 90 kDa in rat) shares high sequence identity with a previously cloned human protein, termed 80K-H (11Sakai K. Hirai M. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Fukuyama R. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1989; 5: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and an unpublished bovine sequence (U49178). The human cDNA was originally isolated in an attempt to clone what appeared to be two major PKC substrates of 80 kDa, termed 80K-H (for “high”) and 80K-L (for “low”) based on their gel mobilities (48Hirai M. Shimizu N. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The clone isolated as 80K-H, however, proved to be a poor substrate for this kinase (48Hirai M. Shimizu N. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in contrast to the 80K-L protein, which was revealed to be the biochemically similar, but genetically distinct, myristylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (48Hirai M. Shimizu N. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Stumpo D.J. Graff J.M. Albert K.A. Greengard P. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14399-14405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the 80K-H protein was identified as one of several proteins in the 90-kDa molecular mass range to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to basic fibroblast growth factor (32Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Ong S.H. Siak C.B. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In conflict with these data implicating 80K-H in intracellular signal transduction cascades is information suggesting a role for this molecule as a cell-surface receptor or co-receptor on cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, conferring an ability to bind proteins modified by advanced glycation end products, a heterogeneous series of complex end-products resulting from the non-enzymatic reaction of free-amino groups of proteins with reducing sugars such as Glc (51Li Y.M. Mitsuhashi T. Wojciechowicz D. Shimizu N. Li J. Stitt A. He C. Banerjee D. Vlassara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11047-11052Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Added to this is the report from Trombetta et al. identifying 80K-H as the β-subunit of glucosidase II, based on the finding that GIIα and GIIβ exist as a heterooligomer and are refractory to biochemical separation (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Although it is not yet possible to completely resolve these diverse observations, a number of clues to the localization of this molecule emerge from analysis of its cDNA sequence. Highly revealing is the fact that 80K-H possesses a hydrophobic signal sequence that is cleaved at the same position in the mouse protein as in the human and rat proteins identified in the studies described above (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Sakai K. Hirai M. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Fukuyama R. Shimizu N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since the mature protein lacks a transmembrane domain, this implies that the protein initially enters the secretory pathway. Also present in 80K-H, and conserved among mouse, human, and bovine, is a carboxyl-terminal HDEL tetrapeptide. This sequence has been shown to interact with a membrane receptor that functions to continually retrieve from the Golgi and return to the ER proteins containing specific carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptides (33Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of the HDEL tetrapeptide found in ER proteins has been shown to favor the secretory pathway (34Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 80K-H has in common with other ER proteins a highly acidic region that may bind Ca2+ at low affinity, forming a “zipper” structure linking ER proteins in a loose matrix (36Fliegel L. Ohnishi M. Carpenter M.R. Khanna V.K. Reithmeier R.A.F. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Smith M.J. Koch G.L.E.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 80K-H also possesses a pair of 12-amino acid motifs that may form two interacting helix-loop-helix EF-hand structures (39Kretsinger R.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Such motifs have been shown to coordinate Ca2+ in other ER proteins, and may allow for conformational regulation by Ca2+ levels or confer a buffering capacity on the protein (34Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, 80K-H possesses a polar distribution of conserved Cys residues and possesses intrachain disulfide linkages (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations are consistent with 80K-H residing in the ER lumen.Our biochemical data fit best with the suggestion by Trombettaet al. that 80K-H represents the β-subunit of glucosidase II. We have shown that the 80-kDa protein co-purifies with GIIα and a major cellular glycoprotein. Moreover, we have found that the 80-kDa protein can associate with glucosidase II activity in the absence of detectable CD45 (data not shown). Although GIIβ does not appear to be necessary for GIIα catalytic function (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Hino Y. Rothman J.E.

Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it may be capable of modulating the activity of the holoenzyme. Additionally, it may function to retain the α-subunit in association with the lumenal face of the ER membrane. If correct, this could explain why an 80–90-kDa protein was consistently observed to be present in GIIαpreparations after exhaustive purification steps (7Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Hino Y. Rothman J.E.

Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and also help reconcile the ability of GIIα to partition to the membrane fraction as a non-integral protein (6Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that GIIβ (80K-H) has been purified in the apparent absence of the larger catalytic subunit (11Sakai K. Hirai M. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Fukuyama R. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1989; 5: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Yang Z. Makita Z. Horii Y. Brunelle S. Cerami A. Sehajpal P. Suthanthiran M. Vlassara H. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our data do not exclude the possibility that 80K-H may adhere to a cell-surface protein(s) in certain cell types, where it may contribute to the binding of proteins modified by advanced glycation end products. The basis for detecting an admittedly small subpopulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated 80K-H in a previous study, however, is unclear (32Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Ong S.H. Siak C.B. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); we have been unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein in response T-cell receptor-stimulation of CTL clone cells (data not shown).An important question arising from our study is why are we able to copurify glucosidase II with CD45. Our evidence that the interaction between glucosidase II and CD45 is dependent on high mannose triantennary core oligosaccharide linkages supports the hypothesis that glucosidase II interacts with immature CD45 that presumably contains terminal α-1,3 Glc linkages. The simplest explanation for our results is that GIIα and GIIβ interact with CD45 in the same way that they do with all immature glycoproteins; however, because CD45 is a highly expressed, multivalent ligand, we are able to detect the association. Nevertheless, our observations that we are unable to copurify glucosidase II with class I MHC molecules or detect the association of these ER proteins with class I molecules by blotting or enzymatic assay, suggest that there may be something special about the way in which glucosidase II interacts with CD45. Moreover, it is notable that we failed to copurify detectable levels of any other enzyme or receptor that recognizes oligosaccharides present on CD45, or any other ER chaperone molecule that interacts with CD45.It is also possible that our data may relate to novel aspects of CD45 maturation or function. That maturation of CD45 is highly unconventional in some cell types is revealed by a report demonstrating the presence of high mannose triantennary oligosaccharide linkages on cell-surface CD45 derived from immature thymocytes (52Uemura K. Yokota Y. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has further been noted that in a resting T-cell line approximately 30% of total cellular CD45 is retained in the cis-Golgi (53Minami Y. Stafford F.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9222-9230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within minutes of activating this cell with anti-Thy-1, this intracellular pool of CD45 was found to disperse, partitioning to an insoluble intracellular fraction. It is tempting to speculate that a novel function of glucosidase II may be to target and/or retain a portion of newly synthesized CD45, possibly in a transitional ER compartment. It is not clear whether the PTP activity of the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 may be required to perform a function in this particular subcellular microenvironment; however, it is interesting that the cytosolic phosphatase, PTP1B, has been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (54Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In addition, tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors can block vesicular transport (55Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Also intriguing, particularly in view of the fact that GIIβ may bind Ca2+, is a report detailing defects in regulation of intracellular Ca2+ by cells deficient in CD45 (56Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. Yamada H. June C.H. Dumont F.J. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and another indicating that re-distribution of intracellular pools of CD45 correlates with changes in the ability of T cells to liberate Ca2+ from internal stores (57Shivnan E. Clayton L. Alldridge L. Keating K.E. Gullberg M. Alexander D.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigation of the interactions between CD45 and glucosidase II may provide novel insights into the functions of these molecules. CD45 is a high molecular mass (∼180-∼220 kDa) transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; DOC, sodium deoxycholate; Endo, endoglycosidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GII, glucosidase II; kb, kilobase(s); H-LAG, human lysosomal α-glucosidase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; ORF, open reading frame; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; DOC, sodium deoxycholate; Endo, endoglycosidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GII, glucosidase II; kb, kilobase(s); H-LAG, human lysosomal α-glucosidase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; ORF, open reading frame; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase.expressed in abundance on all cells of hematopoietic lineage (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Although CD45 is encoded by a single gene, alternative splicing of the mRNA allows for the generation of at least eight distinct isoforms of the molecule based on variable usage of exons 4–6, which encode a region of the amino-terminal ectodomain. Of particular interest, and experimental utility, is the observation that these isoforms are expressed in a cell type-specific and differentiation stage-specific manner. The variable exon repertoire expressed by different isoforms is known to greatly influence the charge properties of CD45 since the region encoded by these exons contains multiple sites forO-linked glycosylation (2Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD45 also possesses 11–18 putative N-linked glycosylation sites, which are subject to cell-specific controls, conferring further microheterogeneity upon CD45 (3Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that approximately one third of the total molecular weight of mature CD45 is contributed by carbohydrates, which vary qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the particular cell and isoform(s) expressed (3Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is identical among all isoforms and encodes two tandem PTP domains, at least one of which possesses intrinsic activity (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). A series of studies in CD45-deficient cell lines (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev.

May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) have revealed that CD45 functions as a key regulator of maturation and activation pathways in lymphocytes. One mechanism through which CD45 appears to function is by regulating the activity of various members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Despite the advances that have been made, questions remain regarding many aspects of the biology of CD45. For example, it is not known whether certain, as yet unidentified, factors are responsible for regulating the PTP activity of CD45, possibly by directing the subcellular localization of the phosphatase. It is also not clear whether, in addition to its ability to regulate Src family kinases, CD45 performs additional functions in hematopoietic cells distinct from, and possibly more general than, its ability to regulate cellular activation pathways. One means through which insight can potentially be gained into the regulation and function of CD45 is to identify molecules with which it physically interacts. Previously, we described a 116-kDa glycoprotein of unknown identity that specifically associates with CD45 i"

These findings are compounded further now by the enzyme's apparent association with the nucleolus of the cell and its state of phosphorylation, as will be described in this paper. In addition we will provide evidence that TS may be located also in the mitochondria of cells as has been described recently for a bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase·TS plant enzyme (14Neuburger M.

Attempts to establish the intracellular location of TS have been inconclusive since depending on the technique and cells used, TS has been shown to be associated either with the nucleus (16Brown S.S.

Liang C.-M. Henry S. Chabner B.A. Allegra C.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6668-6676PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent antibody studies by us some 10 years ago using human TS antibody 2W. A. Samsonoff, G. Maley, and F. Maley, unpublished observations. 2W. A. Samsonoff, G. Maley, and F. Maley, unpublished observations. indicated that the enzyme was present mainly within the nucleus of the HeLa cell, but could not be confirmed with H35 hepatoma cells. More recently by using a similar technique with yeast the enzyme was shown to be localized to the nuclear periphery (20Poon P.-P. Storms R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8341-8347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To more clearly define the enzyme's location within a eukaryote, we will demonstrate, using immunogold electron microscopy and autoradiography, the nuclear and nucleolar presence of TS in a rat hepatoma (H35) cell line. The fixation of cells and the labeling procedures used for the localization of the TS antigen after first treating the cells with a purified anti-TS rabbit antibody then with an IgG secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with 5 nm colloidal gold, Janssen Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) were essentially as described in the instructions provided by Janssen and by Hechemy et al. (21Hechemy K. Fox J. Samsonoff W.A. Anacker R. Silverman D. Eisemann C. Green I.S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 377-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TS antigen was purified to homogeneity (22Rhee M.S. Balinksa M. Bunni M. Priest D.G. Maley G.F. Maley F. Galivan J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3979-3984PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 mg injected as an emulsion with Freund's complete adjuvant several times along the midline region of a rabbit's spine. After 2 weeks antibody production was boosted with another 0.5 mg of TS in saline that was injected into the rabbit's hind legs intramuscularly and neck pad. After two more weeks 50 ml of blood was removed and allowed to clot. The TS antibody (IgG) was purified from the rabbit serum by CM-Affi-Gel blue chromatography (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gold particles were counted on electron micrographs (final magnification × 45,000). Cell areas were determined by overlaying each micrograph with a calibrated lattice of known size, and underlying areas were determined for each cell compartment. The density of gold label is defined as the number of gold particles encountered per square micron of surface counted. H35S (FdUrd-sensitive) and H35R (FdUrd-resistant) cells (6 × 104 in 12 ml of Swim's medium containing 5% human serum 10% fetal bovine serum) were grown for 43 h in 100-mm plates in a CO2 incubator, after which 8 ml of medium was removed from each plate. Folinic acid was added to a final concentration of 100 μm to the remaining 4 ml, while [6-3H]FdUrd (22 Ci/mmol), DuPont NEN) was added to a final concentration of 0.26 μm. The plates were incubated for an additional 4 h, washed three times with media and incubated for 4 h with fresh Swim's media. At the end of this period, the cells were fixed with 2 ml of Trump's fixative for 15 min and washed two additional times with 5 ml of fixative. The plates were then incubated overnight at 40 °C and the cells gently scraped off the Petri dishes and centrifuged, followed by rinsing in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. After a secondary fixation for 30 min at room temperature in a solution of 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, the pellets were embedded in agar, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Epon/Oraldite. Sections of 0.1 μm were collected on carbon-coated grids, and autoradiographic emulsions were prepared essentially as described by Caro and van Tubergen (23Caro L.G. van Tubergen R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1962; 15: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Grids were post-stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate (24Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (17591) Google Scholar) and examined in a Zeiss 910 transmission electron microscope at 100 kv. H35S and H35R cells were grown in Swim's medium to about 90% confluence in one to three roller bottles and harvested with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% versene. The cells were added to an equal volume of Swim's medium and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm followed by washing with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The centrifuged cells were resuspended in 4 ml of isolation buffer (230 mm mannitol, 70 mmsucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The cells were then homogenized and centrifuged in a 15-ml plastic centrifuge tube at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C using a Sorvall GLC-2B centrifuge. The supernatant fraction after transferring to another tube was recentrifuged at 20,000 × g in a Sorvall RC-2B centrifuge for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of isolation buffer and recentrifuged. Alternatively, mitochondria were purified by isopycnic centrifugation as described by Rickwood et al.(25Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usman V.M. Darley-Usman V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 1-6Google Scholar). In either case, the final mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 1 ml of STE (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of STE and sonicated for 7 s in an ethanol/ice bath and centrifuged as above. Alternatively, the mitochondria were suspended in cold water and after lysis the membranous fraction was centrifuged, as above, in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Ternary complexes containing [32P]FdUMP were obtained by a slight modification of the procedure of Maley et al. (26Maley F. Lane J.P. Changchien L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as follows: to 8 μl of H35R cell extract, mitochondrial supernatant fraction, or purified recombinant rat TS (27Ciesla J. Weiner K.X.B. Weiner R.S. Reston J.T. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was added 1 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 3 μl of a 1.6 mm (R,S)-CH2H4PteGlu solution (26Maley F. Lane J.P. Changchien L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 3 μl of 0.1 m cytidine 5′-monophosphate, and 5 μl of [32P]FdUMP (1.1 × 106dpm). After incubating at room temperature for 30 min the reactions were stopped with an equal volume of SDS-loading buffer and boiled for 3 min. Half of the sample was subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE for 1 h at 180 volts. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film for 15–60 min at room temperature. H35R rat hepatoma cells were grown in Swim's medium as above on 60-mm tissue culture plates for 24 h prior to labeling. The cells, which were at 80% confluence at this time, were washed 3 × with 2 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and were then incubated with 2 ml of phosphate-free DMEM, at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 1 h. The media were replaced with 1.5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum (1.5 ml/plate) and 120 μCi of 32Pi, which was incubated in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 4 h. The plates were washed four times with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and the cells lysed in 0.5 ml of a modified RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) on ice with gentle rocking for 30 min. The lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, which were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf 5415 centrifuge. The supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, to which were added 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% slurry in modified RIPA), incubated for 1 h, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. To the supernatant fractions transferred to fresh tubes was added 10 μl of rabbit anti-rat TS serum, and after incubation on ice for 1 h, 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to each tube, which were shaken for 1 h. The beads were centrifuged and washed four times with 200 μl of modified RIPA, then resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Each supernatant fraction (10 μl) was loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and after 1 h at 175 volts, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, followed by destaining and drying onto Whatman No. 3MM paper. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 1–3 days at −70 °C using an enhancing screen. H35R cells were grown for 24 h as described above. The medium was removed, and the plates were rinsed with a buffer solution containing 0.25m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgSO4. The cells from six plates were scraped off with the above buffer, but containing 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and sonicated for 10 s in an ethanol/ice bath. Aliquots of the sonicates (0.28 ml) were added to each Eppendorf tube with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The incubations, conducted at room temperature, were terminated at various times by the addition of 1 μmol of cold ATP, which so diluted the [γ-32P]ATP to effectively end the measurable incorporation of labeled phosphate into the protein acceptors. The cellular debris was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, where they were treated with 7 μl of rabbit anti-rat TS serum for 1 h on ice, followed by 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h on ice. Earlier studies by us using fluorescent guinea pig antibody to HeLa cell TS, as well as immunogold electron microscopy, strongly implicated the association of TS with the nucleus.2 However, attempts to repeat these studies by exposing H35S cells to rat TS fluorescent antibody were inconclusive, mainly due to the difference in membrane permeability of the two cell lines. Since we had available to us much larger quantities of rat TS (22Rhee M.S. Balinksa M. Bunni M. Priest D.G. Maley G.F. Maley F. Galivan J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3979-3984PubMed Google Scholar) than HeLa TS for the preparation of antibody, we explored the use of immunogold secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) fixation to rabbit anti-rat TS antibody following treatment of H35S cells with the latter. Fig. 1 A reveals that little or no gold particles could be detected when the cells were exposed to nonspecific IgG. In contrast, when the H35S cells were treated with purified anti-TS IgG, a major share of the immunogold particles were found to be localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1 B) with most of the particles being associated with the nucleolus (Fig. 1 C). The nuclear distribution of the particles could be partially blocked if the antibody was first treated with H35 TS, verifying the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 2). That the nuclear (nucleolar) association of the TS antibody was not a random event was verified by measuring a statistically significant number of immunogold particles in a large number of areas inside, as well as outside of the cell (Fig. 2). However, because of the uniqueness of these findings and the possibility that the results of Fig. 1 were a consequence of the technology employed and did not truly represent what was observed, a more direct approach was sought, that of autoradiography.Figure 2Distribution of TS-directed immunogold particles in H35S cells, which is typified by the results in Fig.1. The density of gold particles in each cell compartment was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” A minimum of 20 cells was counted in each of five experiments, with the standard deviations given by the error bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To unambiguously confirm the immunogold results a biochemical approach was taken, that of exposing the cells to [6-3H]FdUrd and leucovorin, which in the case of the former compound will be converted to [6-3H]FdUMP once in the cell, while the latter is metabolized to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate. Both compounds then combine with TS to form a tight ternary complex, which is the basis, in most cases, of the chemotherapeutic response to fluorouracil or FdUrd (28Ulman B. Lee M. Martin Jr., D.W. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although leucovorin was added to make certain the folate pool was not limiting, it was found in most instances that the concentration of this pool was adequate. After thorough washing of the cells to remove unbound [6-3H]FdUrd, it was hoped that the location of the TS complex within the cell would be revealed on autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3 A, most of the labeled ternary complex resided in the nucleus of the H35S cells and, similar to the immunogold electron micrographs of Fig. 1, appears to be localized primarily to the nucleolar region. Since the possibility existed that the nucleolar presence of the label was due to the breakdown of FdUrd to fluorouracil and its subsequent incorporation into nucleolar RNA, this experiment was repeated in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled uracil or deoxyuridine. No dilution of the radioactivity was apparent, indicating that incorporation into RNA was not the source of the label within the cell (data not shown). In addition, SDS-PAGE of H35S and H35R cells treated as described in Fig.3, followed by autoradiography, revealed that all of the radioactivity was associated with the FdUMP·TS ternary complex with none of the label at the origin, which would be indicative of RNA (data not presented). In an attempt to increase the immunogold particles and labeled ternary complexes within the cell, an FdUrd-resistant cell line (H35R) that contained 50–100-fold greater levels of TS than the FdUrd-sensitive line (H35S) (22Rhee M.S. Balinksa M. Bunni M. Priest D.G. Maley G.F. Maley F. Galivan J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3979-3984PubMed Google Scholar) was employed. In contrast to the findings with the H35S cell line (Fig. 3 A), the H35R cells revealed that although some radioactivity was in the nucleus, most of the ternary complex was spread throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B). It is of interest to note that the morphology of the two cell lines differed in that the H35R cells are larger than the H35S cells. It should be emphasized though that the level of TS found in dividing cells in culture and in tissues, both normal and neoplastic, is more like that found in H35S than H35R, that is quite low. As in the case of the immunogold studies, these findings were reproduced in numerous autoradiographs where it was possible to easily distinguish between H35S and H35R cells. As a consequence of recent findings suggesting the presence of TS in plant mitochondria as a dihydrofolate reductase·TS bifunctional complex (14Neuburger M. Réberllé F. Jourdain A. Nakamura S. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the presence of a dUTPase in rat liver mitochondria, we extensively purified mitochondria from H35S and H35R cells by the same procedure used for dUTPase (15Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and found considerable TS activity in the latter relative to the former using a sensitive tritium release assay (29Roberts D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3546-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To confirm the assay, we incubated mitochondrial extracts with [32P] FdUMP and CH2H4PteGlu, and as shown in Fig.4, mitochondria do indeed contain TS as evidenced by their ability to form a ternary complex. To demonstrate that the enzyme was not associated with the mitochondrial membranes, lysis of the mitochondria in water followed by centrifugation to remove the membranous fraction revealed TS to be present mainly in the supernatant fraction. As in the case of the dUTPase (15Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), TS appears to be imported, since evidence for a sequence in mitochondrial DNA, which hybridizes to the rat TS cDNA could not be detected, although it is possible that the mitochondrial TS sequence, if it does exist, is sufficiently different from the genomic DNA that it does not hybridize to mitochondrial TS DNA. However, based on the high degree of evolutionary homology of the various TSs described to date (2Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), this would appear to be unlikely. In view of the fact that many proteins, in particularly those associated with the regulation of cell division are phosphorylated (30Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar), we examined this possibility for TS. H35R cells were incubated with32Pi, and the TS present within the cells was extracted with antibody specific for rat TS using protein A. As shown in the SDS-PAGE autoradiogram (Fig. 5), the TS extracted from the cells was labeled with 32Pi (Fig. 5,lane 2), but no label was present in this region when nonspecific serum was used (Fig. 5, lane 1). In the presence of increasing amounts of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatases, the amount of label associated with TS appeared to increase (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4), while the addition of staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, blocked TS labeling completely (Fig. 5, lane 5). To verify the results in Fig. 5, we determined if the apparent phosphorylation of TS that was occurring in situ could be measured in cellular extracts. It is apparent from the results in Fig. 6 that a kinase is present in the extracts that transferred 32P from [γ-32P]ATP to a specific site on the TS present in the extracts. For the purpose of measuring potential kinase activity, we used H35R cells rather than H35S cells, since a much greater quantity of TS is present in extracts from these cells, which did not require the addition of TS as a substrate. To reduce the background and to basically terminate the transfer of 32P, a large excess of cold ATP was added at the indicated times in Fig. 6, which appeared to have the desired effect of ending measurable incorporation of radioactivity into protein. It is clear from the results in Fig. 6 that the transfer is time-dependent. Preliminary results indicate that at least one serine in the enzyme is phosphorylated. Numerous proteins, particularly those associated with cell division, have been found in the past decade to be associated with the nucleus. Even before these more recent developments, TS was reported to be present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells as part of a “replitase” complex consisting of enzymes involved mainly in providing substrates for DNA synthesis (17Reddy G.P.V. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3312-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), although the cytoplasmic location of TS has also been reported (18Kucera R. Paulus H. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 167: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Johnston P.G. Liang C.-M. Henry S. Chabner B.A. Allegra C.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6668-6676PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in this paper by both immunogold labeling and autoradiography that not only is TS associated with the nucleus of H35S cells, it is located predominantly in the nucleolus. It was hoped that cells selected for their resistance to FdUrd (H35R), as a result of a 50–100-fold increase in TS, would show an even greater nuclear content of TS. However, much to our surprise, when these cells were examined by autoradiography to locate TS by means of ternary complex formation, most of the TS was found in the cytoplasm, although some was still in the nucleus. It should be emphasized that the presence of such high concentrations of TS in H35R cells is not encountered normally, since TS, even in actively dividing cells, can be detected only by a sensitive tritium release assay (29Roberts D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3546-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme can be measured easily in H35R cell extracts using a spectrophotometric assay (26Maley F. Lane J.P. Changchien L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This massive level of TS in the cytoplasm of H35R cells is also associated with an altered morphology in that these cells appear to be considerably larger than the H35S cells. It is not known at this time whether the morphologic differences are associated with an apparent impaired transport of TS to the nucleus. Even so, it is not obvious how TS is directed to the nucleus, since it does not possess a typical nuclear localization signal (31Silver P.A. Keegan L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although there are three sites in the protein sequence of human, mouse, and rat TS (27Ciesla J. Weiner K.X.B. Weiner R.S. Reston J.T. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with three to four basic residues within a seven- to eight-amino acid peptide sequence that could serve this purpose. Alternatively, the enzyme might be chaperoned into the nucleus by a protein similar to that described recently for the Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins (32Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that dUTPase, like TS, although associated with the nucleus, does not contain a characteristic nuclear localization signal either (15Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Ladner R.D. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. McNulty D.E. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7752-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Other properties that dUTPase and TS share relate to their presence in mitochondria and their state of phosphorylation. It is possible that the mitochondrial location of TS is due to the nonspecific adherence of TS to the surface of the mitochondria, but the extensive washing procedure employed would appear to mitigate against this possibility, as well as our recent finding that the enzyme can be released on hypotonic lysis of the mitochondria.3 Preliminary results reveal that the H35 TS is labeled on a serine, as has been found also for dUTPase (33Ladner R.D. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. McNulty D.E. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7752-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because of these common properties of TS and dUTPase, it would not be unreasonable to assume that the two enzymes reside in the same regions of the cell, possibly in the proposed replitase complex (12Noguchi H. Reddy G.P.V. Pardee A.B. Cell. 1983; 32: 443-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, extracts of H35 cells contain a kinase (5Matthews D.A. Villafranca J.E. Janson C.A. Smith W.W. Welsh K. Freer S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that phosphorylates TS. More recently, to test TS's susceptibility to phosphorylation, we have found such kinases as protein kinase C and calmodulin kinase to phosphorylate recombinant rat TS quite well, and with a fair degree of specificity, as several other proteins including E. coli TS, were not phosphorylated. 3J. Reston and F. Maley, unpublished data. A function for the phosphorylation of TS, if any, is not known, although based on similar studies, it has been shown that phosphorylation can affect the stability, the activity, and even the location of a protein (34Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As shown recently in the case of MADR2, its nuclear accumulation and signaling depend on it being phosphorylated (35Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be an isolated case as more and more instances are being reported on the influence of protein phosphorylation on the cellular location of various proteins (34Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Lyon C.E. Bohmann K. Sleeman J. Lamond A.I. Exp. Cell.

It is interesting to note that only the nuclear form of dUTPase is also phosphorylated (33Ladner R.D. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. McNulty D.E. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7752-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whether a similar case can be made for TS remains to be determined. In a similar vein, questions can be raised regarding the function of TS in the nucleus of the cell and even more so the purpose of its nucleolar presence. Since TS has been shown to interact with its own mRNA to regulate its translation (9Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C. Chabner B.A. Elwood P.C. Zinn S. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8977-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), as well as that of c-myc RNA (38Chu E. Takechi T. Jones K.L. Voeller D.M. Capur S.M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Segal S. Allegra C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is possible that what is observed in the autoradiographic patterns (Fig. 3 A) is an association of TS with its mRNA or pre-mRNA or possibly its association with a replitase complex (17Reddy G.P.V. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3312-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As far as the mitochondrial location of TS, mitochondrial DNA must be maintained, and since TS is involved in providing a substrate for the synthesis and repair of DNA, this could very well be its function. In any event it would appear from the data presented here that the functional role of TS may be more complex than merely serving as a provider of dTMP. A preliminary account of these findings has been presented (39Reston J. Samsonoff W.A. McKee M. O'Connor B. Galivan J. Maley G. Maley F. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1996; 37: 493Google Scholar).

We find that Spc3p is also required for cell growth and signal peptidase activity within the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Amino-terminal signal sequences of proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 are cleaved by a membrane-bound endoprotease termed signal peptidase (1Milstein C. Brownlee G.G. Harrison T.M. Matthews M.B. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). This enzyme has also been shown to catalyze the proteolytic fragmentation of some abnormal membrane proteins, thereby leading to their degradation (3Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J.

Isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ER signal peptidase (SP) contains four nonidentical protein subunits (5YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sec11p (17 kDa) is required for signal peptide cleavage (8Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and signal peptidase-dependent protein degradation (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sec11p is related to two subunits of the mammalian SPC (SPC18 and SPC21) (9Greenburg G. Shelness G.S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Sec11p, the Spc1p (11 kDa) and Spc2p (18 kDa) subunits of the yeast SPC are nonessential for cell growth and enzyme activity (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Spc1p and Spc2p, however, perform auxiliary and nonredundant roles. Spc1p facilitates signal peptide cleavages in cells burdened with high levels of a membrane protein substrate of the signal peptidase-dependent protein degradation pathway (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Spc2p is important for enzyme activity and cell viability at elevated temperatures (7Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Spc1p and Spc2p are homologous to mammalian subunits SPC12 and SPC25, respectively (6Fang H.

Despite the fact that a multisubunit signal peptidase has been purified from yeast and mammalian cells, enzymes exhibiting less subunit complexity have been identified in other systems. Leader peptidase from the inner membrane of E. coli consists of a single polypeptide chain (13Zwizinski C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7973-7977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein exhibits limited homology to Sec11p and to mammalian SPC18 and SPC21 (14Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Signal peptidase purified from hen oviduct contains two subunits, one related to Sec11p and a second related to SPC22/23 of the mammalian SPC (16Baker R.K. Lively M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8561-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Shelness G.S. Kanwar Y.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have cloned and characterized theSPC3 gene encoding the yeast homolog to mammalian SPC22/23. We find that, as with Sec11p, Spc3p is essential for signal peptide cleavage and signal peptidase-dependent protein degradation. Our data are thus in agreement with in vitrostudies, using an avian system, which show that a two-subunit complex functions to cleave signal peptides. The idea that both Sec11p and Spc3p are related to the prokaryotic signal peptidase is also discussed. Plasmid pSPC3 bearing SPC3 was isolated from a high copy (2 μm) plasmid library marked with LEU2 (American Type Culture Collection ATCC No. 37323). Among 5,500 transformants of strain CMYD1 (sec11–7) (genotypes of yeast strains are listed in Table I), pSPC3 was isolated from one colony that grew at 32 °C. The SPC3 gene was amplified from pSPC3 by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward oligonucleotide primer CGGGATCCACACGTGAATACTACC, which is located 204 bp upstream of the SPC3 start codon, and the reverse primer CGGAATTCAATAAATGGGAACAG, which is located 189 bp downstream of theSPC3 stop codon. The amplified fragment was restricted withBamHI and EcoRI and inserted into low-copy (CEN) plasmid pRS314 (TRP1) (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was named pHF332. A 1.5-kb HindIII-XbaI restriction fragment containing the SPC3 gene was excised from plasmid pSPC3 and inserted into 2 μm plasmid pRS426 (URA3) (22Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar).

Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11449) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was restricted with NheI, which cuts 30 bp upstream of the SPC3 open reading frame, andSpeI, which cuts 3 bp downstream of the stop codon ofSPC3, and the SPC3 gene was replaced with a 1.6-kb NheI DNA fragment containing the LEU2gene. This NheI fragment was obtained from a modified YDp-L plasmid (24Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.-A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) that contains LEU2 flanked by twoNheI sites (a NheI linker was inserted at theSmaI site of YDp-L). This construct containing a replacement of SPC3 with the LEU2 gene was restricted withHindIII and XbaI and transformed into diploid strain SEY6210.5 with selection for leucine prototrophs. Transformants bearing a replacement of the SPC3 gene with theLEU2 gene were confirmed by genomic PCR using oligonucleotide primers described above. For construction of a frameshift mutation in SPC3, the single BglII site of pHF331 (located at codons 80–82 of SPC3) was restricted and then filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and ligated. For construction of temperature-sensitive mutations, the plasmid pSPC3 was used as a template for PCR under conditions that favor misincorporation of dNTPs by Taq polymerase (25Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique ( Phila. ). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The above described oligonucleotide primers located upsteam and downstream of theSPC3 gene were used. After 30 cycles of DNA amplification, the PCR product was restricted with BamHI andEcoRI and cloned into the polylinker of plasmid pRS314 (CEN6 TRP1). The resulting plasmids carrying a pool of mutagenized SPC3 genes were transformed into strain HFY405 (Δspc3)/pHF331 (2 μm SPC3 URA3), and transformants were subjected to the plasmid shuffle technique (26Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). From 200 transformants, four temperature-sensitive mutants containing plasmids pHF333 (CEN6 spc3–1 TRP1), pHF334 (CEN6 spc3–2 TRP1), pHF335 (CEN6 spc3–3 TRP1), and pHF336 (CEN6 spc3–4 TRP1) were isolated. To confirm that the temperature-sensitive phenotype was plasmid linked, each of the plasmids was purified and transformed into strain HFY405/pHF331, using plasmid shuffling to replace pHF331 with each of the transformed plasmids. The spc3–4 mutation was integrated into the SPC3chromosomal locus using methods described previously (27Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4951-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). TheBamHI-EcoRI fragment containing thespc3–4 gene from pHF336 was inserted into plasmid pRS306 (URA3) (22Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was restricted withNheI. Linear DNA was transformed into haploid strains SEY6210 and SEY6211. A Ura+ transformant of each strain was placed on a minimal agar plate supplemented appropriately (28Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (1 mg/ml). After several days of incubation at 23 °C, colonies were picked and tested for growth at 37 °C. From this analysis, temperature-sensitive strains were detected at a frequency of ∼50%. Plasmid pSPC3 was introduced into representative temperature-sensitive strains to test for complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth defect. The resulting temperature-sensitive strains used in this study were named HFY406 (MATα spc3–4) and HFY407 (MATa spc3–4). In a previous study, we observed that overexpression of Spc1p suppressed a mutational defect in Sec11p (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A similar approach was thus employed in a search for the yeast homolog to mammalian SPC subunit SPC22/23 (Experimental Procedures). In this analysis, pSPC3 was isolated from a high-copy (2 μm) plasmid library through the ability of this plasmid to suppress the growth defect of strain CMYD1 (sec11–7) (Fig. 1 A). As shown below, the plasmid pSPC3 bears the gene encoding the yeast homolog of SPC22/23. Fig. 1 A also depicts the growth of strain CMYD1 carrying high copy plasmid pSPC1, which contains the SPC1gene (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The data show that pSPC1 suppressed the sec11mutation at a higher temperature than pSPC3. DNA sequencing at one end of the chromosomal fragment contained within pSPC3 revealed a match to a sequence on chromosome XII. The identified sequence was that of PET309, which encodes a protein required for stability and translation of COX1 mitochondrial mRNA (29Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Among the open reading frames present nearPET309, we identified an uncharacterized gene that we have named SPC3 (accession no.Z73238). 2Ellen Beasley (Stanford University) independently registered the SPC3 gene in theSaccharomyces genome data base under the nameSPY2. To determine whetherSPC3 suppressed sec11–7, a frameshift mutation was constructed at codon 82 of the SPC3 gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). The high copy plasmid bearing frame-shifted SPC3 did not suppress the growth defect of strain CMYD1 (sec11–7) at 32 °C. The control plasmid containing wild-type SPC3 suppressed the sec11–7mutation. To determine if SPC3 also suppresses the signal peptidase defect seen in sec11 mutant cells, strains CMYD1 (sec11) and CMYD1/pSPC3 were subjected to a pulse-chase analysis using methods described previously (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to log phase at 23 °C, shifted to 32 °C for 30 min, pulse labeled for 5 min with 35S-EXPRESS, and chased for 30 min in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine, and proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with antibodies directed against ER resident Kar2p (30Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 31Rose M. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the precursor of Kar2p was converted to mature Kar2p to a greater extent insec11 mutant cells containing pSPC3 than in sec11cells lacking pSPC3 (compare lanes 1 and 3). Overexpression of the SPC3 gene thus partially corrected the signal peptide cleavage defect in the sec11 mutant. Primary amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the product of theSPC3 gene, Spc3p, exhibited 55% similarity and 22% identity to SPC22/23 of the mammalian SPC (Fig. 2). These measurements are similar to the homologies shared between Spc1p and Spc2p and their mammalian counterparts (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Spc3p is also related to the SPC22/23 homolog (18Newsome A. McLean J.W. Lively M.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) present in the two-subunit avian SPC (54% similarity, 24% identity). Spc3p is nonhomologous, however, to Sec11p, Spc1p, and Spc2p. Hydropathy analysis of Spc3p and SPC22/23 (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17095) Google Scholar) identified a single hydrophobic stretch of amino acids located near the amino termini of the respective proteins. This region in SPC22/23 has, indeed, been shown to span the ER membrane (33Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated molecular masses of SPC22/23 (20.3 kDa) and Spc3p (21.3 kDa) as well as the isoelectric points, 8.8 for SPC22/23 and 8.6 for Spc3p, are similar. Heterozygous disruption of the SPC3 gene was accomplished in diploid strain SEY6210.5 through replacement of SPC3 with the LEU2 marker (see “Experimental Procedures”). Genomic PCR analysis was used to confirm the heterozygous disruption of SPC3 in Leu+ transformants of strain SEY6210.5 (data not shown). The heterozygote was sporulated, and the spores generated were examined using tetrad analysis. Dissection of 10 tetrads revealed only two viable spores from each tetrad. All recovered strains were leucine auxotrophs, suggesting cells bearing the spc3 null mutation were inviable. The requirement of SPC3 for cell growth was confirmed by introducing plasmid pHF331 (SPC3 URA3) into above described strain SEY6210.5 containing a heterozygous disruption of theSPC3 gene. Tetrad analysis of this transformant yielded four viable spores from each of five tetrads examined. Two spores from each tetrad were Leu+ Ura+. Colonies were not recovered upon placement of the Leu+ Ura+ cells on agar plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, a chemical used to select for yeast cells cured of plasmids bearing the URA3gene (34Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The requirement of SPC3 for cell growth was circumvented in further biochemical studies through the generation of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in the SPC3 gene. Using a PCR-based method of nucleotide misincorporation (see “Experimental Procedures”), mutant alleles spc3–1, spc3–2, spc3–3, and spc3–4 were generated. The spc3–3 mutant failed to grow at 32 °C, whereas the nonpermissive temperature for the remaining mutants was 37 °C. We screened cells containing these mutations in an attempt to identify at least one allele that rapidly inhibited Spc3p function following a shift of mutant cells to their nonpermissive temperatures. Strain HFY405 (Δspc3) bearing a series of plasmids containing these mutations (plasmids are described in “Experimental Procedures”) was grown to log phase at 23 °C, then shifted to 37 °C for the time intervals indicated in Fig.3. Cell extracts were examined by Western blotting using anti-Kar2p antibodies. Significant amounts of preKar2p accumulated in the spc3–3 and spc3–4 mutants after a 30-min incubation at their nonpermissive temperature (lanes 8–9). Increasing levels of preKar2p appeared in these cells after 1 h (lanes 12 and 13) and 2 h (lanes 16 and 17). In contrast, the spc3–1 andspc3–2 mutants exhibited a modest defect in the cleavage of preKar2p even after 2 h at the nonpermissive temperature (lanes 14 and 15). Furthermore, the nonpermissive temperature for the spc3–4 mutant (37 °C) was higher than the sec11–7 mutant (32 °C), a difference that made it possible to follow both mutations in genetic crosses. For these reasons, the spc3–4 mutation was chosen for further study. A pulse labeling analysis (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was employed to more accurately measure signal peptide cleavage in the spc3–4 mutant. Strain HFY405 (Δspc3) bearing pHF336 (CEN6 spc3–4 TRP1) or control plasmid pHF332 (CEN6 SPC3 TRP1) was grown to log phase at 23 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were pulse labeled, and proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with anti-Kar2p antibodies. The sec11 mutant was examined for use as a control. The data in Fig. 4demonstrate that cells bearing the wild-type SPC3 gene displayed efficient cleavage of preKar2p (lane 1). In contrast, the spc3 (lane 2) and sec11(lane 3) mutations strongly inhibited preKar2p cleavage at the nonpermissive temperature. The fact that this defect was present in the spc3 mutant after shifting cells to 37 °C for only 5 min argues in favor of a direct effect of the spc3 mutation on the signal peptidase reaction. The results presented thus far do not eliminate the possibility that the spc3–4 mutation inhibited protein translocation, thereby resulting in an accumulation of preKar2p in the cytoplasm. To test this possibility, strain HFY405 (Δspc3)/pHF336 (spc3–4) was grown to log phase at the permissive temperature and shifted to 37 °C for 1.5 h, and membranes were prepared using methods described previously (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was treated with proteinase K in the presence and absence of detergent and subjected to Western blotting with anti-Kar2p antibodies. The results depicted in Fig. 5 A demonstrated that preKar2p was protected from proteolytic digestion in extracts lacking detergent (lanes 3–7) but exposed to proteolytic attack in extracts incubated with detergent (lanes 8–12). A proteolytic fragment, Kar2f, was also present in this analysis. Kar2f has been seen previously in proteinase K digests of Kar2p (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that the spc3–4 mutation did not inhibit protein translocation. To corroborate this result, vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (35Stevens T.B. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 443-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (371) Google Scholar) was examined. CPY was chosen for this analysis because untranslocated preproCPY (ppCPY) migrates differently from the translocated form on SDS-PAGE gels due to core glycosylation of this protein in the ER lumen. The Western blot shown in Fig. 5 Breveals significant amounts of ppCPY in the temperature-sensitivesec61 mutant (lane 5), which is known to exhibit a defect in protein translocation (36Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutant strain HFY405 (Δspc3)/pHF336 (spc3–4) exhibited ppCPY levels that were similar to the levels present in cells containing wild-type SPC3 (compare lanes 1 and2). A distinct form of CPY (designated CPY*) was present in the spc3–4 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature (lane 1). CPY* comigrated with a form of CPY found in thesec11 mutant (lane 3). In addition, CPY* migrated similarly to a form of CPY found in the sec23 mutant (lane 4). The sec11 (8Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and sec23 (37Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) mutations inhibit signal peptide cleavage and protein transport to the Golgi apparatus, respectively. CPY*, therefore, probably represents aberrant glycosylation of ppCPY resulting from a defect in signal peptidase activity. We have previously demonstrated that chimeric membrane protein AHDK2 is fragmented in a Sec11p-dependent manner and that the fragmentation of AHDK2 by signal peptidase is necessary for its proteolytic elimination (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AHDK2 is anchored to the ER membrane by a transmembrane segment from arginine permease. Fused to the luminal side of this transmembrane segment is a fragment of histidinol dehydrogenase (HD), which is followed by the Kar2p moiety. The presence of Kar2p at the C terminus of AHDK2 permits detection of proteolytic intermediate f1, which is produced through a cleavage near the transmembrane segment of AHDK2. To determine whether Spc3p is important for cleavage at the f1 site of AHDK2, expression plasmid pAHDK2 (URA3) (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was introduced into strain HFY405 (Δspc3)/pHF336 (CEN6 spc3–4 TRP1). This strain and control strain HFY405 (Δspc3) bearing plasmids pAHDK2 and pHF332 (CEN6 SPC3 TRP1) were grown to log phase at 23 °C, shifted to 37 °C for 30 min, then analyzed by pulse-chase using anti-HD antibodies. As expected, cells containing the wild-typeSPC3 gene displayed AHDK2 and proteolytic fragment f1 during the pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). In contrast, no apparent f1 was produced in spc3mutant cells (lanes 4–6). The sec11–7 mutation displays a genetic interaction, termed synthetic lethality, with the Δspc1 and Δspc2 mutations (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Specifically, the growth of cells containing the sec11mutation and either the spc1 or spc2 null mutation is inhibited more severely than the growth of cells containing these mutations individually. We therefore asked whether thesec11–7 mutation is synthetically lethal with thespc3–4 mutation. To avoid the problem of loss of plasmid pHF336 (spc3–4) in the analysis of yeast tetrads, the chromosomal SPC3 gene locus was replaced by thespc3–4 mutation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of a spc3 sec11 double mutant was initiated by crossing strains HFY406 (spc3–4) and CMYD1 (sec11–7). These mutations were followed in the analysis of tetrads by the ability of the spc3–4 andsec11–7 mutations to inhibit cell growth at 37 and 32 °C, respectively. The distribution of progeny in 18 tetrads that were examined at 23 °C was as follows: 14 tetratype (onespc3 mutant spore, one sec11 mutant spore, one wild-type spore, and one inviable spore), three nonparental ditype (two wild-type and two inviable spores), and one parental ditype (twosec11 and two spc3 mutant spores). An additional three tetrads containing only two viable spores were produced. Phenotypic analysis of these spores was inconsistent with the nonparental ditype. Therefore, some of the spores in these tetrads probably succumbed to random spore death. The data derived from this analysis demonstrated that the spc3–4 sec11–7 double mutant was inviable at 23 °C, temperature permissive for thespc3–4 and sec11–7 single mutants. We next questioned whether the spc3–4 mutation was synthetically lethal with the Δspc1 and Δspc2mutations. Random spore analysis of diploid cells derived from a cross between strains HFY407 (spc3–4) and HFY401 (Δspc1::TRP1) produced viable spores that were both tryptophan prototrophs and temperature-sensitive (frequency of 4/14). This indicated the spc3–4 Δspc1 double mutant grew at 23 °C. The double mutant also grew well at 32 °C, indicating no apparent genetic interaction between thespc3–4 and Δspc1 mutations under the tested conditions. In contrast, analysis of diploid cells derived from strains HFY407 (spc3–4) and CMY195 (Δspc2::URA3) yielded progeny with the following distribution: 11 tetratype (one Ura+, one Ura−, one ts/Ura−, and one inviable spore), two nonparental ditype (two Ura− and two inviable spores), and two parental ditype (two ts/Ura−, and two Ura+ spores). Random spore death probably led to one tetrad containing one Ura+, one Ura− and two inviable spores and a second tetrad containing 2 ts/Ura−, one Ura+, and one inviable spore. Importantly, the absence of any spore from this dissection that was both ts and Ura+indicates that the spc3–4 Δspc2 double mutant was inviable at 23 °C. These results thus make a distinction between Spc1p and Spc2p, both of which are nonessential for signal peptidase activity (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Δspc2 mutation but not the Δspc1 mutation is synthetically lethal with the spc3–4 mutation. In addition, these data suggest a difference may exist between Sec11p and Spc3p, both of which are essential for signal peptidase activity. Thesec11–7 mutation is synthetically lethal with the Δspc1 and Δspc2 mutations, whereas thespc3–4 mutation is synthetically lethal with Δspc2 but not Δspc1. One interpretation of these results is that Spc3p may physically interact with Spc2p but not Spc1p; however, it is also plausible that allele-specific mutations in the SPC3 gene may be found that synthetically interact with the Δspc1 mutation. Sec11p has been shown previously to function directly in the cleavage of signal peptides and the fragmentation of abnormal membrane proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Results described here indicate that Spc3p is also required for these enzymatic activities. Moreover, Spc3p and Sec11p interact genetically in that overexpression of Spc3p suppresses the sec11–7mutation, and the spc3–4 and sec11–7 mutations are synthetically lethal. Importantly, the fact that the conditionalspc3–4 mutation inhibits signal peptidase activity after a brief shift to its nonpermissive temperature supports the notion that Spc3p also directly participates in the signal peptide cleavage reaction. In contrast to Spc3p and Sec11p, Spc1p and Spc2p are nonessential for enzyme activity (6Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologs of Spc1p and Spc2p contain two transmembrane segments, an orientation that positions the majority of their sequences on the opposite side of the ER membrane from the active site of signal peptidase (12Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3925-3929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conversely, the mammalian homologs of Sec11p and Spc3p are type II single spanning membrane proteins containing a large luminal domain (33Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Spc3p and Sec11p function directly in the signal peptide cleavage reaction, it seems likely that the SPC subunits predominately exposed to the lumen comprise a two-subunit core enzyme that is required for signal peptidase activity. This conclusion is supported by the fact that a two-subunit avian signal peptidase containing homologs to Spc3p and Sec11p has been shown to function in the signal peptide cleavage reaction in vitro (16Baker R.K. Lively M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8561-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The conservation of the signal peptide cleavage reaction throughout evolution is revealed by the fact that signal sequences are cleaved correctly when expressed in either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. Despite this fact, signal peptides are cleaved by a single polypeptide chain, leader peptidase, in E. coli (13Zwizinski C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7973-7977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the overall similarity between Sec11p and leader peptidase is rather weak, it has been noted that the periplasmic domain of leader peptidase contains three distinct regions of homology to the proposed luminal domain of Sec11p (termed Box I, II, and III) (14Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanpera J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Box I contains a serine amino acid found in all proteins of the signal peptidase I family (Fig.7 A). This residue is the only serine in leader peptidase required for enzyme activity (39Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Box II contains a lysine residue that is essential for leader peptidase function (40Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although the corresponding amino acid in Sec11p is histidine. These serine and lysine residues are proposed to constitue a catalytic dyad within leader peptidase, which is similar to the active site of LexA-type proteases (14Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 38Black M.T. Munn J.G.R. Allsop A.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only four amino acids in Box III of leader peptidase are present in Sec11p (39Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that Spc3p and Sec11p are nonhomologous to each other, we suggest that these subunits function together in a manner analogous to leader peptidase. We have performed a comparison of leader peptidase and Spc3p sequences, using the computer-based algorithm described previously (41Wilbur W.J. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 42Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-244860Crossref PubMed Scopus (9363) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 B, this analysis reveals a similarity between the luminal domain of Spc3p and the carboxyl-terminal half of the periplasmic domain of leader peptidase. The Box I and Box II amino acids are located in the amino-terminal half of leader peptidase, thus suggesting the alignment of Sec11p and Spc3p sequences to distinct regions of leader peptidase. Moreover, the number of amino acids present in the luminal domain of leader peptidase (∼250 amino acids), which contains the catalytic site, is similar to the number of amino acids in the proposed luminal domains of both Sec11p (∼135 amino acids) and Spc3p (∼150 amino acids). These correlations raise the intriguing possibility that Sec11p and Spc3p evolved from a common ancestor. However, in light of the modest homologies between these proteins, we cannot exclude the possibility that leader peptidase and the SPC utilize fundamentally distinct mechanisms for cleaving signal peptides. Future experiments to test these two models are in progress.

This pathway, called the CDP-choline, or Kennedy, pathway, is the major or sole one used by all extrahepatic tissues. PC biosynthesis in hepatocytes also occurs via this pathway, but an alternative one in which phosphatidylethanolamine is converted to PC by phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase (PEMT) is also used by this cell type (1Vance D.E.

All of these CT cDNAs encode a CT protein of 367 amino acids, and the sequences are highly homologous among the different species. CT exists in both soluble and nonintegral membrane-bound forms and is subject to both pre-translational (7Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Post-translational regulation may involve binding of CT to membranes in cells as well as changes in C-terminal phosphorylation. In addition, CT mRNA levels increase with growth factor stimulation of certain cells (7Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after partial hepatectomy in rat liver (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. Batenburg J.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B.

Whether the changes in mRNA levels under these conditions are due to changes in CT gene transcription or to changes in CT mRNA stability (cf. Ref. 7Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has not been fully investigated. Importantly, all of these regulatory studies have been conductedin vitro or in cultured cells, and, in a few cases, results obtained from different laboratories have been contradictory. Thus, the physiological regulation of CT activity, particularly in vivo, is an important area for further investigation. Our laboratory has recently become interested in the physiology and regulation of CT during atherogenesis (10Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol.

We found that free cholesterol loading of macrophages, an important event in advanced atherosclerosis, leads to the induction of CT activity, PC biosynthesis, and PC mass (10Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This response helps the macrophages adapt to potentially toxic levels of cellular free cholesterol, and failure of this response may be one cause of an important lesional event, namely macrophage necrosis (12Tabas I.

To test these ideas in vivo using induced mutant mouse models, it became necessary for us to determine the structure of the murine CT, or Ctpct, gene. This information should also be useful in addressing some of the uncertainties regarding pre- and post-translational CT regulation described above. Given the central importance of CT, it is surprising that only a small part of the structure of the Ctpct gene has been reported thus far (4Rutherford M.S. Rock C.O. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Tessner T.G. Copeland N.G. Jackowski S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Herein, we present the complete structure of the murine Ctpct gene, which reveals a relationship between exon organization and functional domains of CT, the existence of two transcriptional initiation sites, and the presence of several potential 5′-upstream cis-elements that may be involved in gene transcription. All chemical reagents were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher. All restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from DuPont NEN. The random primer labeling kit, the 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR kits, and all synthesized primers were from Life Technologies, Inc. The DNA preparation kit was obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA), and Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The Taq DNA polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. QuickHyb solution and Taq extender PCR additive were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). RNA Zol B was from Tel-Test “B”, Inc. (Friendswood, TX), and the TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). A PCR product amplified from rat CT cDNA (generously supplied by Dr. R. B. Cornell, Simon Fraser University, Canada) by a set of primers (Nos. 820 and 976 as shown in Table I) was used for screening a mouse 129/J stem cell genomic DNA library in a P1 vector (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Four P1 clones (Nos. 4901, 4902, 4903, and 4904) containing the Ctpct gene were obtained. These four P1 clones were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis using three PCR products as probes in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The three probes, which were located in the 5′-, internal, and the 3′-regions of the CT cDNA, were produced by PCR using primers Nos. 137 and 305 (5′), 820 and 976 (internal), and 1003 and 1177-A (3′), respectively, as shown in Table I. The three probes were labeled with α-32P using a random primer labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the protocol of the manufacturer. One of the P1 clones, No. 4904, contained the entire Ctpct gene (see Fig. 1) based on the results of the Southern blot. Clone No. 4904 was then digested by eitherEcoRI or PstI and subcloned into pBluescript KS+ vector, and six subclones containing Ctpctgene fragments were identified by Southern blot using CT cDNA as the probe.Table IPrimers used for PCR and sequencing of the murine Ctpct genePrimer No.5′—Sequence—3′Position in cDNAaBased on the rat CT cDNA sequence (3).

Open table in a new tab The six subclones mentioned above were sequenced for determining exon sequences and exon-intron boundaries. In addition, the 5′-upstream region of clone 6 was sequenced to identify potentialcis-elements involved in binding transcriptional factors. DNA was prepared using the Qiagen DNA preparation kit following the protocol of the manufacturer. DNA sequencing was performed either automatically using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer model 373A) in the DNA Core facility of Columbia University or manually by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing reagents (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The primers used for DNA sequencing are listed in Table I. Sequences were analyzed using the Wisconsin GCG software package (13Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Exon sequences and exon-intron boundaries were defined by comparison with both murine CT cDNA (4Rutherford M.S. Rock C.O. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Tessner T.G. Copeland N.G. Jackowski S.

A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The intron sizes were defined by PCR using P1 clone 4904 as template and the primers listed in Table I. For introns less than 3 kb, the following PCR condition was used: initial cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; plus a final extension of 72 °C for 6 min. For introns larger than 3 kb,Taq extender PCR additive (Stratagene) was added to the PCR reaction following the instructions of the manufacturer, and the PCR condition was adjusted as follows: initial cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min; followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 8 min; plus a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. 5′-RACE (or “anchored”) PCR was conducted to determine the transcriptional initiation sites of the murine Ctpctgene, using a 5′-RACE PCR kit (Life Technologies) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the livers of 10-week-old female 129/J mice using RNA Zol B following the instructions of the manufacturer. RT-PCR was performed using superScript reverse transcriptase, primer No. 382 (Table I), and the above RNA (as template), as shown in Fig. 2 A. The resulting first strand of 5′ CT cDNA fragment was purified using a GlassMax spin cartridge. Then, oligo-dC was added to the 5′-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Finally, PCR was performed using the 5′-tailed CT cDNA fragment as template together with primer No. 305 (Table I) and an abridged anchor primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′). The resulting PCR products were probed by Southern blot with the 32P-labeled 5′-CT cDNA PCR product (using primer Nos. 137 and 305) employed previously for screening the 5′-end of the genomic clones (see above). PCR products that hybridized to this 5′-probe were cloned into pCR2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The CT transcriptional initiation sites were identified by sequencing of the above clones using primer No. 305. 3′-RACE PCR was employed to determine the 3′-UTR of CT cDNA using a 3′-RACE PCR kit (Life Technologies) following the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, total RNA was isolated as described above. RT-PCR was performed using an adapter primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). The resulting first strand of CT cDNA was used as template for further PCR using the primer No. 1177-S (Table I) and the adapter primer. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. As described in detail under “Experimental Procedures,” four clones were isolated from a murine 129/J stem cell genomic DNA library in the P1 vector, and one of these genomic clones (No. 4904) was found to contain the entire Ctpct gene by Southern blot using various CT cDNA probes (Fig. 1). Clone No. 4904 was digested by either EcoRI orPstI and subcloned into pBluescript KS+ vector. Six subclones encompassing parts of the Ctpct gene were identified by Southern blot analysis, and these subclones were sequenced. As shown in Fig. 1, clone 1 (2 kb) contains the 3′ portion of intron I and the 5′ portion of exon 2; clone 2 (3 kb) contains the 3′ portion of intron I, all of exon 2, and the 5′ portion of intron II; clone 3 (4 kb) contains the 3′ portion of intron II, all of exon 3, and the 5′ portion of intron III; clone 4 (12 kb) covers the 3′ portion of intron III, all of exons 4–8 and introns IV-VII, and the 5′ portion of intron VIII; clone 5 (4 kb) contains the 3′ portion of intron VIII, all of exon 9, and the 3′-NFR; and clone 6 contains the 5′ portion of intron I, all of exon 1, and the 5′-NFR. The Ctpct gene is approximately 26 kb in length, which is ∼17 times the length of the CT cDNA. The gene is composed of 9 exons interrupted by 8 introns. Exon 1 contains the 5′-UTR with interruption by intron I at 10 base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon, which is in exon 2; exon 9 contains the 3′-UTR (Figs. 1 and 4). The sizes of the exons range from 72 to 548 bp (TableII), and the sizes of the introns, which were estimated by PCR amplification using a pair of primers located on flanking exons (see Table I), range from 0.5 kb to 6 kb (Fig. 1 and TableIII). All exon-intron boundaries were sequenced and are listed in TableIII. The boundary sequences at the 5′- and 3′-ends of all of the introns are GT and AG, respectively (Table III), which are consensus sequences for pre-mRNA splicing recognition donor and acceptor sites (14Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). As described in detail under “Discussion” and depicted in Fig. 1, the organization of the exons of the Ctpct gene are related to the distinct functional domains of the CT enzyme.Table IIPositions and sizes of exons in the 129/J murine Ctpct geneExon No.Position in putative 129/J murine cDNACodon sequences interruptedAmino acids at sequence interruption11 –72 (72)2-aNumber in parentheses equal size of the exon in base pairs.no codonuntranslated273 –199 (127)GTT/GGTVal39-Gly403200 –299 (100)T/GTCys734300 –416 (117)G/TCVal1125417 –568 (152)CGG/ATTArg162-Ile1636569 –647 (79)G/GCGly1897648 –790 (143)AAC/GAGAsn236-Glu2378791 –979 (189)CTG/AAGLeu299-Lys3009980 –1527 (548)a Number in parentheses equal size of the exon in base pairs.

The intron sequences adjoining the splice junctions are in boldface letters. Open table in a new tab The transcriptional initiation sites of the Ctpct gene were determined by 5′-RACE PCR. PCR was performed using a 5′-fragment of 129/J murine liver CT cDNA tailed with oligo-dC as template; the set of primers used were an abridged anchor primer and primer No. 305 (Table I and Fig. 2 A). The reaction generated products of two distinct sizes, 400 and 370 bp, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Southern blots of these PCR products hybridized with a 5′-CT cDNA probe (Fig. 2 B), indicating that both products were 5′-CT cDNA fragments with different lengths. 5′-RACE PCR was repeated using a different preparation of total RNA from 129/J mouse liver, and the result was the same. Therefore, there appear to be two transcriptional initiation sites utilized in the Ctpct gene. To identify these sites, the 400- and 370-bp PCR products were each cloned into pCR2.1 vector and sequenced using primer No. 305 (Table I). As shown in Fig. 3, one of the start sites is 82 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon and marked as position +1, and the other is 47 nucleotides upstream of the ATG and marked as position +35. Both start with A, a purine, the most common transcription-initiating nucleotide. Clone 6 (Fig. 1), which contained a 4-kb PstI digestion fragment from the Ctpct gene, was identified by Southern blot using exon 1 as a probe. Clone 6 contains approximately 2.6 kb of the 5′-NFR of the Ctpct gene, all of exon 1 (72 bp), and approximately 1.4 kb of intron I. We sequenced 600 bp of DNA immediately upstream of the first transcription start codon (position +1). In analyzing this putative promoter region of the Ctpctgene (Fig. 3), we found characteristics that are typical of housekeeping gene promoters, such as no TATA or CAAT boxes and a high G + C content (see “Discussion” and Refs. 15Kim S.H. Moores J.C. David D. Respess J.G. Jolly D.J. Friedmann T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3103-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev.

C.1988: 1-42Google Scholar). Using a computer analysis of the 5′-NFR, a number of potential transcription factor-binding sites were revealed, as indicated in Fig. 3. A total of five potential Sp1-binding sites (GC boxes) (18Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 316: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) were located at positions −9, −58, −66, −70, and −144; the sites at −66 and −70 are overlapping. An AP1 site (ATGAGTCAA) was located at position −350, an AP2 site (GCCGGCGGG) was located at position −324, and an AP3 site (TGTGGTTT) at position −107. Two TFIIIA sites (CGGGCTCGAA and CAGGTCGGAA) were located at positions −319 and −381. Two reversed Y1 sites (AGAGGGCGGG and AGCCGGCGGG) were located at positions −73 and −325; the first overlaps with an Sp1 site, and the second overlaps with AP2 and TFIIIA sites. 3′-RACE PCR (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 4 A) yielded a 370-bp product whose sequence is shown in Fig. 4 B. The sequence from the stop codon (TAA) to the terminal adenine, which is the site where polyadenylation occurs, is 341 bp (3′-UTR). Although a 3′-terminal adenine is typical (19Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), an unusual polyadenylation signal sequence (AATATA) was located 14 bp upstream of the site where the poly(A) tail is added during the maturation of CT mRNA (see Ref. (19Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). 2The typical eukaryotic upstream polyadenylation signal is AATAAA; 3.4% of 269 surveyed vertebrate polyadenylated cDNA sequences, however, have been found to have the signal found in the Ctpct gene (AATATA) (19Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 4 C, the 3′-UTR was located on exon 9 of the Ctpct gene (i.e. without an intervening intron) since the sequence of the 3′-RACE PCR product (above) was identical to the sequence of the 3′-end of exon 9 of the Ctpct gene (from clone 5 in Fig. 1). The conserved sequence (TTTTTT), which is one of several possible downstream signals required for efficient eukaryotic mRNA polyadenylation (20Wahle E. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was located in the 3′-NFR of the Ctpctgene, 50 bp downstream of the 3′-terminus of exon 9 (Fig.4 C). The structure of the murine Ctpct gene reveals several interesting points. First, the organization of the exons has a distinct relationship to the functional domains of the CT protein (Fig. 1). Exon 2 encodes the first 39 amino acid residues of CT, which includes a signal sequence (residues 8–28) that targets CT to the nucleus (21Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), where the enzyme is localized in certain cell types (22Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 3 encodes residues 40 through 72, for which no specific function has been reported. Exons 4–7 code for the catalytic domain (residues 73–236) (3Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); exon 4 contains the codons for a HSGH motif (residues 89–92), which is thought to mediate binding of CTP by the enzyme (23Veitch D.P. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10743-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Exon 8 encodes amino acids 237–299, which contain a 58-residue α-helix containing three contiguous 11-residue repeats (residues 256–288); this α-helix is thought to play an important role in the membrane-binding properties and enzymatic activity of CT (5Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A.C. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This exon also encodes a densely positive-charged region, a cluster of five lysine residues within a 7amino acid stretch (residues 248–254), the function of which is unknown. Exon 9 codes for the C-terminal part of the CT protein (residues 300–367), which includes a second α-helix (shown not to be necessary for membrane binding (26Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and multiple serine residues that become phosphorylated in vivo (27MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); phosphorylation of these serines may interfere with the binding of CT to membranes (29Hatch G.M. Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15751-15758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17843-17849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and with the activation of CT by lipid activators, such as PC/oleic acid liposomes (31Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the catalytic domain of mammalian CT is highly homologous to yeast CT while the nuclear localization signal, membrane-binding, and phosphorylation domains of mammalian CT are not (24Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Tsukagoshi Y. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears as if the exons encoding the basic catalytic unit of CT evolved first and were later embellished with additional exon cassettes resulting in more complex post-translational regulatory control. Other interesting features of the murine Ctpct gene include the use of two transcriptional initiation sites, the presence of an untranslated exon 1 that is approximately 6 kb upstream from the initiation codon in exon 2, and the large size of the gene. Other genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, transfer, and metabolism also have an untranslated first exon, including the genes encoding phosphatidylethanolamine transferase-2 (PEMT2) (33Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2341-2350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-II, C-III, and E (34Li W.H. Tanimura M. Luo C.C. Datta S. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 245-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipid transfer protein (35Tu A.Y. Deeb S.S. Iwasaki L. Day J.R. Albers J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The gene for PEMT2, a 199-amino acid integral membrane protein that catalyzes the synthesis of PC in hepatocytes, has three other features in common with the Ctpct gene, namely two transcriptional initiation sites, a very large size (∼30-fold larger than its cDNA versus ∼20-fold larger for theCtpct gene), and the absence of a TATA or CAAT box in the 5′-upstream region of the gene (see below) (33Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2341-2350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these similarities denote common transcriptional regulatory features between the two PC biosynthetic genes must await further studies on both genes. In this regard, the cloning of the Ctpct gene will hopefully lead to future studies directed at understanding how transcription of the CT gene is regulated. The 5′-upstream sequence revealed no TATA or CAAT box, but this region is rich in G + C (71% in the first 350 upstream nucleotides) and contains five GC boxes corresponding to consensus Sp1-binding sites (36Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1978; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Sp1-binding sites have been shown to be present in promoters of numerous viral and cellular genes and generally located at 40–100 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional initiation sites (36Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1978; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar); in the putative Ctpctpromoter region, three potential Sp1-binding sites (−58, −66, and −71) are present in this location. Lack of a TATA or CAAT box, multiple origins of transcription, and GC-rich Sp1-binding sites are often found together and are typical of housekeeping genes (37Beck T.W. Brennscheidt U. Sithanandam G. Cleveland J. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Ishii S. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Brady J.N. Merlino G.T. Pastan I.

Other consensus transcriptional factor-binding sites found in the 5′-upstream region of the Ctpct gene include those for AP1, AP2, AP3, TFIIIA, and Y1 (Fig. 3); these sites and those for Sp1 are concentrated in two areas of the putative promoter region, namely between nucleotides −14 and −140 and between −310 and −392 (Fig.3). Future studies will determine whether Sp1 and these other factors are involved in basal transcription of the gene or in transcriptional regulation, such as might occur during growth factor stimulation of certain cells (7Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after partial hepatectomy in rat liver (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B.

J. 1995; 312: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The major impetus for our laboratory to clone the Ctpct gene was related to our interest in the role of the CT enzyme and PC biosynthesis during atherogenesis (10Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J.

Cloning of the gene was necessary for future gene targeting to create induced mutant mouse models of altered arterial wall PC biosynthesis. Additional induced mutant mouse models using CT constructs mutated in regions thought to be important in post-translational regulation (e.g. phosphorylation or membrane-binding domains) and in the consensus cis-acting sequences of the putative promoter region of the Ctpct gene will also be useful in understanding the regulation of CT in vivo. The authors wish to thank Dr. Rosemary B. Cornell (Simon Fraser University) for the rat CT cDNA, and Drs. Jeanine D'Armiento and Xian Cheng Jiang for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2106414391,"In eukaryotic cells, pre-tRNAs spliced by a pathway that produces a 3′,5′-phosphodiester, 2′-phosphomonoester linkage contain a 2′-phosphate group adjacent to the tRNA anticodon. This 2′-phosphate is transferred to NAD to give adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose 1“,2”-cyclic phosphate (Appr>p), which is subsequently metabolized to ADP-ribose 1“-phosphate (Appr-1”p). The latter reaction is catalyzed by a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase), previously identified in yeast and wheat. In the work presented here, we describe cloning of the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding the 20-kDa CPDase that hydrolyzes Appr>p to Appr-1“p. Properties of the bacterially overexpressed and purified Arabidopsis enzyme are similar to those of wheat CPDase. In addition to their transformation of Appr>p, both enzymes hydrolyze nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates to nucleoside 2′-phosphates. For theArabidopsis CPDase, the apparent K mvalues for Appr>p, A>p, C>p, G>p, and U>p are 1.35, 1.34, 2.38, 16.86, and 17.67 mm, respectively. Southern analysis indicated that CPDase in Arabidopsis is encoded by a single copy gene that is expressed, at different levels, in allArabidopsis organs that were analyzed. Indirect immunofluorescence, performed with transfected protoplasts, showed that CPDase is localized in the cytoplasm. Based on substrate specificity and products generated, the plant enzyme differs from other known cyclic phosphodiesterases. The Arabidopsis CPDase does not have recognizable structural similarity or motifs in common with proteins deposited in public data bases. In eukaryotic cells, pre-tRNAs spliced by a pathway that produces a 3′,5′-phosphodiester, 2′-phosphomonoester linkage contain a 2′-phosphate group adjacent to the tRNA anticodon. This 2′-phosphate is transferred to NAD to give adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose 1“,2”-cyclic phosphate (Appr>p), which is subsequently metabolized to ADP-ribose 1“-phosphate (Appr-1”p). The latter reaction is catalyzed by a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase), previously identified in yeast and wheat. In the work presented here, we describe cloning of the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding the 20-kDa CPDase that hydrolyzes Appr>p to Appr-1“p. Properties of the bacterially overexpressed and purified Arabidopsis enzyme are similar to those of wheat CPDase. In addition to their transformation of Appr>p, both enzymes hydrolyze nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates to nucleoside 2′-phosphates. For theArabidopsis CPDase, the apparent K mvalues for Appr>p, A>p, C>p, G>p, and U>p are 1.35, 1.34, 2.38, 16.86, and 17.67 mm, respectively.

Based on substrate specificity and products generated, the plant enzyme differs from other known cyclic phosphodiesterases. The Arabidopsis CPDase does not have recognizable structural similarity or motifs in common with proteins deposited in public data bases. Transcripts of many tRNA genes in eukaryotes contain a single short intron, located in a conserved position in the anticodon loop, which is excised by a different mechanism to that utilized during nuclear pre-mRNA processing (Fig. 1; reviewed in Refs. 1Phizicky E.M.

Splicing of pre-tRNA is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavages that result in removal of the intron and formation of two tRNA half-molecules, a 5′-half terminating in a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and a 3′-half bearing a 5′-hydroxyl group (3Filipowicz W.

The ligation pathway leading to the formation of the 2′-phosphate-bearing tRNA molecules is also conserved in vertebrates (12Zillmann M. Gorovsky M.A. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), despite the fact that in these organisms most of the tRNA splicing appears to involve another RNA ligase, an enzyme which joins two tRNA halves by the regular 3′,5′-phosphodiester (3Filipowicz W.

The 2′-phosphate present in the product of the spliced tRNA is removed by a specific phosphotransferase, previously identified in yeast and vertebrates (14McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol.

Culver et al. (16Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillmann M. Kierzek R. Michaud N. LaReau R.D. Turner D.H. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) found that this enzyme transfers the 2′-phosphate to an NAD acceptor molecule, to produce ADP-ribose 1“,2”-cyclic phosphate (Appr>p). 1The abbreviations used are: Appr>p, ADP-ribose 1“,2”-cyclic phosphate; Appr-1“p, ADP-ribose 1”-phosphate; Appr-2“p, ADP-ribose 2”-phosphate; N, any of four (A, G, C, U) nucleosides; pN, N3′p, N2′p, and N>p, nucleosides 5′-, 3′-, 2′-, and 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, respectively; pG>p, guanosine 5′-phosphate, 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate; CIP, calf intestine phosphatase; CNPase, 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase; CPDase, cyclic phosphodiesterase; EST, expressed sequence tag; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TLC, thin layer chromatography. However, Appr>p is not the final product of this complex series of reactions. It has been found recently that Appr>p is converted into ADP-ribose 1“-phosphate (Appr-1”p) by the action of the cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase), identified in yeast and wheat (17Culver G.M. Consaul S.A. Tycowski K.T. Filipowicz W. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24928-24934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although all partial reactions leading to the formation of Appr>p and Appr-1“p have, to date, only been demonstrated in yeast (16Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillmann M. Kierzek R. Michaud N.

It has been suggested that Appr>p, or its hydrolysis product, may perform some as yet unspecified regulatory function(s) in the cell (16Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillmann M. Kierzek R. Michaud N. LaReau R.D. Turner D.H. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Conservation of the Appr>p-forming pathway in vertebrates (12Zillmann M.

Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), despite the fact that most of the cellular tRNA in these organisms seems to be processed by another pathway (see above), offers some support for this hypothesis. The plant CPDase was originally purified from wheat as an enzyme that hydrolyzes nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates to nucleoside 2′-phosphates (18Tyc K. Kellenberger C. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12994-13000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological significance of this reaction is not known, but the ability of the enzyme to convert the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate to the 2′-phosphate in mononucleotides but not in cyclic-phosphate-terminated oligoribonucleotides, together with its ability to hydrolyze Appr>p, clearly distinguishes it from other known enzymes having the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate 3′-phosphodiesterase activity (17, 18; see “Discussion”). Although the yeast phosphodiesterase shares many characteristics with the wheat enzyme, it has a different substrate specificity, hydrolyzing Appr>p to Appr-1“p, but having no detectable activity on nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates (17Culver G.M. Consaul S.A. Tycowski K.T. Filipowicz W. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24928-24934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation experiments performed with yeast and wheat germ extracts indicated that phosphodiesterases described above are, most probably, the only cellular activities converting Appr>p to Appr-1”p (17Culver G.M.

In this work we describe the molecular characterization of the plant cyclic phosphodiesterase. The cDNA encoding this protein inArabidopsis has been cloned and the properties of the bacterially overexpressed and purified enzyme have been compared with those of its purified wheat counterpart. The Arabidopsisenzyme has no apparent structural resemblance to other known cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Plantlets of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia C0, were grown in Petri dishes containing 0.8% agar, 1% sucrose, and MS salts (19Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) in a 22 °C growth chamber under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Three weeks after sowing, leaves, roots, and floral buds were harvested. For leaf strip incubation, the leaves were sliced and incubated in a culture medium described by Nagy and Maliga (20Nagy J.J. Maliga P. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1976; 78: 453-455Crossref Google Scholar), containing 1 mg/liter of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Aliquots were harvested at different times of culture for total RNA extraction. About 5 μg of wheat germ CPDase, purified as described previously (18Tyc K. Kellenberger C. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12994-13000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was applied to the SDS-PAGE 10% gel. After blotting to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and staining with Ponceau S, the approximately 23-kDa CPDase band was excised and treated with trypsin. Proteolytic peptides were resolved by HPLC and sequenced by Dr. W. S. Lane (Harvard MicroChem, Cambridge, MA). Three peptides were sequenced (Fig.2). A λZAP cDNA library, prepared with a mixture of the poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 24, 48, and 72 h leaf strip cultures (a gift from J. Fleck, Institut de Biologie Moléculaire des Plantes du CNRS, Strasbourg, France), was screened with the partial cDNA clone (theArabidopsis EST; GenBank™/EBI accession number T12916; kindly provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) as a probe. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C in 5 × SSPE (SSPE: 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm Na2-EDTA, pH 7.7) containing 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution (100 × Denhardt's solution is 2% Ficoll, 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2% bovine serum albumin), 1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were subsequently washed in 2 × SSC (SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mmNa2citrate) and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C and in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C. Twenty-nine clones were isolated after screening 800,000 recombinant phages. After excision of the phagemids, the inserts were analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing of the ends. The longest clones were subsequently sequenced on both strands. Primer extension was carried out (21Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. Smith A. Struhl K. Current Protoclos in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, New York1990Google Scholar) using a 25-mer-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 1 (ACGGTGACGTGAGGAACGAATCTTG), complementary to positions 203–227 of the cDNA (Fig. 2), 10 units of avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 100 μg of RNA isolated from theArabidopsis leaf strip cultures incubated for either 24 or 48 h. The resulting cDNA was purified on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and its 3′ end was tagged with the 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide 2 (pCATCTCGAGCGGCCGCATCA) using T4 RNA ligase (22Dumas J.B. Edwards M. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5227-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The CPDase cDNA sequence was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide 3 (GTGAGGAACGAATCTTGG; complementary to positions 202 to 219; Fig. 2) and oligonucleotide 4 (TGATGCGGCCGCTCGAGA; complementary to the 3′ tag) as primers. The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. The fragment encompassing 226 base pairs of the promoter and upstream portion of the transcribed region was cloned by inverse PCR (23Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). TheArabidopsis DNA was digested with EcoRI and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. PCR was performed using oligonucleotide 5 (CGATTCCTCATCTGGTAATGC; complementary to positions 130 to 150 in Fig.2) and oligonucleotide 6 (GCTAATGGAAGCTTTGAGATCC; positions 168 to 189 in Fig. 2) as primers. The amplified fragments were cloned into theSmaI site of pBluescript and sequenced. Total RNA from Arabidopsis organs and leaf strip cultures was isolated as described by Hall et al. (24Hall T.C. Ma Y. Buchbinder B.U. Pyne J.W. Sun S.M. Bliss F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3196-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg/lane) was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) by capillary transfer using 20 × SSPE, and UV-cross-linked to the membrane. The integrity and the amount of RNA applied to each lane were verified by control hybridizations using a tomato 25 S rRNA probe (25Kiss T. Kis M. Solymosy F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment extending from positions 430–741 (Fig. 2) was used as a CPDase probe. The histone H4 probe corresponds to the 196-base pair restriction fragmentAccI/DdeI of the coding region of the gene H4A748 (26Chaboute M.E. Chaubet N. Philipps G. Ehling M. Gigot C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 8: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The actin probe corresponds to the 570-base pair PCR-amplified fragment of the Arabidopsis actin gene AAc1 (27Nairn C.J. Winesett L. Ferl R.J. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 65: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was isolated from lyophilized Arabidopsisplants using a procedure similar to that of Murray and Thompson (28Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) by the random priming method (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). RNA as well as DNA gel blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 5 × SSPE, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The blots were subsequently washed in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C and in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C and then at 60 °C. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of the hen polyclonal antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were detected using peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified rabbit anti-chicken IgYs (Dianova) and the ECL Western blotting analysis system from Amersham. ABamHI site was introduced 3′ to the CPDase coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The NcoI/BamHI fragment (the NcoI site is present at the AUG initiation codon of the CPDase cDNA) was cloned into the pQE-60 vector (Qiagen) yielding plasmid pQECPDase. In this construct, 10 additional amino acids (sequence GSRSHHHHHH) are placed in frame at the C terminus of the recombinant protein. The protein remained soluble during expression in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and was purified in the native form, under nondenaturing conditions, using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and following the Qiagen protocol. The purified CPDase was applied to a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Two hens were immunized with the purified recombinant CPDase. For primary immunization, 20 μg of the protein, in Freund's complete adjuvant, was used. After 4 weeks, 20 μg of the protein with Freund's incomplete adjuvant was injected. Eggs were collected daily starting 2 weeks after the last immunization. Antibodies were purified from egg yolk according to the three-step method of Polson and von Wechmar (32Polson A. von Wechmar M.B. van Regenmortel M.H.V. Immunol. Commun. 1980; 9: 475-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A 2 m(NH4)2 SO4 precipitation was used for the complete removal of polyethylene glycol. All nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic and 3′,5′-cyclicphosphates, nucleoside 5′-, 3′- and 2′-phosphates, pG>p and inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate were obtained from Sigma and Pharmacia Biotech Inc. A>p, G>p, and C>p were purified by reverse phase HPLC on Nucleosil C4 RP-300 column using 50 mm triethyl-ammonium acetate-acetonitrile gradient. Products were collected as a single peak. Appr>p was chemically synthesized as described elsewhere (33Hall J. Genschik P. Filipowicz W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1996; 79: 1005-1010Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide AAAAUAAAAG>p* (asterisk denotes the position of the label) was prepared as follows: the synthetic oligoribonucleotide AAAAUAAAAG (0.7 μg), obtained from MWG-Biotech (Munich, Germany), was 3′-terminally labeled using 5′-[32P]pCp (*pCp) and T4 RNA ligase. The ligation product was then digested with 5 units of RNase T1 yielding AAAAUAAAAGp*. The latter was quantitatively converted into AAAUAAAAG>p* by incubation with the RNA 3′-terminal phosphate cyclase purified from HeLa cells (34Filipowicz W. Vicente O. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. For calculation of specific activities and kinetic analysis, a quantitative assay based on a measurement of the phosphatase-sensitive nucleotide product was used. All incubations (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Concentrations of CPDase and substrates and incubation times at 30 °C were as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 2 min, and 80 μl of 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 unit of CIP was added. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, liberated phosphate was assayed according to Hess and Derr (35Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). For determination of theK m and V max values, the assays contained substrates at concentrations of 1.38–12.5 mm. All velocities were calculated from the initial linear rates. Values were fitted to the Lineweaver-Burk equation by the linear regression method assuming proportional errors. Products of enzymatic digestions, performed as described previously (8Konarska M. Filipowicz W. Domdey H. Gross H.J. Nature. 1981; 293: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were analyzed by cellulose TLC in solvent A (saturated (NH4)2SO4/3 m sodium acetate/isopropyl alcohol (80:6:2)) or by polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC in solvent B (0.75 m LiCl). The nucleotide standards and reaction products were visualized under UV light. The CPDase coding sequence (theNcoI-BamHI fragment from pQECPDase; see above) was cloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pGGS.5 expression vector (kindly provided by Gordon Simpson of this laboratory; the vector contains a duplicated cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and a cauliflower mosaic virus poly(A) signal), resulting in the plasmid pHATCPDase. The CPDase encoded by pHATCPDase contains the influenza hemagglutinin nonapeptide epitope tag (flu tag, amino acids YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus. A similar plasmid (pNRBP43) expressing the nuclear RNA-binding protein N-RBP43 of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia with the flu tag fused at the C terminus, was used as a control for the nuclear-localized protein. Mesophyll protoplasts of N. plumbaginifolia were transfected by the polyethylene glycol method (36Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), using 20 μg of plasmid per transfection. Transfected protoplasts were collected 24 h after transfection, washed twice with 10 ml of W5 solution (36Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), twice with 10 ml of 0.5% Mes, pH 5.7, containing 175 mm CaCl2, and suspended in 100 μl of the same Mes/CaCl2 buffer. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed according to Cairnset al. (37Cairns E. Gschwender H.H. Primke M. Yamakawa M. Traub P. Schweiger H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5557-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and Neuhaus et al. (38Neuhaus G. Neuhaus-Url G. Gruss P. Schweiger H.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2169-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with modifications. Aliquots of the protoplast suspension were spread on the surface of detergent- and acetone-washed glass slides. The slides were dried in an oven at 55 °C and kept overnight under vacuum in a desiccator. Samples were fixed for 30 min at room temperature by overlaying with 100 μl of the fixation solution (4% formaldehyde, 1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0). They were subsequently washed four times for 30 min with 1 ml of washing solution A (2.5% NaCl in 0.1 m glycine-KOH buffer, pH 8.5), and overlaid for 1 h in a wet chamber with 100 μl of a solution of the rabbit antiserum against the flu epitope (antibody HA-11; Berkley Antibody Co.), diluted 1:80 with buffer B (2.5% NaCl solution in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Glass slides were washed four times for 15 min with 1 ml of solution A and overlaid for 30 min with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment; Jackson/Milan Analytica AG). The secondary antibody was diluted 1:100 with buffer B, containing 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye. After washing four times with 1 ml of solution A and four times with 1 ml of solution C (0.1m glycine-KOH, pH 8.5), samples were overlaid with a drop of the embedding material and covered with a cover glass. Samples were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and a Leica TCS 4D confocal scanning laser microscope, using a 63× objective. Images were recorded using the Leica software (SCANware 4.2) provided with the system and analyzed with the Imaris software on a Silicon Graphics work station. The previously purified wheat germ CPDase (18Tyc K. Kellenberger C. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12994-13000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subjected to tryptic digestion, and three peptide sequences were obtained. One of these, the 20-amino acid-long pep3, showed 80% identity and 100% similarity to an open reading frame of the Arabidopsis EST, present in the GenBank™/EBI data base (accession number T12916). The EST cDNA was used as a probe to screen the λZAP cDNA library made with the poly(A)+ RNA obtained from the Arabidopsis leaf strip culture. Twenty-nine positive recombinant phages were isolated, and their inserts were analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing of the ends. The longest cDNA obtained from this screening started approximately 85 nucleotides downstream from the transcription initiation site, as determined by primer extension (data not shown). To determine the 5′-terminal mRNA sequence, RACE experiments were performed using RNA isolated from leaf strip cultures incubated for either 24 or 48 h. Both RNA preparations yielded cDNA clones of identical sequence and extending to the same position (position 1 in Fig. 2). The sequence of the region identified by RACE was independently confirmed by cloning, using inverse PCR, and sequencing the promoter region of the gene. The apparent full-length cDNA is 741 nucleotides long, without counting the poly(A) tail (Fig. 2). The sequence including the presumed AUG initiation codon (AUCCAUGGA) is similar to the consensus (AACCAUGGC) established for plant genes (39Lütcke H.A. Chow K.C. Mickel F.S. Moss K.A. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The 5′-terminal leader contains one additional AUG in a much less favorable context, followed by termination codons (Fig. 2). Conceptual translation of the cDNA yields a 20.5-kDa protein of 181 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 4.82. The deducedArabidopsis protein contains sequences showing significant similarities with all sequenced peptides derived from the wheat protein. The greatest sequence homology is for pep3 (see above). Peptides pep1 and pep2 show 39 and 38% similarity and 39 and 31% identity, respectively. The coding region of theArabidopsis cDNA was subcloned in the pQE-60-inducible expression vector to yield a fusion protein containing six histidine residues at the C terminus. The tagged protein was overproduced inE. coli and purified using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Fig. 3 A). The protein was over 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The polyclonal antibodies, raised in chickens immunized with the overexpressed ArabidopsisCPDase, detected purified Arabidopsis protein on Western blots and also cross-reacted with the purified wheat CPDase (Fig.3 B). The antibodies did not detect the CPDase in crude cellular extracts prepared from the leaves of Arabidopsis, but the protein band likely to correspond to the CPDase could be detected after partial purification of the enzyme (data not shown). Hence, consistent with previous observations (18Tyc K. Kellenberger C. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12994-13000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the CPDase appears to be a nonabundant protein. The Arabidopsis CPDase hydrolyzed all four nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates to the corresponding 2′-phosphomonoesters as analyzed by cellulose TLC (Fig. 4). No 3′-phosphomonoester formation could be detected. Thus, lik"

The single site mutation therefore altered GFOR, which in the wild-type situation contains NADP as nondissociable redox cofactor reacting in a ping-pong type mechanism, to a dehydrogenase with dissociable NAD(P) as cosubstrate and a sequential reaction type. After prolonged preincubation of the S116D mutant protein with excess NADP (but not NAD), GFOR activity could be restored to 70 units/mg, one-third of wild-type activity, whereas glucose dehydrogenase activity decreased sharply.

Glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR 1The abbreviations used are: GFOR, glucose-fructose oxidoreductase; kb, kilobase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. ; EC 1.1.1.99.-) is a homotetrameric enzyme from the Gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobiliswhich catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone and the reduction of fructose to sorbitol (Fig. 1) in a ping-pong type mechanism (1Zachariou M. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hardman M.J. Scopes R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 179: 203-209Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sorbitol is used as a compatible solute by Z. mobilis to counteract the detrimental osmotic effects of high concentrations of sugars in the medium (3Loos H. Krämer R. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7688-7693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent physiological role of GFOR is the production of sorbitol from the two sugar moieties of sucrose, a natural carbon source of the bacterium which dwells in sugar-rich habitats (4Swings J. DeLey J. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is synthesized as a precursor (pre-GFOR) with an NH2-terminal signal peptide of 52 amino acid residues (5Kanagasundaram V. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is exported to the periplasm, at least partially, via the Sec pathway (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mature enzyme is located in the periplasm (7Loos H. Völler M. Rehr B. Stierhof Y.-D. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 84: 211-216Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Aldrich H.C. McDowell L. Barbosa M.de F.S. Yomano L.P. Scopes R.K. Ingram L.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stoichiometrically, one molecule of the cofactor NADP is bound per monomer (1Zachariou M. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-GFOR was shown to be enzymatically fully active and to bind NADP tightly (9Loos H. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A deletion of 15 mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues (Δ32–46) in the signal peptide led to a cytosolic form of GFOR which could be purified and showed characteristics similar to the wild-type enzyme (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in terms of reactivity and the mode of cofactor binding. A special feature of GFOR is the tight binding of the cofactor NADP(H). Treatment with perchloric acid removed the cofactor from the apoprotein (1Zachariou M. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that NADP(H) is bound in a noncovalent manner. During protein purification, the cofactor is not removed from the enzyme (1Zachariou M. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The published DNA sequence and the amino acid sequence derived thereof reveal that GFOR has little similarity to other enzymes (5Kanagasundaram V. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This, together with the mode of tight cofactor binding, suggests a novel dinucleotide binding mode. Although diffracting crystals have been obtained from purified GFOR (10Loos H. Ermler U. Sprenger G.A. Sahm H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2447-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme had not been available while the present investigations were performed. Using site-directed mutagenesis we wanted to analyze the tight binding of cofactor to GFOR. Based on alignments and secondary structure predictions, we mutated amino acid residues that are likely to be involved in cofactor binding. As a striking result, a mutant GFOR with a single amino acid substitution (S116D) behaved as glucose dehydrogenase with dual coenzyme specificity for NADP and NAD. Z. mobilis strain ACM3963 (11Kirk L.A. Doelle H.W. Biotechnol. Lett. 1993; 15: 985-990Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and its recombinant derivatives were maintained and cultivated anaerobically as described previously (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For protein purifications, cells were grown in complex medium with 10% glucose with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) to induce gfo expression from derivatives of plasmid pZY507 (CmR; Escherichia coli/Z.mobilis shuttle vector withlacI q/Ptac control; 6). E. coli cells were grown in LB medium with appropriate antibiotics (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction of plasmids pZY470, pZY470Δ32–46, and pZY570 is described elsewhere (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All manipulations of DNA, cloning, and transformation were done according to standard procedures (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 13Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8190) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the chain termination method using dideoxynucleotides (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) in conjunction with T7 DNA polymerase (15Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) using the nonradioactive A.L.F. fluorescence detection method according to the manufacturer's protocols (Pharmacia LKB, Freiburg, Germany). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on a derivative of M13mp18 (16Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar) containing an internal 0.3 kb PstI/SphI fragment of the gfo gene according to a standard procedure (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) with oligonucleotidesI, 5′-GCTTTTTCAGCGTTACCATCGACCAAAGCTTCGAT-3′ (S116D); II, 5′-GACGCCATATTCAGCGGCAACTTTCTGAGCAGCTTCAGCGTTACCATCGACG-3′ (S116D/K121A/K123Q/I124K); and III, 5′-TAAAATCTGGTTAAGACCATATTTACCCAGACC-3′ (A95G); altered base triplets are underlined. In a second round of mutagenesis, an M13 clone with the exchange A95G was used as template together with oligonucleotides I and II to combine these mutations. Base exchanges were checked by DNA sequencing. After verification, the respective fragments were cloned into plasmid pZY470Δ32–46, sequenced again, introduced into the shuttle vector pZY507, and conjugated to Z. mobilis ACM3963 as described elsewhere (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To avoid any problems with the export of recombinant GFOR proteins to the periplasm or related problems as stability and cofactor incorporation (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), respective mutations were introduced into a gfo allele that encodes a cytoplasmic form (GFORΔ32–46). This form had been shown earlier to bind NADP in the same tight manner as wild-type GFOR and was enzymatically fully active (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis was performed using a megaprimer method with two steps of polymerase chain reaction (18Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 467-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the first round of polymerase chain reaction, plasmid pZY470 DNA (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) served as a template with the loop-out primer IV 5′- ACGATCTTCCGGCATCGGGCGGATCATΔAATCCTTGTTTCTTTCTTAAC-3′ (Δ2–74) and the M13/pUC universe sequencing primer;Δ denotes the site of deletion. The resulting 222-base pair megaprimer was incubated with the M13/pUC universal and reverse sequencing primers (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) together with a 1.5-kb PvuII fragment of pZY470 as template in the second polymerase chain reaction step. The 1.5-kb product was restricted withEcoRI plus HindIII, and the 0.3-kb fragment was ligated to plasmid pZY470 restricted withEcoRI/HindIII. Clones were checked for the desired deletion by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid (pZY470Δ2–74) was restricted withEcoRI/HindIII, and the 0.3-kb fragment was cloned into pZY470/S116D or pZY470/S116D/K121A/K123Q/I124K to combine Δ2–74 with these amino acid substitutions. All gfo alleles were conjugated to Z. mobilis ACM3963 on plasmids derived from pZY507 as described elsewhere (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant proteins (GFORΔ32–46, GFORΔ2–74, or derivatives) were purified from derivatives of the GFOR-defective Z. mobilis strain ACM3963 (11Kirk L.A. Doelle H.W. Biotechnol. Lett. 1993; 15: 985-990Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) after growth in complex medium supplemented with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). GFOR was purified using a coupled anion-cation exchange chromatography as described elsewhere (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A second cation exchange step was omitted, as apparent purity was already achieved in the first step (Fig. 2). As degradation was observed with some mutant proteins, NADP (0.5 mm) was added to all buffers during purification steps. Because of the lack of detectable GFOR activity in most of the mutant proteins, GFOR-containing fractions were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Western blot analysis (19Towbin H.T. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Fractions were pooled, equilibrated to 40 mm K-MES, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.4, by ultrafiltration, mixed with the same volume of glycerol (88%), and stored at −20 °C until further use. NH2-terminal peptide sequencing was performed by limited Edman degradation in conjunction with an Applied Biosystems Inc. 371 sequencer. Determination of the COOH-terminal amino acid was done with carboxypeptidase Y (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by reversed phase HPLC as described elsewhere (20Lindsroth P. Mopper K. Anal. Chem. 1979; 51: 1167-1174Crossref Google Scholar). Tightly bound NADP(H) was released from GFOR by acid denaturation and was subsequently detected by HPLC analysis. The enzymes were equilibrated to sodium phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 5.0) by ultrafiltration and diluted to a final concentration of approximately 4 mg protein/ml. 60 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid (35%) was added to 60 μl of the enzyme solution, mixed, and kept on ice for 15 min. The samples were neutralized by the stepwise addition of 180 μl of KHCO3(2 m), and insoluble material was spun down by centrifugation. An aliquot of the supernatant was submitted to HPLC on an octadecyl-silica gel column (Hypersil ODS, 5 μm, CS Chromatography Service, Langerwehe, Germany) that was eluted with a gradient of sodium phosphate (200 mm, pH 5.0), acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 40 °C. Retention times of NADP(H) and NAD(H) were determined with standard solutions. Enzyme activities were determined at 30 °C in a thermostatted cuvette holder of a Shimadzu UV160 spectrophotometer by the measurement of acidification (formation of gluconic acid from glucose) according to a published method (1Zachariou M. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gluconolactonase from Rhodotorula rubra was added in excess to the reaction mixture (7Loos H. Völler M. Rehr B. Stierhof Y.-D. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 84: 211-216Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Glucose dehydrogenase activity was measured by the increase of reduced NAD(P) at 340 nm. Reaction mixtures contained 5 μg/ml purified protein (GFOR or mutant protein), 5 units/ml gluconolactonase, glucose (400 mm in 40 mm K-MES buffer, pH 6.4), and 1 mm NAD(P). To determine K m for NAD(P), concentrations of coenzymes were varied from 2 to 1,000 μm. K m,k cat, and standard deviations thereof were calculated by the Enzfitter Program (Elsevier Biosoft, version 1.05). Protein was determined by a dye binding method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Spectrometer at 20 °C. Prior to use, the enzyme solutions were equilibrated by ultrafiltration to sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.4). Excitation and emission slits were set to 4 nm. To minimize photodecomposition of the enzymes, the shutter of the exciting beam was kept closed until the measurement started. Fluorescence titrations were performed by the stepwise addition of 2.5–5 μl of NADPH to 2 ml of an enzyme solution with a concentration of 0.6 μm (tetramer). Dilution by the addition of NADPH was kept to a maximum of 2.5%. Controls were obtained following the same procedure without added enzyme. To minimize inner filter effects of nucleotide fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was set to 360 nm (22Basso L.A. Engel P.C. Walmsley A.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Titration curves were fitted to a quadratic equation relating the fluorescence change to the coenzyme concentration for a second order binding process (23Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap B.D. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). (F−FL)(F∞−FL)−1=12[E]0Kd+[E]0+[S]0±(Kd+[E]0+[S]0)2−4[E]0[S]0Equation 1 where [E]0 and [S]0represent the initial enzyme and NADPH concentrations, respectively;F ∞ is the fluorescence intensity at saturating NADPH concentration; F L is the fluorescence intensity at a given NADPH concentration without enzyme; andF is the fluorescence intensity at a given NADPH concentration with enzyme. During former rounds of subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we had already encountered several deviations from the published DNA sequence of the gfo gene (5Kanagasundaram V. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to sequence the complete gfo gene again. In a comparison with the former sequence (5Kanagasundaram V. Scopes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), several frameshifts were observed which resulted in a deviating amino acid sequence of GFOR comprising only 433 residues (instead of 439). According to our DNA sequencing, the COOH-terminal residue should be a tyrosine. We subjected purified GFOR to a carboxypeptidase Y treatment and found that, indeed, tyrosine appeared as the first residue (data not shown). Using the corrected gfo sequence and the derived amino acid sequence, we performed similarity searches with the HUSAR package provided by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL, Heidelberg) in all accessible data bases using the BLAST data base search program. Several amino acid sequences, in some cases open reading frames with putative enzyme functions, were found which showed significant similarities to the NH2-terminal half of GFOR (Fig. 3); similar findings, using the uncorrected GFOR sequence, have been reported by others (24Rossbach S. Kulpa D.A. Rossbach U. DeBruijn F.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All of these proteins are NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases displaying a possible fingerprint motif of a classical Rossmann fold (25Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) at their immediate NH2 termini. In the GFOR sequence, a possible fingerprint motif could also be recognized, although it was preceded by the signal sequence of 52 amino acid residues and a proline-rich sequence of approximately 30 amino acid residues (Fig. 3). GFOR displays the characteristic fingerprint of a NADP binding Rossmann fold,i.e. the sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Ala with alanine at position 95 and the absence of a negatively charged amino acid residue (Asp or Glu), which is typically found as the last conserved residue of the fingerprint sequence in NAD-binding βαβ folds (25Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 26Hanukoglu I. Gutfinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). From the sequence alignment in Fig. 3, a highly conserved motif with the consensus AGKHVXCEKP became apparent; this box is found around amino acid residues 170–185 of GFOR. A data base search for this motif returned exclusively the sequences listed in Fig. 3. All of the listed enzymes, with the exception of biliverdin reductase, are known, or can be expected, to react with substrates that are structurally similar to glucose. Therefore this motif may constitute a putative fingerprint for a novel class of sugar dehydrogenases. A secondary structure prediction of GFOR was performed using the PHD program (27Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar), based on the multiple alignment shown in Fig. 3. The amino-terminal half of GFOR, according to this prediction, consists of six β-folds interspaced by α-helical elements, resembling the structure of Rossmann-type NAD(P) binding sites (28Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Brändén C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). Taken together with the possible fingerprint motif for NAD(P) binding sites, it could be predicted that GFOR binds its cofactor NADP in a domain comprising the NH2-terminal half (approximately amino acid residues 80–250) in a βαβ dinucleotide binding fold, resembling the Rossmann fold of dehydrogenases. Only a few amino acid residues are highly conserved in Rossmann folds. These are 10–11 amino acid residues, termed the fingerprint sequence of βαβ dinucleotide binding folds, in the region of the first and second β-sheet (βa and βb) and the interspacing pyrophosphate binding α-helix (αb). From sequence and structural data and from mutational analyses, it has been established that the fingerprint regions of binding sites for NAD or NADP differ to some extent and that these differences play a key role in determining the coenzyme specificity (29Scrutton N.S.

To analyze the mode of NADP binding in GFOR and to assess the involvement of a possible Rossmann fold, we intended to weaken the interaction of GFOR with its cofactor NADP by engineering an NAD binding motif using site-directed mutagenesis. The conserved Ala residue in NADP binding sites is known to induce a hydrogen bond pattern that differs from that of NAD binding sites, where Gly occupies this position (30Baker P.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Rob A. Stillman T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Mittl P.R.E. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1504-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To assay this for GFOR, we changed Ala-95 of GFOR to Gly (A95G; mutant A, Fig.4). Negatively charged amino acid residues (Glu or Asp) are invariably found at the end of the second β-sheet of NAD binding sites. The oxygen atoms of the side chain carboxyl group form hydrogen bonds to the 2′- and 3′-OH groups of the adenine ribose moiety of NAD. In contrast, NADP binding sites usually contain an uncharged amino acid residue at this position, which is followed immediately by a positively charged residue in many cases (29Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 33Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our secondary structure predictions suggested that Ser-116 at the end of the putative βB in GFOR might be replaced by Asp (S116D; mutant B) to lower the affinity for NADP and to combine mutations A and B (A95G/S116D; mutant C; Fig.4), to complete disruption via the H bonding pattern. Site-directed mutageneses were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resulting mutant alleles were introduced and expressed in the GFOR-defective strain Z. mobilis ACM3963 (6Wiegert T. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Kirk L.A. Doelle H.W. Biotechnol. Lett. 1993; 15: 985-990Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These and additional mutant proteins (see below) are listed in Fig. 4. Mutant proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). Only mutant A (A95G) showed GFOR activity comparable to the GFORΔ32–46 wild-type enzyme (Table I). No GFOR activity could be detected by the standard photometric GFOR enzyme assay (without addition of NADP) with mutants B (S116D) and C (A95G/S116D). The loss of GFOR activity could be due to the loss of the cofactor NADP(H). Proteins, therefore, were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence at 450 nm is a sensitive proof of the presence of reduced NAD(P) (34Roskoski R. in Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes.in: Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Part B. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987: 173-188Google Scholar). In addition, shifts in tryptophan fluorescence at 330 nm may reveal conformational differences between wild-type and mutant GFOR (35Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, U. K.1989: 251-285Google Scholar). GFORΔ32–46, as the control with tightly bound NADP, was preincubated with glucose to reduce bound NADP. When fluoresence was excited at 295 nm, only weak tryptophan fluorescence was observed, with a distinct peak of NADPH fluorescence at 450 nm. Fluorescence spectra with the mutant enzyme B (GFOR-deficient) at the same conditions showed clearly enhanced tryptophan fluorescence compared with the wild-type enzyme, with the same emission maximum at 330 nm (Fig. 5). However, no NADPH fluorescence at 450 nm could be measured. Mutant A showed the same fluorescence emission spectra as the wild-type GFORΔ32–46, and mutant C behaved similarly to mutant B (data not shown).Table IGlucose-fructose oxidoreductase and glucose dehydrogenase activitiesGFOR activityGlcDH activity−NADP+NADPμmol/min/mgμmol/min/mgGFORΔ32–46144 ± 7136 ± 10NDMutant A154 ± 4159 ± 3NDMutant BND43 ± 23.6 ± 0.1Mutant CND41 ± 13.1 ± 0.3Mutant DNDND4.2 ± 0.2Mutant ENDND4.4 ± 0.1GFORΔ2–74NDNDNDMutant FNDND2.8 ± 0.1Mutant GNDND3.6 ± 0.1Specific GFOR and glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) activities of GFORΔ32–46, GFORΔ2–74, and mutants thereof (compare with Fig. 4) are shown.

The final concentration of enzyme was 5 μg/ml and 20 μm NADP in the assay mix. To examine whether the differences in intensity of tryptophan fluorescence between wild-type GFOR and mutant B reflected differences in the native conformation, the respective enzymes were denaturated with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. In the denatured state, wild-type GFOR and mutant B showed the same intensity of tryptophan fluorescence and the NADPH fluorescence at 450 nm of wild-type GFOR vanished (Fig. 5). These results indicate that mutant B did not contain the tightly bound cofactor NADP(H). Moreover, in wild-type GFOR a quenching of tryptophan fluorescence energy occurred, most likely by a direct transfer of fluorescence energy from tryptophan residues to the 1,4-dihydronicotineamide ring of NADPH which does not absorb light at a wavelength of 295 nm. To release any bound cofactor (oxidized or reduced forms of NADP or NAD), protein from wild-type GFORΔ32–46, mutant A, and mutant B was denatured by perchloric acid, and the supernatants were analyzed for NAD(P) by HPLC. NADP was detected with GFORΔ32–46 and from mutant protein A. No NADP appeared from mutant B. NAD was not detected from any protein (data not shown). We deduce that a single amino acid residue exchange (S116D) is sufficient to destroy tight cofactor binding to GFOR. The enzymatic assay for GFOR activity is usually performed withou"
https://openalex.org/W2008211868,"Two-component signal transduction systems involving histidine autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to an aspartate residue on a receiver molecule have only recently been discovered in eukaryotes, although they are well studied in prokaryotes. The Sln1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis a two-component regulator involved in osmotolerance. Phosphorylation of Sln1p leads to inhibition of the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase osmosensing pathway. We have discovered a second function of Sln1p by identifying recessive activated alleles (designatednrp2) that regulate the essential transcription factor Mcm1. nrp2 alleles cause a 5-fold increase in the activity of an Mcm1-dependent reporter, whereas deletion ofSLN1 causes a 10-fold decrease in reporter activity and a corresponding decrease in expression of Mcm1-dependent genes. In addition to activating Mcm1p, nrp2 mutants exhibit reduced phosphorylation of Hog1p and increased osmosensitivity suggesting that nrp2 mutations shift the Sln1p equilibrium toward the phosphorylated state. Two nrp2 mutations map to conserved residues in the receiver domain (P1148S and P1196L) and correspond to residues implicated in bacterial receivers to control receiver phosphorylation state. Thus, it appears that increased Sln1p phosphorylation both stimulates Mcm1p activity and diminishes signaling through the Hog1 osmosensing pathway.

Thus, it appears that increased Sln1p phosphorylation both stimulates Mcm1p activity and diminishes signaling through the Hog1 osmosensing pathway. Two-component regulators are a family of signal transduction molecules prevalent in prokaryotic organisms that play a major role in the adaptation of microorganisms to changes in the extracellular environment (1Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 2Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The response of cells to chemotactic agents, sporulation conditions, and changes in osmolarity, for example, are each governed by two-component regulators in which information about external conditions is converted via a sensor-associated kinase into high energy phosphoryl groups on histidine and aspartate side chains ultimately activating an appropriate set of genes. The “two-component” designation derives from the observation that in many cases the pertinent activities are divided between two polypeptides. One is designated the “sensor/kinase” and contains an extracellular domain (sensor) and a histidine autokinase activity (transmitter). The second is called the response regulator and is made up of a receiver domain containing a conserved aspartate residue and, in some cases, an output domain. Two-component regulators have been recently identified in eukaryotes including Arapidopsis, Saccharomyces,Dictyostelium, and Neurospora (3Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 485-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In most of these eukaryotic examples, the transmitter and the receiver domains are present in a single hybrid molecule. Examples of hybrid kinases are also known in prokaryotes, and in certain cases, the attached receiver domain is thought to regulate phosphotransfer to a cytoplasmic receiver containing an output domain (4Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chang C.-H. Winans S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7033-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The strength of the signal through a given pathway is determined by the stability of the phosphoryl aspartate whose susceptibility to hydrolysis depends on the tertiary or higher order structure of the receiver domain. Stability of the aspartyl phosphate may be regulated by “phosphatase” activities present either in the sensor/kinase, receiver domain, or in auxiliary factors (6Perego M. Hoch J.A. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 97-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Stock J.B. Surett M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). Whether the role of these phosphatases is enzymatic or rather to trigger a conformational alteration that alters the exposure of the residue to water is unclear. The yeast SLN1 gene is a member of the two-component family that encodes a hybrid kinase including sensor, histidine kinase, and receiver domains (8Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Its role is to sense and respond to changes in osmolarity by regulating a MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; P, Mcm1 binding site; P-lacZ, Mcm1-dependent reporter; kb, kilobase pair(s); UAS, upstream activation sequence; UASG, upstream activation sequence from the GAL1, 10 genes; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid. kinase pathway composed of Hog1p (MAP kinase), Pbs2p (MAP kinase kinase), and Ssk2p/Ssk22p (two MAP kinase kinase kinases) (9Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Sln1p phosphorylates a second two-component molecule, Ssk1p consisting of a receiver domain, via the phosphorelay intermediate, Ypd1p (10Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Under conditions of increased osmolarity, the equilibrium between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Sln1p shifts to favor the unphosphorylated form (10Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), and the resulting accumulation of unphosphorylated Ssk1p leads to activation of the Hog1 MAP kinase pathway (9Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Hog1p, in turn, activates a set of hyperosmotic response genes necessary for survival under increased external osmotic pressure (11Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Also contributing to Hog1p phosphorylation in response to hyperosmolarity is Sho1p, a putative membrane-associated molecule that interacts with the Hog1p kinase Pbs2p via its Src homology 3 domain (12Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Alleles of the SLN1 gene that increase expression of an Mcm1-dependent reporter were previously isolated in a screen for mutants that increased the activity of theCYC1-lacZ reporter gene under the control of a high affinity Mcm1 binding site (referred to as a P site) (13Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Deletion of theSLN1 gene causes a 10-fold reduction in Mcm1-dependent reporter gene expression without affecting Mcm1p levels, thus Sln1p is an activator of Mcm1p or of an Mcm1p auxiliary protein, and the so-called nrp2 (negative regulator of P site) mutants are recessive activating alleles ofSLN1 (13Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since deletion of the HOG1 gene has no effect on the activity of an Mcm1-dependent reporter, we suggested that Mcm1p is not directly regulated by Hog1p and that Sln1p has two separate regulatory functions (13Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, how Sln1p accomplishes both functions. Although the mechanism by which Sln1p regulates the Hog1 MAP kinase pathway involves phophorylation and phosphotransfer, whether the same activities are required for Sln1p regulation of Mcm1p is an open question. In addition, although we have shown that Hog1p is not required for Sln1p activation of Mcm1p, other intermediates in the Sln1-Hog1 pathway have not been tested so the point at which the two “pathways” branch has not been defined. Our present results indicate that Sln1p activation of Mcm1p uses regulatory mechanisms in common with Sln1p activation of the Hog1 pathway and indicates that signaling through the two pathways may depend on the same phosphorelay capabilities of Sln1p. The hypothesis that the nrp2 mutations affect the Sln1p phosphorylation state is further supported by our finding in two instances that the amino acid changes responsible for the nrp2 mutant phenotype map to positions likely to have an effect on the equilibrium between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Sln1p. Based on these results, we propose a model in which shifting the equilibrium of Sln1 to the phosphorylated state results in inactivation of the Hog1 pathway and activation of the Mcm1 pathway. Given the multiple roles of Mcm1p in growth control and cell physiology, this may represent an integrated mechanism by which cells respond to stress.

Yeast strains containing the UASG-regulated Sln1 receiver domain (pBG95) were grown in 2% raffinose to early log phase at which time 3% galactose or 2% glucose was added. Cultures were incubated for approximately 5 h before being harvested for preparation of protein extracts. Extracts were prepared by a glass bead disruption protocol (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.E. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2.

Following electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose, filters were blocked for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% milk powder dissolved in 0.1% Tween/phosphate-buffered saline. Filters were subsequently incubated (6 h) with HA antibody (1:1000) (Babco) followed by secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:2500) (Sigma). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). ThreeSLN1 gapped plasmids (A, B, and C) were generated by digesting pHL589 with EcoRI/StuI (A),StuI/ClaI (B), orBstEII/MluI (C). Gap rescue (23Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) was performed by transforming gap A, B, or C plasmids into mutant yeast strains harboring the nrp2-1 (JF1356), nrp2-2 (JF1357), or nrp2-3 (JF1358) mutations. The presence of the mutation on a rescued gap plasmid was assessed by the blue color of colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside plates. Plasmids were rescued from yeast (24Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar) and subjected to sequence analysis. The sequence of both strands was determined. In vitro mutagenesis (nrp2-1) or subcloning of restriction fragment (nrp2-2 and nrp2-3) encompassing the presumed missense mutation was done to confirm the identity of each mutation. Cells were cultured to early log phase (1 × 107/ml) and serially diluted 1:10 in YPD or YPD + 0.9 m NaCl. Two μl of the appropriate dilutions were spotted onto YPD and YPD + 0.9 mNaCl plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for up to 3 days. Cells were cultured to early log phase (7 × 106/ml) in YPD at which time solid NaCl was added to 0.4 m. 10-ml aliquots were taken at indicated times following the addition of salt. The t = 0 time point was taken prior to the addition of salt. Cells were pelleted at 4 °C at low speed and frozen in dry ice prior to storage at −70 °C. Cell pellets were washed once with 5 ml of cold protease inhibitor mixture (50 μg/ml leupeptin, 23 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in water). Extracts were processed for antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots essentially as described by Maedaet al. (9Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS acrylamide gels (6% stacking gel) and electroblotted to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose (Protrans, Schliecher & Schuell). The nitrocellulose filter was blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) + 4% bovine serum albumin, washed twice for 10 min in TBST, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with RC20 recombinant antiphosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:2500 in TBST + 4% bovine serum albumin, and washed twice with TBST. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Activation of the Hog1 MAP kinase pathway depends on the phospho-relay capabilities of the Sln1p hybrid kinase (9Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Mutation of either the phosphorylated histidine or the phosphorylated aspartate confers a phenotype equivalent to the null, indicating the requirement of these residues for signaling (9Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Activation of Mcm1-dependent transcription may likewise involve Sln1p phosphorylation and phosphotransfer to downstream molecules. Alternatively, activation of Mcm1p may be independent of the phosphorylation state of Sln1p. Assessment of Mcm1p activity in the null or in phosphorylation defective mutants is difficult since the SLN1 deletion mutation causes lethality on rich media and extremely slow growth on minimal media in some genetic backgrounds (13Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and unconditional lethality in other genetic backgrounds (9Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). To circumvent these difficulties, we tested the involvement of Sln1p phospho-intermediates in Mcm1 signaling by examining the effect of the nrp2mutations on the ability of cells to respond to osmotic stress. If the stimulating effect of nrp2 mutations on Mcm1-dependent transcription is due to a shift in the Sln1p equilibrium to the phosphorylated state, for example, the resulting decrease in unphosphorylated Sln1p might limit the amount of unphosphorylated Ssk1p available to trigger a normal osmotic response. To test this idea, we examined the osmotic sensitivity of ournrp2 mutants. To render the cell completely dependent on Sln1p signaling for its response to hyperosmolarity (12Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), it was necessary to first delete theSHO1 gene which encodes a second osmosensor. The SHO1 gene was deleted by one-step disruption in nrp2-1 and nrp2-3 strains. The osmotolerance of isogenic nrp2-1 and nrp2-1 sho1-Δ strains and isogenic sho1-Δ and wild type strains was compared by spotting serial dilutions of cells on 0.9m NaCl plates or on unsupplemented YPD media.SHO1 + SLN1 + cells exhibited normal viability on 0.9 m NaCl although colony size was reduced. Strains lacking the Hog1 MAP kinase, on the other hand, were extremely sensitive to this condition (Fig.1). Both nrp2-1 and sho1-Δ single mutants grew with wild type viability on 0.9 m NaCl plates at 30 °C; however, the plating efficiency of thenrp2-1sho1 double mutants was reduced approximately 100-fold (Fig. 1). Likewise, the nrp2-3 mutant was partially sensitive to 0.9 m NaCl, and SHO1 deletion exacerbated the effect (Fig. 1). The enhanced osmosensitivity of the double nrp2 sho1 mutant is consistent with nrp2mutations shifting the Sln1 equilibrium to favor the phosphorylated form, thus diminishing or inhibiting the normal effect of increased osmolarity on the activity of the sensor/kinase. To examine in more detail the basis for the osmosensitivity ofnrp2 mutants, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of Hog1p in the nrp2 sho1 double mutant and sho1 andnrp2 single mutants. Strains were grown in rich media, and NaCl was added to 0.4 m at time 0. Aliquots were taken over time for immediate processing, denaturing gel electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. As expected, a 50-kDa band corresponding to Hog1p was apparent in wild type strains at the earliest point assayed (5 min) after addition of salt (Fig.2). Likewise, in sho1 deletion andnrp2 single mutants, Hog1p phosphorylation was rapidly induced and persisted for 15–20 min. In contrast, in the nrp2 sho1 double mutants, Hog1 phosphorylation was not detectable (Fig.2). Taken together, these studies indicate that Mcm1-dependent transcription is stimulated by phosphorylation of Sln1p. To determine if the proposed effects of the nrp2mutations on Sln1p phosphorylation state could be understood at the molecular level, we used gap rescue to localize the mutations and sequence analysis to pinpoint the alterations. Plasmids expressing thenrp2 mutant alleles were constructed by in vitromutagenesis or by swapping the appropriate restriction fragments into the context of wild type SLN1 sequences carried on pHL589. The phenotype of the reconstructed nrp2 alleles was evaluated in a sln1-Δ background following transformation and sporulation of a sln1-Δ/SLN1 +heterozygous diploid (JF1455). Two of the nrp2 alleles,nrp2-2 and nrp2-3, were found to be point mutations leading to changes in conserved proline residues just downstream of the aspartate residue in the Sln1p receiver domain which is the target for phosphorylation (Fig. 3).nrp2-2 is a change to serine at P1148 and nrp2-3is a change to leucine at P1196. The third nrp2 mutation,nrp2-1, is a T550I change in the non-conserved region upstream of the histidine kinase domain in the region linking the kinase to the presumed membrane spanning domains (Fig. 3). The significance of the base pair changes in the nrp2-2 andnrp2-3 mutants can be evaluated by comparison of the Sln1p receiver domain to the bacterial receiver, CheY, for which a crystallographic structure is available. As described in detail below (see “Discussion”), the alignment of Sln1p and CheY receiver domains shows that the nrp2-2 and nrp2-3mutations map to positions that are likely to affect Sln1p function and are consistent with changes in Sln1p phosphorylation state. Since phosphorylated Sln1p inhibits the activity of the Hog1 pathway but appears to stimulate the activity of the Mcm1 pathway, it seemed possible that phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Ssk1p might likewise play opposing roles in regulating the two pathways. We tested the importance of Ssk1p in Sln1-Mcm1 signaling by measuring the effect of an SSK1deletion on the activity of the Mcm1-dependent reporter, P-lacZ (P = Mcm1 binding site). Unlike theSLN1 deletion which causes constitutive activation of the Hog1 pathway, and perhaps, as a result, lethality, SSK1deletion is not lethal. In the absence of Ssk1p, the Hog1 pathway fails to be activated by the Sln1 pathway but is under normal regulation via Sho1p-Pbs2p interactions. If the presence of Ssk1p is required for signaling to Mcm1p, deletion of SSK1 would be expected to prevent the activation of the Mcm1-dependent reporter bynrp2 mutations. To examine the involvement of Ssk1p in Sln1-Mcm1 signaling, we deleted the SSK1 gene by one-step transformation of wild type and nrp2-1 mutant strains. We found that the activity of our reporter was virtually unchanged as a result of SSK1 deletion in either wild type ornrp2 backgrounds (Table III).Table IIISSK1 mutations do not significantly affect P-lacZ activityStrain3-aStrains were as follows: wild type (JF1331);nrp2–1 (JF1359); ssk1-Δ (ssk1-Δ derivatives of JF1331); nrp2–1 ssk1-Δ (ssk1-Δ derivatives of JF1359).Relative β-galactosidase activity,3-bActivities are the averages of at least four measurements.

DNA mismatch repair is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the genome. This DNA repair pathway corrects mispaired or unpaired bases that arise by replication errors, by physical damage to bases (e.g. deamination of 5-methylcytosine), and by the formation of heteroduplex DNA during homologous recombination between similar but not identical sequences (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). In addition, mismatch repair serves to modulate levels of homologous recombination between evolutionarily divergent sequences (2Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 3Selva E.M. New L. Crouse G.F. Lahue R.S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, mismatch repair has been implicated in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and in G2 cell-cycle checkpoint control (reviewed in Ref. 4Kolodner R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar).Numerous genetic and biochemical studies have established the existence of mismatch repair in eukaryotes that bears overall similarity to that seen in prokaryotes including the identification of several eukaryotic MutS and MutL homologs. The recent demonstration that mutations in human MutS and MutL homologs are the underlying defect in many hereditary and sporadic tumors speaks to the prominent role this repair pathway plays in mutation avoidance (reviewed in Refs. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, and5Kunkel T.A.

Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar and6Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). E. coli MutS protein recognizes and binds to mismatches and small insertion/deletion mutations of 1–4 nucleotides. In the presence of ATP, MutL protein forms a complex with MutS bound to a heteroduplex DNA, and together they activate MutH, an endonuclease that incises the DNA at hemimethylated d(GATC) sites, thereby directing excision and repair synthesis to the newly synthesized (and transiently undermethylated) DNA strand. The nature of the strand discrimination signal in other prokaryotes and in eukaryotes where no equivalent dam methylation systems have been found is unclear, but it may involve single-strand breaks or ends (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar).The means by which MutS proteins discriminate between damaged and undamaged DNA poses an intriguing problem in protein-DNA recognition. The mismatch repair machinery of E. coli discriminates among different mismatches (reviewed in Ref. 6Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). G:T, A:C, A:A, and G:G mismatches are efficiently repaired, whereas the repair efficiencies of T:T, T:C, and A:G mismatches are dependent on sequence context. In contrast, C:C mismatches are very poor substrates for the mismatch repair pathway. X-ray diffraction and NMR studies indicate that, to a first approximation, most base pair mismatches are relatively well accommodated within the DNA helix and introduce only minor distortions (reviewed in Refs. 7Kennard O. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1985; 3: 205-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 8Patel D.J. Shapiro L. Hare D. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 70-84Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these localized conformational changes can, in some cases, be detected biochemically,e.g. by alterations in the binding mode of the minor groove reporter neocarzinostatin (9Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9081-9089Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or by hypersensitivity to osmium tetroxide in the case of a G:T mismatch (10Bhattacharyya A. Lilley D.M.J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several studies have concluded that efficient repair is, roughly speaking, correlated with the propensity for a given mismatch to be stacked within the helix. Thus, intrahelical wobble base pairs (e.g. G:T, A:C, A:A, and G:G) may be repaired more readily than looped out base pairs (e.g. C:C, C:T, and T:T) (11Fazakerley G.V. Quignard E. Woisard A.

The recognition of DNA bulges is complicated by the fact that unpaired bases are, for the most part, stacked within the helix, although in some cases, unpaired pyrimidines have been observed to be extrahelical, and heteroduplexes containing unpaired bases are sometimes associated with compensatory kinks or bends (reviewed in Ref. 14Turner D.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 334-337Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar).To begin to address the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition by MutS protein, we have initiated biochemical studies of heteroduplex DNA binding by a thermostable MutS protein from Thermus aquaticus. This protein binds specifically to heteroduplex DNAs containing mispaired or unpaired bases over a broad temperature range up to 70 °C (15Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we utilize enzymatic and chemical probes to identify regions of the heteroduplex DNA that are in close association with Taq MutS protein. Our data reveal that critical contact points reside in the immediate vicinity of an unpaired base in both the major and minor grooves of a heteroduplex DNA.DISCUSSIONEnzymatic and chemical footprinting identify regions of a heteroduplex DNA containing a single unpaired thymidine residue or a G:T mismatch that interact with a thermostable MutS mismatch repair protein. The DNase I footprint of the complex extends approximately three turns of the DNA helix more or less centered on the lesion. Chemical probes delineate protein-DNA interactions involving no more than one turn of the DNA helix in either direction flanking the lesion. Interactions involving a very limited number of nucleotides are consistent with the absence of a defined consensus sequence for mismatch recognition by MutS protein. Taq MutS protein contacts the major groove and the sugar-phosphate backbone of the heteroduplex in the region of an unpaired base. In addition, hydroxyl radical and phenanthroline-copper footprinting strongly suggest that MutS protein is also closely associated with the minor groove in the immediate vicinity of the unpaired base, although distortion of the minor groove as a consequence of binding elsewhere cannot be ruled out. Based on these data, we propose that Taq MutS makes extensive contacts with the periphery of the helix in the vicinity of the lesion.Protein contacts involving the major groove of a Δ1 insertion/deletion heteroduplex in two different sequence contexts as well as a G:T heteroduplex are identified as a result of protection from methylation of neighboring guanine residues on either side of the lesion. Methylation interference implicates the same critical guanine residues in heteroduplex binding. Two regions of hydroxyl radical protection offset in the 5′ direction are also consistent with major groove interactions in the immediate vicinity of the lesion. Independent evidence for major groove contacts involving TaqMutS protein stem from photocross-linking studies in which the cross-linking moiety is located in the major groove of a heteroduplex DNA. 1V. Malkov, I. Biswas, R. D. Camerini-Otero, and P. Hsieh, submitted for publication. Close association of the Taq MutS protein with the opposing minor groove in the vicinity of the lesion is supported by hydroxyl radical and phenanthroline-copper footprinting results. Hydroxyl radical footprinting of the Taq MutS-Δ1 heteroduplex complex reveals a pair of completely protected regions in complementary strands offset by 3 nucleotides in the 3′ direction. This pattern of strong protection from hydroxyl radical cleavage is characteristic of minor groove binding as first demonstrated for λ repressor (22Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 87: 5469-5473Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and subsequently for other proteins including E. coli IHF protein (32Yang C.-C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), TFIID (33Lee D.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and Flp recombinase (17Kimball A. Kimball M.L. Jayaram M. Tullius T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although we cannot rule out MutS-induced distortion of the minor groove in the absence of minor groove binding, the pattern of hydroxyl radical cleavage does rule out alignment of Taq MutS protein along only one side of the DNA, since no pattern of periodic protection coinciding with the helical repeat of DNA was observed.Binding of Taq MutS protein to a Δ1 or G:T heteroduplex also affords complete protection from 1,10-phenanthroline-copper modification of approximately 6 residues on both strands centered on the lesion (Figs. 6 and 8 B). Such extensive protection in conjunction with hydroxyl radical footprinting, discussed above, and ethylation interference, see below, argue strongly for protein contacts involving the minor groove.Ethylation interference studies identify several phosphates in both strands of the heteroduplex as being important for binding and are consistent with the protein contacting both the major and minor grooves in the vicinity of the unpaired base (see Fig. 10). Ethylation of phosphates located 3′ to every critical guanine residue identified in methylation protection/interference studies abolished MutS binding. Likewise, ethylation of phosphates 3′ to every protected residue identified in hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments, with the exception of the unpaired thymidine, also abolished binding.Our results confirm and extend previous studies concerning interactions between MutS proteins and heteroduplex DNA. DNase I protection and methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) cleavage experiments of E. coli MutS protein bound to various mismatches revealed highly localized interactions (12Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). E. coli MutS protected about 22 bases in each strand from DNase I cleavage, although, in contrast toTaq MutS protein, the pattern of protection for E. coli MutS protein was asymmetric with respect to the mismatch (insertion/deletion mutations were not examined). In the case of the methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) footprinting, protection extended some 8–12 bases, depending on the mismatch. Methylation interference studies of partially purified human GTBP bound to a G:T mismatch identified flanking guanines and to some extent adenosines as being important for binding, although methylation of guanines 2 or more bases away from the mismatch had no effect (34Jiricny J. Hughes M. Corman N. Rudkin B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8860-8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The interaction of MutS protein with the heteroduplex DNA is reminiscent of the binding interactions of another DNA repair protein,E. coli MutY, that recognizes G:A mismatches (35Lu A.-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on alkylation interference and substrate specificity studies, those authors concluded that MutY binds to both the major and minor grooves in the vicinity of the mismatch as well as to several critical phosphate groups.Central to the issue of recognition of mispaired and unpaired bases by MutS proteins is the structure of the DNA heteroduplex containing such a lesion. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of DNA structure as it relates to mismatches or bulges is far from complete. However, NMR, x-ray diffraction, electrophoretic, and thermodynamic studies reveal little structural similarity between DNA bulges and mismatches.Both x-ray crystallographic and NMR studies reveal that the G:T mismatch assumes a “wobble” type hydrogen bonding scheme utilizing the major tautomers of the bases (reviewed in Refs. 28Kennard O. Salisbury S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10701-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hunter W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Patel D.J. Shapiro L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 423-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this structure, the thymine is displaced toward the major groove. Distortions of the G:T heteroduplex are not as extensive as for a bulged DNA (see below), although the mismatch does result in localized structural distortions including alterations in base stacking in adjacent residues in some instances (8Patel D.J. Shapiro L. Hare D. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 70-84Google Scholar). In addition, a G:T mismatch has been shown to alter the attack site of the minor groove intercalator neocarzinostatin (9Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9081-9089Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the mispaired thymidine in a G:T mismatch can be hypersensitive to modification by osmium tetroxide (10Bhattacharyya A. Lilley D.M.J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Unpaired bases can be extrahelical or stacked within the helix. Unpaired purines are largely stacked within the DNA helix at all temperatures and in several different sequence contexts (38Kalnik M.W. Norman D.G. Swann P.F. Patel D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3702-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Woodson S.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3130-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Rosen M.A. Live D.

Biol. 1993; 229: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pyrimidine bulges can be either extrahelical or intrahelical, depending on sequence and temperature. In general, pyrimidine bulges are looped out at lower temperatures, i.e. 0 °C, and stacked within the helix at higher temperatures, i.e. 35 °C (30Kalnik M.W. Norman D.G. Zagorski M.G. Swann P.F.

In some although not all cases, the presence of a DNA bulge confers a bend in the DNA helix (reviewed in Ref. 14Turner D.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 334-337Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The extent of bending can be influenced by the identity of the nucleotides in the bulge (unpaired purines cause greater bending than unpaired pyrimidines), the size of the bulge, and the flanking sequence (10Bhattacharyya A. Lilley D.M.J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Rice J.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4512-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,47Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1358-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). While the conformation of the unpaired thymidine in the DNA substrate shown in Fig. 2 is unknown, it may be stacked within the helix, as has been established by NMR for another bulged heteroduplex consisting of one unpaired thymidine flanked by guanine residues (44Kalnik M.W. Norman D.G. Li B.F. Swann P.F. Patel D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 636-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the thymidine is stacked within the helix, it is still subject to hypermodification by 1,10-phenanthroline-copper and OsO4prior to being bound by MutS, and the presence of the unpaired base introduces distortion of neighboring residues as detected by phenanthroline-copper footprinting of naked heteroduplexes.A possible mechanism for the recognition of insertion/deletion and mismatch lesions by MutS proteins is one that has been invoked for nucleotide excision repair to explain damage-specific recognition of a broad spectrum of DNA lesions that share no obvious structural similarities (reviewed in Refs. 48Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1993; 289: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and 49Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar)). In this scheme, recognition is mediated through protein-induced deformation of the DNA rather than direct recognition of structurally diverse substrates. Presumably, lesions that are targets for excision repair facilitate the formation of an altered conformation, thereby shifting the equilibrium in favor of the formation of a stable protein-DNA complex. Based on the work presented here and the work of others, we speculate thatTaq MutS binds and distorts the heteroduplex DNA and utilizes extensive contacts with the periphery of the helix to gauge the extent to which a region of DNA can accommodate protein-induced strain. Both Mg2+ and ATP cofactors have been shown to modulate heteroduplex binding by MutS proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar and4Kolodner R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and such modulation may be an integral component of the target search by MutS. In this regard, it is noteworthy that E. coli MutS protein has been shown to form α structures in the presence of ATP, suggesting that it can translocate along the DNA (6Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar).This study provides new details on the interactions between MutS protein and a heteroduplex DNA. Problems to be pursued include the identification of regions of MutS protein that contact the major and minor grooves of the heteroduplex, the determination of protein-induced DNA distortion, and an examination of how contacts between MutS protein and the heteroduplex DNA are modulated during repair. DNA mismatch repair is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the genome. This DNA repair pathway corrects mispaired or unpaired bases that arise by replication errors, by physical damage to bases (e.g. deamination of 5-methylcytosine), and by the formation of heteroduplex DNA during homologous recombination between similar but not identical sequences (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). In addition, mismatch repair serves to modulate levels of homologous recombination between evolutionarily divergent sequences (2Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 3Selva E.M. New L. Crouse G.F. Lahue R.S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, mismatch repair has been implicated in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and in G2 cell-cycle checkpoint control (reviewed in Ref. 4Kolodner R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Numerous genetic and biochemical studies have established the existence of mismatch repair in eukaryotes that bears overall similarity to that seen in prokaryotes including the identification of several eukaryotic MutS and MutL homologs. The recent demonstration that mutations in human MutS and MutL homologs are the underlying defect in many hereditary and sporadic tumors speaks to the prominent role this repair pathway plays in mutation avoidance (reviewed in Refs. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, and5Kunkel T.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The most thoroughly studied mismatch repair system is methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli (reviewed in Refs. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar and6Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). E. coli MutS protein recognizes and binds to mismatches and small insertion/deletion mutations of 1–4 nucleotides. In the presence of ATP, MutL protein forms a complex with MutS bound to a heteroduplex DNA, and together they activate MutH, an endonuclease that incises the DNA at hemimethylated d(GATC) sites, thereby directing excision and repair synthesis to the newly synthesized (and transiently undermethylated) DNA strand. The nature of the strand discrimination signal in other prokaryotes and in eukaryotes where no equivalent dam methylation systems have been found is unclear, but it may involve single-strand breaks or ends (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The means by which MutS proteins discriminate between damaged and undamaged DNA poses an intriguing problem in protein-DNA recognition. The mismatch repair machinery of E. coli discriminates among different mismatches (reviewed in Ref. 6Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). G:T, A:C, A:A, and G:G mismatches are efficiently repaired, whereas the repair efficiencies of T:T, T:C, and A:G mismatches are dependent on sequence context. In contrast, C:C mismatches are very poor substrates for the mismatch repair pathway. X-ray diffraction and NMR studies indicate that, to a first approximation, most base pair mismatches are relatively well accommodated within the DNA helix and introduce only minor distortions (reviewed in Refs. 7Kennard O. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1985; 3: 205-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 8Patel D.J. Shapiro L. Hare D. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 70-84Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these localized conformational changes can, in some cases, be detected biochemically,e.g. by alterations in the binding mode of the minor groove reporter neocarzinostatin (9Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9081-9089Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or by hypersensitivity to osmium tetroxide in the case of a G:T mismatch (10Bhattacharyya A. Lilley D.M.J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several studies have concluded that efficient repair is, roughly speaking, correlated with the propensity for a given mismatch to be stacked within the helix. Thus, intrahelical wobble base pairs (e.g. G:T, A:C, A:A, and G:G) may be repaired more readily than looped out base pairs (e.g. C:C, C:T, and T:T) (11Fazakerley G.V. Quignard E. Woisard A.

The recognition of DNA bulges is complicated by the fact that unpaired bases are, for the most part, stacked within the helix, although in some cases, unpaired pyrimidines have been observed to be extrahelical, and heteroduplexes containing unpaired bases are sometimes associated with compensatory kinks or bends (reviewed in Ref. 14Turner D.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 334-337Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To begin to address the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition by MutS protein, we have initiated biochemical studies of heteroduplex DNA binding by a thermostable MutS protein from Thermus aquaticus. This protein binds specifically to heteroduplex DNAs containing mispaired or unpaired bases over a broad temperature range up to 70 °C (15Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we utilize enzymatic and chemical probes to identify regions of the heteroduplex DNA that are in close association with Taq MutS protein. Our data reveal that critical contact points reside in the immediate vicinity of an unpaired base in both the major and minor grooves of a heteroduplex DNA. DISCUSSIONEnzymatic and chemical footprinting identify regions of a heteroduplex DNA containing a single unpaired thymidine residue or a G:T mismatch that interact with a thermostable MutS mismatch repair protein. The DNase I footprint of the complex extends approximately three turns of the DNA helix more or less centered on the lesion. Chemical probes delineate protein-DNA interactions involving no more than one turn of the DNA helix in either direction flanking the lesion. Interactions involving a very limited number of nucleotides are consistent with the absence of a defined consensus sequence for mismatch recognition by MutS protein. Taq MutS protein contacts the major groove and the sugar-phosphate backbone of the heteroduplex in the region of an unpaired base. In addition, hydroxyl radical and phenanthroline-copper footprinting strongly suggest that MutS protein is also closely associated with the minor groove in the immediate vicinity of the unpaired base, although distortion of the minor groove as a consequence of binding elsewhere cannot be ruled out. Based on these data, we propose that Taq MutS makes extensive contacts with the periphery of the helix in the vicinity of the lesion.Protein contacts involving the major groove of a Δ1 insertion/deletion heteroduplex in two different sequence contexts as well as a G:T heteroduplex are identified as a result of protection from methylation of neighboring guanine residues on either side of the lesion. Methylation interference implicates the same critical guanine residues in heteroduplex binding. Two regions of hydroxyl radical protection offset in the 5′ direction are also consistent with major groove interactions in the immediate vicinity of the lesion. Independent evidence for major groove contacts involving TaqMutS protein stem from photocross-linking studies in which the cross-linking moiety is located in the major groove of a heteroduplex DNA. 1V.

This results in an 8-fold increase in oxygen affinity and a marked decrease in cooperativity. Kinetic measurements of ligand binding to the Leu97 mutant suggest an altered unliganded (deoxy) state, which has been confirmed by high resolution crystal structures in the unliganded and carbon monoxide-liganded states. Analysis of the structures at allosteric end points reveals them to be remarkably similar to the corresponding wild-type structures, with differences confined to the disposition of residue 97 side chain, F-helix geometry, and the interface water structure. Increased oxygen affinity results from the absence of the Phe97 side chain, whose tight packing in the heme pocket of the deoxy state normally restricts the heme from assuming a high affinity conformation. The absence of the Phe97 side chain is also associated with diminished cooperativity, since Leu97 packs in the heme pocket in both states. Residual cooperativity appears to be coupled with observed structural transitions and suggests that parallel pathways for communication exist in Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin.

Residual cooperativity appears to be coupled with observed structural transitions and suggests that parallel pathways for communication exist in Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin. The homodimeric hemoglobin (HbI) 1The abbreviations used are: HbI, wild-typeScapharca dimeric hemoglobin; HbI-CO, CO-liganded wild-type HbI; F97L-CO, CO-liganded F97L. from the blood clam Scapharca inaequivalvis offers a simple model system for studying communication between two chemically identical subunits. Analysis of the mechanistic details of this intersubunit communication is being pursued to provide insights into the regulation of protein function. Scapharca HbI binds oxygen cooperatively, with a p50 of 7.8 torr and a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.5 at 20 °C, neither of which changes as pH varies from 5.5 to 9.0 (1Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the individual subunits of HbI have the same myoglobin fold as mammalian hemoglobins, the quaternary assemblage is radically different (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon oxygen binding by HbI, only small tertiary changes are seen at the subunit interface in contrast to the relatively large quaternary changes observed with mammalian hemoglobins (3Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Analysis of structures of this hemoglobin at 1.6 Å for the deoxygenated molecule, 1.4 Å for the CO-liganded form, and 1.7 Å for the oxygenated form has provided a framework for understanding the role of individual side chains and interfacial water in mediating cooperativity (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Condon P.J. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25259-25267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylalanine 97 has a central role in the proposed structural mechanism of cooperativity (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Condon P.J. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25259-25267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The side chain of Phe97undergoes the largest ligand-linked conformational change in HbI. In the deoxy state, it is tightly packed in the heme pocket, whereas upon ligand binding it is displaced from the heme pocket into the subunit interface. The lowered oxygen affinity of the deoxy state appears to result primarily from the packing of Phe97 in the heme pocket, where it restricts movement of the iron atom into the heme plane and lengthens a hydrogen bond involving the proximal histidine. Upon ligation, movement of Phe97 into the subunit interface is coupled with disruption of a well ordered interfacial water cluster and movement of the heme groups deeper within each subunit. These effects within a subunit alter the nature of interactions between subunits, which presumably encourages movement of the Phe97′ side chain (second subunit) into the interface, allowing the second subunit to attain a high oxygen affinity state prior to ligand binding (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In view of its significant role in the proposed cooperative mechanism of HbI, Phe97 is clearly indicated as a target for mutation. Phe97, four residues from the proximal histidine at position 101, is analogous to the fourth residue of the F helix in mammalian hemoglobins, which is a leucine in all known vertebrate hemoglobins and most invertebrate hemoglobins. The smaller size of the leucine side chain in these hemoglobins allows it to remain packed in the heme pocket in both liganded and unliganded states. In this paper, we present functional and high resolution crystallographic studies of the Leu97 HbI (F97L) mutant. This mutation results in increased oxygen affinity and diminished cooperativity that appear correlated with observed ligand-linked structural transitions. Our results confirm the crucial role of residue Phe97 in modulating oxygen binding by HbI, while demonstrating the persistence of residual cooperativity and suggesting that parallel pathways exist for information transfer between subunits. Escherichia coli strain TG1 was used as the host strain for propagating recombinant bacteriophage M13mp18 vector and for in vitro site-directed mutagenesis.E. coli strain W3110lacIq L8 was the host used for overexpression of recombinant HbI (5Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G. Royer Jr., W.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In vitro oligonucleotide-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the F97L mutant. The initially constructed gene for HbI bearing 5′ and 3′ termini complementary to KpnI and SacI sites was cloned into the polylinker region of a M13mp18 bacteriophage vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), which had been cut previously with the same two restriction endonucleases. Following several rounds of plaque purification using TG1 cells as hosts, recombinant single-stranded DNA was isolated (6Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Subsequently, a 19-mer oligonucleotide (University of Massachusetts Medical Center DNA synthesis facility) complementary to the region of the gene coding for residue Phe97 was used in a site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Sculptor in vitromutagenesis system, Amersham Life Science Inc.) to mutate residue 97 to leucine. Following three rounds of plaque purification, single-stranded DNA was isolated and the changes in DNA sequence were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Double-stranded DNA of the replicative form of the vector was then prepared and subjected to AccI and SacI restriction cleavage to isolate a segment of the HbI gene that contains the leucine 97 mutation. This fragment was then subcloned into a similarly digested wild-type HbI gene borne on a pCS26 expression vector that, as reported earlier, has allowed for significant overexpression of recombinant, wild-type HbI protein (5Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G. Royer Jr., W.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant F97L was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described for wild type (5Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G. Royer Jr., W.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic measurements were carried out at 20 °C with a Cary 3 spectrophotometer at a protein concentration of about 6 × 10−5m (heme) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. Oxygen equilibria were measured using a tonometer, according to Rossi-Fanelli and Antonini (7Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 77: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), with a reducing system to minimize protein oxidation (8Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were measured at 20 °C in 0.1m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 in a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco J700 processor in the range 380–650 nm. The deoxygenated derivative was obtained by addition to the oxygenated protein of a small volume of a 1.0 m sodium dithionite solution prepared in deoxygenated buffer. Kinetic measurements using flash photolysis were performed using a YAG laser giving a 9-ns flash of 25 mJ at 532 nm. The beam was telescoped to give a parallel beam 2 mm in diameter colinear with the observing beam supplied from a 75-W xenon arc passing through a blue filter and imaged at the sample within the photolysis beam. The observing beam continued through a Spex 250-mm monochromator to a photomultiplier and amplifier (Teledyne-Philbrick 1321). The output from the amplifier was digitized by a DAS-50 12-bit A/D converter (Metrabyte) and transferred to an IBM personal computer. The combination had an overall response time of 2 μs. Stopped flow measurements were performed with the apparatus described by Gibson and Milnes (9Gibson Q.H. Milnes L. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) in the slightly modified version of the Durrum Corp. (Palo Alto, CA). Data were digitized and recorded as described for flash photolysis using a tungsten lamp as light source. The dead time of the stopped flow experiment (2-cm path) was 2.4 ms. For the low oxygen experiments the apparatus was filled with a dilute solution of sodium dithionite and allowed to stand overnight. It was then washed out repeatedly with buffer bubbled with pure nitrogen before introducing the working solutions. Low oxygen concentrations were obtained by mixing air-equilibrated buffer with nitrogen-bubbled buffer in a syringe. For the oxygen-pulse experiments a strong (5 mm) solution of deoxygenated hemoglobin was diluted into nitrogen-bubbled buffer and solid dithionite was added (10Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6095-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A kinetic equivalent of the two-state model was then developed to simulate the progress of oxygen saturation in oxygen-pulse and other kinetic experiments using a two-step Runge-Kutta process (11Stark P.A. Introduction to Numerical Methods. Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York1970Google Scholar). To make comparisons with experimental data, a set of oxygen-pulse experiments with a series of initial concentrations of oxygen was performed and corresponding simulations were run. The early stages of both the experiments and the simulations were then discarded and the remaining time courses, which do not depart from a single exponential, were fitted using a nonlinear least squares program. In addition to the kinetic parameters for the two-state model it is necessary to supply values for the removal of oxygen from solution by dithionite. This was done empirically with attention directed to reproducing the peak fractional saturation observed with the experiment. Deoxy and carbonmonoxy F97L crystals were grown as described in Ref. 2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, except that both crystal forms were grown from solutions of 40–50 mg/ml hemoglobin. Microseeds obtained by crushing corresponding wild-type HbI crystals were used to nucleate mutant HbI crystal growth. The morphologies of both crystal forms were similar to those of wild-type recombinant HbI. X-ray diffraction data were collected from crystals at room temperature on a R-AXIS IIC imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU 200 rotating anode generator (Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX). Data were processed using software supplied by the manufacturer. The F97L-CO crystals were essentially isomorphous to native crystals, showing the symmetry of monoclinic space group C2, and cell constantsa = 93.25 Å, b = 43.98 Å,c = 83.50 Å, and β = 122.03°. A total of 116 frames was collected from two crystals with an oscillation range of 1.5 to 1.8° for each frame. The overall R merge for 40,595 unique reflections with I/ς > 1 was 5.52% (R merge = Σ|I − <I>|/Σ I, where I is the measured intensity of each reflection and <I> is the mean value for the corresponding unique reflection). This data set represents 93.5% of the predicted unique reflections to Bragg spacings greater than 1.6 Å and 88.8% to 1.5 Å. Deoxygenated F97L HbI crystals showed the symmetry of orthorhombic space group C2221, with cell constants of a= 91.99 Å, b = 44.27 Å, and c = 143.83 Å, essentially isomorphous to native deoxy crystals. The deoxy F97L HbI data set represents diffraction data from a single crystal that was collected in two different orientations. Initially the largec axis (143.8 Å) was aligned horizontally (perpendicular to the spindle axis). The close spacings between reflections along thec* axis necessitated a small oscillation range (0.9°) in this orientation for the 34 oscillation frames collected. In a second set of frames, the crystal was reoriented with its c axis vertical (parallel to the spindle axis). This allowed for the use of a larger oscillation range of 2.5°. A total of 30 oscillation frames was recorded from this crystal orientation. The overallR merge for 27,590 unique reflections derived from 95,839 independent observations with I/ς > 1 was 7.33%. These represent 84.1% of the predicted unique data to Bragg spacings greater than 1.7 Å. The starting models for both CO-liganded and deoxy Leu97 HbI structures were the native HbI structures (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in which residue Phe97 was mutated to leucine using the macromolecular modeling program “O” (12Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Also, the water molecules associated with these structures were deleted and alternate conformers of protein side chains eliminated from the Protein Data Bank coordinate files (entry codes 3SDH and 4SDH). These models were then refined using the XPLOR package (13Brünger A.T X-PLOR. 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Prior to the commencement of refinement, 10% of randomly selected reflections from each data set were designated as test reflections for use with the Free-R cross-validation method (14Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar). Two cycles of simulated annealing were performed, with the first cycle incorporating noncrystallographic symmetry restraints upon the model. The protocol for simulated annealing that was used called for “heating” the molecule to 1000 K followed by 50 steps of 0.5-fs molecular dynamics. After each set of 50 steps, the temperature was lowered by 25 K and 50 new dynamics steps were performed. This procedure was continued until a temperature of 300 K was reached and was followed by 60 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization combined with B-factor refinement. Addition of water molecules to the models was initiated at this stage using the programs PEAKS and LOCATE written by Wayne Hendrickson (Columbia University, New York). Peaks of electron density greater than 3.5 ς in F o − F c maps and 0.8 ς in 2F o − F cmaps that satisfied hydrogen-bonding criteria were identified as locations for water molecules. This procedure was reiterated, resulting in the addition of five and four shells of water to the CO-liganded and deoxy structures, respectively. Each model was subjected to 120 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization combined with B-factor refinement using XPLOR following the addition of each shell of water molecules. Water molecules with refined B-factors greater than 50 Å2were deleted. The model was then examined in conjunction with 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps to locate poorly placed protein side chains and missing water molecules, which were then built. This was followed by 120 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization combined with B-factor refinement. Mutation of phenylalanine 97 to leucine (F97L) inScapharca HbI resulted in increased ligand affinity and diminished cooperativity as observed by both equilibrium and kinetic measurements. The p50 value for oxygen binding, based on equilibrium measurements, decreased from 7.8 to 1.0 torr, and the Hill coefficient decreased from 1.5 to 1.16 ± 0.05. The statistical analysis of all the data sets (n = 12) indicated that the Hill coefficient was significantly higher than 1.0, such that cooperativity, although drastically reduced, was not abolished. A summary of kinetic experiments on ligand binding is presented in Table I. The increased oxygen affinity observed in equilibrium measurements was primarily due to a decrease in the oxygen dissociation rate, particularly at low O2 saturation. Oxygen-pulse and CO-replacement experiments (15Gibson Q.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed a greater than 10-fold decrease in the dissociation rate at low oxygen saturation compared with HbI. In contrast to HbI, there was little or no change in the oxygen-dissociation rate for F97L as a function of varying levels of oxygen saturation (Fig. 1). Additionally, measurements of CO binding to F97L by both stopped flow and flash photolysis showed a clear increase in combination rates compared with wild type.Table IKinetic ligand binding parameters to Scapharca HbI and F97LOxygen on ratesOxygen off ratesCO on ratesk′1k′2k 1k 2l′1l′2μm −1 s −1s −1μm −1 s −1F97LND1-aND, not determined.26401-bOxygen pulse measurements (15).451-bOxygen pulse measurements (15).0.52.3HbI111-cFrom Ref. 23.161-cFrom Ref. 23.4901-cFrom Ref. 23.501-dFrom Ref. 24.0.091-dFrom Ref. 24.0.21-dFrom Ref. 24.Parameters are intrinsic (i.e. no statistical factors).

A prime designates an on rate, and no prime indicates an off rate. The absorption spectra of the oxygenated and CO-liganded derivatives of F97L were almost identical to those reported for native HbI (1Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, significant differences were observed for the deoxygenated derivative. In the Soret region, the band line shape was wider and more symmetric and the absorption maximum was shifted to lower wavelengths by 4 nm. In the visible region, the unusual shoulder present at 590 nm (Qo band) in wild-type HbI was absent (data not shown). The circular dichroism spectra of deoxy F97L (Fig. 2) confirmed the peak shift observed in the absorption spectra and displayed additional interesting features: (i) the overall molar ellipticity values were decreased by 20–25% with respect to HbI, a value that is beyond experimental error; (ii) the ellipticity of the Qo band was reduced; and (iii) the splitting of the Soret band (Bo band), which gives rise to the characteristic negative peak at 419 nm in HbI, was greatly diminished in F97L. Upon substitution of Phe97 with the smaller leucine side chain, the strong Qo band at 590 nm, which is diagnostic of proximal strain in wild-type HbI (1Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Wang C.M. Brinigar W.S. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4961-4977Google Scholar), was reduced. In addition, the asymmetry of the energy and polarization of the electronic transition moments of the components of the Bo band, which gives rise to splitting of the Soret band, was diminished in the mutant in which symmetry was restored. The overall decrease in molar ellipticity in F97L supports the coupled oscillator theory of Hsu and Woody (17Hsu M.C. Woody R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), since the removal of an aromatic ring from within 4 Å of the heme plane is expected to decrease the rotational strength of the coupled π-π* transitions of aromatic residues and heme, thus decreasing the intensity of the Cotton effect. The models for deoxygenated and CO-liganded F97L have been refined against the x-ray data to conventional R-factors of 18.3 and 18.6%, respectively, with excellent stereochemistry (Table II). An electron density map of the heme region of one subunit is shown in Fig.3. Both the unliganded and liganded structures of F97L were found to be strikingly similar to the corresponding structures of wild-type HbI, with significant differences confined to the disposition of residue 97 side chain, F-helix geometry, and the interfacial water structure. Evidence of similarities in the overall structure is presented in Fig. 4.Table IIRefinement statistics on Scapharca F97LCODeoxyResolution limits (Å)10.0–1.510.0–1.7No. of reflections used in refinement (F > 1 ς)37,55724,848R-factor2-aR = Σ | |Fo| − |Fc| |/Σ|Fo|, whereFo is the observed structure factor andFc is that calculated from the model.18.6%18.3%No. of test reflections for R free (F > 1 ς)30382742R free23.1%24.4%No. of nonhydrogen atomsHemoglobin23162312Solvent222174Root mean square deviation from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.0100.011Bond angles (°)2.22.2Dihedrals (°)18.518.2Impropers (°)1.51.5Average B-factors (Å2)Main chain16.720.4Side chain19.823.4Heme atoms16.017.7CO ligands14.4–Solvent atoms37.236.62-a R = Σ | |Fo| − |Fc| |/Σ|Fo|, whereFo is the observed structure factor andFc is that calculated from the model.

In contrast to the similarity in overall B-factors, the core interface water molecules showed significantly higher B-factors in F97L than in wild type. This indicates that these water molecules, which have been implicated in cooperative function in wild-type HbI (18Royer Jr., W.E. Pardanani A. Gibson Q.H. Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike the phenylalanine side chain, which is packed tightly between the heme group and the proximal histidine (residue 101), the smaller Leu97 side chain appeared to be accommodated without strain. This was reflected in differences in heme conformation, position of the heme iron, and subtle changes in F-helix geometry compared with deoxy wild-type HbI, as discussed further below. Upon ligand (CO or O2) binding to wild-type HbI, the Phe97 side chain is displaced into the subunit interface, since its tight pocket is reduced when the iron moves into the heme plane (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, the leucine side chain remained in the heme pocket in F97L upon ligand binding (Fig. 4, bottom). In deoxy wild-type HbI, there is a sharp bend in the F-helix (residues 87–103) (Figs. 4 (top) and 5) that was postulated to result from wedging of the Phe97side chain in the heme pocket (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, this bend, although attenuated, persisted in F97L, where the smaller leucine side chain was readily accommodated in the heme pocket. Subtle differences in F-helix geometry were present including a movement of the backbone toward the heme group, most markedly seen involving the C-α of residue Leu97 (0.5 Å), but also involving Lys96 (0.3 Å) and Glu95 (0.3 Å), as shown in Fig. 5. This change presumably resulted from loss of the tight packing of Phe97between the F-helix backbone and the heme group. Additionally, the distances between the carbonyl oxygens of residues 96 and 97 and the amide nitrogens of residues 100 and 101, respectively (4.5 and 3.9 Å), were slightly less than the corresponding distances in the wild-type deoxy structure. These effects reflect a subtle straightening of the sharp bend observed in the F-helix of deoxy wild-type HbI. Also, the hydrogen bond between the main chain carbonyl oxygen of residue 97 and the Nδ of the proximal histidine, which is hypothesized to play a role in determining oxygen affinity of the heme iron (2Royer Jr., W.E.

To determine the minimal cis-acting requirements for adenine regulation, hybrid promoter constructs were made betweenADE5,7 promoter fragments and a CYC1-lacZreporter. A 139-nucleotide fragment containing two BAS1 binding sites was sufficient to confer adenine regulation on theCYC1-lacZ reporter. Analysis of deletion and substitution mutations led to the conclusion that the proximal BAS1 binding site is both necessary and sufficient for regulation, whereas the distal site augments the function of the proximal site. By performing saturation mutagenesis, we found two essential regions that flank the proximal site. An ABF1 consensus sequence is within one of these regions, and mutations that impaired in vitro ABF1 binding impaired promoter activity in vivo. A second region is AT-rich and appears to bind BAS2. No substitution mutations led to high level constitutive promoter activity as would be expected from removal of an upstream repression sequence. Our results indicate that ABF1, BAS1, and BAS2 are required for ADE5,7 promoter function and that adenine repression most likely involves activator modification or a negative regulator that does not itself bind DNA.

The de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides requires 10 enzymatic steps to form the first purine nucleotide, inosine monophosphate. IMP is converted to either AMP or GMP in two steps. The products of at least 13 genes are required for this synthesis, since mutations in any one of these lead to an adenine requirement (1Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar). Most of these genes encode the biosynthetic enzymes that participate in specific steps of the pathway (ADE1, ADE2, ADE4, ADE5,7, ADE6, ADE8, ADE12, ADE13), others encode enzymes required to produce additional substrates necessary to complete the pathway (ADE3, ASP5), and the function of one gene product is unknown (ADE9). Strains with mutations in two additional genes,BAS1 and BAS2, have a partial adenine requirement (2Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In these latter mutants, expression of the biosynthetic enzymes is low, indicating a positive regulatory role for these gene products (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The expression of BAS1 andBAS2 is not regulated by adenine levels (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T.

Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). BAS1 binds to DNA using an amino-terminal myb motif (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This tryptophan-rich motif is repeated three times in the BAS1 protein (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T.

S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence derived from these six BAS1 binding sites is TGACTC. Interestingly, this hexanucleotide sequence forms the core of the binding site for GCN4 protein as well, although flanking nucleotides differently affect the binding affinity of these two proteins (10Høvring P.I.

Whereas GCN4 has a preference for the sequence RRTGACTCATTT (R represents A or G; Ref. 11Hinnebusch A.G. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R.

Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The BAS2 binding site at HIS4 has been mapped to an A + T-rich repeat, TTAA (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggested that BAS2 binds to the ADE2 and ADE5,7promoters; however, no specific binding sites were identified (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to participating with BAS1 in transcriptional activation ofHIS4 and the ADE genes, BAS2 (also known as PHO2 and GRF10) stimulates transcription of PHO5 (12Johnston M. Carlson M.

BAS2 also interacts with PHO4 to induce PHO5 transcription under phosphate starvation conditions (16Oshima Y. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 159-180Google Scholar). Binding of PHO4 is BAS2-dependent and restricted to derepressing conditions as shown by in vivo footprinting experiments (17Venter U. Svaren J. Schmitz J. Schmid A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4848-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There is evidence that BAS2 and PHO4 physically interact at the promoter and that this interaction is regulated by phosphate (18Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Because expression of the genes that are activated by BAS1 and BAS2 is lower when cells are grown in adenine excess, adenine antagonizes the activation function of one or both of these proteins. Excess adenine could inhibit their ability to interact with one another, to bind to DNA, or to interact with components of the transcriptional machinery. Down-regulation of BAS protein function could also occur by covalent modification or through binding of a negative regulator, analogous to binding of the repressor GAL80 to the activator GAL4 (12Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). Alternatively, a DNA binding repressor might interact with negative control sites in the promoter, as described for the MIG1-TUP1-SSN6 complex that mediates the carbon catabolite repression ofGAL genes (12Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar).To define more clearly the cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements required for adenine regulation, we performed an extensive analysis of the ADE5,7 promoter. First, we identified the minimal sequences from ADE5,7 sufficient to confer adenine-regulated activation (UASADE5,7 1The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activation sequence; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; (His)6-, a six-histidine tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; SD, synthetic dextrose. 1The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activation sequence; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; (His)6-, a six-histidine tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; SD, synthetic dextrose. function) to a heterologous CYC1-lacZ reporter lacking its native UASCYC. We then subjected the minimal UASADE5,7 to extensive mutagenesis by making successive 3-nucleotide substitutions across this element to identify precisely the critical nucleotides contained therein. Our results indicate that of the two BAS1 binding sites at UASADE5,7, the gene-proximal copy is the more critical, being both necessary and sufficient for adenine-regulated promoter activity. Two additional regions were essential for UASADE5,7 function. One region, located 5′ to the critical BAS1 site, is a binding site for ABF1. The other, located 3′ to the critical BAS1 site, is an extended A + T-rich element that appears to be a Bas2 binding site. We found that none of the nucleotide substitutions in the UASADE5,7 led to constitutively derepressed expression, the phenotype expected from the loss of a repressor binding site. Thus, our results suggest that the repression of UASADE5,7 function in adenine-replete cells involves a modification of one of the three transcriptional activator proteins, BAS1, BAS2, or ABF1, rather than binding of a repressor. The de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides requires 10 enzymatic steps to form the first purine nucleotide, inosine monophosphate. IMP is converted to either AMP or GMP in two steps. The products of at least 13 genes are required for this synthesis, since mutations in any one of these lead to an adenine requirement (1Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R.

Most of these genes encode the biosynthetic enzymes that participate in specific steps of the pathway (ADE1, ADE2, ADE4, ADE5,7, ADE6, ADE8, ADE12, ADE13), others encode enzymes required to produce additional substrates necessary to complete the pathway (ADE3, ASP5), and the function of one gene product is unknown (ADE9). Strains with mutations in two additional genes,BAS1 and BAS2, have a partial adenine requirement (2Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In these latter mutants, expression of the biosynthetic enzymes is low, indicating a positive regulatory role for these gene products (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,4Stotz A. Muller P.P. Linder P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression of the adenine biosynthetic genes is repressed when cells are grown in the presence of adenine (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This adenine-mediated repression occurs at the transcriptional level (7Rolfes R.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ADE gene transcription is unregulated in bas1 or bas2mutant strains (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The expression of BAS1 andBAS2 is not regulated by adenine levels (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Zhang, F., Kirouac, M., Zhu, N., Hinnebusch, A. G., and Rolfes, R. J. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. , 17, in press.Google Scholar), however, indicating that adenine repression occurs by down-regulating the activator functions of the BAS1 or BAS2 proteins. BAS1 and BAS2 were identified as transcriptional activator proteins required for the basal expression of the HIS4 gene (2Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). BAS1 binds to DNA using an amino-terminal myb motif (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This tryptophan-rich motif is repeated three times in the BAS1 protein (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,10Høvring P.I. Bostad A. Ording E. Myrset A.H. Gabrielsen O.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17663-17669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAS1 binds to two sites in the HIS4 promoter (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and to two sites in each of the promoters for the ADE2 andADE5,7 genes (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence derived from these six BAS1 binding sites is TGACTC. Interestingly, this hexanucleotide sequence forms the core of the binding site for GCN4 protein as well, although flanking nucleotides differently affect the binding affinity of these two proteins (10Høvring P.I. Bostad A. Ording E. Myrset A.H. Gabrielsen O.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17663-17669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hinnebusch A.G. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar). Whereas GCN4 has a preference for the sequence RRTGACTCATTT (R represents A or G; Ref. 11Hinnebusch A.G. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar), none of the known BAS1 sites or any predicted sites in other ADEgene promoters have either an A nucleotide at the 3′ base following the conserved hexanucleotide core or any other sequence conservation. BAS2 binds to DNA via an amino-terminal homeodomain that is closely related to the engrailed protein of Drosophila (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The BAS2 binding site at HIS4 has been mapped to an A + T-rich repeat, TTAA (8Tice-Baldwin K. Fink G.R. Arndt K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggested that BAS2 binds to the ADE2 and ADE5,7promoters; however, no specific binding sites were identified (3Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to participating with BAS1 in transcriptional activation ofHIS4 and the ADE genes, BAS2 (also known as PHO2 and GRF10) stimulates transcription of PHO5 (12Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar) andHO (13Brazas R.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5524-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). High level transcription of HO requires BAS2 in conjunction with SWI5 (13Brazas R.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5524-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Brazas R.M. Stillman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 11237-11241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Binding of BAS2 and SW15 to theHO promoter is cooperative in vitro (13Brazas R.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5524-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Brazas R.M.

BAS2 also interacts with PHO4 to induce PHO5 transcription under phosphate starvation conditions (16Oshima Y. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 159-180Google Scholar). Binding of PHO4 is BAS2-dependent and restricted to derepressing conditions as shown by in vivo footprinting experiments (17Venter U. Svaren J. Schmitz J. Schmid A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4848-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There is evidence that BAS2 and PHO4 physically interact at the promoter and that this interaction is regulated by phosphate (18Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because expression of the genes that are activated by BAS1 and BAS2 is lower when cells are grown in adenine excess, adenine antagonizes the activation function of one or both of these proteins. Excess adenine could inhibit their ability to interact with one another, to bind to DNA, or to interact with components of the transcriptional machinery. Down-regulation of BAS protein function could also occur by covalent modification or through binding of a negative regulator, analogous to binding of the repressor GAL80 to the activator GAL4 (12Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). Alternatively, a DNA binding repressor might interact with negative control sites in the promoter, as described for the MIG1-TUP1-SSN6 complex that mediates the carbon catabolite repression ofGAL genes (12Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). To define more clearly the cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements required for adenine regulation, we performed an extensive analysis of the ADE5,7 promoter. First, we identified the minimal sequences from ADE5,7 sufficient to confer adenine-regulated activation (UASADE5,7 1The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activation sequence; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; (His)6-, a six-histidine tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; SD, synthetic dextrose. 1The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activation sequence; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; (His)6-, a six-histidine tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; SD, synthetic dextrose. function) to a heterologous CYC1-lacZ reporter lacking its native UASCYC. We then subjected the minimal UASADE5,7 to extensive mutagenesis by making successive 3-nucleotide substitutions across this element to identify precisely the critical nucleotides contained therein. Our results indicate that of the two BAS1 binding sites at UASADE5,7, the gene-proximal copy is the more critical, being both necessary and sufficient for adenine-regulated promoter activity. Two additional regions were essential for UASADE5,7 function. One region, located 5′ to the critical BAS1 site, is a binding site for ABF1. The other, located 3′ to the critical BAS1 site, is an extended A + T-rich element that appears to be a Bas2 binding site. We found that none of the nucleotide substitutions in the UASADE5,7 led to constitutively derepressed expression, the phenotype expected from the loss of a repressor binding site. Thus, our results suggest that the repression of UASADE5,7 function in adenine-replete cells involves a modification of one of the three transcriptional activator proteins, BAS1, BAS2, or ABF1, rather than binding of a repressor.

https://openalex.org/W2088524278,"Basal and induced transcription of pheromone-dependent genes is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent way. FUS1, a gene strongly induced after pheromone treatment, shows high mRNA levels in mitosis and early G1 phase of the cell cycle, a decrease in G1after START and again an increase in S phase. Overexpression ofCLN2 was shown to repress the transcript number of pheromone-dependent genes (1). We asked whether the activities of components of the mating pathway fluctuate during the cell cycle. We were also interested in determining at what level Cln2 represses the signal transduction machinery. Here we show that the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Fus3 indeed fluctuates during the cell cycle, reflecting the oscillations of the gene transcripts. CLN2 overexpression represses Fus3 kinase activity, independently of the phosphatase Msg5. Additionally, we show that the activity of the MEK Ste7 also fluctuates during the cell cycle. Increased Cln2 levels repress the ability of hyperactiveSTE11 alleles to induce the pathway. G protein-independent activation of Ste11 caused by an rga1 pbs2 mutation is resistant to high levels of Cln2 kinase. Therefore our results suggest that Cln2-dependent repression of the mating pathway occurs at the level of Ste11.

Mating between cells of the two opposite haploid cell types ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae requires recognition of the mating partner through secreted pheromones. In response to pheromone both mating partners arrest their cell cycle in G1 (2Hartwell L.H. Bacteriol. Rev. 1974; 38: 164-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Strathern J.

The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces , Gene Expression. 1992: 657-744Google Scholar). They undergo morphological changes (shmoo formation), which enables two cells of opposite mating type to fuse and form a diploid zygote. Mating is restricted to a short period in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (5Cross F. Hartwell L.H. Jackson C. Konopka J.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Dolan J.W. Fields S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1008: 155-169Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Marsh L. Neiman A.M.

Cells which have passed a point called START in G1 are committed to undergo a new cell cycle and cannot respond to mating pheromone until they reach G1 again (9Reid B.J. Hartwell L.H. J.

Transition through START is mediated by the function of the G1 cyclins Cln1, Cln2, and Cln3, which are the regulatory subunits of the Cdc28 kinase (11Richardson H.E. Wittenberg C. Cross F. Reed S.I.

In response to mating pheromone the activity of the Cdc28-Cln kinase gets inhibited, so that the cell cannot pass START (16Peter M. Herskowitz I.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Far1 causes its association with the Cdc28-Cln1 and Cdc28-Cln2 kinases and thereby inhibits their ability to drive the cell through START (17Peter M. Gartner A. Horecka J.

Both mating partners are arrested in the same stage of the cell cycle when they fuse. This mechanism ensures the correct ploidy of the zygote. Transcription of pheromone-inducible genes such as FUS1, STE2 (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SST2, STE12, andMFA2 (20Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) has been shown to fluctuate during the cell cycle. It reaches its maximum during late mitosis and early G1, decreases drastically in late G1 around START, and increases again in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The transcript of FAR1, which encodes a putative cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, also fluctuates during the cell cycle, but in contrast to other pheromone-inducible genes, its transcription in G2/M is Mcm1-dependent (20Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The stability of the Far1 protein is also regulated during the cell cycle. Far1 protein can be detected only in early G1 cells and is rapidly degraded in other stages of the cell cycle (10McKinney J.D. Chang F. Heintz N. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This ensures that the cell cycle arrest in response to pheromone occurs in early G1 only. The cell cycle regulated restriction of pheromone-dependent gene transcription may reflect an important mechanism ensuring that the responsiveness of the cell to mating pheromone is maximal in early G1. The decrease of pheromone-dependent gene transcription in late G1 correlates with an increase in the appearance of G1 cyclin. Overexpression of CLN2represses FUS1 transcription (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Preliminary epistasis experiments demonstrated that the repression occurs downstream of the receptor (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that it involves neither Sst2 (implicated in recovery from pheromone-induced G1 arrest) nor the carboxyl-terminal part of the pheromone receptor (implicated in desensitization). Potential targets of Cln2-mediated repression are the components of the pheromone-induced MAPK pathway. This signal transduction pathway has been the focus of several reviews (4Sprague G.F. Thorner J.W. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces , Gene Expression. 1992: 657-744Google Scholar, 21Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In short, activation is mediated by the binding of pheromone to a seven-transmembrane receptor coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein.

Gβγ transmits the signal to the Ste20 kinase (28Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Hougan L. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Gen.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2949-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Downstream of Ste20 the sequential activation of several protein kinases, tethered together by the scaffold protein Ste5, propagates the signal (28Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Hougan L. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These kinases belong to the family of highly conserved MAPK pathways (21Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and function in the linear order Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3/Kss1. The MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 are thought to activate the transcription factor Ste12, which mediates the transcriptional induction of pheromone-dependent genes (33Dolan J.W. Kirkman C. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5703-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 34Errede B. Ammerer G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this work we investigate which components of the pheromone-induced signal transduction pathway are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent way. We show that the activity of the MAPK Fus3 fluctuates during the cell cycle. Furthermore, Fus3 kinase activity is repressed by overexpression of CLN2. The repression occurs independent of the function of the phosphataseMSG5, which dephosphorylates Fus3 (36Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The activity of the MEK Ste7 was shown to respond to the cell cycle as well. By the use of hyperactive alleles of STE11 and a deletion ofRGA1, we conclude that CLN2 represses the mating pathway at the level of Ste11. The studies in this work represent an important contribution to the understanding of the regulation of a signaling cascade by the cell cycle and the phenomenon described here may be relevant in the regulation of MAPK pathways in higher eucaryotic cells. The S. cerevisiae strains utilized in this study are listed in Table I. Standard yeast techniques were used as described in Sherman et al. (37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). YEP (complete) medium, minimal synthetic medium, and supplements are described by Hicks and Herskowitz (38Hicks J.B. Herskowitz I. Genetics. 1976; 83: 245-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed either as described by Ito et al. (39Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Beggs (40Beggs J.D.

Unless otherwise indicated cells were induced for 10 min with pheromone. For the expression of the galactose inducible GAL1–10 CLN2 construct cells were pregrown on YEP medium plus 2% raffinose.

The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. The strains used contain the Myc epitope-tagged Ste7 wild-type protein (pNC318) or an inactivated version of Ste7 (pNC318-R220) on a centromeric plasmid under the control of the CYC1 promoter (45Zhou Z.

Unless otherwise indicated everything was done at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with kinase extract buffer (KEB) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, O.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mmNa2H2P2O7, 15 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, O.1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin), and resuspended in 200 μl of breakage buffer (KEB without sodium fluoride and Na2H2P2O7). Cells were lysed by vortexing them with glass beads 3 times for 4 min. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation once for 5 min and twice for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay as recommended by the manufacturer. 300 μg of protein extract were used for the immunoprecipitation. Ste7 was precipitated with approximately 10 μg of anti-Myc 9E10 antibody for 1.5 h. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads in a 1:1 suspension (preincubated in breakage buffer) were added. After 1 h incubation the beads were washed 5 times in breakage buffer, and 3 times in HEPES, 25 mm, pH 7.5. For the kinase assay, 6 μl of kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 15 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) were added to the beads. 0.5 μg of E. coli purified Fus3-R42 as a substrate, 0.2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl), 1 μl of HEPES, 250 mm, 2 μl of 1 mm ATP, and H2O up to a final volume of 20 μl were added. The kinase assay was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and boiling the extracts for 4 min. Phosphorylation of the substrate was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis on a 9.5% polyacrylamide (28:2, acrylamide-bisacrylamide) gel (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Yeast total RNA preparation was performed as described by Cross and Tinkelenberg (47Cross F.R. Tinkelenberg A.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). RNA was separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Boehringer Mannheim nylon membranes (as recommended by the manufacturer). Northern blots were processed as described by Priceet al. (48Price C. Nasmyth K. Schuster T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments used as probes were labeled by random priming and isolated as follows: SST2, aClaI/HapI fragment was cut out from theSST2 coding region; CMD1, with the oligos 5′-GTCCTCCAATCTTACCGAAG-3′ and 5′-TTACAAGTAGAATCCATTTAGATAACAAAGCAGCG-3′ the CMD1 coding region was isolated by PCR from genomic DNA; CLN2, aSalI/ClaI fragment was cut out from theCLN2 coding region; CDC28, anEcoRI/PstI fragment from the plasmid K2354, containing a GAL1–10 CDC28 construct (by A. Amon) was isolated; FUS1, the HindIII/SalI fragment of the FUS1 coding region was isolated;STE3, a HindIII fragment from the STE3coding region was isolated; ACT1 was isolated as aXhoI/KpnI fragment from the ACT1coding sequence. DNA content of propridium iodide-stained cells was measured on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan as described by Lewet al. (49Lew D.J. Marini N.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1992; 69: 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Epstein and Cross (50Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at permissive temperature at 24 °C in the appropriate medium from OD600 0.2 to 0.8. The cultures were diluted to OD600 0.4 and arrested for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The arrest was checked by microscopic examination and determination of the budding index. cdc15–2 cells were arrested as described above. The cultures were released by diluting them with ice-cold YEPD to OD600 O.5 and further cooling them down on ice till the temperature was 24 °C. They were released at 24 °C. Aliquots were taken at the indicated time points for kinase assays, FACS analysis, RNA preparation, protein extracts for Western blots, and for the determination of the budding index. The transcripts of pheromone-dependent genes fluctuate during the cell cycle (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether the transcriptional fluctuations are the consequence of differences in the activity of the MAPK Fus3, we expressed FUS3 constitutively from theTPI1 promoter to examine kinase activity independently of its transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle. Kinase assays from distinct cell cycle arrested cells were performed with a Myc epitope-tagged Fus3. Fus3 was immunoprecipitated with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Cells harboring a temperature-sensitive mutation in the CDC15 or the CDC4 gene were arrested at the restrictive temperature in late mitosis or late G1, respectively. In vitro Fus3 kinase assays using bacterial recombinant Far1 as a substrate were performed under pheromone-induced conditions (Fig. 1 A) and uninduced conditions (data not shown). According to the fluctuations observed for pheromone-dependent genes, Fus3 MAPK activity was expected to be high in cells arrested in late mitosis, and low in cells arrested in late G1. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, Fus3 kinase activity shows the same cell cycle-dependent pattern as described for the FUS1 transcript (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fus3 activity is high in cdc15–2 arrested cells (lane 3), and low in cdc4–1 arrested cells (lane 5). To further analyze the cell cycle-dependent regulation of basal Fus3 kinase activity we performed cdc15–2 release experiments in the absence of pheromone. The cultures were arrested at restrictive temperature in late mitosis and released from the block at permissive temperature. The arrest was checked by microscopic examination and determination of the budding index (data not shown). At the indicated time points, samples were taken for kinase assays (Fig.1 B) and Northern analysis (Fig. 1 C). The activity of Fus3 was examined by in vitro kinase assays. As seen in Fig. 1 B the activity of Fus3 shows the same cell cycle-dependent regulation which had been observed for the transcripts of mating dependent genes. Differences in the activity of Fus3 could have been due to differences in Fus3 protein levels. To rule out this possibility, Western blot analysis was performed. Aliquots from the cdc15–2 release experiment in Fig. 1, B and C, were used for the preparation of cell extracts. The Western blot was probed with anti-Fus3 and anti-Cdc28 polyclonal antibodies. The Fus3 protein concentration stays constant throughout the cell cycle and is not responsible for the fluctuations in kinase activity or in expression of pheromone-dependent genes (data not shown). A second release experiment to study the timing of Fus3 activity during the cell cycle was performed. The release was checked by FACScan analysis (Fig. 1 E). Fus3 activity and CLN2mRNA fluctuate antagonistically (Fig. 1 D). These data are in accordance with previous studies showing that theFUS1 and CLN2 transcripts fluctuate antagonistically (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Basal and pheromone-induced activity of the MAPK Fus3 are cell cycle- regulated, but the protein levels of Fus3 stay constant. The activity of the MAPK Fus3 reaches its maximum in late mitosis and early G1, drops after START, is low in late G1, and increases again in S phase. The pattern of its cell cycle regulation is the same as observed for the FUS1transcript and reaches its maximum when CLN2 levels are low. Overexpression of the G1 cyclin genesCLN1 and CLN2 represses transcription ofFUS1 (1Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To see whether CLN2 overexpression reduces Fus3 kinase activity, CLN2 was overexpressed from the GAL1–10 promoter in cycling cells and Fus3 activity was examined by in vitro kinase assays.

Fractional MgATPase activation was less than the fraction of troponins that bound Ca2+, implying a cooperative effect of bound Ca2+ on cross-bridge cycling. Addition of phalloidin did not alter cooperative effects between bound Ca2+ molecules in the presence or absence of myosin S1. When the myosin S1 concentration was raised sufficiently to introduce cooperative myosin-myosin effects, lower Ca2+concentrations were needed to activate the MgATPase rate. MgATPase activation remained less than Ca2+ binding, implying a true, not just an apparent, increase in Ca2+ affinity. MgATPase activation by Ca2+ was more cooperative than could be explained by cooperativeness of overall Ca2+binding, the discrepancy between Ca2+ binding and MgATPase activation, or interactions between myosins. The results suggest the thin filament-myosin S1 MgATPase cycle requires calcium binding to adjacent troponin molecules and that this binding is cooperatively promoted by a single cycling cross-bridge. This mechanism is a potential explanation for Ca2+-mediated regulation of cross-bridge kinetics in muscle fibers.

This mechanism is a potential explanation for Ca2+-mediated regulation of cross-bridge kinetics in muscle fibers. Just as isometric tension is cooperatively activated by Ca2+, so is the cardiac thin filament-myosin S1 1The abbreviations used are: myosin S1, myosin subfragment 1; TnC, TnT, TnI, troponin C, T, and I, respectively; CBMII, mouse troponin C mutant D65A/E66A; CBMII-Tn, troponin reconstituted from CBMII. 1The abbreviations used are: myosin S1, myosin subfragment 1; TnC, TnT, TnI, troponin C, T, and I, respectively; CBMII, mouse troponin C mutant D65A/E66A; CBMII-Tn, troponin reconstituted from CBMII.

Trueblood C.E. Evans R. Weber A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 182: 265-269Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this behavior is that ATPase activation is proportional to Ca2+ binding to the many TnCs on each thin filament and that this calcium binding is cooperative (3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the idea that Ca2+ binding and MgATPase activation are proportional and found to the contrary that they are not. Instead, fractional MgATPase activation was considerably less than fractional Ca2+binding and more closely paralleled the number of pairs of adjacent troponins with Ca2+ bound to both. To accomplish the above experiment, we employ a constitutively inhibitory form of cardiac troponin containing an inactivating mutation of the sole regulatory site of TnC, site II (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This troponin, designated CBMII-Tn, results in a low thin filament-myosin S1 MgATPase rate that is not increased by the addition of Ca2+, analogous to previous results in which a similar TnC mutant was exchanged into myofibrils or muscle fibers (5Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24067-24073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Negele J.C. Dotson D.G. Liu W. Sweeney H.L. Putkey J.A. J. Biol.

CBMII-Tn binds to actin-tropomyosin with an affinity identical to that of normal troponin in the absence of Ca2+. This binding, which is very tight for both normal troponin and for CBMII-Tn (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), permits the present report in which thin filaments are assembled with defined mixtures of normal troponin and CBMII-Tn. In the presence of saturating Ca2+ concentrations, such thin filaments exhibit a fractional saturation of the TnC regulatory sites that is experimentally controllable by varying the relative concentrations of the two forms of troponin. This permits assessment of Ca2+-regulated myosin S1 MgATPase activity in a novel manner as a function of bound Ca2+ rather than as a function of the free Ca2+. In addition to varying the ratio of the two troponins, the myosin S1 and free Ca2+ concentrations are also systematically varied in the present study. The results imply a previously unrecognized aspect of the cooperativity of muscle activation, that rapid cycling of an isolated cross-bridge depends on Ca2+ binding to adjacent troponin molecules, and also suggest that cross-bridge cycling increases Ca2+ affinity at least locally, regardless of the density of myosin on the thin filament. The relationship between the data and various models of thin filament structure and regulation are discussed. Cardiac troponin and tropomyosin were purified from bovine heart using an ether powder technique (10Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rabbit fast skeletal muscle F-actin was obtained by the method of Spudich and Watt (11Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because bovine cardiac myosin S1 tends to precipitate at the concentrations used in many of the experiments, most of the data were obtained using rabbit fast skeletal muscle chymotryptic myosin S1 purified by ion exchange chromatography (12Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Some of the experiments (see Fig. 1) were repeated using bovine cardiac myosin S1 purified as described previously (10Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CBMII-Tn was prepared by reconstitution (13Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol.

F-actin, tropomyosin, and various mixtures of troponin and CBMII-Tn were combined in the indicated ratios under the ionic conditions used in the ATPase experiments. Since troponin binds to the thin filament with an affinity of 3–5 × 108m−1 (8Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

This was tested by a sedimentation experiment. 15.5 μmF-actin, 2 μm tropomyosin, 1 μm cardiac troponin (nonradioactive), and 1 μm reconstituted CBMII-Tn labeled with iodo[14C]acetic acid on TnT Cys-39 were combined in the presence of 100 μmCaCl2, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was sedimented in a TL100 centrifuge at 25 °C for 20 min at 35,000 rpm.

The fraction of actin pelleting was similar, 93%. All three values agreed within experimental error. The ATPase rate was measured by the release of radioactive phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP (15Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (NENTM Life Science Products, 2–7 × 107cpm/μmol) with five or more time points obtained at variable intervals of 20, 60, or 120 s, depending upon the ATPase rate. Conditions and protein concentrations were varied as described in each figure. The free Ca2+ concentration was varied using 0.5 mm1,2-bis-(2-amino-5-bromo-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid as a Ca2+ chelator and variable concentrations of CaCl2 (3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fraction is equivalent to the fraction of adjacent troponin·troponin pairs in contrast to the other possible adjacent pairs: CBMII-Tn·CBMII-Tn, troponin·CBMII-Tn, and CBMII-Tn·troponin. The number of such boundaries depends upon two factors: (i) the relative amounts of the two troponins and (ii) the tendency of the two forms of troponin to bind in a random or nonrandom pattern. The fractional Ca2+saturation is θ = troponin/(troponin + CBMII-Tn). If binding were random, then the fraction of adjacent pairs with Ca2+ bound on both elements of the pair would simply equal θ2. However, prior work shows that when the two forms of troponin are present in excess, they compete in a way that implies positive cooperativity and a small tendency for the two forms of troponin to segregate from each other (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This same tendency must be assumed to exist in the present experiments, which differ in that the troponins are added in a stoichiometric amount relative to the sites on the actin filament. For a closed linear filament including n troponins, withp = nθ designated as the number of troponins with bound Ca2+, the fraction of tropomyosin·tropomyosin boundaries with Ca2+ bound on both sides of the boundary can be shown to be as follows. f22=∑Y−j(p−j)pjn−p−1j−1n×∑Y−jpjn−p−1j−1Equation 1 The sums are taken over j, which refers to the number of discrete regions of one or more consecutive Ca2+ along the filament. By induction, j varies from 1 to pwhen p < n/2, and j varies from 1 to n − p when p >n/2 (exceptions are when p = 0 orp = n). Y is the cooperativity parameter, corresponding not only to the tendency for each type of troponin to segregate from the other (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but also, in the case of a fully normal thin filament, to a Y-fold tighter Ca2+ binding to a troponin that is adjacent to a troponin already with bound Ca2+ (3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, each configuration has a statistical weighting factor ofY −j, accounting for its free energy relative to configurations with different values for j. The number of adjacent, bound Ca2+·Ca2+ pairs equals p − j for any configuration. The other terms in the expression have to do with the number of ways of placing j regions containing pCa2+ions in n places. Simulations (not shown) with Equation 1 show it to be indistinguishable from f 22 = θ2 = (p/n)2 when Y = 1 as expected because binding is random when Y has this value. Also, Equation 1 gives negligibly different results forn = 30 and n = 200 unless Yis much larger than is true for the present experiments. Finally, Equation 1 is numerically indistinguishable from the implicit relationship between f 22 and θ that arises from independent derivations of the functionsf 22(Ca2+) and θ(Ca2+) (16Hill T.L. Cooperativity Theory in Biochemistry. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1985Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the effect of altering the fractional Ca2+ saturation of the thin filament by varying the relative concentrations of troponin and CBMII-Tn. The normalized results of six experiments are shown, and it is clear that the relationship between Ca2+ binding and MgATPase rate activation is not a linear one (straight line). Rather, activation lags behind Ca2+ binding. When 50% of the troponins bind Ca2+ and 50% do not, the fractional MgATPase rate activation is only 30–35% that of the maximal stimulation observed for full Ca2+ saturation. Thesolid line, which does not fit the data, is the result expected if MgATPase activation were proportional to Ca2+binding regardless of whether Ca2+ binding is cooperative. The dashed lines in Fig. 1 are theoretical curves for the fraction of troponin·troponin boundaries with Ca2+ bound on both sides, which depends in part upon the degree of cooperativity in the binding of the two forms of troponin to the thin filament. The equilibrium constant Y governs the tendency of troponin and CBMII-Tn to separately cluster on the thin filament rather than bind randomly (3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Y also dictates the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding to a thin filament containing only normal troponin, with Y > 1 indicating positive cooperativity. The experimentally determined value ofY is approximately 1.5 (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the long dashesin Fig. 1 correspond to this value. A slightly better fit is found withY = 4, as indicated by the theoretical curve represented with shorter dashes. This might suggest that the true value for Y is greater than the previously measured value of about 1.5. A more likely explanation is that the degree of MgATPase rate activation does not precisely correspond to the fraction of troponin·troponin pairs that have Ca2+ on both sides. In either case, the deviation from linearity in Fig. 1 indicates that Ca2+ binding to more than one troponin is required for full actin activation of ATP hydrolysis at any given thin filament site. An important aspect of the cooperative process illustrated in Fig. 1 is that it is not due to interactions between myosin S1 molecules. The myosin S1 concentration was only 1% that of the actin concentration, making myosin·myosin cooperativity unlikely. To confirm this experimentally, the MgATPase rate was shown to be linear with the myosin S1 concentration over a 16-fold range (0.25–4% that of the actin concentration). Linearity with myosin S1 concentration was shown both at pCa 5 and at pCa 5.89 (10–15% activation) for thin filaments with troponin and no CBMII-Tn and atpCa 5 for thin filaments with 50% troponin and 50% CBMII-Tn (data not shown). The curvature in Fig. 1 is not attributable to hyperbolic dependence of the MgATPase rate on the regulated actin concentration in the presence of saturating Ca2+ concentrations (10Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Adelstein R.S. Eisenberg E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 921-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Any such tendency would work in the reverse direction, producing a convex relationship or else tending to straighten a concave curve such as shown. This is not a major factor in Fig. 1 in any case because the MgATPase rates for the Ca2+-saturated thin filaments are about one-fourth to one-third the V max observed with saturating thin filament concentrations (data not shown). The actin concentration for the data sets in the figure are below the actinK app, which diminishes the importance of this consideration. The polymerization ability of the troponin·tropomyosin complex (18Jackson P. Amphlett G.N. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19White S.P. Cohen C.

Biol. 1986; 192: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and atomic models of actin·actin contacts in F-actin (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) suggest that longitudinal contacts along the thin filament are the most likely source of cooperativity. However, this does not exclude the possibility that cooperativity occurs across rather than along the actin filament. To test this, we added phalloidin, which binds near the thin filament axis with an orientation that is invariant with thin filament conformation (22Naber N. Ostap E.M. Thomas D.D. Cooke R. Proteins. 1993; 17: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and both decreases thin filament flexibility and alters strand-strand interactions (23Orlova A. Prochniewicz E. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 25Isambert H.

Any cooperativity that was dependent upon such interactions might be changed by the addition of phalloidin. The Fig. 2 inset shows that the cooperative effect of bound Ca2+ on MgATPase rate activation was similar to results found in the absence of phalloidin. The results are indistinguishable from Fig. 1. The main portion of Fig. 2 provides a measurement of Ca2+-dependent cooperative interactions between troponin molecules on the thin filament in the absence of myosin, again in the presence of phalloidin. This experiment differs from the ATPase data in that the sum of the troponin and CBMII-Tn concentrations is in constant excess relative to the sites on the thin filament. The two forms of troponin compete for binding sites on actin-tropomyosin, and the pattern of this competition implies that these binding sites (for troponin) interact in a manner sensitive to Ca2+. This experiment measures the value of the cooperativity parameter and equilibrium constant Y, which is found to be 1.7 ± 0.4 in the presence of phalloidin. This result implies weak Ca2+-sensitive interactions of a strength indistinguishable from that found previously in the absence of phalloidin (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Curve-fitting of the data also results in a value forK R, the fold-increase in the affinity of troponin for actin·tropomyosin that results from Ca2+dissociation from site II. K R is 2.4 ± 0.2 in the presence of phalloidin, which is indistinguishable fromK R in the absence of phalloidin, 2.2 ± 0.1 (4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The experiment in Fig. 1 employed a mixture of normal troponin and CBMII-Tn. An extrapolation of these results suggests that for a thin filament with normal troponin only, the MgATPase rate will not increase in proportion to Ca2+ binding as the free Ca2+concentration is increased. Fig. 3 A shows the normalized MgATPase rate as a function of the free Ca2+concentration in the presence of either low myosin S1 concentrations as were also present in Fig. 1 (Fig. 3, □) or in the presence of much higher myosin S1 concentrations (Fig. 3,×). The rightmost two curves show the difference between Ca2+ binding (short dashes) and adjacent Ca2+ pair binding (solid curve, fit to MgATPase data (□)) according to Fig.1 under conditions where myosin·myosin cooperativity is precluded by low myosin S1 concentrations. The K app from the ATPase curve underestimates the true binding constant, but this discrepancy is small, 3.7 versus 2.4 × 105m−1 for K binding versus K app. The relationship between these curves is determined by Fig. 1; if the short dash curve in Fig. 3 A is set as the independent variable and the solid curve as the dependent variable, then a graph describing the data in Fig. 1 is the result. However, the lines actually were obtained by a best fit of Equation 1 to the experimental data (□). Assuming the MgATPase rate is proportional to the fraction of adjacent troponin pairs with Ca2+ on both sides, then the best fit regulatory site Ca2+ affinity is 3.7 ± 0.6 × 105m−1 and the cooperativity parameter Y = 3.4 ± 0.9. The mean value for Y from 10 such experiments was 5 ± 1, corresponding to a Hill coefficient of 2.2 (3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and similar to the level of cooperativity reported previously (1Tobacman L.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tobacman L.S.

Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The analysis in Fig. 3 A indicates that there is little difference in the cooperative shapes for Ca2+ binding and for Ca2+ pair binding (the solid and short dash curves are equally steep). Similarly, if Y is set at a noncooperative value of 1, both curves are less steep but they remain parallel, and the relationship between them is still consistent with Fig. 1 (not shown). This indicates that Fig. 1 is consistent with the data in Fig. 3 A, but only if overall Ca2+binding to the thin filament regulatory sites is cooperative. Since this process is known to have little cooperativity for reconstituted thin filaments (3Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys.

Potter J.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1987; 8: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), some other explanation will be needed to rationalize the larger cooperativity observed for MgATPase activationversus the free Ca2+ concentration (Fig.3 A and Ref. 1Tobacman L.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another source of cooperativity in MgATPase assays is effects of myosin S1 on the thin filament. Careful studies of Weber and co-workers (30Bremel R.D. Murray J.M. Weber A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 267-275Crossref Google Scholar) using skeletal muscle regulatory proteins have shown increased MgATPase rates, increased Ca2+ affinity, and apparent Ca2+ affinity (32Murray J.M. Weber A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 35: 11-15Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Murray J.M. Weber A. Bremel R.D. Carafoli E. Calcium Transport in Contraction and Secretion. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1975: 489-496Google Scholar). These effects are observed when the myosin concentration is high relative to actin or when conditions favor strong actin–myosin bond formation (34Murray J.M. Knox M.K. Trueblood C.E. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows the potentiating effect of high myosin S1 concentrations on the thin filament-myosin S1 MgATPase rate using cardiac regulatory proteins. For an actin concentration of 5 μm, the MgATPase rate deviated from linearity when the myosin S1 concentration was >3 μm. This deviation correlated with a shift in the Ca2+ K app in MgATPase versus pCa experiments. There was no shift for 3 μm myosin S1 (not shown), a small shift for 5 μm myosin S1 (not shown), and a 2.5-fold shift in K app in the presence of 10 μm myosin S1 (Fig. 3 A, ×). The apparent Ca2+ affinity from these and other titrations was 2.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1 in the presence of 0.3 μm myosin S1 and 6.0 ± 0.9 × 105m−1 in the presence of 10 μm myosin S1. Comparison among the three curves in Fig. 3 Ashows that MgATPase rate activation of 10 μm myosin S1 (×) occurs at even lower Ca2+ concentrations than the calculated Ca2+ saturation of the regulatory sites (short dashes) when the myosin concentration is low. If the high myosin S1 (×) versus low myosin S1 (□) MgATPase rate shift had occurred without any change in true Ca2+ binding, MgATPase activation would precede fractional Ca2+ binding. This would be the opposite of the relationship in Fig. 1, a convex rather than a concave curve. This possibility is evaluated and excluded by Fig. 3 C, which shows fractional MgATPase activation as a function of bound Ca2+. Even in the presence of high myosin S1 concentrations that “potentiate” the thin filament, Ca2+ binding precedes fractional activation. Therefore, the shift seen in Fig. 3 A (× versus □) involves a myosin-induced increase in Ca2+ affinity. However, there may also be some change in the precise relationship between fractional Ca2+ binding and fractional MgATPase rate activation; Fig.3 C appears to show less deviation from linearity than does Fig. 1. In this regard, it should be noted that strongly bound cross-bridges can activate the thin filament under appropriate conditions, even in the absence of any Ca2+ binding (31Bremel R.D. Weber A. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 238: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). When only 25% of the troponins on the thin filament are capable of binding Ca2+, i.e. 75% of the troponin is of the form CBMII-Tn, a gradual increase in the Ca2+ concentration produces a small level of activation that is shown in Fig.4. The figure is a normalized composite of four experiments, and in all of them the noise precluded any assessment ofY. The data is noisy because a 25:75 ratio of troponin:CBMII-Tn produces only a low MgATPase rate (Fig. 1); the average Ca2+-saturated rate is twice the EGTA rate for these data sets. The solid curve is a noncooperative binding isotherm. Comparison of the data points to this theoretical curve suggests that cooperativity may actually be present (the data deviates from the curve), but this may be an artifact of the normalization of each data set. The K app could be measured with enough precision, 4.3 ± 1.2 × 105m−1, to permit comparison to the value found for thin filaments with fully normal troponin, 2.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1 (n = 10, with representative data shown in Fig. 3 A, □). This was unexpected, since the CBMII-Tn might have cooperatively interacted with adjacent troponin molecules to decrease Ca2+ affinity. It is unclear why a modest increase in apparent affinity occurred instead, but the effect is small in any case. The thin filament has at least three conformations: an inhibited state in the presence of EGTA, a Ca2+-induced state, and an active state observed in the presence of strongly binding myosin cross-bridges (35Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol.

Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). Induced CHO-K1 cells, kindly provided by Dr. Simoni, were grown essentially as described by Inoue et al. (1Inoue S. Sharma R.C. Schimke R.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5894-5898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to a final ALLN concentration of 70 μm in the presence of 20 μm verapamil. Cells were collected and stored at −70 °C until assayed. Control CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown without ALLN or verapamil. Total RNA was isolated from induced cells by the TRIzol method (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). First strand synthesis was primed with the RACE adapter T17 primer using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (11Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 28-38Google Scholar). An initial cDNA fragment for CHO reductase was generated using 3′-RACE PCR with a primer based on the human aldose reductase sequence (5′-CTCAACAACGGCGCCAAGATGCCCA corresponding to position 19 to 43 of the coding region). Subsequently, gene specific primers were used with 5′-RACE PCR to obtain the 5′-end cDNA. The 5′-RACE procedure was improved by titrating the amount of gene-specific primer over the range 0.001 to 10 pmol per reaction (12Templeton N.S. Urcelay E. Safer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 48-50PubMed Google Scholar). The entire cDNA was sequenced in both directions using overlapping gene specific primers. Sequencing was performed by the dye terminator method using an Applied Biosystems model 377A sequencer. Total RNA from noninduced cells was used with 3′-RACE PCR to generate cDNA fragments for hamster aldehyde reductase (ALR1; EC 1.1.1.2) and aldose reductase (ALR2; EC 1.1.1.21). A coding region fragment for aldehyde reductase of 735 bp was generated using the primers 5′-TGTCCTCCTGCACACTG (sense) (position 15 to 31 of the rat coding region) and 5′-GGACCTGCCACCTGAGC (antisense) (position 734 to 750 of the pig coding region). A 3′-end fragment of hamster aldose reductase was generated using the RACE adapter primer and the primer 5′-GCCTTGATGAGCTGTG (sense) (position 898 to 913 of the mouse coding region). These fragments were sequenced and aligned with known members of the AKR family to ensure their correct assignment for use as probes in Northern analysis. 3′-RACE cDNA from noninduced total RNA was used to generate a Hamster glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe using a sense (5′-GTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT) and antisense (5′-AGCATCAAAGGTGGAAGAATG) primer derived from the rat sequence. The entire CHO reductase cDNA was amplified using primers in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region containing restriction sites forEcoRI and XhoI, respectively. This fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into pCRII (Invitrogen) similarly digested. The plasmid CHOpCRII was transformed into CJ236 cells. Introduction of a NdeI site at the N-terminal methionine was performed using the Kunkel method (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Successful mutagenesis was screened by NdeI digestion and positive clones were resequenced to ensure introduction of no other mutations. The NdeI-XhoI fragment was subcloned into the pET16b vector (Novagen) to generate an in-frame histidine leader sequence for HisTag purification. The CHOpET16b plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells containing pLysS. One-half liter cultures were grown in LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and the cultures were grown for a further 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended at 30 ml/liter of culture in bind buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9) and stored at −20 °C. Cells were thawed and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were disrupted by sonication and the insoluble fraction separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml chelating Sepharose column (Pharmacia) previously charged with nickel sulfate and washed with bind buffer. The loaded column was washed with 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9 (wash buffer), and CHO reductase was eluted using a linear gradient from wash buffer to elute buffer (1m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.9). The pooled protein was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C or −20 °C. Protein samples from the purification of CHO reductase were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method as described above. Total RNA was glyoxalated (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and separated on a 1% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad). Prehybridization was done at 37 °C for at least 1 h in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C in the same solution containing at least 1 × 107 cpm/ml of each probe at 1 × 108 cpm/μg. The probes were either an 800-bp hamster glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, a 735-bp hamster ALR1 cDNA, a 450-bp hamster ALR2 cDNA, or the full-length CHO cDNA prepared by nick-translation (Nick Translation System, Life Technologies, Inc.). Final membrane washes were at 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 60 min, 70 °C with exposure for 16 h at 25 °C with DuPont Reflection NEF film and one intensifying screen. A radiolabeled riboprobe was prepared by in vitrotranscription of the 3′ portion of the hamster CHO reductase gene with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]CTP. The plasmid CHOpCRII was linearized at the unique AccII site to generate a 200-bp cRNA transcript. The polyacrylamide gel-purified riboprobe (0.5 × 106 cpm) and tissue RNA (20 μg) or CHO-K1 cell-derived RNA (2–5 μg) were denatured at 85 °C for 10 min and annealed overnight at 55 °C in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Sample processing and display were as described previously except that the ribonuclease digestion buffer contained 50 μg/ml RNase A in addition to 2 μg/ml RNase T1 (14Steinhelper M.E. Cochrane K.L. Field L.J. Hypertension. 1990; 16: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). All substrates were assayed at 25 °C in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer, except for daunomycin which was assayed in 0.1 m HEPPS, pH 8.5. Apparent K m values for the substrates were assayed in the presence of 200 μm NADPH. ApparentK m values for the cofactors were assayed in the presence of 1 mm pyridine-3-aldehyde. NADH was assayed in a 5-mm path-length cell at 370 nm with correction for the different Δε at that wavelength. All steroids were assayed in the presence of 2.5% acetonitrile. Kinetic constants were determined using the Marquardt algorithm (15Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) supplied with the spectrophotometer. Sequence information obtained from the initial 3′-RACE reaction performed on induced CHO-K1 total RNA using the primer to human ALR2 was different from known ALR2 sequences. Specific primers were used to sequence the sense and antisense strands and to obtain the 5′-untranslated region using 5′-RACE. The full-length cDNA sequence generated by RACE PCR consisted of 1268 nucleotides with a 5′-noncoding region of 43 nucleotides, an open reading frame of 951 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 274 nucleotides (Fig. 1). The open reading frame coded for a protein of 316 amino acids. The original peptide fragments sequenced by Inoue et al. (1Inoue S. Sharma R.C. Schimke R.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5894-5898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) matched exactly with the sequence determined from cDNA sequencing. The deduced protein sequence of CHO reductase showed high identity to members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The highest identity was to the mouse fibroblast growth factor regulated (FR-1) protein at 92% (4Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). CHO reductase was 80% identical to the MVDP (5Pailhoux E.A. Martinez A. Veyssiere G.M. Jean C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19932-19936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aldose reductases were approximately 70% identical while the aldehyde reductases were approximately 47% identical. Multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that CHO reductase, FR-1, and MVDP form a distinct subgroup within the superfamily and should be classified in the AKR1B group using the nomenclature system proposed by Jez et al. (2Jez, J. M., Flynn, T. G., and Penning, T. M. (1997) Biochem. Pharmacol., in press.Google Scholar). CHO reductase contained the same residues implicated in the catalytic mechanism as other members of the aldo-keto reductase family. These included Asp-44, Tyr-49, Lys-78, and His-111. RNA gel blot hybridization analysis from cells treated with ALLN at a concentration of 70 μm confirmed the induction of CHO reductase (Fig. 3). This induction was instead of aldose reductase or aldehyde reductase. The selectivity of the aldose reductase probe was maximized by using the 3′-end of its cDNA, which contained the greatest differences between the hamster aldose reductase and CHO reductase sequences. Analysis of a range of CHO tissues revealed no detectable levels of CHO reductase mRNA when probed by Northern blot using the full-length CHO cDNA as probe. These blots did confirm the integrity of the RNA. RNase protection assay analysis of the same RNA stocks showed transcript in the bladder, testis, jejunum, and to a lesser extent in the ovary (Fig. 4). The basal level in CHO-K1 cells was higher than in all tissues tested comparing the signal from 5 μg of noninduced cells total RNA with 20 μg of tissue RNA. As indicated by the Northern analysis, cells induced by ALLN showed a markedly elevated transcript level. The recombinant protein yield was 45–50 mg/liter of cells after chromatography on the nickel-Sepharose column. The protein was greater than 98% pure as judged by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The expressed CHO reductase was active when tested with a variety of common substrates for the aldo-keto reductases. The K mvalues for the cofactors NADPH and NADH were very similar to those obtained for aldehyde and aldose reductase (Table I). ALLN, which was used to induce the protein, was a substrate although it bound poorly as indicated by its millimolar K m. Overall aliphatic substrates such as the commonly useddl-glyceraldehyde were poor substrates. The only kinetic values for FR1 or MVDP are a K m of 0.92 mm for FR1 with dl-glyceraldehyde (16Wilson D.K. Nakano T. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14323-14330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This value falls between that obtained for CHO reductase and what has been observed with ALR2 (Table I). The poor ability to catalyze aliphatic substrates also included glucose which was only converted at a level of 2–3 times background up to a concentration of 1.2 m. Small aromatic aldehydes were better substrates (Table II), with micromolar K m values andk cat values 2–10-fold higher than for the aliphatic substrates. A number of ketones were substrates for the CHO reductase (Table III). They exhibited lowk cat values (<1 s−1) and tighter binding for aromatic or heterocyclic substrates. The diagnostic ketone substrate for the carbonyl reductases, menadione (K mof 0.045 mm (17Wermuth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1206-1213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), was not a substrate for CHO reductase. CHO reductase was also able to catalyze the reduction of a number of steroid aldehydes and ketones (Table IV). The affinities were high (low μm) while the turnover rates were again less than 1 s−1. The enzyme showed selectivity for aldehydes or ketones on ring D (e.g.17α-hydroxyprogesterone) and no reactivity toward ketones on ring A (e.g. testosterone). The enzyme showed a pH optimum of 6 to 6.5 with all substrates except daunomycin which was maximally reduced at pH 8.5 (data not shown). CHO reductase was inhibited 35% by 1 mm sodium barbitone and 31% by 1 mm sodium valproate.Table IKinetic constants for CHO reductase with aliphatic aldehydesKinetic constants for CHO reductase.

ALR1 and ALR2 sources as indicated in TableI. ALR1 and ALR2 sources as indicated in TableI. We have isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA from Chinese hamster ovary cells that encodes CHO reductase, a new member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. Initial characterization of this protein was described by Inoue et al. (1Inoue S. Sharma R.C. Schimke R.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5894-5898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the sequence presented here confirms their assignment to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The enzyme showed highest protein sequence identity to the fibroblast growth factor-regulated protein (FR-1) and to MVDP. FR-1, MVDP, and now CHO reductase comprise a subgroup of the aldo-keto reductases that are inducible. FR-1 is induced in cells by exposure to acidic fibroblast growth factor-1 (4Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus may play a role in the mitogenic action of fibroblast growth factor-1. MVDP expression in the vas deferens was dependent on the presence of testosterone (5Pailhoux E.A. Martinez A. Veyssiere G.M. Jean C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19932-19936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and androgen response elements have been isolated in the MVDP gene (18Fabre S. Manin M. Pailhoux E. Veyssiere G. Jean C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5857-5864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both these murine aldo-keto reductases appear to be expressed instead of the more common aldehyde or aldose reductases. CHO reductase induction was also instead of the Chinese hamster aldehyde or aldose reductases. Besides FR-1 ((AKR1B8); nomenclature proposed by Jez et al.(2Jez, J. M., Flynn, T. G., and Penning, T. M. (1997) Biochem. Pharmacol., in press.Google Scholar)), MVDP (AKR1B7) and now CHO reductase (AKR1B9), many other members of the AKR superfamily have been shown to be induced by chemical, hormonal, or extracellular factors. AKR inducing agents have included ethacrynic acid (9Ciaccio P.J. Jaiswal A.K. Tew K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15558-15562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ethoxyquin (19Ellis E.M. Judah D.J. Neal G.E. Hayes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), 3′-methyl-4-dimethyl-aminoazobenzene (20Takahashi M. Fujii J. Miyoshi E. Hoshi A. Taniguchi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), andN-methyl-N-nitrosourea (21Zeindl-Eberhart E. Jungblut P.R. Otto A. Rabes H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14589-14594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while spontaneous induction has been observed during the development of hereditary hepatitis leading to hepatocarcinogenesis (6Takahashi M. Hoshi A. Fujii J. Miyoshi E. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. Aozasa K. Taniguchi N. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hormonal regulation of AKR members has been observed during the estrous cycle (7Iwata N. Hara S. Nishimura C. Takahashi M. Mukai T. Takayama M. Endo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in the cell cycle of Leishmania major (22Samaras N. Spithill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4251-4254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and due to the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor on astrocytes (8Laeng P. Bouillon P. Taupenot L. Labourdette G. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1240-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Androgen response elements have been found for ALR2 (23Wang K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16052-16058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to that mentioned for MVDP. ALR2 was also regulated by extracellular osmolytes (24Kaneko M. Carper D. Nishimura C. Millen J. Bock M. Hohman T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Moriyama T. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an osmotic response element has been found in the rabbit ALR2 gene (26Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The different members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily are clearly important in a number of cellular defense and developmental mechanisms. RNase protection assay analysis showed that the CHO reductase was variably expressed in the organs of the Chinese hamster. The highest levels were seen in the bladder with transcript also present in the jejunum, testis, and to a lesser extent, ovary. This is in contrast to the FR-1 and MVDP genes that were expressed in testis, heart, ovary (FR-1), and adrenal (both) (27Lau E.T. Cao D. Lin C. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The low level of CHO reductase transcript in the ovary is puzzling since a high basal level was clearly evident by RNase protection assay analysis of the CHO-K1 cells. This may indicate that the protein is developmentally regulated or that transcriptional regulation in the CHO-K1 cells line has been altered. These cells may thus be primed for the tremendous induction that occurred when the aldehyde ALLN was introduced. Expressed CHO reductase was functional and displayed kinetics distinct from other members of the aldo-keto reductase family. It is interesting that despite its close sequence identity to the aldose reductases (approximately 70%) it showed an affinity for aliphatic substrates more closely comparable to the aldehyde reductases (Table I). Conversely, for aromatic substrates, its affinity was generally comparable with aldose reductase (Table II). In contrast to the work of Vander Jagt et al. (28Vander Jagt D.L. Kolb N.S. Vander Jagt T.J. Chino J. Martinez F.J. Hunsaker L.A. Royer R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), on human aldose reductase, which reported no substituent effects for aromatic aldehydes, CHO reductase showed a 10-fold lower K m forp-nitrobenzaldehyde versus benzaldehyde. The preference for aromatic substrates likely accounts for the ability of CHO reductase to reduce the anthracycline-based ketone daunomycin. CHO reductase showed similar kinetic constants to the previously reported daunorubicin reductase (29Felsted R.L. Bachur N.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (K m, 0.043versus 0.08 mm; k cat, 0.47 versus 1.5 s−1, respectively at pH 8.5). However, it is not daunorubicin reductase since CHO reductase, as with other aldose reductase members (30Cromlish J.A. Flynn T.G. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1485-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was only slightly inhibited by 1 mm sodium barbitone. Daunorubicin reductase and other aldehyde reductases are almost completely inhibited at this concentration (31Turner A.J. Hick P.E. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Turner A.J. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Daunomycin also bound tighter to CHO reductase than it did to the ketone preferring carbonyl reductase (0.043versus 0.13 mm) (17Wermuth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1206-1213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, CHO reductase was not able to reduce menadione. The observed preference for aromatic and other heterocyclic substrates could also explain why CHO reductase was able to metabolize ketone steroids, even though aldehyde containing steroids were preferred. This ability to use ketones makes this enzyme kinetically distinct from the aldehyde and aldose reductases. The underlying structural reasons for these subtle kinetic differences between CHO reductase and the aldose reductases can be explained by analysis of the crystal structures of both these proteins. CHO reductase has not been crystallized. However, the FR-1 crystal structure can be used in this comparison because of the high degree of sequence identity to CHO reductase, particularly around the substrate site. Comparison of the ternary complexes of FR-1 (16Wilson D.K. Nakano T. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14323-14330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and human aldose reductase (33Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) complexed with NADP and the inhibitor zopolrestat show that there are many aromatic residues involved in the binding of zopolrestat. These include Tyr-49, Trp-80, Trp-112, Phe-123, and Tyr-310. These residues would provide the primary binding energy for aromatic substrates such as pyridine-3-aldehyde or steroids through π-bond stacking interactions. This would account for the similarK m values using aromatic substrates for CHO reductase and aldose reductase. However, the substrate site is bounded by two regions of considerable sequence difference between FR-1 (and thus CHO reductase) and aldose reductase (Fig. 5). These differences result in the active site pocket in FR-1 being wider due to the more remote position of the loop containing Cys-299. In addition, more space is seen around the trifluoromethyl group of zopolrestat in FR-1. This larger substrate pocket in CHO reductase may not clamp small aliphatic substrates as firmly as does aldose reductase, resulting in the lower observed affinity. This larger substrate pocket may also allow for more movement of larger substrates such as daunomycin or the ketone containing steroids thus allowing for the correct orientation and reduction of these ketones. We thank Dr. John Watson for assistance with cell culture, Dr. Florante Quiocho and Dr. David Wilson for access to the crystal coordinates for zopolrestat bound FR-1 and ALR2, and Dr. Zongchao Jia for help with interpreting the crystal structures."

TheK d values of the ligands increase by an average factor of 3.0 ± 0.8 per decrease in pH unit between pH ∼4.5 and pH ∼6.3. Below pH ∼4.5 there is a smaller increase inK d values, and above pH ∼6.3 theK d values become relatively pH-independent. We determined the crystal structures of complexes of streptavidin with cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 at pH 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5, with cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2 at pH 2.0, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, and 11.8, with cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 at pH 2.5, 2.9, and 3.7, and with FSHPQNT at pH 4.0 and compared the structures with one another and with those previously determined at other pH values. At pH values from 3.0 to 11.8, the electron density for the peptide His side chain is strong, flat, and well defined. A hydrogen bond between the Nδ1 atom of the His and the peptide Gln amide group indicates the His of the bound peptide in the crystals is uncharged at pH ≥ 3.0. By determining selected structures in two different space groups, I222 with two crystallographically inequivalent ligand sites and I4122 with one site, we show that below pH ∼3.0, the pK a of the bound peptide His in the crystals is influenced by crystal packing interactions. The presence of the Nδ1His-NGln hydrogen bond along with pH dependences of the peptide affinities suggest that deprotonation of the peptide His is required for high affinity binding of HPQ-containing peptides to streptavidin both in the crystals and in solution. The pH dependences of the affinities for streptavidin of linear and cyclic peptide ligands containing the HPQ sequence discovered by phage display were determined by plasmon resonance measurements. At pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.0, theK d values for Ac-AEFSHPQNTIEGRK-NH2, cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2, and cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQFC]IEGRK-NH2, were determined by competition, and those for cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 were determined directly by equilibrium affinity measurements. TheK d values of the ligands increase by an average factor of 3.0 ± 0.8 per decrease in pH unit between pH ∼4.5 and pH ∼6.3. Below pH ∼4.5 there is a smaller increase inK d values, and above pH ∼6.3 theK d values become relatively pH-independent. We determined the crystal structures of complexes of streptavidin with cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 at pH 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5, with cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2 at pH 2.0, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, and 11.8, with cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 at pH 2.5, 2.9, and 3.7, and with FSHPQNT at pH 4.0 and compared the structures with one another and with those previously determined at other pH values.

Screening of peptide libraries either displayed on phage by molecular biology or produced by combinatorial chemical synthesis is an effective method for discovery of peptide ligands for diverse protein targets. Owing to the remarkably high stability and high affinity of streptavidin for its natural ligand biotin (K d∼10−15m) (1Green N.M. Adv.

Finally, the high resolution crystal structures of apostreptavidin and of streptavidin-ligand complexes provide a powerful basis for developing structure-based ligand design strategies (12Katz B.A. Liu B.

Recently we described the structures of streptavidin-bound linear and cyclic peptide ligands containing the HPQ sequence (13Katz B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15421-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) discovered by phage display and probed the structural basis for the higher affinities of the cyclic ligands compared with the corresponding linear ones. These structures enabled the successful design of cyclic peptide ligands conformationally constrained with designed thioether cross-links (22Katz B.A. Johnson C. Cass R.T. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1996; 118: 7914-7920Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The binding to streptavidin and avidin of certain small molecule and peptide ligands is pH-dependent. The affinities for avidin of biotin derivatives, 2-iminobiotin and diaminobiotin, decrease dramatically as the pH is lowered (24Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 101: 774-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as does the affinity for streptavidin of a linear peptide discovered by phage display, FSHPQNT (25Weber P.C. Pantoliano M.W. Thompson L.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9350-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The extent of topochemical catalysis of disulfide formation and the resulting dimerization of designed streptavidin-bound HPQ-containing ligands whose thiols are presented next to one another in the crystal lattice also depend on pH (20Katz B.A. Cass R.T.

Appraisal of the ionization states of groups in a protein-bound ligand or at the ligand binding site of the protein target may reveal some of the determinants of high affinity binding crucial for structure-based ligand design. To this end we determine the pH dependences of binding to streptavidin of linear and cyclic peptide ligands containing the HPQ sequence and probe the structural basis for the dependences through crystallographic determination of complexes at multiple pH values. The affinities for streptavidin at pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 7.0, 7.3, 8.0, and 9.3 of linear Ac-AEFSHPQNTIEGRK-NH2, cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2, cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQFC]IEGRK-NH2, and cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 are determined by plasmon resonance measurements. We also determine the streptavidin-bound crystal structures of cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 at pH 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 and of smaller versions of the other ligands, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2 at pH 2.0, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, and 11.8, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 at pH 2.5, 2.9 and 3.7, and FSHPQNT at pH 4.0. Several structures are determined in two space groups, I222 and I4122. The structures of the complexes are compared with those previously determined at other pH values. The crystal structures of the streptavidin-bound linear and cyclic peptide ligands determined over a range of pH values show that the pK a of the peptide His is greatly reduced in the crystals. Together with the pH dependences of the peptide affinities, the structures of the complexes over a range of pH values suggest that deprotonation of the peptide His is required for high affinity binding both in the crystals and in solution. Peptides for crystallography, FSHPQNT, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2, and cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 were synthesized as described (6Giebel L.B. Cass R.T. Milligan D.

For BIAcore analysis, corresponding peptides Ac-AEFSHPQNTIEGRK-NH2, cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQGPPC]IEGRK-NH2, cyclo-Ac-AE[CHPQFC]IEGRK-NH2 and cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2 were synthesized as described (6Giebel L.B.

Soc. 1995; 117: 8541-8547Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The first three of these are longer than the corresponding ones for crystallography; they contains N-terminal AE sequence and C-terminal IEGRK for reasons independent of the present study (6Giebel L.B. Cass R.T. Milligan D. Young D. Arze R. Johnson C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15430-15435Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Apostreptavidin, purchased from Calbiochem, was crystallized by vapor diffusion in 40 λ sitting drops under conditions described for crystals of space group I222 (13Katz B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15421-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Pähler A.

Streptavidin-FSHPQNT was cocrystallized (13Katz B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15421-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in the I222 and I4122 (a = 58.0 Å, c = 174.5 Å) space groups under similar conditions, pH 4.0, at an initial peptide concentration of 15.0 mg/ml. Streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2 crystals, pH 2.0, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, and 11.8 were prepared by soaking I4122 streptavidin-cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2 cocrystals (13Katz B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15421-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in synthetic mother liquor (75% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 25% buffer) at peptide concentrations ranging from 15.0 to 28.0 mg/ml for several days. For the pH 2.0 and 3.0 structures the buffer was 1.0 m sodium formate. At pH 3.6, 4.2, and 4.8 the buffer was 1.0 mpotassium acetate, and at pH 11.8 it was 0.10 mCAPS. 1The abbreviations used are: CAPS, 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, [bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-tris-(hydroxymethyl)-methane; Fo and Fc, observed and calculated structure factors; αc, calculated phases. Crystals of streptavidin-cyclo-[5-S-valeramide-HPQGPPC]K-NH2, and -cyclo-Ac-[CHPQGPPC]-NH2 were prepared by soaking I222 or I4122 apostreptavidin crystals in 75% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 0.25 msodium formate, 20 mg/ml peptide, pH 1.5, 2.5, or 2.9, or in 75% (NH4)2SO4, 0.25 mpotassium acetate, pH 3.7. The target pH values were obtained by adjusting 2-ml volumes of (NH4)2SO4/buffer solution with NaOH or HCl using a calibrated Corning pH meter. The peptides were subsequently dissolved in smaller (∼100–250 λ) volumes whose final target pH values were confirmed with pH paper designed to measure integral pH values as well as pH values 0.5 units from integral. Because of the relatively large molarity of the buffers in the synthetic mother liquors and the smaller molarity of peptides, the effect of dissolving the peptide in the (NH4)2SO4/buffer solutions is insignificant. Some x-ray diffraction data sets of streptavidin-peptide complexes were collected on a Siemens IPC area detector coupled to a Siemens three-circle goniometer mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode target copper tube operating at 50 kV, 60 mA. Data were indexed and reduced to produce integrated intensities and structure factors with the programs Sadie and Saint supplied by Siemens as described (13Katz B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15421-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other x-ray diffraction data sets were obtained with an R-AXIS IV image plate system equipped with mirrors mounted on the Rigaku generator upgraded to operate at 50 kV, 100 mA. The nonmonochromated mirror-focused x-rays were filtered with 0.004 cm of nickel. The image plate and associated data reduction software (Biotex) were from Molecular Structure Corporation (The Woodlands, TX). Crystal-to-detector distances ranged from 69.6 to 85.0 mm, 2θ = 0.0 °, oscillations in φ (Δφ) from 1.00 to 1.50 °/frame, 20–45 min/frame. For highly diffracting crystals, data were also collected at a distance of 75.7 mm, 2θ = 7.77 °. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table I.Table ICrystallography of streptavidin-peptide complexes at various pH valuesParameters, cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH21-aRestrained, isotropic temperature factors were refined, and bulk solvent contributions were included for all structures. For I4122 and I222 structures with more than 2000 and 4000 atoms, respectively, hydrogens were included in the refinements.

We recently proposed that TF1, which binds with high affinity (K d was ∼3 nm) to preferred sites within the hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)-containing phage genome, identifies its binding sites based on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility. Here, we show that two hmU-A base pair steps coinciding with two previously proposed sites of DNA distortion are critical for complex formation. The affinity of TF1 is reduced 10-fold when both of these hmU-A base pair steps are replaced with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps; only modest changes in affinity result when substitutions are made at other base pairs of the TF1 binding site. Replacement of all hmU residues with thymine decreases the affinity of TF1 greatly; remarkably, the high affinity is restored when the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to previously suggested sites of distortion are reintroduced into otherwise T-containing DNA. T-DNA constructs with 3-base bulges spaced apart by 9 base pairs of duplex also generate nm affinity of TF1.

The genome of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1 contains 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) 1The abbreviations used are: hmU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil; IHF, integration host factor; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: hmU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil; IHF, integration host factor; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide. in place of thymine, and discrimination between T- and hmU-containing DNA is important during phage multiplication (1Lee G. Hannett N.M. Korman A. Pero J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Choy H.A. Romeo J.M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For one phage-encoded protein, the DNA-binding and -bending protein TF1, this discrimination is essentially absolute: the high affinity of TF1 (K d order of magnitude nm) for preferred sites within the hmU-containing phage genome is greatly reduced for the corresponding T-containing DNA (3Johnson G.G. Geiduschek E.P. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1473-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Greene J.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA is matched in T-containing DNA constructs that contain sets of two consecutive mismatches separated by 9 bp of duplex, indicating that hmU-content and appropriately placed flexible loops contribute similarly to complex formation. We proposed, therefore, that DNA in a complex with TF1 is distorted at two sites that are separated by 9 bp of duplex DNA, sites corresponding to two hmU-A base pair steps, and that TF1 identifies its target sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexibility (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we examine the requirement for hmU residues across a 37-mer DNA duplex representing a preferred binding site within the phage genome (4Greene J.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and specifically evaluate sequence requirements at the two inferred sites of DNA distortion. TF1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli DL39 (6Härd T. Hsu V. Geiduschek E.P. Appelt K. Kearns D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and purified as described (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides with hmU content were synthesized as described (7Conte M.R. Galeone A. Avizonis D. Hsu V.L. Mayol L. Kearns D.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1992; 2: 79-82Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. T-containing oligonucleotides were purchased and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The top strand (shared among bulge constructs) was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Complementary oligonucleotides were mixed at equimolar concentrations, heated to 90 °C, and slowly cooled to 4 °C over several hours to form duplex DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments were carried out as described (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Experiments with perfect duplex hmU- or hybrid T/hmU-DNA were done at room temperature unless noted otherwise. Experiments with bulge constructs were performed at 4 °C to prevent dissociation of duplexes. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and protein-DNA complexes were quantified using phosphorimaging. DNA migrating between bands corresponding to free and complexed DNA was considered as free DNA (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in calculating equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Values of K d are reported as the average of at least three experiments ± S.E. (for closely related DNA constructs yielding suboptimal complex formation, triplicate determinations were deemed unnecessary). The sequence of a 37-mer DNA construct corresponding to a preferred binding site within the phage SPO1 genome (4Greene J.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1 A. Because of the ability of TF1 to form nested complexes on longer DNA fragments, the length of the DNA constructs was chosen to accommodate only one TF1 dimer (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The affinity of TF1 for the 37-mer hmU-containing duplex (K d was ∼3 nm; Fig. 1 A) was reduced 10-fold upon replacement of the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to the potential sites of distortion with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps (Figs. 1 and 2, panels B). Altering the sequence at the center of the binding site (Figs. 1 and 2,panels C) or on the flanks, distal to the proposed sites of bending (Figs. 1 and 2, panels D), did not significantly affect complex formation. The observed sequence specificity at proposed sites of distortion is consistent with a direct participation of hmU-A base pair steps in complex formation and DNA bending.Figure 2Electrophoretic analysis of hmU-DNA titrated with TF1. The affinity of TF1 for the 37-mer duplex corresponding to a preferred binding site (panel A) is reduced upon replacement of hmU-A base pair steps with A-hmU (panel B). Altering the central base pairs (GC-rich; panel C) or the sequence distal to proposed sites of DNA distortion (wild-type (wt) +GC; panel D) has little effect on complex formation. Protein concentrations indicated below panel Dare identical for all panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the contribution of hmU residues to the DNA binding affinity of TF1, DNA constructs were designed in which central hmU-containing blocks of 13 or 11 bp, encompassing the proposed sites of DNA distortion (Fig. 3, constructs Th2 andTh3), or of 9 or 7 bp, excluding hmU-A steps that are candidate sites of specific distortion (Fig. 3, constructsTh4 and Th5), were embedded in T-containing surrounding sequence. Constructs in which the proposed sites of distortion lie within the hmU-containing blocks (Th2 andTh3) yielded K d = 5–6 nmcompared with 3 nm for all-hmU-DNA. A more than 5-fold reduction in affinity was observed for DNA with shorter hmU-containing blocks (Th4 and Th5). A DNA duplex in which a central 13-bp T-containing block is flanked by hmU-containing sequence (Fig. 3, construct Th1) bound TF1 with 10-fold lower affinity relative to all-hmU-DNA. For DNA with 2 4-bp hmU-containing blocks, a significantly lower affinity was observed for DNA constructs with T-A base pair steps at the proposed sites of bending (Fig. 3, constructs Th8 andTh9) than for otherwise identical constructs with hmU-A base pair steps (Fig. 3, constructs Th6 and Th7;K d was ∼5 nm). Remarkably, TF1 was found to have essentially undiminished affinity for DNA in which the two hmU-A base pair steps are completely surrounded by T-containing DNA (K d = 4 nm; Fig. 3, constructTh7/6, and Fig. 4, A andB). We note also that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA and for the Th7/Th6 construct was the same at room temperature and at 4 °C (Figs. 3 and 5 and data not shown). A 7–10-fold reduction in affinity was observed if only one strand contained the requisite hmU-A sequence (Fig. 3, constructsTh7/T and T/Th6, and Fig. 4 C). Our interpretation of these observations is that hmU content affords an increased flexibility that is recognized by TF1 and that hmU-A base pair steps symmetrically disposed about the center of the binding site are targets for specific distortion in the protein-DNA complex.Figure 5The nm affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA is reproduced by T-DNA with base bulges separated by 9 bp of duplex. The affinity of TF1 for perfect duplex hmU-DNA is reproduced by T-DNA with a set of 4-nt loops (A). 1- or 2-base bulges (lowercase c, underlined) in combination with a mismatch reproduce the nm affinity for TF1 (B), as do 2- or 3-base bulges (C). ≫, the same as in the legend to Fig. 3. All experiments were carried out at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The high affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA (K d was ∼3 nm) was reproduced in T-DNA that contains two appropriately positioned flexible sites generated by sets of tandem mismatches (Ref.5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and Fig. 5 A). Improved complex formation relative to perfect duplex T-DNA would also be expected for T-DNA constructs in which the energetic cost of bending is lessened through the incorporation of bulge-loops, i.e. with nucleotides that are formally unopposed on the complementary strand (Fig. 5). Constructs with sets of 1- or 2-nt bulges combined with one mismatched base pair positioned 9 bp apart indeed generated high affinity for TF1 (Fig.5 B); note that sets of 2-nt loops (one mismatch) generated suboptimal binding compared with sets of 4-nt loops (two consecutive mismatches). The high affinity of TF1 was fully restored for DNA constructs with sets of 2- or 3-nt bulges with suboptimal binding for DNA with a pair of 1-nt bulges (Fig. 5 C). Replacing the T-containing top strand of bulge constructs with the corresponding hmU-containing strand did not affect complex formation (data not shown). Bulge-loops are considered to generate directed kinks in the helix axis (8Gohlke C. Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11660-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7140-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of such kinks, we observed a reduction in electrophoretic mobility of bulged DNA constructs, the magnitude of which depended on the size of the bulge (data not shown). The mobility of protein-DNA complexes was similar irrespective of the nature of the DNA construct. The TF1 double mutant protein TF1 (E15G/T32I) binds DNA with ∼40-fold higher affinity than does wild-type TF1 (10Andera L. Spangler C.J. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) due to interactions outside the central 25-bp region of the binding site (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The presence of bulge-loops in T-DNA affected the affinity of TF1 (E15G/T32I) and wild-type TF1 in similar ways, consistent with unaltered interactions for the mutant protein with a central DNA segment that includes proposed sites of bending (data not shown). The structure of TF1 reveals the presence of flexible β-ribbon arms that are directly involved in DNA binding (11Jia X. Grove A. Ivancic M. Hsu V.L. Geiduschek E.P. Kearns D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 2M. Silva, L. Pasternack, and D. Kearns, submitted for publication. as does the structure of the closely related HU protein (12White S.W. Appelt K. Wilson K.S. Tanaka I. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Vis H. Mariani M. Vorgias C.E. Wilson K.S. Kaptein R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and the recently reported structure of integration host factor (IHF) in a complex with DNA (14Rice P.A. Yang S.-w. Mizuuchi K. Nash H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). At the tip of the DNA-binding arms, TF1 contains a Phe residue at position 61 in place of the Arg found in all other members of this protein family. TF1(F61R) has reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 819-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but was seen to retain high affinity for hmU-DNA (K d = 9.6 ± 0.7 nm). Substituting Phe-61 with Tyr had little effect on affinity (K d = 6.8 ± 0.9 nm). Replacing Phe-61 with a polar, uncharged residue (Ser or Gln) significantly reduces both DNA binding affinity and site-selectivity (15Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 819-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Notably, the affinity for hmU-DNA of both TF1(F61S) (K d = 236 ± 19 nm) and TF1(F61Q) (K d = 685 ± 48 nm) increased more than 5-fold for T-DNA with 2 3-base bulges (K d = 36 ± 2 and 90 ± 7 nm, respectively; Fig. 5). This is in contrast to wild-type TF1 that bound hmU-DNA and bulge-DNA constructs (1+2, 1+3, 0+2, and 0+3) with approximately the same affinity (Fig. 5). T-DNA with sets of 4-nt loops, which also reproduces the affinity of wild-type TF1 for hmU-DNA (Fig. 5 A and Ref. 5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), did not significantly enhance complex formation by TF1(F61S) (K d was ∼200 nm) or TF1(F61Q) (K d was ∼570 nm) beyond that observed with hmU-DNA. Apparently hmU content and flexible loops in T-DNA contribute similarly to complex formation for these TF1 mutant proteins, which are deficient in binding and bending of hmU-DNA (15Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 819-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Schneider G.J. Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 777-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas DNA with a static kink generates an increase in affinity. Our previous conjecture that TF1 principally identifies its preferred binding sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexure was based on an analysis of affinities for DNA constructs with sets of 4-nt loops (5Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For this mode of target site selection, the prediction would be for the sequence at the sites of distortion to significantly affect complex formation. This prediction appears to be borne out both in terms of preferred base pair steps in the context of hmU-DNA (Figs. 1 and 2) but particularly by the significant effect of hmU-A base pair steps in a T-containing surrounding sequence (Figs. 3 and 4). We propose that hmU content confers a site-specific flexibility on the DNA duplex that is recognized by TF1. hmU-A base pair steps that are situated at presumptive sites of DNA bending make the principal contributions to complex formation with TF1. hmU residues at other positions that generate measurable, yet suboptimal affinities, presumably do so either due to longer range effects on DNA flexure or because of alternative placement of TF1. An effect of hmU residues on the deformability of the double helix is corroborated by the increased affinity observed for other members of the family of type II DNA-binding proteins, HU and IHF, and for the unrelated eukaryotic protein, HMG1 (17Grove A.

Changes in complex formation by both major and minor groove-binding proteins and antibiotics induced by introduction of other modified bases have also been interpreted in terms of effects on DNA deformability by exocyclic substituents (18Diekmann S. von Kitzing E.

Inferences about increased flexure of DNA containing modified bases stress the need for analysis of the associated structures and conformational energetics. Structural nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of an A-hmU base pair flanked by G-C base pairs indicates no significant deviations from classical B-form DNA (21Mellac S. Fazakerley G.V. Sowers L.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although nearest neighbors do influence the structure (22Pasternack L.B. Bramham J. Mayol L. Galeone A. Jia X. Kearns D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 13C or31P nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments may provide the required insights into the dynamics of duplex DNA the size of a protein binding site, features that are only poorly extractable from measurements using techniques such as fluorescence polarization and DNA cyclization (23Millar D.P. Robbins R.J. Zewail A.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1982; 76: 2080-2094Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24Kahn J.D. Yun E. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The suggested locations of DNA bends in the TF1·DNA complex coincide with two hmU-A base pair steps. Considering the unique properties of the T-A step in terms of diversity of structure (25Hunter C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1025-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 26Wolffe A.P. Drew H.R. Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar), it would be of particular interest to determine whether the inherent deformability of the T-A step is accentuated in hmU-A. For a protein that bends DNA through a large angle (16Schneider G.J. Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 777-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is not surprising to find a greater affinity for DNA whose axis is kinked by unpaired bases (Fig. 5). Indeed, similar results have been previously reported for HU (27Pontiggia A. Negri A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We note that T-DNA constructs with pairs of suitably placed 4-nt loops or 3-nt bulge-loops generate the same affinity for wild-type TF1. However, different structures and energetics of deformation are indicated by the significantly higher affinity for bulge constructs of the TF1 mutant proteins TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q), which are impaired in DNA binding and bending. These observations are consistent with a static kink introduced by bulge-loops compared with a looser more flexible structure imposed by symmetric loops (8Gohlke C. Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11660-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); we suggest that pre-bent DNA bulge-loop constructs also permit complex formation with certain TF1 mutant proteins, whereas binding and bending of DNA with sets of 4-nt loops (or hmU content) require a protein-mediated introduction and stabilization of DNA kinks. Replacement of Phe-61 at the tip of DNA-binding arms with a polar, uncharged residue may render TF1 mutant proteins either incapable of producing specific DNA kinks, a process which would be aided locally by the presence of DNA bulge-loops, or deficient in securing the resulting DNA conformation, demands on which would be lessened in DNA with a predisposed orientation. If TF1, like IHF, employs a totally conserved Pro residue to intercalate between specific base pairs of the binding site (14Rice P.A. Yang S.-w. Mizuuchi K. Nash H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), then the deficiency of TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q) in DNA binding and bending may reside in their inability to stabilize a severely bent DNA conformation. Phe-61 contributes to the striking preference of TF1 for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 819-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TF1(F61R) also has high affinity for hmU-DNA but a reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 819-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, IHF (which has higher affinity for a specific binding site in hmU-DNA compared with T-DNA (17Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) relies heavily on indirect readout to recognize its binding sites (14Rice P.A. Yang S.-w. Mizuuchi K. Nash H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). If TF1 and IHF engage their DNA targets in an isomorphous fashion, the preference for hmU-DNA characteristic of TF1 may not be due to specific interactions between Phe-61 and hmU residues of the TF1 binding site. Rather, the inability of TF1 to stabilize a T-DNA duplex that is severely kinked through intercalation of Pro residues may be alleviated by the more pliable hmU-DNA. On the other hand, the possibility that TF1 does use Phe-61 directly for inducing DNA kinks at two hmU-A base pair steps remains to be established or disproved by direct structure determination."

Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Because E12 and E47 are expressed in many embryonic and adult tissues (3Roberts V.J. Steenbergen R. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7583-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), they cannot regulate cell type-specific gene expression. Tissue selectivity is achieved by the formation of E12/E47 heterodimers with cell type-specific bHLH transcription factors, which promotes differentiation to individual cell types. For example, the skeletal muscle bHLH factors MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and Myf6 regulate each step of myogenesis by forming heterodimers with E12/E47 (4French B.A. Chow K.-L. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) also depends on the interaction of E12/E47 with cell type-specific bHLH factors. The E2A proteins can also function in the absence of cell type-specific bHLH factors. Although no cell type-specific bHLH factor has been identified in fibroblasts, overexpression of E47 retards the progression of fibroblasts through the cell cycle at the G1 restriction point (10Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The function of E12 and E47 is antagonized by the proteins Id1, Id2, and Id3 (11Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L.

The Id proteins use the HLH domain to sequester E12/E47 and prevent subsequent activation of the E box. Increased transgenic expression of Id1, under the influence of an immunoglobulin promoter/enhancer, prevents B cell differentiation (13Sun X.-H. Cell. 1994; 79: 893-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Also, the Id proteins increase cellular proliferation by inhibiting E12/E47-dependent suppression of growth (14Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of the important role of the E2A proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, proteins that bind to the E2A proteins may also have an important impact on these processes (17Gu W.

By this technique we cloned the rat (r) homologue of the human (h) polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen (PM-Scl) from a rat aorta cDNA library. PM-Scl had been shown previously to reside predominantly in the granular layer of the nucleolus (as well as within distinct nucleocytoplasmic foci) and not to be affected by nuclease digestion (19Alderuccio F. Chan E.K.L. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Reichlin M. Maddison P.J. Targoff I. Bunch T. Arnett F. Sharp G. Treadwell E. Tan E.M. J. Clin.

We found that the C terminus of rPM-Scl interacts specifically with a 54-amino acid domain in E12/E47 that is distinct from the bHLH domain. This interaction appears to affect E2A protein function because cotransfection of rPM-Scl and E47 specifically increased E47-mediated transcriptional activation of an E box-luciferase reporter construct.DISCUSSIONhPM-Scl was first identified with autoantibodies from patients with the syndrome for which it is named (20Reichlin M.

Arthritis Rheum. 1985; 28: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy identified prominent hPM-Scl staining in the granular layer of the nucleolus and in distinct nucleoplasmic clusters (21Reimer G. Scheer U. Peters J.-M. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3802-3808PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-hPM-Scl antibodies precipitated a multimeric complex of 11 or more peptides and phosphoproteins (39Gelpi C. Algueró A. Angeles Martinez M. Vidal S. Juarez C. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 81: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This complex is distinct from the ribonucleoprotein, and indirect evidence suggests that it associates with DNA rather than rRNA (21Reimer G. Scheer U. Peters J.-M. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3802-3808PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gelpi C. Algueró A. Angeles Martinez M. Vidal S. Juarez C. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 81: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The corresponding cDNA was cloned by expression screening with antibodies isolated from patients suffering from the polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome (19Alderuccio F. Chan E.K.L. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). hPM-Scl encodes a 355-amino acid protein whose highly acidic C terminus is responsible for a characteristic pattern of aberrant migration at 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE, despite a predicted size of 39.5 kDa. We have found that rPM-Scl also has an aberrant migration pattern on SDS-PAGE owing to its C terminus (Fig. 5, bottom).The localization of hPM-Scl to the granular layer of the nucleoli and to distinct nucleocytoplasmic foci suggests that it is associated with the nuclear matrix. The nuclear matrix is a complex lattice of nonhistone proteins that is resistant to nuclease digestion and high salt extraction (40van Driel R. Humbel B. de Jong L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Berezney R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The matrix affects transcription by binding to trans-acting factors that include the steroid receptors (42van Steensel B. Jenster G. Damm K. Brinkmann A.O. van Driel R. J. Cell.

A. 1994; 91: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Retention of trans-acting factors in the nuclear matrix can increase or decrease transcriptional activity. In addition, the nuclear matrix orchestrates the formation of distinct subnuclear compartments into specific foci of transcription (46Jackson D.A. Hassan A.B. Errington R.J. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 47Elefanty A.G. Antoniou M. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Grosveld F.G.

Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar).To consider the possibility that PM-Scl interacted with different families of trans-acting factors, we tested the specificity of the rPM-Scl-E12/E47 interaction by the yeast two-hybrid assay. rPM-Scl did not interact with the HLH protein Id3 or with thetrans-acting factors Max, Gax, Myb, and OCT-1 (Fig. 4). By contrast, rPM-Scl interacted well with E12 and E47. E12 and E47 differ by their HLH domains, which result from differential splicing of theE2A gene. The two bHLH exons encode similar domains that have clearly different affinities for other HLH domains (2Sun X.-H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The absence of a difference between E12 and E47 in binding affinity for rPM-Scl implies a non-bHLH binding domain.We again used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify the domains through which rPM-Scl and E12/E47 bind. The E2A protein binding epitope is in the C terminus of rPM-Scl. This epitope binds to a 54-amino acid domain upstream of the E12/E47 bHLH domain. Removal of the basic or HLH domains did not affect the binding interaction of E47 with rPM-Scl. GenBankTM analysis of this 54-amino acid domain revealed conservation of amino acid sequence between the E2A proteins and E2-5/ITF-2. This domain is also conserved among the human, rat, mouse, and guinea pig E2A proteins.To validate further the cellular interaction between E12/E47 and rPM-Scl, we performed transient transfection assays with an E box-luciferase reporter plasmid. rPM-Scl increased E47-dependent luciferase activity without increasing the basal activity of an E box-luciferase or an SV40-luciferase (pGL2) reporter plasmid (Fig. 7). Although a nonspecific reduction in reporter plasmid activity is common in cotransfection assays, an increase in activity indicates a specific interaction. This observation supports the conclusion that rPM-Scl and E12/E47 are interacting partners within mammalian cells.The regulated expression of rPM-Scl may indicate that this nucleolar protein is a novel non-HLH regulator of the E2A proteins. Like PM-Scl, B23 is a nucleolar protein that associates with atrans-acting factor, YY1. Both B23 and YY1 have been colocalized to the nuclear matrix and the nucleolar remnant (49Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and transfection of B23 with YY1 relieves YY1-induced repression of transcription. In contrast, our cotransfection experiments (Fig. 6) indicate that rPM-Scl enhances activation of E2A protein transcription. Still, the net effect of B23 on YY1 and rPM-Scl on E12/E47 is to increase transcription.We have cloned and characterized UbcE2A (31Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that binds the same E2A protein domain as rPM-Scl. UbcE2A antagonizes the functional activity of the E2A proteins by promoting their degradation. Also, Sloan et al. (50Sloan S.R. Shen C.-P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have found that B cell differentiation may be regulated by phosphorylation of E47 serine residues 514 and 529, which are contained within the rPM-Scl binding epitope. The convergence in one E2A protein region of these three regulatory mechanisms (degradation, phosphorylation, and possibly nuclear matrix attachment) may indicate an important non-HLH regulatory domain.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) also depends on the interaction of E12/E47 with cell type-specific bHLH factors. The E2A proteins can also function in the absence of cell type-specific bHLH factors. Although no cell type-specific bHLH factor has been identified in fibroblasts, overexpression of E47 retards the progression of fibroblasts through the cell cycle at the G1 restriction point (10Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The function of E12 and E47 is antagonized by the proteins Id1, Id2, and Id3 (11Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 12Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1815-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although the Id proteins have an HLH domain, they lack a DNA-binding domain. The Id proteins use the HLH domain to sequester E12/E47 and prevent subsequent activation of the E box. Increased transgenic expression of Id1, under the influence of an immunoglobulin promoter/enhancer, prevents B cell differentiation (13Sun X.-H. Cell. 1994; 79: 893-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Also, the Id proteins increase cellular proliferation by inhibiting E12/E47-dependent suppression of growth (14Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Okayama H. Oda K. J. Biol.

Because of the important role of the E2A proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, proteins that bind to the E2A proteins may also have an important impact on these processes (17Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 18Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 507-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with the E2A proteins, we used E12 as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid interaction trap. By this technique we cloned the rat (r) homologue of the human (h) polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen (PM-Scl) from a rat aorta cDNA library. PM-Scl had been shown previously to reside predominantly in the granular layer of the nucleolus (as well as within distinct nucleocytoplasmic foci) and not to be affected by nuclease digestion (19Alderuccio F. Chan E.K.L. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Reichlin M. Maddison P.J. Targoff I. Bunch T. Arnett F. Sharp G. Treadwell E. Tan E.M. J. Clin.

We found that the C terminus of rPM-Scl interacts specifically with a 54-amino acid domain in E12/E47 that is distinct from the bHLH domain. This interaction appears to affect E2A protein function because cotransfection of rPM-Scl and E47 specifically increased E47-mediated transcriptional activation of an E box-luciferase reporter construct. DISCUSSIONhPM-Scl was first identified with autoantibodies from patients with the syndrome for which it is named (20Reichlin M. Maddison P.J. Targoff I. Bunch T. Arnett F. Sharp G. Treadwell E. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Immunol. 1984; 4: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 38Targoff I.N. Reichlin M. Arthritis Rheum. 1985; 28: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy identified prominent hPM-Scl staining in the granular layer of the nucleolus and in distinct nucleoplasmic clusters (21Reimer G. Scheer U. Peters J.-M. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3802-3808PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-hPM-Scl antibodies precipitated a multimeric complex of 11 or more peptides and phosphoproteins (39Gelpi C. Algueró A. Angeles Martinez M. Vidal S. Juarez C. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 81: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This complex is distinct from the ribonucleoprotein, and indirect evidence suggests that it associates with DNA rather than rRNA (21Reimer G. Scheer U. Peters J.-M. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3802-3808PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gelpi C. Algueró A. Angeles Martinez M. Vidal S. Juarez C. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 81: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The corresponding cDNA was cloned by expression screening with antibodies isolated from patients suffering from the polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome (19Alderuccio F. Chan E.K.L. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). hPM-Scl encodes a 355-amino acid protein whose highly acidic C terminus is responsible for a characteristic pattern of aberrant migration at 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE, despite a predicted size of 39.5 kDa. We have found that rPM-Scl also has an aberrant migration pattern on SDS-PAGE owing to its C terminus (Fig. 5, bottom).The localization of hPM-Scl to the granular layer of the nucleoli and to distinct nucleocytoplasmic foci suggests that it is associated with the nuclear matrix. The nuclear matrix is a complex lattice of nonhistone proteins that is resistant to nuclease digestion and high salt extraction (40van Driel R. Humbel B. de Jong L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Berezney R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The matrix affects transcription by binding to trans-acting factors that include the steroid receptors (42van Steensel B. Jenster G. Damm K. Brinkmann A.O. van Driel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), ATF (43van Wijnen A.J. Bidwell J.P. Fey E.G. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S.

A. 1994; 91: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Retention of trans-acting factors in the nuclear matrix can increase or decrease transcriptional activity. In addition, the nuclear matrix orchestrates the formation of distinct subnuclear compartments into specific foci of transcription (46Jackson D.A. Hassan A.B. Errington R.J. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 47Elefanty A.G. Antoniou M. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Grosveld F.G.

Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar).To consider the possibility that PM-Scl interacted with different families of trans-acting factors, we tested the specificity of the rPM-Scl-E12/E47 interaction by the yeast two-hybrid assay. rPM-Scl did not interact with the HLH protein Id3 or with thetrans-acting factors Max, Gax, Myb, and OCT-1 (Fig. 4). By contrast, rPM-Scl interacted well with E12 and E47. E12 and E47 differ by their HLH domains, which result from differential splicing of theE2A gene. The two bHLH exons encode similar domains that have clearly different affinities for other HLH domains (2Sun X.-H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The absence of a difference between E12 and E47 in binding affinity for rPM-Scl implies a non-bHLH binding domain.We again used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify the domains through which rPM-Scl and E12/E47 bind. The E2A protein binding epitope is in the C terminus of rPM-Scl. This epitope binds to a 54-amino acid domain upstream of the E12/E47 bHLH domain. Removal of the basic or HLH domains did not affect the binding interaction of E47 with rPM-Scl. GenBankTM analysis of this 54-amino acid domain revealed conservation of amino acid sequence between the E2A proteins and E2-5/ITF-2. This domain is also conserved among the human, rat, mouse, and guinea pig E2A proteins.To validate further the cellular interaction between E12/E47 and rPM-Scl, we performed transient transfection assays with an E box-luciferase reporter plasmid. rPM-Scl increased E47-dependent luciferase activity without increasing the basal activity of an E box-luciferase or an SV40-luciferase (pGL2) reporter plasmid (Fig. 7). Although a nonspecific reduction in reporter plasmid activity is common in cotransfection assays, an increase in activity indicates a specific interaction. This observation supports the conclusion that rPM-Scl and E12/E47 are interacting partners within mammalian cells.The regulated expression of rPM-Scl may indicate that this nucleolar protein is a novel non-HLH regulator of the E2A proteins. Like PM-Scl, B23 is a nucleolar protein that associates with atrans-acting factor, YY1. Both B23 and YY1 have been colocalized to the nuclear matrix and the nucleolar remnant (49Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and transfection of B23 with YY1 relieves YY1-induced repression of transcription. In contrast, our cotransfection experiments (Fig. 6) indicate that rPM-Scl enhances activation of E2A protein transcription. Still, the net effect of B23 on YY1 and rPM-Scl on E12/E47 is to increase transcription.We have cloned and characterized UbcE2A (31Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that binds the same E2A protein domain as rPM-Scl. UbcE2A antagonizes the functional activity of the E2A proteins by promoting their degradation. Also, Sloan et al. (50Sloan S.R. Shen C.-P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have found that B cell differentiation may be regulated by phosphorylation of E47 serine residues 514 and 529, which are contained within the rPM-Scl binding epitope. The convergence in one E2A protein region of these three regulatory mechanisms (degradation, phosphorylation, and possibly nuclear matrix attachment) may indicate an important non-HLH regulatory domain. hPM-Scl was first identified with autoantibodies from patients with the syndrome for which it is named (20Reichlin M.

We cloned theacrB gene, which has been identified as a mutation of thegyrB gene, and found a double point mutation altering two consecutive amino acids (S759R/R760C) in the COOH-terminal region of the gyrase B subunit. The mutant B subunit was found to associate with the A subunit to make the quaternary structure, and the reconstituted gyrase showed an 80-fold reduction of specific activity in DNA supercoiling assay; the sensitivity to acriflavine was not different in the same unit of wild-type and mutant gyrases. The mutant enzyme retained intrinsic ATPase activity, but DNA-dependent stimulation was observed infrequently. A gel shift assay showed that acriflavine inhibited the DNA binding of gyrase. The acrBmutation also reduced significantly the DNA binding of gyrase but did not change the sensitivity to acriflavine. These results revealed that the acrB mutation is related to the inhibitory mechanism of acriflavine; and the acriflavine sensitivity of the mutant, at leastin vitro, is caused mainly by reduction of the enzyme activity. Further, our findings suggest that the COOH-terminal region of the B subunit is essential for the initial binding of gyrase to the substrate DNAD87842.

Acriflavine is an acridine dye that causes inhibition of cell division in microorganisms, plasmid loss of bacterial cells, and high mutation frequencies. The mutagenic activity of acridine dyes results mainly in frameshift mutation, which is derived from insertion or deletion of base(s) in the DNA (1Drake J.W. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1964; 64: 1-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although acriflavine is known as an antibiotic agent, almost all Escherichia coli K12 wild-type strains exhibit resistance to this reagent. For investigation of determinants in acriflavine resistance, five acridine-sensitive mutants have been isolated: acrA (2Nakamura H. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 8-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acrB (3Nakamura H. Hachiya N. Tojo T. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1184-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),acrC and acrD (4Nakamura H. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 8-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and acrE (5Nakamura H. Okada N. Mem. Konan Univ. Sci. Ser. 1989; 36: 83-88Google Scholar). The acrA mutant is highly cross-sensitive with membrane-attackable substances such as phenethyl alcohol, detergents, and some fatty acids (6Nakamura H. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 987-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakamura H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1183-1184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned acrA +gene showed a gene dosage effect in E. coli (8Hase A. Funatsuki K. Kawakami M. Nakamura H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 1053-1057Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed an operon encoding two membrane protein genesacrA and acrE (this is not the same gene described above) (9Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This acrAE operon is homologous to theenvCD operon mutant, which is also hypersusceptible to basic dyes, detergents, and antibiotics (10Klein J.R. Henrich B. Plapp R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These genes are deduced to be subunits of energy-dependent pump proteins. Mutations at the acrA locus also occurred in response to deletion of topA, which encodes topoisomerase I (11DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These mutations help the survival of ΔtopA strains under specific growth conditions. Deletion of topA is deleterious to E. coli, and several compensatory mutations have also been mapped to gyrA or gyrB (11DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Although the relationship between acrA and the superhelicity of genome DNA has not been elucidated clearly yet, it is interesting that theacrB gene has been demonstrated to fall into the same cistron of gyrB (12Hansen I.G. Meyenburg K.v. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); in the genetic map of the E. coli chromosome, acrB is designated in the locus ofgyrB (13Backmann B.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 180-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that gyrase is at least one of the target proteins of acriflavine. The DNA gyrase of E. coli consists of two A subunits (M r = 105,000, gene gyrA) and two B subunits (M r = 95,000, gene gyrB) to form a tetramer. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of supercoiling-relaxation, knotting-unknotting, and catenation-decatenation for DNA strands in the presence of ATP and divalent metal ions (14Cozzarelli N.R. Science. 1980; 207: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 16Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The A subunit contains the active site for DNA breakage and reunion, and it forms a homodimer in the absence of the B subunit that does not make a dimer conformation itself (18Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The B subunit has an ATPase domain (NH2-terminal region), the structure of which has been demonstrated crystallographically (19Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The B subunit that lacks the NH2-terminal ATPase domain, named ν protein, still shows DNA relaxing activity (20Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, this region is thought to contain all of the functional domains in the B subunit for establishing topoisomerase activity. The mechanisms of the precise parts of this protein, however, have not been elucidated yet. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the acrBmutation located in the COOH-terminal region. The results suggest that this region contributes to the DNA binding of gyrase. Wild-type strain W1895 (metB, gyrA +,gyrB +, acriflaviner) andacrB strain N2879 (acriflavines mutant derived from W1895) were used in the acriflavine resistance test (3Nakamura H. Hachiya N. Tojo T. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1184-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pJB11, which has 3.4-kilobase fragment containing thegyrB gene (22Yamagishi J. Yoshida H. Yamayoshi M. Nakamura S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. A. Hase (Osaka City Research Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science). Expression vector pGEX4T-3 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. pBluescript II (KS+) was from Stratagene. PGY medium-concentrated (1% Polypeptone (Difco Laboratories), 0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% NaCl, 0.1% glucose, adjusted pH 7.4) and PGY medium-dilute (0.5% Polypeptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.3% NaCl, 0.1% glucose, adjusted pH 8.0) were used for the acriflavine sensitivity test. Other media were constructed as described in Ref. 23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Restriction enzymes were from Takara Shuzo (Japan), the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system was from Pharmacia, and oligonucleotides were from Biologica (Japan). Genomic DNA was purified from E. coli strain N2879 as described by Cosloy and Oishi (24Cosloy S.D. Oishi M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1973; 124: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The DNA library was constructed with the pBluescript II (KS+) plasmid, and the gyrB(acrB) gene was screened by colony hybridization using a wild-type gyrB gene as a probe. The DNA fragment was labeled with the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). The gyrA gene was cloned from strain W1895 by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). DNA sequencing was performed using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) gyrA, gyrB, andgyrB(acrB) gene products were purified by the protocol of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein system, DEAE-Sepharose column (25Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a Novobiocin-Sepharose column (26Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Each plasmid for overexpression of the gyrase subunit was constructed using the expression vector pGEX4T-3 (Pharmacia). In the expression plasmid for the gyrA gene, an arginine codon AGA at the 6th codon, which is a rare codon in E. coli, was replaced by CGT. All of the gyrase genes were inserted in the site ofBamHI (NH2 terminus) and XhoI (COOH terminus) of the vector; each gene product is expected to have two extra amino acids upstream of the first methionine after the thrombin cleavage. The transformed cells were inoculated into 2.5 liters of 2 × YT medium and incubated at 30 °C with vigorous shaking until A 600 reached at 0.5. Expression of the fusion gene was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm. After 30 min (15 min for B subunits), the culture was cooled down rapidly on ice, and cells were harvested. Further incubation caused a formation of an inclusion body that was hardly solubilized. The procedure of the glutathione-Sepharose column was essentially as described in manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). We used phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 5 mmDTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for column washing, thrombin cleavage. and protein elution. To purify the B subunit, the eluate from the glutathione-Sepharose column was dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of TGED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.12 m NaCl and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose (type DE52, Whatman) column (12-ml bed volume) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through fraction was collected and subjected to the Novobiocin column procedure. To obtain the A subunit, the DEAE column procedure was skipped. The sample was dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT, 10% ethylene glycol) and loaded onto a Novobiocin affinity column (50-ml bed volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. To obtain the A subunit, the flow-through fraction was collected. For elution, HEPES buffer containing 5 m urea was used to obtain the wild-type B subunit and HEPES buffer containing 7 m urea for the acrB mutant subunit. Finally, these samples were dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of TGED buffer without NaCl, concentrated by Centricon (Amicon), and stored at −80 °C. Relaxed pBluescript plasmid DNA was prepared by topoisomerase I enzyme from rat liver (27Otter R. Cozzarelli N.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gyrase enzyme was reconstituted in 30 μl of reconstitution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 360 μg/ml BSA, 20% glycerol) with purified A and B subunits (7.5 μg each). The supercoiling assay was performed in 60 μl of the reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1.5 mm ATP, 5 mmspermidine, 50 μg/ml BSA, 500 μg/ml tRNA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of relaxed pBluescript DNA, and various amounts of reconstituted gyrase. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, then extracted with phenol solution and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution twice, respectively. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and subjected to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. One unit of enzyme activity of gyrase was defined as the amount that brought 50% of relaxed DNA to the supercoiled position in agarose gel electrophoresis. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA, 1 μg of gyrase, and various concentrations of ATP with or without 2.5 μg of relaxed pBluescript II (KS+) DNA. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The amount of generated ADP was measured by high performance liquid chromatography as described by Taylor et al. (28Taylor M.W. Hershey H.V. Levine R.A. Coy K. Olivelle S. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 219: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The gyrase cleavage site of pBR322 (29Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (base position 886–1089) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pBluescript. The isolated DNA fragment was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction was performed with the method of Bachellier et al. (30Bachellier S. Saurin W. Perrin D. Hofnung M. Gilson E. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with modifications. Gyrase was reconstructed with 5.0 μg of A and B subunit, respectively, in 20 μl of the reconstitution buffer described above. Half of the reconstituted gyrase (10 μl) was added to 10 ml of 2 × binding buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 12 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm DTT, 20 mm ATP) containing 300 pg of labeled DNA and 25 ng of double stranded competitor DNA (poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), Sigma). Subsequently, samples were incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. Polyacrylamide gel (multigel 2–15% gradient, Daiichi-kagaku Co. Ltd.) was used, and prerunning was done with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 192 mm glycine, 8 mm MgCl2 at 90-V constant voltage for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein-bound and free DNA were separated electrophoretically with new buffer at 90-V constant voltage for 4 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and contacted to the x-ray film. To quantitate the gyrase-DNA complex, a gel containing the complex was excised, and the radioactivity was counted by the Cerenkov method. Using the gyrB(wild) gene as a probe, we isolated thegyrB(acrB) gene from N2879 strain. The nucleotide sequences of the gyrB(acrB) gene revealed two nucleotide substitutions. The 2275th A from the translation start was substituted for C by transversion, and 2278th C was substituted for T by transition. These point mutations alter amino acids in the B subunit: Ser759 → Arg and Arg760 → Cys. These mutations were located at the COOH-terminal region of thegyrB gene (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence of the other part was identical to the reported gyrBsequence (31Adachi T. Mizuuchi M. Robinson E.A. Appella E. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 771-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The bacterial growth curves in the presence of 20 μg/ml acriflavine are shown in Fig. 2. Wild-type strain (W1895) showed continuous growth without time lag. The wild-type cells carrying a high copy number of plasmids with wild-type gyrB(pJB11) or gyrB(acrB) (pSB1) had resistant features. However, the cells carrying pJB11 showed more intense growth than the cells without plasmid, whereas the cells carrying pSB1 showed a 2-h time lag for growth recovery. In the mutant strain (N2879), the cells without plasmid and with pSB1 did not show growth. On the contrary, mutant cells carrying pJB11 showed recovery of the survival after a 4-h decline. Such recovery after a limited time may result from the time lag for gyrB expression induced by decreased superhelicity of the genome DNA (32Menzel R. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4185-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity to acriflavine in the N2879 strain has a complex feature that cannot be explained by the gene dosage effect alone. However, the semidominant character of thegyrB(acrB) gene, which would be caused by the stoichiometric effect of the gene product, is notable. To analyze the gene product of acrB, each subunit of gyrase was overexpressed and purified using the glutathione S-transferase-fusion protocol. After the glutathione S-transferase column procedure, however, a small amount of the other partner of the subunit was still found in purification of both A and B subunits, and each sample exhibited supercoiling activity. Therefore, these glutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins seem to retain the ability to associate with the partner subunit even though they contain a large polypeptide of glutathione S-transferase in the NH2-terminal side. The copurified A and B subunits were absorbed and eliminated by a DEAE-Sepharose column and a Novobiocin affinity column, respectively. Absence of the partner subunit was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and supercoiling assay. About 10 mg of protein was obtained from a 2.5-liter culture in each case. The supercoiling activity in vitro was detected from gyrase proteins reconstituted with both wild-type and the mutant B subunit. However, their specific activities were quite different. The specific activity of wild-type gyrase was calculated to be 3.2 × 106 units/mg of protein, and that of mutant gyrase was 4.0 × 104 units/mg. Therefore, the activity of gyrase was reduced 80-fold byacrB mutation. We also examined the effect of acriflavine in the supercoiling reaction (Fig. 3). Acriflavine caused partial inhibition against 1 unit of gyrase at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and complete inhibition at 6 μg/ml. Against 100 units of gyrase, little inhibition was observed at 10 μg/ml. These findings were common to the wild-type and mutant gyrase. Thus, the sensitivity of the supercoiling activity to acriflavine was not affected by the mutation. We examined whether the mutant B subunit had lost the ability to associate with the A subunit. The molecular weight of the reconstituted mutant gyrase protein was estimated by a Superdex-200HR (Pharmacia) column, and the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.4). Both wild-type gyrase and mutant gyrase were eluted at the same position with a molecular mass of 400 kDa, which corresponds to that of regular gyrase tetramer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an equal amount of gyrA andgyrB subunits. These results showed that the mutant B subunit was able to construct a gyrase tetramer, indicating that the lower supercoiling activity of the mutant gyrase was not due to the loss of the affinity with the A subunit. The NH2-terminal region of the B subunit contains an ATPase domain. We examined the ATPase activity of wild-type and mutant gyrase (Fig. 5). In the absence of DNA, these enzymes showed a similar level of intrinsic ATPase activity. The Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that both K m for ATP was 1.7 mm as reported (26Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the presence of DNA, the ATPase activity was quite different in the wild-type and mutant; the ATP hydrolysis of wild-type gyrase was significantly stimulated by DNA, whereas that of mutant gyrase was hardly stimulated. Fig. 6 shows the inhibitory effect of acriflavine on ATPase activity. Although slight inhibition was observed under the conditions without DNA, the inhibitory effect was the most marked in the case of wild-type enzyme with DNA. In the case of both wild-type and mutant gyrase, the activity was reduced by the high concentration of acriflavine (>3 μg/ml) to the same level as the intrinsic ATPase activity. These results indicated that acriflavine specifically inhibited the DNA-dependent ATPase activity. We examined DNA binding of wild-type and mutant gyrases by gel shift assay. The wild-type gyrase showed notable binding to a 204-base pair DNA fragment containing the cleavage region of gyrase (29Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 A). On the other hand, the gyrase with gyrB(acrB) subunit showed very little binding capacity (Fig. 7 B). The extent of gyrase-DNA complex formation decreased as the concentration of acriflavine increased in the case of wild-type and mutant gyrase. Fifty percent inhibition of binding was observed at a similar concentration of the acriflavine (∼20 μg/ml) in these experiments, indicating that the mutation did not change the sensitivity to acriflavine in DNA binding. Fig. 8 shows the DNA binding of gyrase under the competitive conditions of B subunits to associate with the A subunit. Various amounts of wild-type and mutant B subunits were mixed with constant amount of the A subunit, and the mixtures were subjected to the gel shift assay. With an increasing amount of the mutant B subunit, the amount of the gyrase-DNA complex decreased (Fig.8 A). On the other hand, an excess amount of wild-type B subunit did not inhibit DNA binding and rescued the defect of the mutant gyrase (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Competitive effect of mutant and wild-type B subunit on DNA binding. A subunit (7.5 μg) was mixed with an equal amount (7.5 μg) of wild-type B subunit and various amounts of mutant B subunit (panel A) or mixed with an equal amount of mutant B subunit and various amounts of wild-type B subunit (panel B) in the reconstitution buffer. These mixtures were used for gel shift assays, and the radioactivity in DNA-gyrase complex was counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gyrase is a target protein of several antibiotics, some of whose mechanisms have been analyzed in detail. Coumarin drugs bind the NH2-terminal domain of the B subunit and inhibit ATP hydrolysis of the enzyme. Quinolone antibiotics are deduced to bind a transient complex consisting of cleaved DNA and gyrase, which are bound covalently to each other. Analysis of the resistant mutations of the gyrase gene revealed that mutations occurred in the corresponding domains where these antibiotics act. Isolated mutant gyrases showed resistant features in vitro as well as in vivo(33Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4474-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 34Contreras A. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Yoshida H. Kojima T. Yamagishi J. Nakamura S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The present work showed that acriflavine suppressed DNA binding of gyrase (Fig. 7), and the acrB mutation caused the reduction of DNA binding (Figs. 7 and 8). These results suggest that theacrB mutation is also related to the antibiotic mechanism as the resistant mutations against coumarin and quinolone. Acriflavine is well known as a DNA intercalate substance, and it changes the superhelical density of plasmid as ethidium bromide does, implying that it changes the conformation of the DNA strand. We found that similar concentrations of acriflavine were effective in inhibiting the wild-type gyrase and an 80-fold higher amount of the mutant gyrase in the supercoiling assay (Fig. 3). Therefore, acriflavine is most likely to interact with DNA and not directly with the gyrase protein. As the DNA binding is the initial step of gyrase function, it is reasonable to consider that acriflavine suppresses the subsequent processes such as ATPase activation (Fig. 6) and DNA supercoiling (Fig. 3). The acrB mutation, however, did not change the sensitivity of gyrase to acriflavine in vitro, unlike the resistant mutations against coumarin and quinolone, which change the sensitivity of the gyrase to them, respectively. Supercoiling assay and gel shift assay (Figs. 3 and 7) indicated that the mutant enzyme reduced the activity without becoming more sensitive to acriflavine. These findings suggest that the acriflavine-sensitive feature of acrB is mainly the result of a reduction of specific activity. When we prepared the cell extract from strain N2879 with partial purification by polymine P precipitation (27Otter R. Cozzarelli N.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), no supercoiling activity was detected in that extract, whereas the expected activity was found in the extract from the wild-type strain (data not shown). Thus, gyrase activityin vivo also seemed to be decreased. The mechanism of the susceptibility to acriflavine in vivo, however, appears too complex to be elucidated. For example, the reduction of supercoiling activity may cause a decrease in the superhelical density of genome DNA which allows acriflavine to have greater access to DNA. The acrB mutation alters two amino acids (S759R/R760C) near the COOH-terminal end of the gyrase B subunit (Fig. 1). The region designated as C-TERM in Fig. 1 is separated from the NH2-terminal part of the B subunit by an insertion of about a 170-amino acid sequence (black boxed in Fig. 1), which is absent in gyrases of Gram-positive bacteria, bacterial topoisomerase IV (parE gene), and eukaryotic topoisomerase II. The C-TERM is expected to be a separable structural domain, but the relationship to DNA binding has not been reported in the region. Fig.9 A shows the homology of the C-TERM region to the corresponding regions of B subunit of Bacillus subtilisgyrase and parE protein of E. coli topoisomerase IV. As the deletion of 29 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end ofparE protein (double underlined in Fig.9 A) results in a loss of ability to associate withparC protein (counterpart of the gyrase A subunit) (36Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), C-TERM potentially includes a structure necessary for association with the A subunit. Thus we examined whether the acrB mutation affects the association with the A subunit. The mutant B subunit, however, showed normal assembly with the A subunit in the gel filtration assay (Fig. 4) and the gel shift assay (Fig. 8). These results suggest that the reduction of DNA binding is caused by an alteration in the C-TERM region itself, not by loss of the quaternary structure. Berger et al. (37Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) have recently reported the crystal structure of yeast topoisomerase II and pointed out that a region including a highly conserved sequence (Fig. 9 A), which is located at about 20 residues NH2-terminal from theacrB site, is involved in the contact with the other B subunit in the gyrase tetramer. Considered together with the A subunit-associating region described above, the C-TERM region appeared to serve the two functional structures that are related to contact with the partner A and B subunits, respectively. The crystal structure of topoisomerase II indicates that the counterpart of the region between the conserved sequence and acrB is composed of an α-helix and forms an axis that extends to the linker between the A′ and B′ subfragments. Therefore, the axis-like structure in the NH2-terminal part of C-TERM may structurally support the B′ subfragment as a backbone. Further, during the enzyme reaction of topoisomerase II, a hinge motion of a polypeptide segment located between the A′ and B′ subfragments is suggested by an SV8 proteolysis experiment (38Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal part of C-TERM is expected to serve as the hinge region because it corresponds to the disordered linker region between the A′ and B′ subfragments in the crystal structure (37Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These features of C-TERM led us to the hypothesis that one of the roles of this region is to provide a structure necessary for the conformational change of gyrase. During the enzyme reaction, the B subunits have to come apart for DNA entering. The contact to the other B subunit must be lost in this step, and the hinge motion of the COOH-terminal part of C-TERM is thought to separate each B subunit (37Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar,39Berger J.M. Wang J.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is probably supported structurally by the NH2-terminal part of C-TERM. Therefore, a mutation in C-TERM is expected to cause a disordered arrangement of the whole B subunit and/or disadvantage in conformational change of gyrase. Several possibilities are expected to reduce the DNA binding affinity. One possibility is that the acrB mutation affects DNA recognition and/or the subsequent conformational change of gyrase which is induced during DNA binding. From the analogy of crystal structure of topoisomerase II, acrB seems to be located near the active site tyrosine and CAP-like DNA binding domain in the A subunit. The hydrophobicity plot shows that the mutation region is hydrophilic (Fig. 9 B), implying that the amino acid residues are located at the surface of the protein. Further, the acrBmutation changes the location of a positive charge (Arg760) which might interact directly with DNA. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that this region is related directly to the recognition and/or transportation of DNA to the DNA binding domain of the A subunit. In fact, DNA binding is suggested to cause a structural change of the region corresponding to the COOH-terminal part of C-TERM (38Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence near the acrB mutation region is well conserved in the E. coli parE gene product as well as in B. subtilis gyrase (Fig. 9 A). DNA binding characteristics of topoisomerase IV are thought to be more similar to those of type II eukaryotic enzymes than those of the gyrases from the observation that topoisomerase IV protects only short region (34 base pairs) of DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion as eukaryotic topoisomerase II (40Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the acrB mutation region seems to be related to general DNA binding and not to the gyrase-specific DNA wrapping, which is thought to be caused by the 33-kDa domain of the A subunit (17Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. G. Katsuura and Dr. M. Ishizuka for helpful advice on the ATPase assay and the gel mobility shift assay, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2057812711,"The cytotoxic action of such alkylating chemotherapeutic drugs as 2-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea (CNU) derivatives is countered by the repair proteinO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes O 6-alkylguanine induced in the DNA by these agents. Resistance to these drugs is often correlated with the MGMT levels in normal and tumor cells of human and rodent origin. Exposure of mouse 3T3 cells to increasing concentrations of CNU, and subsequent selection of resistant cells, led to the isolation of clones with 5–10 times higher levels of MGMT activity than in the control. The increased MGMT expression at both mRNA and protein levels resulted from 5- to 10-fold amplification of the Mgmt gene. Amplification of this gene was not associated with concomitant amplification of another alkylation damage repair gene,N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase. No amplification of at least three other genes on chromosome 7 (which contains theMgmt gene) was observed in the drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, the amplified Mgmt sequence was not associated with a homogeneously staining region, or double minute chromosomes, nor present as episomal DNA. In situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes of the drug-resistant cells indicated both translocation and localized amplification of the Mgmt gene.

No amplification of at least three other genes on chromosome 7 (which contains theMgmt gene) was observed in the drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, the amplified Mgmt sequence was not associated with a homogeneously staining region, or double minute chromosomes, nor present as episomal DNA. In situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes of the drug-resistant cells indicated both translocation and localized amplification of the Mgmt gene. Development of resistance to drugs in mammalian tumor cells is a general phenomenon and is the major cause of failure of cancer chemotherapy (1Alitalo K. Oncogene Amplif. 1993; 4: 1-2Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 3Futscher B.W. Dalton W.S. Teicher B.A. Drug Resistance in Oncology. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 461-478Google Scholar). Thus, an understanding of the molecular basis of the development of drug resistance is extremely important for designing new approaches to counter the progression of this process. Commensurate with the diversity of cytotoxic agents and their cellular targets, drug resistance often involves increased expression of specific genes. In the case of the widely studied multiple drug resistance gene,Mdr-1, the encoded product acts as an effluxing pump and reduces the intracellular concentrations of many chemotherapeutic drugs (1Alitalo K. Oncogene Amplif. 1993; 4: 1-2Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 3Futscher B.W. Dalton W.S. Teicher B.A. Drug Resistance in Oncology. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 461-478Google Scholar). Several alkylating agents are being extensively used as potent antitumor drugs. These include nitrogen mustards, procarbazine, and various derivatives of 2-chloroethyl N-nitrosourea (CNU) 1The abbreviations used are: CNU,2-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea; DM, double minute; HSR, homogeneous staining region; Igfr, insulin-like growth factor receptor; MGMT, O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase; MPG, N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase; PKC, protein kinase C; FITC, fluorescein isothiocynate. 1The abbreviations used are: CNU,2-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea; DM, double minute; HSR, homogeneous staining region; Igfr, insulin-like growth factor receptor; MGMT, O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase; MPG, N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase; PKC, protein kinase C; FITC, fluorescein isothiocynate. (4Berger N.A. DeVita J. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1993: 400-409Google Scholar). The CNU-type drugs exert their cytotoxic effect by cross-linking DNA strands, and the first step in the reaction involves O-6 alkylation of guanine. Procarbazine also induces O 6-alkylguanine but not DNA cross-links (4Berger N.A. DeVita J. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1993: 400-409Google Scholar). Additionally, these alkylating agents also induce a significant amount of various N-alkylpurine adducts in DNA (4Berger N.A. DeVita J. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1993: 400-409Google Scholar, 5Ludlum D.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 233: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The O 6-alkylguanine andN-alkylpurines are removed from DNA by two ubiquitous DNA repair proteins, O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), respectively (6Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MGMT removesO 6-alkylguanine (and the less abundantO 4-alkylthymine less efficiently) in a single-step stoichiometric reaction involving direct transfer of the alkyl group to the protein (7Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This mechanism effects inactivation of MGMT and restoration of the original base (8Foote R.S. Mitra S. Pal B.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, repair ofN-alkylpurines in DNA involves the multi-step base excision repair pathway initiated by the removal of the base adduct by MPG, followed by repair of the resulting abasic site (9Friedberg E. Walker E.C. Seide W. DNA Repair. Freeman, San Francisco1994Google Scholar). Thus MGMT, as the sole protein involved in removingO 6-alkylguanine from DNA, is rate-limiting in its repair. Consistent with the rate-limiting activity of MGMT, several studies have established a direct correlation between the MGMT level in a given cell type and its resistance to CNU derivatives and procarbazine (6Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Brent T.P. Houghton J.A. Houghton P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2985-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6119-6129PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many alkylating drug-resistant tumors and cell lines have higher levels of MGMT than their progenitor cells (6Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6119-6129PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of MGMT level on sensitivity to both CNU and such monofunctional alkylating agents as N-methylN′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine indicated thatO 6-alkylguanine, even without subsequent interstrand cross-links, is cytotoxic (11Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6119-6129PubMed Google Scholar, 12Day III R.S. Ziolkowski C.H.J. Scudiero D.A. Meyer S.A. Lubiniecki A.S. Girardi A.J. Galloway S.M. Bynum G.D. Nature. 1980; 288: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). AlthoughN-alkylpurines have been shown to be lethal lesions inEscherichia coli (7Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), their contribution to the killing of mammalian cells by alkylating drugs has not been extensively studied. However, some CNU-resistant tumor cells appear to have low levels of MGMT and remove N-alkylpurine residues more efficiently from their DNA than do normal cells (5Ludlum D.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 233: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In any event, these results show that resistance to alkylating drugs can often be due to increased levels of DNA repair proteins. Gene amplification is frequently observed in tumors and may be associated with the chromosomal instability of tumor cells (13Brison O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 25-41PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chernova O.B. Chernov M.V. Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Trends Biochem.

Res. 1995; 337: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although gene amplification may not occur in normal mammalian cells, nontransformed rodent cell lines, presumably because of their inherent genomic instability, often contain variants with an increased copy number of selectable genes (18Stark G.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). While overexpression of theMgmt gene in many CNU-resistant human tumor lines tested so far appears invariably to be due to elevated levels of transcription, it is important to ask whether amplification of the Mgmtgene itself may also contribute to increased resistance to alkylating agents. An earlier study that preceded the cloning of theMgmt gene suggested that amplification of this DNA repair gene is not responsible for drug resistance in tumor cells (19Vlahos N.S. Futscher B.W. Hora N.K. Trent J.M. Erickson L.C. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In another study, V79 Chinese hamster cells selected for resistance to a nitrosourea derivative were found to contain both increased levels of MGMT and double minute chromosomes, indicative of gene amplification. However, no amplification of the Mgmt gene was detected in these resistant cells (20Morten J.E.N. Bayley L Watson A.J. Ward T.H. Potter P.M. Rafferty J.A. Margison G.P. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the first reported amplification of the Mgmt gene in a mouse cell line, in parallel with the increased resistance of the cells to an alkylating drug. The NIH 3T3 cell line (a gift of W. K. Yang, Biology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory) was sub-cloned and then grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). The clone had an average chromosome number of 65 and was free of double minute chromosomes (DM). The human and mouse MGMT cDNA-containing plasmids and human MPG cDNA-containing plasmid were described earlier (21Chakravarti D. Ibeanu G.C. Tano K. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15710-15715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shiota S. von Wronski M.A. Tano K. Bigner D.D. Brent T.P. Mitra S.

Lomax of NCI, was freshly dissolved in water immediately before each use and diluted in water to obtain the desired concentration. High molecular weight DNA was extracted from the 3T3 cells by the method of Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and digested to completion with different restriction endonucleases for Southern blot analysis. After quantitation of DNA by the fluorometric procedure (25Setaro F. Morley C.G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), 10-μg aliquots of DNA were electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose and transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-probe, Bio-Rad) under alkaline conditions. Purified DNA inserts from various plasmids were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized at 42 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 6 × SSC, 0.25% non-fat dry milk with the radiolabeled probe, and washed to final stringency with 1 × SSC at 60 °C for 30 min (23Tano K. Shiota S. Collier J. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For the Northern transfer analysis, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from proteinase K-digested cell lysates by two successive oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography steps according to Badley et al. (27Badley J.E. Bishop G.A. St. John T. Frelinger J.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 114-116PubMed Google Scholar). Denatured poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose containing 2.2 m formamide and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham). The membrane filters were baked at 80 °C for 1 h, hybridized at 65 °C in 0.5 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.7% SDS, 0.25% non-fat dry milk, and washed as described above. Recombinant DNA probes used in this study were pSS601 (22Shiota S. von Wronski M.A. Tano K. Bigner D.D. Brent T.P. Mitra S.

Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) for PKC-β mapped to chromosome 7 (from ATCC). The MGMT activity in parent and CNU-resistant cells was quantitated using poly((dG·dC), [8-3H]m6dG) as the substrate as described earlier (29Foote R.S. Pal B.C. Mitra S. Mutat. Res. 1983; 119: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The level of the methyltransferase was expressed on a per cell basis. Metaphase cell preparations were made by standard procedures and stained with 3% Giemsa. Twenty cells were analyzed for chromosome number and the presence of DM chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out as described by Pinkel et al. (30Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar) with some modifications (31Natarajan A.T. Vermeulen S. Darroudi F. Valentine M.B. Brent T.P. Mitra S. Tano K. Mutagenesis. 1992; 7: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, biotinylated DNA probe was produced by nick translating a mouse Mgmt genomic clone in λ cosmid, combined with yeast tRNA and salmon sperm DNA, and finally precipitated by adjusting to 0.3 m in sodium acetate (pH 5.6) and adding 2 volumes of cold ethanol. After standing for 2 h and centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), the DNA was resuspended in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 50 mm Na-phosphate (pH 7.0) and hybridized to the cytological preparations for 16 h in situ. After hybridization, the slides were washed three times for 5 min in 60% formamide, 2 × SSC (pH 7.0) at 37 °C, then twice for 5 min each with 2 × SSC, and finally for 5 min with 4 × SSC, 0.5% Tween 20 at room temperature. The slides were incubated with 5% natural non-fat dry milk (Lucerne Ltd.) in 4 × SSC for 10 min at room temperature, then washed with 4 × SSC, 0.05% Tween 20. The biotinylated probe was detected using fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC, 5 ng/μl) conjugated with avidin (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature before three washes with 4 × SSC, 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min. The signals were amplified by reincubation twice with biotinylated anti-avidin D antibodies (5 ng/μl) before another incubation with avidin D and FITC for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, dried in ethanol, mounted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 90% glycerol containing 2% of antifade (1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane, DABCO), propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) and 0.02% sodium azide, and examined under a Leitz microscope equipped with FITC epifluorescence optics. Mouse Mgmt genomic pSS600 clones were isolated from a cosmid library. 2S. Shiota, unpublished data. The total DNA was nick translated with fluorescein-tagged dATP and other unmodified dNTPs. The relative resistance of cells to CNU-type drugs is invariably dependent on their MGMT levels (6Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6119-6129PubMed Google Scholar, 12Day III R.S. Ziolkowski C.H.J. Scudiero D.A. Meyer S.A. Lubiniecki A.S. Girardi A.J. Galloway S.M. Bynum G.D. Nature. 1980; 288: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Because of their relatively high level of MGMT, NIH 3T3 cells are more resistant to CNU than MGMT-deficient cells, e.g. Chinese hamster ovary cells (32Dunn W.C. Tano K. Horesovsky G.J. Preston R.J. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments on cell killing as a function of CNU concentration, we observed that 300 μm CNU killed more than 90% of the cells. We isolated CNU-resistant clones by repeatedly exposing 3T3 cells to increasing concentrations of CNU, starting with 300 μm. The survivors after each treatment were allowed to grow to near confluence. 2 to 3 million cells/100-mm dish in the late log phase were treated with the drug for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium. After removal of the drug, complete medium was added to the dishes, which were transferred to the CO2 incubator. Severe cytotoxicity was apparent as sloughing off most of the cells within 48 h after drug treatment. The remaining cells (<5% of the initial population) were allowed to grow in fresh medium for about 2 weeks when the cell density reached near confluence (4–5 doublings). The cells were split 1:5, transferred to fresh dishes, grown overnight, treated again with 300 μm CNU, and the whole cycle was repeated once more. The surviving cells after growth and subculture were then treated with 400 μm CNU for two cycles, followed by two cycles of exposure to 500 μm. Finally, the cells were exposed to two cycles of 600 μm CNU and single colonies of surviving cells were isolated. Increasing the CNU concentration above 600 μm did not allow any surviving cells that would eventually form colonies. Significant toxicity to 600 μm was observed even among the cells that grow from cells surviving two treatments with that drug concentration. Although about a dozen colonies were formed per dish after treatment with 600 μm, we picked three colonies with the highest cell numbers for further study, and named these presumptive clones CR-1, CR-2, and CR-3. These cells were maintained by treatment with 300 μm CNU before every passage; they showed little toxic response to this drug treatment. These cells showed a small increase in chromosome number (65 ± 10) compared with wild type cells, and some acentric chromosome fragments were observed. However, there was no evidence for acentric DM chromosomes or homogeneously staining regions (HSR) in any of the cell lines (data not shown). Unless otherwise stated, the following experiments were performed with the CR-1 line; experiments with CR-2 showed similar results. Equal amounts of DNA (20 μg) from parental 3T3 and CR-1 were digested with one of several different restriction endonucleases and loaded onto 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.1 μg/ml) before electrophoresis; equal DNA loading was confirmed by the intensity of ethidium fluorescence. Southern blot analysis showed significant increases in Mgmtgene-specific bands in DNA from CR-1 cells compared with that of the untreated control (Fig. 1 A). However, identical profiles of DNA fragments from treated and untreated cell lines were observed using different restriction enzymes. The absence of fragments with altered size indicates that a large segment containing the Mgmt gene was amplified without gross chromosomal rearrangements in the neighboring region. It is interesting to note that CR-3, which also exhibited an increased activity of MGMT after CNU treatment, did not show any increase in gene dosage (data not shown). Thus it appears likely that increased MGMT activity may also result from altered expression in the absence of gene amplification. We further investigated whether amplification of the Mgmt gene was associated with amplification of other selected genes on the same or different chromosomes. Resistance of cells to CNU was invariably correlated with the level of MGMT, the enzyme responsible for the removal of O 6-alkylguanine. Ludlum (5Ludlum D.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 233: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) has also shown that an increased repair of N-alkylpurine adducts in DNA was observed in some tumor cells resistant to BCNU. Furthermore, this resistance was associated with an increased level of MPG activity (6Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the Mpg gene was coamplified with the Mgmt gene in the CR-1 line. Fig.1 B shows the absence of MPG gene amplification in this clone, which, based on densitometric analysis, showed about a 6-fold increase in the Mgmt gene copy number over that of the parent line. The lack of MPG amplification also served as a positive control for equal loading of DNA samples in the gel. The HSR is a hallmark of gene amplification in a locus where hundreds of copies of the amplified genes are present within a chromosome (18Stark G.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,33Windle B.E. Wahl G.M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 276: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Wintersberger E. Chromosoma ( Berl .). 1994; 103: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lack of any HSR in metaphase chromosomes of CR-1 suggested the absence of such extensive amplification of Mgmt and other genes. The mouse Mgmt gene has been localized near the telomere of chromosome 7 at 24.3 centimorgan distal from the centromere, 8.8 centimorgan distal from PKC-β, and 4.6 centimorgan proximal from the Int2 locus (35Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Eppig G.J. Maltais L.J. Miller J.C. Dietrich W.F. Weaver A. Lincoln S.E. Steen R.G. Stein L.D. Nadeau J.H. Lander E.S. Science. 1993; 262: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). 3N. Jenkins, personal communication. Very few genes in the vicinity of the Mgmt gene have been cloned or identified (35Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Eppig G.J. Maltais L.J. Miller J.C. Dietrich W.F. Weaver A. Lincoln S.E. Steen R.G. Stein L.D. Nadeau J.H. Lander E.S. Science. 1993; 262: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We asked whether Mgmt gene amplification affects Igfr,Int-2, and PKC-β. Among these, Int-2 is the closest to Mgmt, and Igfr is the farthest. The filter containing CR-1 DNA was thus hybridized with these probes. We did not detect amplification of any of these genes (Fig. 1 C), and so concluded that the amplified region of chromosome 7 was localized in the immediate vicinity of Mgmt gene. Wahl and co-workers (33Windle B.E. Wahl G.M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 276: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 36Carroll S.M. Guadray P. De Rose M.L. Emery J.F. Meinkoth J.L. Nakkim E. Subler M. Von Hoff D.D. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1740-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have shown that amplification of the CAD gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells involved formation of submicroscopic episomal DNA containing this gene. We followed the protocol described by Carroll et al. (36Carroll S.M. Guadray P. De Rose M.L. Emery J.F. Meinkoth J.L. Nakkim E. Subler M. Von Hoff D.D. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1740-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) to test whether the Mgmt gene could be detected in such episomal DNA in the CR-1 line. Blot hybridization of gel-fractionated DNA corresponding to the expected size of episomal DNA did not show anyMgmt-specific sequences (data not shown). Taken together, our results show that CNU-mediated Mgmt gene amplification is not associated with amplification of another key alkylation repair gene and that the size of the amplified region is less than 4.6 centimorgan surrounding the Mgmt locus. The increased number of the Mgmt gene was expected to result in an increased level of the Mgmt transcript. The level ofMgmt mRNA was indeed elevated 5–6-fold in CR-1 cellsversus the parental 3T3 line when equal amounts of total RNA were loaded onto the gel for Northern blot analysis (Fig.2). In several experiments, a 5–10-fold higher level of MGMT mRNA was present in log-phase CR-1 cells than in log-phase parental cells. Because resistance to CNU is associated with increased MGMT protein levels, it was expected that CR-1 cells would have a higher level of MGMT activity as a result of Mgmt gene amplification. Table I shows that MGMT activity was elevated about 6-fold over that in 3T3 cells. Furthermore, there was an approximately collinear relationship among the increase in Mgmt gene copies, the level of mRNA, and the activity in CR-1 cells when compared with the 3T3 cells.Table IIncrease in MGMT mRNA and Polypeptide in CNU-Resistant CR1 CellsCell lineNo. of MGMT molecules/cell-Fold increaseRatio of mRNA MGMT/γ-actin-Fold increaseControl41,600(1.0)0.04(1.0)CR-1273,8006.60.4310.8CR-2310,0007.40.378.1 Open table in a new tab Finally, we investigated the chromosomal location of the amplified Mgmt gene sequences in CR-1 cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The mouse Mgmtgene has been mapped near the telomere of chromosome 7 (Fig.3) (35Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Eppig G.J. Maltais L.J. Miller J.C. Dietrich W.F. Weaver A. Lincoln S.E. Steen R.G. Stein L.D. Nadeau J.H. Lander E.S. Science. 1993; 262: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Although we did not identify the individual chromosomes in metaphase spreads of control 3T3 and CR-1 cells, it is evident that the Mgmt gene signal is located only at the terminal region of chromosomes in the control 3T3 cells (Fig.3 A). On the average, the 3T3 line appears to be triploid with 60–70 chromosomes, and most of the cells had threeMgmt gene-carrying chromosomes. However, in some cells, an additional centric fragment, indicative of deletion in that chromosome, also contained the Mgmt gene sequence (Fig. 3 A). The average number of chromosomes in CR-1 cells was not significantly different from that in the parent line. However, the Mgmtgene in 90% of CR-1 cells was present in four locations, of which three were terminal and one interstitial (Fig. 3 B). A comparison of the strength of the signals of the control and CR-1 cells indicates significant amplification of the Mgmt gene present in the interstitial region of a chromosome in CR-1 cells. In other late passage preparations of CR-1 cells, four to five Mgmtsignals were present in many cells, often with two amplified signals located in the middle of the arms. The presence of the Mgmtgene in the interstitial region suggests translocation, although the breakpoint cannot be defined. Gene amplification in mammalian cell lines was first observed in association with increased resistance to antimetabolites, when cultured cells were selected in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drugs. The intracellular levels of the proteins targeted by these chemicals were elevated to counter their cytotoxic effects. While multiple mechanisms can cause an increased concentration of target proteins, a simple one is to increase the gene dosage without requiring a change in the promoter activity for the specific gene. Amplification of dihydrofolate reductase and Mdr-1 genes in rodent cells can be readily demonstrated when these are adapted to cytotoxic levels of methotrexate and anthracyclin drugs, respectively (1Alitalo K. Oncogene Amplif. 1993; 4: 1-2Google Scholar, 3Futscher B.W. Dalton W.S. Teicher B.A. Drug Resistance in Oncology. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 461-478Google Scholar). It is now evident that amplification is one manifestation of genomic instability (17Tlsty T.D. Briot A. Gualberto A. Hall I. Hess S. Hixon M. Kuppuswamy D. Romanov S. Sage M. White A. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Stark G.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Gene amplification may not occur in normal diploid mammalian cells possessing functional p53 protein that is involved in maintaining genomic stability (15Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 923-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 17Tlsty T.D. Briot A. Gualberto A. Hall I. Hess S. Hixon M. Kuppuswamy D. Romanov S. Sage M. White A. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although cells permissive for gene amplification often have inactive p53 (17Tlsty T.D. Briot A. Gualberto A. Hall I. Hess S. Hixon M. Kuppuswamy D. Romanov S. Sage M. White A. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Stark G.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), amplification of drug-resistance genes has been observed in cells with wild type p53, presumably because of inactivation of another component in the regulatory pathway downstream of the p53 protein (14Chernova O.B. Chernov M.V. Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, although the 3T3 line used in our studies appears to contain wild type 53, these aneuploid cells are permissive for gene amplification because of another defect in the DNA damage-responsive pathway that prevents cell proliferation (14Chernova O.B. Chernov M.V. Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Amplification of the Mgmt gene as observed in 3T3 cells in our study is consistent with the unequal exchange model (18Stark G.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Toledo F. Buttin G. Debatisse M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 255-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Ma C. Martin S. Trask B. Hamlin J.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The interstitial location of additional copies of Mgmt gene (Fig. 3 B) is consistent with this breakage-fusion-bridge model for gene amplification although other models cannot be excluded without further experiments (33Windle B.E. Wahl G.M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 276: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Wintersberger E. Chromosoma ( Berl .). 1994; 103: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Toledo F. Buttin G. Debatisse M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 255-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whether amplification of theMgmt gene contributes to its overexpression (often observed in tumor cells) has important implications for chemotherapy with CNU derivatives. Earlier attempts to test indirectly for Mgmtgene amplification were unsuccessful (19Vlahos N.S. Futscher B.W. Hora N.K. Trent J.M. Erickson L.C. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is possible that the method based on reassociation kinetics used in that study was not sensitive enough for detecting the small increase in copy number of theMgmt gene. In contrast to the situation with amplification of dihydrofolate reductase and other drug resistance genes where the number of gene copies per cell can be serially increased to a thousand or more by successive treatments with increasing concentrations of the selecting drug (14Chernova O.B. Chernov M.V. Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Windle B.E. Wahl G.M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 276: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we observed that 3T3 cells could not be made more resistant by increasing the CNU concentration, and significant toxicity was observed even at 600 μm CNU in the cells that were originally selected in the presence of 600 μmCNU. A maximum of eight to ten Mgmt gene copies were present in these cells. Limited amplification of the Mgmt gene may be explained by the nature of the selection for cells containing amplified Mgmt. Unlike most other cases, where the target of the selecting drug is the gene product itself, the target of CNU is not MGMT itself, but there is an indirect relationship between the protein and the drug via a DNA lesion. CNU induces a number of cytotoxic lesions, of which O 6-alkylguanine is the most important, and its effects can be countered by an increased level of MGMT. However, with increasing alkylation, the contributions of other cytotoxic adducts (e.g. 7-alkylguanine) become significant, and these cannot be countered by MGMT (6Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In principle, coamplification of genes encoding the repair proteins for the other adducts could allow a continuing increase in CNU resistance. We did not observe such resistance, presumably because amplification is a rare event (18Stark G.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Windle B.E. Wahl G.M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 276: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and coamplification of more than one gene (on different chromosomes) would be extremely rare. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence for amplification of a DNA repair gene. Although amplification of the Mgmtgene has not been observed in the relatively few human drug-resistant tumor lines tested so far, there is no a priori reason to assume that such does not occur, at least in some tumors surviving alkylating drug treatment. Dr. N. Lomax of the NCI provided the alkylating drug CNU. We thank Dr. D. Konkel for careful editing of the manuscript and Wanda Smith for expert secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2072533548,"Ribosome binding to the endoplasmic reticulum has been traditionally studied using an in vitro assay in which potential ribosome receptors have been purified, incorporated into synthetic liposomes, and tested for activity. One such receptor (180 kDa; “p180”) has been shown to bind ribosomes with high affinity in such a system when purified to homogeneity. This result has been challenged by data generated in other laboratories, and as a result, doubt has lingered as to the authenticity of p180 as a ribosome receptor. The contribution of the major difference between these studies, the lipid composition of the liposomes used in the in vitro assays, was assessed when identical fractions of rough endoplasmic reticulum-specific membrane proteins were incorporated into liposomes composed of only phosphatidylcholine (as used in other laboratories), a 50:50 mix of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (as used in our original studies), or lipids derived from canine pancreatic microsomes (as a physiologically relevant control). The presence of PS was found to be crucial for the incorporation into and ribosome binding activity of p180 in liposomes. These observations are compatible with published studies on the importance of acidic phospholipids in ribosome binding to intact microsomes and reconcile the apparently conflicting in vitro results surrounding the assignment of p180 as a ribosome receptor.

These observations are compatible with published studies on the importance of acidic phospholipids in ribosome binding to intact microsomes and reconcile the apparently conflicting in vitro results surrounding the assignment of p180 as a ribosome receptor. Translocation of proteins across the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; OG, octylglucoside; HSS, high salt supernatant; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. represents the first step in the secretion of proteins from the cell. From the outset, models describing the process of protein translocation have specified the functional need for the binding of ribosomes to the ER membrane (1Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. Biomembranes. 1971; 2: 193-195Crossref Google Scholar). Through thein vitro assay devised by Borgese et al., ribosome binding to intact membranes has been shown to be saturable, salt-labile, and protease-sensitive (2Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Hortsch M. Avossa D. Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings stimulated considerable research into the identification of a proteinaceous receptor for ribosomes on the cytoplasmic surface of the rough ER. Two of these proteins, p34 (4Ichimura T. Ohsumi T. Shindo Y Ohwada T. Yagame H. Momose Y. Omata S. Sugano H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and p180 (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), when purified to homogeneity and incorporated into synthetic liposomes, were able to bind ribosomes in a salt-dependent, protease-sensitive manner. p34 was identified as an unglycosylated protein that was enriched in fractions incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes that bound ribosomes. p34 was readily cross-linked to ribosomes from these liposomes (6Tazawa S. Unama M. Tondokoro N. Asano Y. Ohsumi T. Ichimura T. Sugano H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 89-98PubMed Google Scholar), although quantification indicated that 61 p34 molecules were needed to bind one ribosome (4Ichimura T. Ohsumi T. Shindo Y Ohwada T. Yagame H. Momose Y. Omata S. Sugano H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has shown that anti-p34 antibodies were able to inhibit both ribosome binding and translocation across the ER (7Ichimura T. Shindo Y. Uda Y. Ohsumi T. Omata S. Sugano H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Most recently, the primary sequence of p34 was deduced, showing the protein to be a type II membrane protein with a large cytosolic domain. It contains 4.5 tandem leucine-rich repeats (23–24 amino acids in length) and an abundance of charged amino acids (8Ohsumi T. Ichimura T. Sugano S. Omata S. Kuwano R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). p180 was first identified as a soluble proteolytic fragment that inhibited ribosome binding to intact microsomes (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Antibodies produced against the fragment enabled the identification of a 180-kDa cytosolically disposed integral membrane protein that, when purified and incorporated into liposomes (50:50 mix of phosphatidyl serine (PS) and PC), promoted protease-sensitive, high affinity (10–20 nm) ribosome binding. The number of ribosomes bound was virtually identical to the number of p180 molecules incorporated into the liposomes. Antibodies and Fab′ fragments against p180 were able to inhibit ribosome binding and translocation in intact microsomes, and depletion studies demonstrated that removal of p180 from detergent extracts by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography produced liposomes that were incapable of binding ribosomes or translocating proteins. The readdition of p180 to prior to reconstitution restored the bulk of activity (9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This type of study enabled an exploration of ribosome binding against a background of the native microsomal lipids and the entire collection of endogenous rough ER-specific proteins. Studies have been published by Nunnari et al. (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Collins and Gilmore (11Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whose conclusions question the role of p180 as a ribosome-binding protein. The basis for these interpretations appears valid; in both cases, it was found that fractions of detergent extracts of RM containing p180 did not possess ribosome binding activity when incorporated into egg PC liposomes. Logically, both groups came to the conclusion that an as yet to be determined membrane protein is the true ribosome receptor. The recent postulation that the α subunit of the Sec61p complex functions as ribosome receptor during the translocation reaction (12Kalies K. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) is addressed under “Discussion.” Additional support for the role of p180 as a ribosome receptor came from its further characterization, and the demonstration of its ability to bind ribosomes within the context of native membranes both in vivo and in vitro (13Wanker E.E. Sun Y. Savitz A.J. Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Its primary structure indicates an N-terminal membrane anchor followed by a highly repetitive, positively charged (pI = 11) domain in which a unique decapeptide motif is expressed 54 times without interruption. The C-terminal half is characterized by its low pI (4.3) and its ability to bind ATP. Studies in which the various domains of p180 were expressed in yeast have shown that the N-terminal repeat-containing domain is necessary and sufficient for ribosome binding. This feature was determined by both morphological analysis in vivo and by ribosome binding studies carried out in vitro (13Wanker E.E. Sun Y. Savitz A.J. Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is still lingering doubt and controversy based in large part on the differences between our data (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the results of Nunnari et al. (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Collins and Gilmore (11Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since the research groups of these colleagues have carried out pioneering research in the field of protein translocation and the quality and accuracy of their work is beyond question, we sought a rational basis for the discrepancy in our findings. As can be seen below, we hypothesize that the major difference between our results was the choice of phospholipids used in the preparation of proteoliposomes for ribosome binding studies. Acidic phospholipids (PS and phosphatidylinositol) make up a significant fraction (approximately 15–25%) of the lipids of the rough ER (14Jothy S. Tay S. Simpkins H. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Jothy S. Bilodeau J.-L. Simpkins H. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ribosome binding activity, measured in vitro, was lost when microsomes were digested with a phospholipase C specific for acidic lipids (15Jothy S. Bilodeau J.-L. Simpkins H. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and not with lipases of differing specificity (14Jothy S. Tay S. Simpkins H. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A striking technical difference between our studies and those of Nunnari et al. (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Collins and Gilmore (11Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was the fact that their test membranes were composed exclusively of phosphatidylcholine; no acidic phospholipids were added. To examine the role of the lipid composition on ribosome binding, identical protein fractions were incorporated into liposomes having differing compositions: pure PC, a 50:50 mix of PC and PS, or a lipid fraction isolated from canine microsomes. The data presented below indicate that lipid composition is not only crucial for activity but can also explain the discrepancies that led to the original questioning of the role of p180 as a ribosome receptor. Six ml of 100A 280/ml canine pancreatic rough microsomes, prepared as described previously (9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were washed with five volumes of 0.5 m KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2 and pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor at 113,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of TMG (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10% glycerol) with 0.5% Nikkol, and pelleted through a cushion of the above solution with 0.5 m sucrose in a Beckman Type 60 Ti rotor at 113,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 12 ml of 175 mm KOAc, 1% octylglucoside (OG) in TMG and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspension was subsequently centrifuged over a cushion of 1.8 m sucrose, 175 mm KOAc, 1% OG in TMG, in a Beckman Ti-80 rotor, at 175,000 × g for 100 min at 4 °C. This pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of 0.7 m KOAc, 1% OG in TMG (HSS buffer), incubated for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged over a cushion of 1.6 m sucrose, 0.7 m KOAc, 1% OG in TMG in a Beckman Ti-80 rotor at 175,000 × g for 2 h. at 4 °C (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The supernatant was termed the “high salt supernatant (HSS)” for the reconstitution experiments. Purified p180 was isolated by diluting 2 ml of the HSS with 18 ml of TMG and placing it on a 2-ml column of equilibrated DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. After the flow-through was collected, the column was washed with 5 volumes of 0.5 mKOAc, 0.1% OG in TMG, 2 volumes of 100 mm KOAc, 0.1% OG in TMG, and then 5 volumes of 100 mm KOAc, 1% OG in TMG. p180 was eluted by a gradient of 100–400 mm KOAc, 1% OG in TMG (6 volumes) and appeared at approximately the midpoint of the gradient (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gradient gels (10–15% acrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the fractions containing p180 were pooled and diluted with 3 volumes of TMG. This pool was placed over a 1-ml column of equilibrated CM-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 3 ml/h. The column was initially washed with 5 volumes of 100 mm KOAc, 1% OG in TMG and eluted with a gradient of 100–500 mm KOAc, 1% OG in TMG (6 volumes). p180 eluted at approximately 300 mmKOAc. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on gradient gels (10–15% acrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Blue. All of the solutions used for the above purification included 110 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 200 μm EGTA. The two monoclonal anti-p180 antibodies and the one polyclonal anti-p180 antibody were previously described (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody against ribophorin I was described by Hortsch and Meyer (16Hortsch M. Meyer D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the polyclonal antibody against mammalian Sec61p was the generous gift of Tom Rapoport (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (17Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody used for the mock depletions was raised against Schizosaccharomyces pombefatty acid synthetase and does not react with any canine rough ER protein. Immunoblots were visualized by a chemiluminescent system (Renaissance System, DuPont NEN). Immunodepletions were performed by cross-linking a mixture of the two anti-p180 monoclonals or the control antibody to protein A-agarose (Schleicher and Schuell) by the method of Schneider (18Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the previously described modifications (9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The immunoaffinity matrix was equilibrated with several volumes of HSS buffer. The HSS and an equal volume of matrix were mixed by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The matrix was pelleted at 1000 × g for 3 min and washed with one-half volume of HSS buffer. After pelleting the matrix, the wash was combined with the treated HSS and termed “depleted” or “mock-depleted” HSS, depending on the matrix used. The canine microsomal lipids (mixed lipids) were prepared by extracting 1 volume of microsomes with 1.25 volumes of chloroform and 2.5 volumes of methanol by stirring for 60 min at room temperature. The insoluble material was collected by centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 3000 × g for 30 min. The insoluble material was resuspended in 5 volumes of water/chloroform/methanol (0.8:1:2) for 60 min. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation as above, and the two organic phases were combined. To this combined volume, an equal volume of chloroform/water (1:1) was added. The phases were separated by centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 3000 × g for 15 min. The organic (bottom) phase was taken and combined with an equal volume of benzene and dried down by rotary evaporation. The lipids were resuspended in 400 mm KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.75% cholic acid, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA and stored at −80° C (19Nicchitta C.V. Migliaccio G. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 587-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To form the liposomes, an equal mix of PS (from bovine brain, 98% purity determined by TLC; Sigma) and PC (from egg yolk, 99% purity determined by TLC; Sigma), PC alone, or mixed lipids were dried down and resuspended at 20 mg/ml in 100 mm KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% OG, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol. For the HSS, mock-depleted, depleted, and readdition liposomes, approximately 1 mg of detergent extract was mixed with 100 μl (2 mg) of lipid. For the readded liposomes, 25 μg of p180 was added to the lipids and detergent extract. For the pure p180 liposomes, 25 μg of p180 was mixed with 50 μl (1 mg) of lipid. The samples were then dialyzed against decreasing concentrations of detergent in 50 mm KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2: 0.75% OG for 1 h in 100 volumes; 0.25% OG for 3 h in 300 volumes; and no OG for 12 h in 1000 volumes. The samples were removed from the dialysis tubing, and EGTA was added to 2 mm. The liposomes were recovered by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti-80 rotor at 112,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in approximately 200 μl of membrane buffer (25 mm KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.4 mm EGTA) in a Dounce homogenizer. The liposomes were normalized either for protein content by SDS-PAGE on gradient gels (10–15% acrylamide) stained with silver (20Ansorge W.J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1985; 11: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (HSS, mock-depleted, depleted, and readdition) or for their ability to scatter light at 600 nm (no protein and p180). Preparation of tritium-labeled HeLa cell ribosomes and stripped rough microsomes as well as ribosome binding assays were performed (final volume, 50 μl) as described previously (9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, liposomes incubated with labeled ribosomes were mixed with heavy sucrose, overlaid with a cushion, and floated by centrifugation. Binding was assessed by quantification of radiolabel associated with the floated fraction. To initially analyze the ribosome binding activity of liposomes composed of different lipids, an extract containing rough ER-specific proteins was incorporated into liposomes. The starting material for these liposomes was HSS originating from a detergent extraction of rough microsomes. The HSS was derived from a pellet of ribosomes and their associated proteins that was obtained by centrifugation of a medium salt (500 mm KOAc)-detergent extract (see “Experimental Procedures”). To remove the ribosome-associated membrane proteins from the ribosomes, the pellet was resuspended in high salt (700 mm KOAc) and detergent, and the ribosomes were repelleted. The HSS contains most of the rough ER-specific membrane proteins including p180, ribophorins I and II, Sec61p, docking protein (SRα), SSR, and the signal peptidase complex (Fig. 1,lane 1, and data not shown). Workers in the field agree that ribosome receptors are among this collection of ribosome-associated membrane proteins and are associated with the ribosomes in low salt and dissociated in high salt (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Kalies K. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Incorporation of this extract into liposomes regardless of composition (pure PC, PS/PC, or microsomal lipids) resulted in ribosome binding characterized in Fig. 2. One difference observed was that saturation was not achieved with the pure PC liposomes, although the rate of increase in ribosomes bound versus ribosomes added did level off somewhat at higher ribosome concentrations. As a control, liposomes were formed that did not contain any proteins. These liposomes were isolated, normalized based on scattering of visible light, and assayed for ribosome binding (Fig. 3,panels A–C, open squares). Interestingly, even in the absence of protein, PC liposomes had a much higher capacity to bind ribosomes than the other liposomes in a manner that was not saturable (Fig. 3 A, open squares). This elevated background may have resulted from an interaction of the positively charged choline moiety with negatively charged ribosomes and would be consistent with the inability of the pure PC liposomes to exhibit saturation of ribosome binding activity. Regardless, one point is clear; lipid composition of liposomes is relevant when examining ribosome binding, and the results obtained with mixtures containing acidic phospholipids more closely resemble those using native microsomal lipids.Figure 3The depletion of p180 has different effects depending on the composition of the liposomes. The liposomes whose protein profiles are shown in Fig. 4 were included in ribosome binding assays. A, liposomes composed of only PC lipids;B, liposomes composed of equal amount of PS and PC lipids;C, liposomes composed of microsomal lipids. Liposomes containing the following extracts were assayed: mock-depleted HSS (filled squares); p180-depleted HSS (open circles); p180-depleted HSS with added purified p180 (filled triangles); purified p180 alone (filled diamonds), and HSS buffer alone (open squares). The data shown are typical of the results obtained in three separate experiments. Error values were within 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further examine its role in ribosome binding, p180 was depleted from ribosome-associated membrane protein fractions by affinity chromatography using two monoclonal antibodies. As a control, the HSS was treated with a monoclonal that does not react to any mammalian ER proteins. As can be seen from both the protein profiles and immunoblots, greater than 90% of p180 was removed, and there was no significant difference in the presence or amount of other proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). There was no change in the level of two specific control proteins, ribophorin I and Sec61α (Fig. 1). As an additional control, p180 was purified from the HSS by salt gradient elution of two consecutive steps of ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1, lane 4) so that it could be added back to the depleted extract before its incorporation into liposomes (“readdition control”). This fraction was previously characterized by immunoblotting (9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protein profiles of the liposomes show that with all three lipid mixtures, the mock and p180-depleted extracts were incorporated to similar extents (Fig. 4, panels A–C,lanes 3 and 4). However, the resulting activities were quite different. With the PS/PC and mixed lipid liposomes, the depletion of p180 caused a 90 and 80% reduction in ribosome binding activity, respectively, compared with mock-depleted controls (Fig. 3,B and C). The p180-depleted PC liposomes showed only a 30% reduction of activity under similar circumstances (Fig.3 A). This result may indicate the existence of an additional ribosome-binding protein. Such a protein is either able to bind ribosomes when incorporated into PC liposomes but not when incorporated into PS/PC or mixed lipid liposomes, or, alternatively, it can become incorporated only into the pure PC liposomes. The readdition of p180 to the depleted HSS restored most of the ribosome binding activity in the PS/PC and the mixed lipid liposomes (Fig. 3, B and C, triangles). The readdition of p180 to pure PC liposomes had no effect on activity (Fig.3 A, triangles). An analysis of the protein profiles showed that additional p180 was not incorporated into the PC liposomes when p180 was restored to the depleted extracts (Fig.4 A, lane 5). This finding, i.e. that p180 is incorporated into PC liposomes within the context of the HSS but cannot be incorporated when it is depleted and then readded to the HSS, was surprising and gave the first indication as to what might have led to discrepancies in published studies (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein components should be identical, since p180 was specifically removed from the HSS by the monoclonal antibodies and no other proteins were seen to elute with p180 from the antibody column (9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The only compositional difference is in the lipid component of the proteoliposomes. These data can be explained by the two following postulates. The first is that ribosome binding activity in pure PC liposomes is mediated by a high level of binding to the lipid itself and that under these circumstances, as suggested above, a protein other than p180 contributes to the binding reaction. The second is that p180, when purified away from endogenous lipids, is not able to be incorporated into liposomes in the absence of acidic phospholipids. As part of the HSS, p180 may still be associated with acidic phospholipids from the original extract. Upon affinity purification, however, the acidic phospholipid is lost and must be replaced. An inability of affinity-purified p180 to become incorporated into pure PC liposomes would provide reasonable support for this hypothesis. Equal amounts of pure p180 (Fig. 1, lane 4) were added to the detergent and lipid-containing mixtures used for liposome construction. Unlike the PS/PC and mixed lipid liposomes, p180 incorporation into pure PC liposomes was barely detectable (Fig. 4,panels A–C, lane 6). Densitometric quantification indicated that levels of p180 incorporated into pure PC liposomes were only 5–10% compared with the liposomes with other lipids. These liposomes were normalized based on their scattering of visible light, and approximately equal quantities of liposomes were recovered for analysis. These data provide the most direct support for our hypothesis that differences in p180's ability to bind ribosomes observed between research groups can be explained by differences in lipid composition of the liposomes used in the in vitroassays. Previous studies involving reconstitution of ribosome binding into liposomes have utilized lipids derived from a variety of sources and with varying compositions (5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that substantially different results are obtained depending on lipid compositions. The presence of acidic phospholipids is necessary for p180-mediated ribosome binding activity, consistent with the need for acidic phospholipids for ribosome binding to intact membranes (14Jothy S. Tay S. Simpkins H. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Jothy S. Bilodeau J.-L. Simpkins H. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our results gave identical results both for PS/PC-containing liposomes and for liposomes composed of the naturally occurring microsomal lipids, thereby substantiating the use of PS/PC as a suitable substitute for endogenous lipids. In contrast, in liposomes composed of pure phosphatidylcholine, many anomalous results were obtained. In addition to higher levels of background ribosome binding to protein-free pure PC liposomes, the loss of p180 had a significantly smaller effect on ribosome binding activity, and once depleted from a detergent extract of ER membrane proteins, readded p180 could barely become incorporated. These findings provide a reasonable explanation for many of the results obtained in other laboratories (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the published studies of Nunnari et al. (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), pure PC liposomes were used in the reconstitution of ribosome binding activity. In their work, two further items are worth noting that may have a bearing on their observations. Although the fractions of ER membrane proteins used in the construction of liposomes were analyzed, what actually was incorporated was not. Thus, as our studies point out, although p180 was undoubtedly present in the starting material, it probably did not become incorporated into the pure PC liposomes that were ultimately tested for binding activity. Additionally, immunoblot analysis of the fractions obtained following DEAE fractionation showed p180 to be degraded to a smear of immunoreactive products (Ref. 10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, Fig. 3 C), even prior to incorporation attempts. Consistent with our results on ribosome binding, the chemical cross-linking approach used by Collins and Gilmore (11Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that p180 was a major ER membrane component that was proximal enough to ribosomes to be detected by this method. Moreover, their data indicate a stoichiometry of ribosomes to p180 of 1:1. Nonetheless, these authors failed to find that fractions containing p180 bound ribosomes when incorporated into pure PC liposomes. Data were presented demonstrating the presence of p180 in the starting material used for incorporation, but a profile of what actually was incorporated into the liposomes was not shown. An explanation wholly consistent with these observations is the same as above; i.e. purified p180 does not become incorporated into pure PC liposomes. In both cases, however, ribosome binding was detected in other fractions: fractions containing smaller proteins and ones that bind to ion exchangers. Our results presented here are consistent with these results, since we also found binding activity in pure PC liposomes that was not mediated by p180. A good candidate based on size and charge (8Ohsumi T. Ichimura T. Sugano S. Omata S. Kuwano R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) would be p34, whose activity, coincidentally, was also characterized in pure PC liposomes (21Yoshida H. Tondokoro N. Asano Y. Mizusawa K. Yamagishi R. Horigome T. Sugano H. Biochem J. 1987; 245: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the results of our p180 depletion studies, p34 probably has little if any activity in PS/PC or endogenous lipid liposomes. The nature of the active factor in pure PC liposomes, unfortunately, remains within the realm of speculation, since neither Nunnari et al. nor Collins and Gilmore have gone on to publish an identification of the binding component in their detergent extracts. An alternative scenario would be one in which, together with p180, another protein is depleted that does not significantly affect ribosome binding but is needed for p180's incorporation into PC liposomes and not into the other liposomes. This is doubtful, however, since additional proteins were not detected when p180 was eluted from the antibody affinity column (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed that p180 was incorporated into pure PC liposomes when complete detergent extracts were used as a starting material but once purified by various chromatography steps, it was not. A plausible explanation would be that during purification of detergent extracts, in contrast to solubilized whole microsomes, the requisite acidic lipids are lost either from the mixture or from a specific association with p180. This interpretation is supported by the fact that both purified and readded p180, when mixed with detergents and an acidic phoshpholipid, enabled the formation of active liposomes. More recently, Kalies et al. (12Kalies K. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have proposed that the α subunit of the mammalian Sec61p is the major binding partner for ribosomes in the ER membrane. As can be seen from the data presented here (Fig. 1), immunoblotting shows that there is no reduction in the amount of the α subunit of the Sec61 complex in extracts that have totally lost their ability to bind ribosomes when incorporated into PS/PC or ER lipid-containing liposomes. Moreover, our studies and those of others show that ribosome binding is exquisitely sensitive to proteases (2Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Sec61α remains intact after digestion with significantly higher levels of protease (12Kalies K. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) than those previously shown to totally eliminate ribosome binding to either intact membranes or liposomes (2Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Savitz A.J. Meyer D.l. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi M. Sakai M.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 241-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of p180 in translocation is not addressed in this paper, and it remains an issue for a separate and thorough analysis. Previously, depletion of p180 was shown to significantly reduce translocation activity in proteoliposomes (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas recent results show that only the Sec61p and docking protein (SRα) complexes are needed for the translocation of certain preproteins (17Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). An acceptable hypothesis, consistent with both sets of data would be that p180 may not be absolutely essential for the translocation of preproteins in a highly reconstituted system (22Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) but may have a stimulatory or regulatory role in liposomes made from more complex mixtures of ER-derived proteins and in intact membranes (10Nunnari J.M. Zimmerman D.L. Ogg S.C. Walter P. Nature. 1991; 352: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Preliminary support for such a hypothesis comes from Northern analysis of p180 showing that its highest expression occurs in tissues with significant levels of secretory activity, e.g. pancreas, liver, and placenta. 2F. Becker and D. I. Meyer, unpublished results. These tissues also have an abundant and extensive rough ER network throughout the cytoplasm. Since it has been known for a number of years that not all bound ribosomes are engaged in protein synthesis (25Rosbash M. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 27Kruppa J. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), our current working hypothesis is that p180 maintains the high level of bound ribosomes found on the ER membranes of actively secreting cells and tissues and thus may perform an accessory or ancillary role in the translocation process. Regardless, we agree with the recent statement from the Rapoport lab with respect to the binding of ribosomes to the ER membrane: “Our findings suggest that the targeting process is more complex than previously anticipated” (28Neuhof A. Rolls M. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Program and Abstracts of the 1st Cell Biology Symposium of the MDC on Protein Transport and Stability, Berlin, September 26–29, 1996.

https://openalex.org/W2052592676,"Protein proteinase inhibitors of the serpin family were recently reported to form SDS-stable complexes with inactive serine proteinases modified at the catalytic serine with 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) that resembled the complexes formed with the active enzymes (Christensen, S., Valnickova, Z., Thøgersen, I. B., Pizzo, S. V., Nielsen, H. R., Roepstorff, P., and Enghild, J. J. (1995) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>270, 14859–14862). The discordance between these findings and other reports that similar active site modifications of serine proteinases block the ability of serpins to form SDS-stable complexes prompted us to investigate the mechanism of complex formation between serpins and DCI-inactivated enzymes. Both neutrophil elastase and β-trypsin inactivated by DCI appeared to form SDS-stable complexes with the serpin, α<sub>1</sub>-proteinase inhibitor (α<sub>1</sub>PI), as reported previously. However, several observations suggested that such complex formation resulted from a reaction not with the DCI enzyme but rather with active enzyme regenerated from the DCI enzyme by a rate-limiting hydrolysis reaction. Thus (i) complex formation was blocked by active site-directed peptide chloromethyl ketone inhibitors; (ii) the kinetics of complex formation indicated that the reaction was not second order but rather showed a first-order dependence on DCI enzyme concentration and zero-order dependence on inhibitor concentration; and (iii) complex formation was accompanied by stoichiometric release of a peptide having the sequence SIPPE corresponding to cleavage at the α<sub>1</sub>PI reactive center P1-P1′ bond. Quantitation of kinetic constants for DCI and α<sub>1</sub>PI inactivation of human neutrophil elastase and trypsin and for reactivation of the DCI enzymes showed that the observed complex formation could be fully accounted for by α<sub>1</sub>PI preferentially reacting with active enzyme regenerated from DCI enzyme during the reaction. These results support previous findings of the critical importance of the proteinase catalytic serine in the formation of SDS-stable serpin-proteinase complexes and are in accord with an inhibitory mechanism in which the proteinase is trapped at the acyl intermediate stage of proteolysis of the serpin as a substrate."
