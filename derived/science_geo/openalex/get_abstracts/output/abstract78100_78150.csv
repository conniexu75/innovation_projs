https://openalex.org/W2002566360,"THE growth of colonies from mouse bone marrow cells in solid agar medium in vitro has been described recently1. The colony growth required stimulation by feeder layer cells, the most effective of which were neonatal mouse kidney cells. Although the colonies appear to arise by the proliferation of single cells, the colony cell population is a mixture of myeloid cells and mononuclear cells and the identity of the cells responsible for the initiation of colony formation has not been established. In order to gain more information on the in vitro colony forming cells the following studies have been made comparing the numbers of colony forming cells in normal, polycythaemic and anaemic mouse bone marrows."

https://openalex.org/W1992545823,"AN electrophoretically fast genetic variant of adult haemoglobin was described in six members of a Negro family living in Texas by Thompson et al. in 1963 (ref. 1). Fingerprints of the purified haemoglobin established the identity of this variant with haemoglobin I previously described by Murayama and Ingram2, in which the third tryptic peptide from the N-terminus of the α chain contained an amino-acid alteration responsible for the rapid electrophoretic migration of the intact haemoglobin. Lysine, which is the sixteenth residue, had been replaced in haemoglobin I by an acidic amino-acid. The substitution was described in both I variants from Texas1 and Philadelphia3 as being lysine to aspartic acid; however, recent elucidation of the genetic code has eliminated the substitution lys→asp from the class of mutations which could result from alteration of a single nucleotide base in the triplet code4. A nucleotide triplet coding for lysine (AAA or AAG) could not be altered in a single base so that it would specify aspartic acid (GAU or GAC). This led Beale and Lehmann5 to re-examine the I variant from Philadelphia. Their findings established the substitution to be lys→glu, which is in agreement with an alteration in a single nucleotide (AAA or AAG to GAA or GAG)."

https://openalex.org/W1977225512,"THE use of Raney metal catalysts for the reductive methylation of amines with formaldehyde and hydrogen is well known1. We wish to report that this reaction is also catalysed by vitamin B12r in vitro, and thus is potentially of biochemical importance. For example, a 1 : 1 mixture of aniline and formaldehyde in methanol and water absorbs hydrogen at room temperature and 1 atm. of pressure if a solution of vitamin B12r is added. N-methylaniline is formed in significant yield (1). Bis-dimethylglyoximato cobalt (II) complexes such as Co(D2H2)·2H2O (‘Diaquocobaloxime (II)’)2 (D = dianion of dimethylglyoxime) which may be regarded as simple models of vitamin B12r were similarly found to be cataly-tically active. Aniline could also be substituted by N-methylaniline which was converted to N,N-dimethylaniline under analogous conditions. In order to isolate or detect intermediates of this reaction, the reductive alkylation of aniline was also carried out using stoichio-metric amounts of the react ants. When 0.4 moles of aniline and 0.25 moles of formaldehyde (in 40 per cent aqueous solution) were added to a suspension of 0.20 moles of Co(D2H2)·2H2O in 1 l. of methanol under 1 atm. of hydrogen, 0.1 mole of hydrogen was rapidly absorbed on stirring and the cobaloxime dissolved completely. On addition of 1 l. of water a crystalline complex precipitated in a yield of 94 per cent, which was dissolved in methanol and reprecipitated by adding water. After drying at 0.1 mm of mercury 25° C it analysed for C21H29N604CoH2O, corresponding to"

https://openalex.org/W2001355171,"DAWID1,2 has identified cytoplasmic DNA in amphibian eggs as mitochondrial DNA. This, however, does not comprise all the cytoplasmic DNA one can find in amphibian eggs. There is an important acid-soluble fraction with unknown biological function and cytological origin3,4. Leaving aside the biosynthesis of mitochondrial DNA, one wonders whether amphibian egg cytoplasmic DNA is synthesized de novo. In insect eggs, the DNA found in the ooplasm comes partly from the nurse cells which are disintegrated and incorporated into the ooplasm during oogenesis5–7. A similar phenomenon has not been observed in amphibian eggs, where the follicle cells only form a thin layer of flat cells around the oocyte. On the other hand, the amphibian oocytes are equipped with microvilli connecting the egg cortex with the surrounding follicle cells8,9. This suggests that the ingestion of foreign macromolecules occurs by pinocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1993200554,"Bate-Smith and Bendall1 reported that rigor mortis in muscle was caused by the irreversible association of actin and myosin as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) became depleted. Conflicting reports have appeared concerning the process of rigor mortis in germ-free animals. Harmon2 has observed that germ-free rats do not become rigid after death. These observations were only visual, but classical theories of the process would require critical re-evaluation if muscle from germ-free animals showed no rigor mortis. We have designed an experiment to investigate the time course of rigor mortis development and associated parameters in normal and germ-free rats (Table 1)."
