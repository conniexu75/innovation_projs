https://openalex.org/W2013954173,"Two species of forest birds, the least flycatcher and the red-eyed vireo, when breeding in the same season in the same habitat, adjust their temporal pattern of singing to avoid the overlapping of songs. The avoidance of acoustic interference is more marked in the flycatcher, which has a briefer song than the vireo."
https://openalex.org/W2066160757,"Routine mapping of snow and ice fields in the northern hemisphere was started by NOAA in 1967. Large year-to-year variations of the snow and pack-ice covers were observed. The annual mean coverage increased by 12 percent during 1971 and has remained high. The index R, which shows the approximate amount of energy reflected from the surface by snow and ice under the mean cloudiness, increased correspondingly. Thus, if the cloud cover over the snow fields did not increase substantially, the anomalous weather patterns of 1972 and 1973 could have been connected with the deficit in surface heat exchange which originated in the northern hemisphere the year before. During the past 7 years the largest changes occurred in the fall and in the continental interiors of Asia and America (8). Two synoptic parameters which could readily provide information on the development of snow and ice cover in the northern hemisphere are (i) the total area momentarily covered and (ii) the running annual mean of snow and ice coverage for the preceding 1-year period. By 20 September 1973 the annual mean coverage was 37.3 x 10(6) km(2), 11 to 12 percent higher than at the same time during 1968 through 1970. Snow cover-fall, the season when 15 x 10(6) to 55 x 10(6) km(2) of the northern hemisphere is covered with snow and ice, started on 20 September 1973, compared to 17 September 1972 and 5 or 10 October during 1967 through 1970. The links between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land surfaces must be better understood before the role of snow and ice can be thoroughly explained and exploited for long-range weather forecasting. But it is clear that snow, hitherto almost overlooked in synoptic meteorological reports, must be important in the mechanism of weather changes."
https://openalex.org/W1987230654,S-(+)-4-Methyl-3-heptanone is the principal alarm pheromone of Atta texana. The dextrorotatory form of the ketone has also been identified from Atta cephalotes. Both enantiomers have been synthesized in high optical purity; Atta texana is more responsive to the (+) enantiomer than to the (-) form. These results implicate a chiral receptor system.

https://openalex.org/W2016113047,There appears to be evidence for a cyclic behavior of the Martian climate in which the surface pressure periodically reaches values compatible with the flow of water in equatorial regions on the planet. A relatively simple test of such hypotheses is pointed out. The premise on which cyclic models are based is that a substantial reservoir of volatils exist in frozen form at one or both poles. The proposed test involves a determination of the relative abundances of neon and argon isotopes. The required measurements may be made after the soft landing next February of Soviet spacecraft presently en route to the planet.

https://openalex.org/W1981831397,"Ocean images were obtained at three widely separated locations on the earth as part of NASA's ocean color experiment. Digital computer enhancement and band-ratioing techniques were applied to radiometrically corrected spectral data to emphasize patterns of chlorophyll distribution and, in one case, of bottom topography. The chlorophyll pattern in the Yellow Sea between China and Korea was evident in a scene produced from shuttle orbit 24. The effects of the discharge from the Yangtze and other rivers were also observed. Two scenes from orbits 30 and 32 revealed the movement of patches of plankton in the Gulf of CÃ¡diz. Geometric corrections of these images permitted ocean current velocities in the vicinity to be deduced. The variability in water depth over the Grand Bahama Bank was estimated by using the blue-green channel of the instrument. The very clear water conditions in the area caused bottom-reflected sunlight to produce a sensor signal that was inversely related to the depth of the water."

The radiance ratio classification algorithm successfully made automatic data-selection decisions. The classification image obtained on the mission is providing information needed to evaluate the FILE algorithm and system performance."

(2) Tissue culture research in the field of cancer is especially welcome, but the projects offered need not be limited to this area."
