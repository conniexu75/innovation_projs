https://openalex.org/W2049020751,"Synchronized interleukin-2 receptor-positive T cells, homogeneous immunoaffinity-purified interleukin-2, and a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-2 receptors were used to show that only three factors are critical for T-cell cycle progression: interleukin-2 concentration, interleukin-2 receptor density, and the duration of the interleukin-2 receptor interaction. Since the proliferative characteristics of T cells are identical to those of both prokaryotic and all other eukaryotic cells, these findings provide a new model that accounts fully for the variables that determine cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1481130297,"Tau is a family of closely related proteins known for its ability to copolymerize with tubulin, inducing the formation of microtubules. When tau was stripped of phosphate by treatment with alkaline phosphatase it underwent a pronounced change in electrophoretic mobility, probably reflecting a conformational change. The dephosphorylated tau promoted significantly more rapid and more extensive polymerization of microtubules though there was no obvious difference in the microtubules formed. Partially purified microtubule protein contains a kinase that can rephosphorylate tau."
https://openalex.org/W1966237185,"The hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], at picomolar concentrations, inhibited the growth-promoting lymphokine interleukin-2, which is produced by human T lymphocytes activated in vitro by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin. Other metabolites of vitamin D3 were less effective than 1,25(OH)2D3 in suppressing interleukin-2; their order of potency corresponded to their respective affinity for the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor, suggesting that the effect on interleukin-2 was mediated by this specific receptor. The proliferation of mitogen-activated lymphocytes was also inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3. This effect of the hormone became more pronounced at later stages of the culture. These findings demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 is an immunoregulatory hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2161752363,"1-Alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of biologically inactive lysophospholipid to bioactive platelet-activating factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PAF) by an acetylation reaction. The activity of this enzyme in eosinophils isolated from patients with eosinophilia is stimulated (up to 4-fold) in a dose-, time-, and Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent manner after exposure to the eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A), C5a, formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP), or ionophore A23187. The three naturally occurring chemotactic factors (ECF-A, C5a, and fMLP) cause a rapid and transient increase of enzyme activity, with a maximum at 1 or 3 min, whereas ionophore A23187 maintains an elevated level for up to 15 min. The activity of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetylhydrolase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of PAF to lyso-PAF, is not affected by C5a, fMLP, or ionophore A23187. The presence of PAF in eosinophils was established by demonstrating the lipid nature of the compound, the RF value being identical with that of synthetic 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine on thin layer chromatograms, and by its ability to induce serotonin release from rabbit platelets. Furthermore, ECF-A, C5a, fMLP, and ionophore A23187 all induce the secretion of PAF from eosinophils. These findings suggest that the generation and release of PAF could be a consequence of eosinophil chemotactic activation and may thus function in inflammatory and allergic reactions in which eosinophils participate."
https://openalex.org/W1562951114,"Vanadate activated rat adipocyte glycogen synthase similarly to insulin in a dose- and time-dependent manner. No additional effect was observed when insulin and vanadate were added together. Vanadate also partially counteracted the effect of epinephrine to activate rat adipocyte glycogen phosphorylase similarly to insulin. Inhibition of Na+K+ATPase or stimulation of hydrogen peroxide generation were shown not to be the mechanisms of the insulin-like action of vanadate on glycogen synthase. Vanadate stimulated the phosphorylation of the 95,000-dalton subunit of the insulin receptor on tyrosine residues both in intact adipocytes and in a solubilized insulin receptor fraction. Vanadate also stimulated the phosphorylation of the 95,000-dalton subunit of a highly purified insulin receptor from human placenta. Neither the insulin receptor fraction from rat adipocyte nor the highly purified insulin receptor from human placenta contained any detectable phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. Potassium fluoride had no stimulatory effect on the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Vanadate caused a 10-fold decrease in the Km for ATP, for tyrosine kinase, and enhanced the phosphorylation of histone H2B. These results demonstrate that vanadate enhances the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor by stimulating the kinase reaction in a similar but not identical manner to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2090741624,"The gene encoding human interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been cloned from human spleen cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the Jurkat cell line. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene revealed that the encoded IL-2 protein has three cysteines located at amino acid residues 58, 105, and 125 of the mature protein. Site-specific mutagenesis procedures were used to modify the IL-2 gene by changing each of the cysteine codons individually to serine codons. Substitution of serine for cysteine residues at either position 58 or 105 of the IL-2 protein substantially reduced biological activity, indicating that the cysteines at these positions are necessary for maintenance of the biologically active conformation and may therefore be linked by a disulfide bridge. The modified IL-2 protein containing a substitution at position 125 retained full biological activity, suggesting that the cysteine at this position is not involved in a disulfide bond and that a free sulfhydryl group at that position is not necessary for receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W1505004647,"Fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes were induced with desacetylthymosin -alpha 1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The induced gamma interferon (or IFN-gamma, immune interferon, type II interferon) was purified to homogeneity utilizing controlled-pore glass, concanavalin A-Sepharose, Bio-Gel P100, or Sephacryl S-200, and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. This procedure resulted in two active species with apparent Mr = 20,000 and 25,000 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both species were found to have identical amino acid sequences with a pyroglutamate residue as NH2-terminus. In both cases six different COOH termini were found. They are, at least qualitatively, identical in both species. There are two possible Asn-X-Ser/Thr glycosylation sites. Both carry carbohydrates in the Mr = 25,000 species whereas in the Mr = 20,000 species only one site is glycosylated. This likely explains the difference in apparent molecular weight between the two species and the expected molecular weight based upon the amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1601561251,"Activation of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes can be triggered by chemoattractants, the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate or the calcium ionophore A23187. We have shown previously that these stimuli have markedly different temporal patterns of oxidase activation (McPhail, L. C., and Snyderman, R. (1983) J. Clin. Invest. 72, 192-200), suggesting that each follows, at least in part, a unique transductional pathway. We now report that if leukocytes were sequentially exposed to any of several combinations of heterologous stimuli, the pattern of activation by the second stimulus was strikingly altered, resulting in a more rapid rate and enhanced level of oxidase activation by the second stimulus. This suggests that exposure of cells to the first stimulus (priming) had influenced an intermediate also used by the second stimulus. The signal for priming could be clearly distinguished from the signal causing oxidase activation by the dose-response curves for each, as well as by the use of several pharmacologic agents. In addition, if leukocytes were given sequential doses of homologous stimuli, either partial (phorbol myristate acetate) or full (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl -phenylalanine and A23187) desensitization of oxidase activation was observed. These results demonstrate that these stimuli share a common intermediate in the pathway of oxidase activation. Moreover, the data indicate that NADPH oxidase activation is regulated by at least three distinct signals: signal 1 (priming), signal 2 (activation), and signal 3 (inactivation). It is likely that more than one intracellular messenger exerts a modulating influence on NADPH oxidase activity and that its regulation involves the interplay between several cellular control proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1592291676,"Using the acetoxymethyl ester of 2, a fluorescent Ca2+-indicator, we have loaded prolactin (PRL)-producing rat pituitary cells with non-toxic concentrations of Quin 2 and quantitated changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ( [Ca2+]i) during stimulation of PRL release by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and 40 mM K+. TRH induced a biphasic response, with an immediate (less than 1 s) in [Ca2+]i from basal levels (350 +/- 80 nM) to a peak of 1-3 microM, which decayed rapidly (t 1/2 = 8 s) to a near basal nadir, then rising to a in [Ca2+]i of 500-800 nM. The TRH-induced phase was attenuated but not abolished by prior addition of EGTA, while the phase was eliminated by EGTA. Addition of 40 mM K+ caused an immediate in [Ca2+]i to 1-3 microM which equilibrated slowly (t 1/2 = 1 min) directly to a of 600-800 nM. The K+-induced and phases were both abolished by prior addition of EGTA. The biphasic nature of TRH action on [Ca2+]i parallels the biphasic actions of TRH on 45Ca2+ fluxes and the biphasic release of PRL by GH cells in suspension. These findings provide evidence that Ca2+-dependent agonist-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i and hormone release are linked, and may generally have two modes: an acute spike mode, dependent primarily on redistribution of intracellular Ca2+ stores; and a sustained plateau mode, dependent on influx of extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1604621894,"By using a variety of biochemical techniques, chromatin and chromatin fragments have been identified as probable physiological ligands for C-reactive protein. Studies using 14C-labeled C-reactive protein show that binding to chromatin is saturable with a Kd = 8 X 10(-7) M, a value indicating that the affinity of C-reactive protein for chromatin is at least four times its affinity for phosphorylcholine. At saturation, there is approximately one C-reactive protein-binding site for every 160 base pairs of DNA in chromatin. The interaction of C-reactive protein with chicken erythrocyte nucleosome core particle has been studied. Fifty per cent inhibition of the binding of C-reactive protein to phosphorylcholine is obtained at a core particle concentration of 1.25 X 10(-9) M, indicating that the affinity of C-reactive protein for one of the sites on core particles is at least 2400 times greater than the affinity of C-reactive protein for phosphorylcholine. The possibility that C-reactive protein may act as a scavenger for chromatin fragments released from damaged cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1602629787,"Abstract We report the DNA and primary amino acid sequences of the Streptomyces plicatus enzyme endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Peptide sequence information was derived from enzyme isolated from Streptomyces culture medium using a combination of mass spectrometric methods and conventional techniques, including Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase Y digestion. The DNA sequence was determined by analysis of the Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H gene cloned into the Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322 (Robbins, P. W., Wirth , D. F., and Hering , C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10640-10644). The enzyme from Streptomyces medium is 271 (or 269) amino acids in length and has a ragged NH2-terminal sequence beginning primarily with Ala-Pro-Val or Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro-Val. DNA resection experiments as well as the DNA sequence itself suggest that a proenzyme or, more probably,  prepro  enzyme may be the primary product of translation. The long 42 (or 44) residue leader sequence of the preproenzyme shows striking similarities to leader sequences found on proteins secreted by Bacillus species. The leader sequence is partially removed by E. coli and, as reported previously, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H made in E. coli appears in both the periplasmic space and in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1527872783,"A retinol-binding glycoprotein ( IRBP ) was purified in milligram quantities from the extracellular matrix ( interphotoreceptor matrix) that occupies the subretinal space in bovine eyes. IRBP binds 2.2 molecules of all-trans retinol with a KD of approximately 10(-6) M. The holoprotein has lambda max at 280 nm (E1%1 cm = 10.99) and at 330 nm (E1%1 cm = 7.88). When freshly isolated from light-exposed eyes, IRBP contains up to 0.6 molecule of all-trans retinol, together with small amounts of the 11-cis and 13-cis isomers. IRBP also binds exogenous cholesterol, alpha-tocopherol, and all-trans retinoic acid, all of which are completely displaced by all trans retinol. The affinity of alpha-tocopherol for IRBP was at least several orders of magnitude less than that of all-trans retinol. IRBP contains 8.4% by weight of carbohydrate, which consists of sialic acid, neutral hexoses, and glucosamine in the molar ratio of approximately 1:3:2. No galactosamine was detected. Observations on the binding of 125I-labeled lectins to IRBP in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels before and after desialosylation suggest that at least one oligosaccharide chain is of the sialated biantennary complex type and contains fucose. The Mr of IRBP on calibrated size-exclusion columns averaged 249,000; on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (with or without dithiothreitol) the apparent Mr was 144,000. IRBP exists in at least four isoelectric forms that bind concanavalin A and have pI values ranging from 4.4 to 4.8. Rabbit anti-bovine IRBP antiserum gave a single precipitin line against purified bovine IRBP , which showed a line of complete identity with crude bovine interphotoreceptor matrix and a line of partial identity with human interphotoreceptor matrix. The human material contains a prominent protein with lectin-binding properties similar to bovine IRBP but with a somewhat faster electrophoretic mobility. When isolated bovine neural retinas were incubated with 3H-labeled fucose, glucosamine, or leucine, a solitary labeled protein identified as IRBP was secreted into the medium. Labeled IRBP could not be detected in the medium when retinal pigment epithelium was incubated with these precursors under the same conditions. Neural retinas incubated with 3H-labeled leucine in the presence of tunicamycin secreted a form of IRBP that did not bind concanavalin A and had an Mr reduced by approximately 5,000."
https://openalex.org/W1502706318,"Stilbene synthase ( resveratrol -forming) converts one molecule of rho- coumaroyl -CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA into 3,4',5- trihydroxystilbene . Following selective induction of stilbene synthesis in cell suspension cultures of peanut (Arachis hypogaea), the enzyme was extracted and purified to apparent homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The enzyme was found to be a dimer of estimated Mr = 90,000 exhibiting under denaturing conditions a subunit Mr of approximately 45,000. The isoelectric point was determined with pI = 4.8. The enzyme's high selectivity towards rho- coumaroyl -CoA (Km = 2 microM) as substrate qualified it as resveratrol -forming stilbene synthase. Structurally related CoA esters, e.g. dihydro-rho- coumaroyl -CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA, were converted less than 1/10 as efficiently as rho- coumaroyl -CoA. Malonyl-CoA (Km = 10 microM) could not be substituted by acetyl-CoA. The purified enzyme was free of chalcone synthase activity. Antibodies raised against stilbene synthase were shown to be monospecific and not to cross-react with chalcone synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1584591558,"The stoichiometry of heme interaction with prostaglandin H synthase was determined by titration of the apoenzyme purified from sheep seminal vesicles. Maximal cyclooxygenase activity was reached when 0.53 +/- 0.11 (n = 6) heme/70,000-Da subunit had been added. Spectrophotometric titrations at 411 nm showed a transition when 0.53 +/- 0.04 (n = 5) heme/subunit had been added. The results from the titration end points were corroborated by comparison of the specific cyclooxygenase activity based on subunit concentration with the specific activity/mol of heme (calculated from the incremental increases in activity during the titration). The value based on subunit was approximately half (0.58 +/- 0.11; n = 6) that based on heme, consistent with one heme/two subunits. Analysis of synthase holoenzyme after chromatography on DEAE-cellulose provided validation for the concept that only one subunit needs to bind heme to give a catalytically active synthase dimer. Binding of some heme to the second subunit appears to be only coincidentally associated with complete saturation of the active subunit. Titrations of the synthase with Mn-protoporphyrin IX gave results which confirmed the presence of two high affinity metalloporphyrin sites/dimer. Unlike heme, two Mn-protoporphyrin IX need be bound per dimer to obtain full catalytic activity. Prostaglandin H synthase appears to have two high affinity binding sites for metalloporphyrins. The two sites have slightly different affinities for heme. The synthase dimer is capable of cyclooxygenase catalysis when the site with higher affinity is occupied by heme. The two subunits of the enzyme are thus not completely identical."
https://openalex.org/W1518656226,"Micellar, discoidal complexes of human apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I, C-II, C-III-1, and C-III-2 with egg phosphatidylcholine (egg-PC) and cholesterol were prepared by the cholate dialysis method. The complexes, isolated by gel filtration, had similar lipid and protein contents by weight, on the average: 1.77:0.083:1.0, egg-PC/cholesterol/apolipoprotein (w/w). The diameters of the discs, visualized by electron microscopy and estimated by gel filtration, ranged from 100 to 200 A. The alpha-helix content of the apolipoproteins in the complexes was from 50-72%, and their fluorescence properties indicated nonpolar, but quite varied environments for the tryptophan residues in the various complexes. Initial reactions of purified human lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase with the complexes, adjusted to equal egg-PC concentrations, indicated that all the apolipoproteins activate the enzyme from 6-fold to 400-fold over control vesicles of egg-PC and cholesterol. In decreasing order of reactivity were the complexes with A-I, C-I, C-III-1, C-III-2, C-II, and A-II. These results indicate that aside from lipid-binding capacity and high amphipathic alpha-helix content, other structural features are required for optimal enzyme activation by apolipoproteins. Concentration and temperature dependence experiments gave similar apparent Km values, markedly different apparent Vmax, and very similar activation energies (about 19 kcal/mol), for the various complexes. These observations suggest that the rate-limiting enzymatic step of the reaction is common to all the complexes but that the activated enzyme levels differ from complex to complex. We propose that enzyme activation occurs upon binding to complexes via apolipoproteins. Addition of excess (5-fold) free apolipoprotein A-I or A-II to complexes resulted in the exchange of bound for free apolipoproteins and in loss of reactivity with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1510933826,"Folate-binding protein (FBP) from rat kidney was isolated, and its properties and location in the kidney were determined. The particulate fraction of rat kidney homogenate was freed of its bound folate, solubilized with Triton X-100, and the FBP was purified using a combination of DEAE-cellulose and affinity chromatography. The purified protein migrated as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel electrophoresis, has an isoelectric point of 5.7, contains 21.7% carbohydrate, and has an Mr of 28,500-30,000. The purified protein retained its affinities for different folate derivatives and its sensitivity to inorganic anions. Inorganic anions enhanced the binding of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; chloride ion was the most effective, followed by Br- greater than I- greater than SO2-4. Chloride ion was also found to lower the dissociation constant of the folic acid-FBP complex at 50 degrees C by about 10-fold. This effect is thought to derive from the formation of a ternary FBP-folic acid-Cl- complex which is more stable than the binary FBP-folic acid complex. An antiserum raised against the purified protein in rabbits was used to determine the location of FBP in the kidney by immunofluorescence. Intense fluorescence staining for FBP was localized at the apices (brush border) of proximal tubules. The choroid plexus, an organ previously shown to contain FBP, also exhibited intense fluorescent staining."
https://openalex.org/W1556278592,"A glycoprotein that stimulates the proliferation of multiple hemopoietic stem and progenitor cell types was purified to apparent homogeneity. The factor, termed P cell-stimulating factor (PSF), was assayed by its ability to support the growth of murine factor-dependent hemopoietic cell lines operationally termed persisting cells (P cells). PSF was purified 50,000-fold from serum-free medium conditioned by the myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3B by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, phenyl boronate chromatography, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, neuraminidase treatment, Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 silica column, and two steps of high performance gel permeation chromatography on a TSK 3000 SW column operated under first neutral and then acidic solvent conditions. Although purified PSF could not be detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels stained with silver, following electrophoresis of purified PSF labeled with iodine-125, autoradiography showed only a single broad band of Mr = 30,000. This labeled band corresponded to the profile of PSF activity eluted from polyacrylamide gel slices. After reduction, labeled PSF had a slightly higher Mr of 32,000, although reduction resulted in loss of 98% of PSF activity, thus suggesting that the integrity of internal disulfide bond(s) was required for activity. When purified PSF was chromatographed on a TSK 3000 SW column under denaturing conditions in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, the single peak of absorbance at 280 nm coincided with a sharp peak of biological activity. The following unique NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified PSF was obtained: NH2ALA -SER-Ile-Ser-X-X-Asp-Thr-His-Arg-Leu-Thr-Arg-. The concentration of PSF required for half-maximal stimulation of P cell growth was estimated as 1.3 X 10(-13) M or 4 pg/ml. The availability of purified PSF will allow rigorous examination of the hypothesis that a single molecule acts on multiple hemopoietic cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1479925054,"We have examined the calcium-binding properties and metal ion-dependent conformational changes of proteolytically modified derivatives of factor IX that lack gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues. Equilibrium dialysis experiments demonstrated that a Gla-domainless factor IX species retained a single high affinity calcium ion-binding site (Kd = 85 +/- 5 microM). Ca2+ binding to this site was accompanied by a decrease in intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity (Kd = 63 +/- 15 microM). These spectral changes were reversed upon the addition of EDTA. Titration with Sr2+ resulted in little change in fluorescence intensity below 1 mM, while titration with Tb3+ caused fluorescence changes similar to those observed with Ca2+. Tb3+ and Ca2+ appear to bind to the same site because tryptophan-dependent terbium emission was reduced by the addition of Ca2+. Similar results were obtained with a Gla-domainless factor IX species lacking the activation peptide. Gla domain-containing factor IX species exhibited fluorescence changes similar to those of the Gla-domainless proteins at low Ca2+, but an additional structural transition was found at higher Ca2+ concentrations (apparent Kd greater than 0.8 mM). Thus, the conformations of factor IX proteins are nucleated and/or stabilized by calcium binding to a high affinity site which does not contain Gla residues. The binding of Ca2+ to lower affinity Gla domain-dependent metal ion-binding sites elicits an additional conformational change. The strong similarities between these results and those obtained with protein C (Johnson, A. E., Esmon, N. L., Laue, T. M. & Esmon, C. T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5554-5560), coupled with the remarkable sequence homologies of the vitamin K-dependent proteins, suggest that the high affinity Gla-independent Ca2+-binding site may be a common feature of vitamin K-dependent proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1543749024,"The specifically mutated enzyme thiol beta-lactamase has been expressed in Escherichia coli by means of the trp promoter and purified to homogeneity. The gene for this enzyme results from a single base change N410 A----T in the gene of pBR322 RTEM beta-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6, penicillinase, penicillin amido-beta-lactamhydrolase) which alters the codon for the active site Ser 70 to that for Cys. Precursor thiol beta-lactamase is processed to give the same NH2-terminal sequence as that for wild type enzyme. In contrast to the wild type enzyme, thiol beta-lactamase contains one free titratable thiol group/molecule. Thiol beta-lactamase catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-lactams with a substrate specificity that is distinct from that of wild type enzyme. For benzyl-penicillin and ampicillin, the Km values are similar to wild type values although the kcat values are 1-2% that of wild type enzyme. For the cephalosporin nitrocefin, the Km is greater than 10-fold that of the wild type and the kcat is at least as large as the kcat for the wild type enzyme. Thiol beta-lactamase is different from wild type beta-lactamase in that it is not competitively inhibited by boric acid although a small degree of noncompetitive inhibition does occur. Whereas the circular dichroism spectra of both enzymes are nearly identical, thiol beta-lactamase at 40 degrees C is 3-fold more resistant to trypsin than is the wild type enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1580636752,"Incubation of HTC rat hepatoma cells with dexamethasone causes a rapid decrease in cellular plasminogen activator (PA) activity. Mixing experiments show the presence of an inhibitor of PA in dexamethasone-treated cells. This study investigates whether the decrease in PA activity is secondary to the induction of an inhibitor by glucocorticoids, to a decrease in the amount of PA, or to a combination of both mechanisms. PA and its inhibitor are dissociated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions, and both activities are then recovered and quantitated. HTC cells have two major forms of PA with Mr values of 110,000 and 64,000. Although PA activity in the unfractionated extracts from dexamethasone-treated cells is inhibited by 90% relative to control, there is no decrease in the total activity of sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated PA activity, suggesting that dexamethasone causes no decrease in the amount of the enzyme. PA inhibitor activity migrates as a single band of Mr = 50,000. The total activity of inhibitor increases in a time-dependent fashion, reaching a maximum of greater than 10 times control after a 4-6-h incubation with 0.1 microM dexamethasone. The induction of inhibitor requires both RNA and protein synthesis and shows a dependence on dexamethasone concentration identical to that for responses known to be mediated by glucocorticoid receptors. We conclude that dexamethasone inhibits PA activity by inducing the synthesis of an inhibitor rather than by decreasing the amount of PA."

https://openalex.org/W1556559565,"Human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) metabolized [14C]arachidonic acid predominantly by lipoxygenase pathways. The major products were 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and 15-HETE. These and other lipoxygenase products, including their derived leukotrienes, have been implicated as mediators of inflammatory and allergic reactions. In human platelets, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen inhibited production of the cyclooxygenase product thromboxane B2 (I50 = 65 microM), whereas the lipoxygenase product 12-HETE was not appreciably affected even at 5 mM ibuprofen. The 5-lipoxygenase of human PMNs (measured by 5-HETE formation) was inhibited by ibuprofen but was about six times less sensitive (I50 = 420 microM) than the platelet cyclooxygenase. The unexpected observation was made that the human PMN 15-lipoxygenase/leukotriene pathway was selectively activated by 1-5 mM ibuprofen. Metabolites were identified by ultraviolet spectroscopy, by radioimmunoassay, or by retention times on high pressure liquid chromatography in comparison with authentic standards. The major product was 15-HETE; and in all of 19 donors tested, 15-HETE formation was stimulated up to 20-fold by 5 mM ibuprofen. Other identified products included 12-HETE and 15- and 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Activation of the 15-lipoxygenase by ibuprofen occurred within 1 min and was readily reversible. The effects of aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen on the PMN 15-lipoxygenase were compared in six donors. Ibuprofen produced an average 9-fold stimulation of the enzyme, whereas aspirin and indomethacin resulted in an average 1.5- and 2-fold enhancement, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1499963833,"A mass spectrometric method was applied to protein S, a development-specific protein of Myxococcus xanthus, in order to verify the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its gene.

The mass values of the observed signals were correlated to the theoretical mass values calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence, thereby identifying the peptides and proving the accuracy of the sequence. The previous finding that protein S is the product of the second gene of the two tandemly repeated genes on the M. xanthus chromosome ( Inouye , S., Franceschini , T., and Inouye , M. (1983) Proc.

The properties of the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity associated with a particulate fraction and the detergent extracts have been characterized by assaying the enzymatic conversion of exogenous [14C]phosphatidylserine to [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine. The yeast decarboxylase does not require a divalent cation and is inhibited by hydroxylamine and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The rate of decarboxylation of exogenous phosphatidylserine catalyzed by membranes prepared from cells grown in the presence of choline is reduced by approximately 60% compared to membranes from cells grown in a choline-deficient medium. Relatively smaller reductions in phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity are also seen in cells grown in the presence of mono- or dimethylethanolamine. In vitro incorporation studies with [14C]serine demonstrate that endogenous, prelabeled phosphatidylserine can be utilized for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the coupled action of the hydroxylamine-sensitive decarboxylase and the phospholipid N-methyltransferases in the presence of 2 mM S-adenosylmethionine. A similar comparative enzymatic study shows that the rates of synthesis and decarboxylation of [14C]phosphatidylserine, as well as phospholipid N-methylation, are lower for membranes prepared from cells grown in the presence of choline relative to identical preparations from cells grown in the absence of choline. These studies describe the properties of particulate and detergent-solubilized phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity in S. cerevisiae and provide evidence that its activity is regulated in coordination with other enzymes in the pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis involving N-methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1565818304,"A major extracellular matrix glycoprotein, GP140 , synthesized by WI-38 human lung fibroblasts has previously been shown to be collagen-like. A form of GP140 that is related to extracellular matrix GP140 both antigenically and in apparent molecular mass was isolated from human placenta. Types I-VI collagen were isolated from human tissues by limited pepsin digestion, selective salt precipitation, and chromatography. Immunoblot analysis of the collagens and GP140 utilizing affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum directed against extracellular matrix GP140 demonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies with type VI collagen. Both type VI collagen and matrix GP140 could be digested with bacterial collagenase following reduction with dithiothreitol but were collagenase insensitive under nonreducing conditions, unlike types I-V collagen. Placental and matrix GP140 and type VI collagen were shown to have receptors for 125I-labeled Lens culinaris lectin. Pepsin digestion of WI-38 extracellular matrix GP140 yielded a 64,000-dalton band which co-migrated with subunits of reduced type VI collagen on Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, reacted with anti- GP140 antiserum and 125I-labeled L. culinaris lectin, and was collagenase-sensitive only under reducing conditions. CNBr fragmentation of extracellular matrix GP140 , the 64,000-dalton pepsin-resistant peptide of GP140 and type VI collagen followed by immunoblot analysis using anti- GP140 revealed similarities in peptide maps of GP140 and type VI collagen. Our data strongly suggest that GP140 and type VI collagen share characteristics that differ from those of other collagen types and that intermolecular disulfide bonding appears to stabilize these molecules in their native unreduced form, thus conferring collagenase resistance. Finally, the SC1 and SC2 subunits of type VI collagen appear to be generated by pepsin digestion of GP140 ."
https://openalex.org/W1599014585,"The glucuronidation of bile acids is an important pathway for the detoxification and elimination of retained bile acids during cholestasis. A 3-OH-specific androgen UDP-glucuronyltransferase was purified from solubilized female rat liver microsomes using Chromatofocusing and UDP- hexanolamine -Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. The purified 3-OH androgen UDP-glucuronyltransferase is reactive towards bile acids, including lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid, in addition to the androgenic steroids etiocholanolone and androsterone. The highest activity towards bile acids is seen with lithocholic acid-24-methyl ester, and no activity is seen with lithocholic acid-3 alpha-sulfate or 5 beta- cholanic acid-3-one. No glucuronidation activity towards bile acids was observed with either a purified 17-OH steroid UDP-glucuronyltransferase or a p-nitrophenol-UDP-glucuronyltransferase. Lithocholic acid competitively inhibits etiocholanolone glucuronidation by the purified 3-OH androgen isoenzyme. These results suggest that a UDP-glucuronyltransferase isoenzyme is present in female rat liver which is capable of specifically glucuronidating the 3-OH group of bile acids and androgenic steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1554350508,"The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone markedly enhances the hydroperoxide-dependent epoxidation of 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo(a)pyrene catalyzed by microsomal and Tween-20 solubilized preparations of prostaglandin H synthase. Furthermore, phenylbutazone radically alters the hydroperoxide specificity of 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo(a)pyrene epoxidation. In the absence of phenylbutazone, only allylic hydroperoxides are effective in initiating epoxidation, whereas in the presence of phenylbutazone the reaction can be initiated by t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. All effects are dependent on the concentration of phenylbutazone present. The primary event is the oxidation of phenylbutazone by prostaglandin H synthase. This pathway yields a peroxy radical of phenylbutazone which appears to be the epoxidizing agent. This activation of a primary substrate by a peroxidase resulting in metabolism of a secondary substrate is analogous to the halogenation reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase. This represents a new class of oxidation reactions catalyzed by prostaglandin H synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1501090807,"Ferrochelatase activity in human liver has been extensively characterized in the mitochondrial fraction by kinetic study of the enzyme in initial velocity conditions. We found that human liver mitochondrial membranes contain large amounts of endogenous metals that are substrates for the enzyme, leading to a lack of linearity of the activity as function of protein concentration. This lack of linearity is mainly due to a high zinc-chelatase activity with endogenous zinc. Under optimal experimental conditions, the maximum velocity for iron incorporation was 8.7 nmol of protoheme/h/mg of protein, and the maximum velocity for zinc incorporation was 4.3 nmol of zinc-protoporphyrin/h/mg of protein. The Michaelis constant for protoporphyrin IX was (i) dependent on the amount of protein when the overall chelatase reactions were measured but (ii) independent of the amount of protein when only zinc-chelatase activity was measured (Km = 0.5 microM). The Michaelis constants for iron and zinc were 0.35 and 0.08 microM, respectively, and the inhibitory constants for competitive incorporation of iron and zinc were KIFe/Zn = 0.12 microM and KIZn/Fe = 0.58 microM. The affinity of the enzyme for zinc lowers the actual determination of ferrochelatase activity with iron as substrate. Furthermore, when measuring ferrochelatase (e.g. in liver biopsy), endogenous zinc content in the biological sample must be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W1489832453,"The significance of carotenoid accumulation in crustacean eggs remains obscure, particularly because neither eggs nor female animals have been found to display specific pigment patterns in relation to reproduction. We report here the first example of carotenoids found exclusively in the ovaries, the eggs, and the hemolymph, but not in the carcass of a female, reproductively active crustacean, i.e. the brine shrimp Artemia. These pigments are virtually absent in males and in immature animals and disappear very rapidly in growing nauplii following hatching of encysted embryos. Within the cysts, they are preferably localized in the yolk platelets. We have identified them as mono-cis- canthaxanthins on the basis of their mass and absorption spectra and by comparison with synthetic components. Carotenoids with the unusual cis-configuration have never been isolated from animals, nor are there reports on the occurrence of carotenoid pigments at specific sites. Our findings may thus provide a clue to a precise function for carotenoids in Artemia and, possibly, related Crustacea."
https://openalex.org/W1500856205,"We have investigated the importance of serine and threonine residues within the signal peptide in the secretion and processing of the major outer membrane lipoprotein precursor prolipoprotein in Escherichia coli. This was accomplished by systematically replacing these residues with alanine utilizing oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The results demonstrated that the replacement of serine 15 but not threonine 16 alone caused an initial accumulation of membrane-bound unmodified prolipoprotein. In addition, replacement of both serine 15 and threonine 16 resulted in a greater accumulation of this membrane-bound precursor. The accumulated prolipoprotein could be matured to lipoprotein in a quantitative manner, and this process was inhibited by globomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. These results will be discussed in terms of the contribution that serine and threonine have in determining the overall secondary structure of the signal peptide and its importance in secretion and/or processing."
https://openalex.org/W1541408984,"Adipocytes were incubated with [32P]phosphate to achieve steady state labeling of glycogen synthase. The enzyme was then rapidly immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide slab gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The 32P-labeled glycogen synthase had an apparent molecular weight ( Mapp ) equal to 90,000. All of the [32P]phosphate could be recovered in two cyanogen bromide fragments. The larger fragment, CB-2 ( Mapp = 28,000), contained about five times more [32P]phosphate than the smaller fragment, CB-1 ( Mapp = 15,500). Insulin increased the activity ratio (-glucose-6-P/+glucose-6-P) of glycogen synthase from 0.12 to 0.26, but did not decrease the amount of [32P]phosphate in the enzyme. However, insulin promoted the formation of species of CB-2 of lower Mapp , suggesting dephosphorylation of sites that affected the electrophoretic mobility of the fragment. Glucose did not affect the mobility of CB-2, but slightly increased the activity ratio and decreased the [32P] phosphate by approximately 20%. With insulin plus glucose, the increase in activity ratio was much greater than the additive effects of either agent alone. The combination decreased the [32P]phosphate in each cyanogen bromide fragment by approximately 60%, indicating that the synergistic activation was due to enhanced dephosphorylation of multiple sites. 2-Deoxyglucose also promoted dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase, decreasing the 32P content of CB-1 and CB-2 by approximately 40% each. 3-O-Methylglucose was without effect. The results presented suggest that the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin via a glucose transport-dependent pathway may involve increased intracellular glucose-6-P which promotes dephosphorylation of sites in both CB-1 and CB-2. Activation by a glucose transport-independent pathway appears to be confined to sites located in CB-2."
https://openalex.org/W1532603332,"Abalone sperm adenylate cyclase activity is particulate in nature and displays a high Mg2+-supported activity (Mg2+/Mn2+ = 0.8) as compared to other sperm adenylate cyclases. Approximately 90% of the enzyme activity in crude homogenates is inhibited by EGTA in a concentration-dependent manner which is overcome by added micromolar free Ca2+. The EGTA-inhibited Ca2+-stimulated enzyme activity is also inhibited by phenothiazines. Added calmodulin, however, has no effect on enzyme activity prepared from crude homogenates. Preparation of a twice EGTA-extracted 48,000 X g pellet fraction yields a particulate enzyme activity that can be stimulated 10-65% by added calmodulin in the presence of micromolar free Ca2+. Detergent extraction (1% Lubrol PX) of the EGTA-washed 48,000 X g pellet solubilizes 2-5% of the total particulate adenylate cyclase activity, and this solubilized enzyme is activated up to 125% by calmodulin. The ability of the different enzyme preparations to be stimulated by calmodulin is inversely proportional to the endogenous calmodulin concentration. Calmodulin stimulation of the Lubrol PX-solubilized enzyme is specific to this Ca2+-binding protein and is mediated as an effect on the velocity of the enzyme. This stimulation is completely Ca2+ dependent and is fully reversible. These data suggest that the control of sperm cAMP synthesis by changes in Ca2+ conductance may be mediated via this Ca2+-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1502948638,"Serum stimulation of cultured human fibroblasts activates a Na+ influx via an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange system. Evidence is presented which indicates that phospholipase activity is an important component of the mechanism by which mitogen receptor occupation leads to activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Serum stimulation of Na+ flux is effectively blocked by inhibitors of phospholipase activity such as mepacrine and U-1002. The Ki values for inhibition of Na+ flux by these agents (10 microM and 18 microM, respectively) are comparable to their Ki values for inhibition of serum-stimulated arachidonic acid release. In contrast, the activation of Na+ influx produced by the divalent cation A23187 is not affected by phospholipase inhibitors indicating that these agents specifically block mitogen activation of Na+ flux rather than nonspecifically disrupting the membrane's ability to perform Na+/H+ exchange. The phospholipase activator melittin stimulates Na+ influx in the absence of mitogens at concentrations that cause a comparable stimulation of arachidonic acid release. The melittin-stimulated Na+ influx is inhibited by amiloride and mepacrine, suggesting that melittin activation of phospholipase activity leads to the activation of the Na+/H+ exchange system. In addition, chronic treatment of cells with dexamethasone, which is known to induce an endogenous phospholipase inhibitor in human fibroblasts, leads to a substantial inhibition of the serum stimulation of both Na+ influx and arachidonic acid release. When taken together, these data support the involvement of phospholipase activity in the serum stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchange system."
https://openalex.org/W1562376745,"Cholesterol ester hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.13) activity from the 104,000 X g supernatant of rat testis was fractionated into 28-kDa, 72-kDa, and 420-kDa molecular mass forms by high performance size exclusion chromatography. The 72-kDa and 420-kDa forms (temperature-labile) were completely inactivated by elevation of temperature from 32 to 37 degrees C. Apparent disaggregation of the 420-kDa form suggested that the 72-kDa and 420-kDa enzymes are monomeric and multimeric forms of the same enzyme. The 28-kDa form was shown to be a different enzyme (temperature-stable) which retained activity at 37 degrees C. In contrast, cholesteryl ester hydrolase activities from 104,000 X g supernatants of liver or adrenal gland were unaffected and increased 4-fold, respectively, by elevation of temperature from 32 to 37 degrees C. Both testicular enzymes exhibited pH optima at about 7.3, and were activated by sodium cholate at concentrations near the critical micellar concentration (0.03-0.07%), but inhibited by higher concentrations. The temperature-labile cholesteryl ester hydrolase exhibited a high specificity for cholesteryl esters of monoenoic fatty acids of 18-24 carbons, especially nervonate (24:1), whereas the temperature-stable cholesteryl ester hydrolase exhibited highest specificity for cholesteryl oleate and arachidonate. Neither enzyme hydrolyzed cholesteryl acetate, myristate, palmitate, linoleate, or docosahexaenoate . Both enzymes reached maximum rates of hydrolysis at 150 microM substrates, with each substrate and at both reaction temperatures. Substrate inhibition was observed at higher concentrations (200 microM). The temperature-labile cholesteryl ester hydrolase was induced 20-fold in hypophysectomized rats by injection of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and was localized in Sertoli cells, the target cells for FSH, but was not induced by luteinizing hormone. The temperature-stable cholesteryl ester hydrolase was induced by both FSH and LH and was found in both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, the respective target cells for FSH and luteinizing hormone. Neither form of the enzyme was present at detectable levels in the germinal cells. The unique properties, localization, and hormonal regulation of both temperature-labile and temperature-stable cholesterol ester hydrolases suggest important roles for these enzymes in the testis."
https://openalex.org/W1492568641,"At least two intermediates of the D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) reaction were liberated in detectable amounts when the functioning enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum was quenched in acid. Using substrate labeled with 32P in C-1, [32P]orthophosphate (Pi) was found when the quenched solution was rapidly processed for extraction of Pi as the acid molybdate complex. Reaction with sodium borohydride under mildly alkaline conditions immediately after acid quenching of the carboxylase reaction decreased the amount of 32Pi that was observed by 68%. The compound whose degradation to Pi was prevented by reaction with sodium borohydride decomposed under both acid and neutral conditions with a half-time of about 5 min at 25 degrees C and was assigned to the beta-keto acid recently demonstrated for the spinach enzyme ( Schloss , J.V., and Lorimer , G.H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4691-4694). It was sufficiently stable upon neutralization to react productively with fresh enzyme. As substrate CO2 concentration was decreased below the steady state Km value, the proportion of the 32P that did not react with sodium borohydride increased, indicative of a second unstable intermediate that precedes the carboxylation step. The decomposition of the latter intermediate to Pi, which occurs with a t1/2 less than or equal to 6 ms, was prevented if I2 was present in the acid quench medium. These are properties expected of the 2,3- enediol form of ribulose bisphosphate. Both intermediates reach their maximum levels when product formation is most rapid and disappear when product formation is complete as expected of reaction intermediates."

The purified enzyme migrates as two major bands with apparent molecular weights of 64,000 and 57,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A single band, with enzyme activity, was observed in nondenaturing acrylamide gels containing Triton X-100. Mn2+ was required for activity, and the pH optimum was 6.9. Km values for UDP-GalNAc and globotriaosylceramide were 14 and 2.5 microM, respectively. Studies on substrate specificities indicate that the preferred substrates have the general structure Gal alpha 1-4Gal-OR in which the nature of the R moiety has relatively little effect on activity. An antibody against the purified enzyme eliminated the activity of the enzyme, but did not neutralize the alpha-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of Forssman glycolipid."
https://openalex.org/W1479994537,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) binds calmodulin with a stoichiometry approaching 1-1.5 mol of calmodulin/mol of MAP2 in the presence of calcium ion. The calmodulin-binding domain(s) of MAP2 were probed by cross-linking 125I-calmodulin with partially digested MAP2, by limited digestion of the preformed 125I-calmodulin-MAP2 adduct, and by cross-linking 125I-calmodulin with the projection- and assembly-promoting portions of MAP2. Cross-linking 125I-calmodulin with partially digested MAP2 resulted in radioactive adducts of approximately 300, approximately 235, approximately 205, approximately 58, and approximately 40 kDa. The radioactive adducts with smaller molecular mass became prominent with increasing time of digestion concomitant with loss of those with higher molecular size. Limited chymotryptic digestion of preformed 125I-calmodulin-MAP2 adducts also produced a approximately 58-kDa radioactive band followed later by a approximately 40-kDa band. Brief chymotryptic digestion and subsequent centrifugation of microtubules preformed with pure tubulin and MAP2 permitted separation of microtubule-bound MAP2 fragments (molecular mass = approximately 215, approximately 180, and approximately 36 kDa) from unbound fragments (molecular mass = approximately 240, approximately 180, and approximately 140 kDa). 125I-Calmodulin cross-linked only with the microtubule-bound MAP2 fragments (forming mainly the approximately 58-kDa adduct) and not with unbound MAP2 fragments. Since the apparent molecular size of calmodulin is approximately 21 kDa on these sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, the results indicate that partial digestion of MAP2 by chymotrypsin produces a approximately 37-kDa fragment which can be further degraded to a approximately 20-kDa fragment. The approximately 37-kDa fragment that is labeled corresponds to the previously identified assembly-promoting fragment that attaches to the microtubule."

The two major isoforms were obtained by preparative isoelectric focusing and subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis with the following results: isoform 3, (Asp)-Glu-Pro-Gln-Ser-Gln-Trp-Asp-Arg-Val; isoform 4, X-Glu-Phe-X-Gln-Gln-Asp-Glu-Pro-Gln-Ser. By comparison with the amino acid sequence previously reported for the primary translation product of rat intestinal apo-A-I mRNA (Gordon et al. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 971-978), isoform 3, the more basic isoform, is identified as mature apo-A-I and isoform 4 as its proform ( proapo -A-I). The proform differs from mature apo-A-I by a 6-amino acid extension at the NH2 terminus. Isoform 5 was not identified further. The plasma steady state distribution of the apo-A-I forms indicates that proapo -A-I is relatively stable in the circulation. Virtually all plasma proapo -A-I is lipoprotein-associated. No significant differences in the steady state proportions of plasma apo-A-I forms were observed between male and female rats, or among various subfractions of plasma high density lipoproteins obtained by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography or by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Rats fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet, however, showed an increase in the proportion of circulating proapo -A-I. The relative increase in proform was even more pronounced in rats fed a fat-free diet containing orotic acid. The biosynthesis, secretion, and metabolism of the various apo-A-I forms were also studied. In liver and intestine, the only known sites of apo-A-I synthesis in the rat, approximately 85% of the newly synthesized intracellular apo-A-I, was the proform . Proapo -A-I was also the predominant form (approximately 80%) released into the circulation by isolated, perfused livers and by autoperfused intestinal segments in vivo. Gradual processing of circulating proapo -A-I to mature apo-A-I was observed in vivo following pulse-labeling of apo-A-I with [3H]leucine. Processing in vivo was approximately 80% complete in 10 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1525948692,"The growth responses of 5-deoxy-5-methylthioribose on a 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase containing cell line (BW5147) and the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient cell line (L1210D) were examined. Methylthioribose was shown to dramatically affect these cells, increasing their growth rate, saturation density, and viability. It was also found that methylthioribose could satisfy the methylthio dependence of the enzyme-deficient cell line, L1210D. A model is proposed to explain the selective growth of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient cells in medium lacking a methylthio donor but containing fetal calf serum. It is hypothesized that cellularly exported methylthioadenosine is degraded to methylthioribose in the presence of medium containing serum of high methylthioadenosine phosphorylase activity (i.e. fetal calf serum). The resultant methylthioribose can then be used to satisfy the methylthio requirement of these cells. To test this theory, various purified preparations of bovine liver methylthioadenosine phosphorylase were used to artificially increase the specific activity of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase in horse serum. In each case, it was demonstrated that only medium containing serum of enzyme activity nearly equal to that of the glutathione-stimulated fetal calf serum activity, supported the growth of methylthio-dependent cells in the absence of methylthio compounds. The data suggest that the degradation of methylthioadenosine and subsequent formation of methylthioribose represents an essential process in the growth of mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1934255972,"Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants fix carbon dioxide at night by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate. If CO2 fixation is conducted with 13C18O2 , then in the absence of carbonic anhydrase, the malate formed by dark CO2 fixation should also contain high levels of carbon-13 and oxygen-18. Conversely, if carbonic anhydrase is present and highly active, oxygen exchange between CO2 and cellular H2O will occur more rapidly than carboxylation, and the [13C] malate formed will contain little or no oxygen-18 above the natural abundance level. The presence of oxygen-18 in these molecules can be detected either by nuclear magnetic resonance (using the oxygen-18 effect on the carbon-13 chemical shift of the carboxyl carbon) or by mass spectrometry (comparing the ions at three and five units above the molecular weight with that one unit above). Studies of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in the presence and absence of carbonic anhydrase in vitro confirm the validity of the method. When CAM plants are studied by this method, we find that most species show incorporation of a significant amount of oxygen-18. Comparison of these results with results of isotope fractionation and gas exchange studies permits calculation of the in vivo activity of carbonic anhydrase toward HCO-3 compared with that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The ratio (carbonic anhydrase activity/phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity) is species dependent and varies from a low of about 7 for Ananas comosus to values near 20 for Hoya carnosa and Bryophyllum pinnatum , 40 for Kalancho e daigremontiana , and 100 or greater for Bryophyllum tubiflorum , Kalancho e serrata, and Kalancho e tomentosa.

https://openalex.org/W1732030651,"The two virginiamycin components VM and VS interact synergistically with bacterial ribosomes in vitro and in vivo. Ribosome affinity for virginiamycin S increases about 10-fold upon incubation with virginiamycin M. This effect has been previously traced by spectrofluorimetric measurement based on the enhancement of virginiamycin S fluorescence upon its binding to the 50 S ribosomal subunit. In the present work the action of two virginiamycin S fluorescence quenchers, acrylamide and iodide, has been explored to gather information about the accessibility of ribosome-bound virginiamycin S and the variation of the accessibility level in the presence of virginiamycin M. Both acrylamide (non-ionized quencher) and iodide (ionized quencher) proved powerful quenchers of free virginiamycin S solutions. Since a comparable effect was obtained on 3- hydroxypicolinamide , the latter was indicated as the part of the molecule involved in the fluorescence effect. Fluorescence quenching by either agent was of the dynamic, i.e. collisional, type. Such an inference was based on the fact that these quenchers merely modified the emission spectrum (not the absorption spectrum), the bimolecular rate constant for the quenching process decreased linearly with the viscosity of the medium (static-type quenching is viscosity-independent), and that linear Stern-Volmer plots were obtained. The quenching ability of both agents underwent a sharp decrease in the presence of ribosomes; however, the Stern-Volmer equation was followed only in the case of acrylamide, whereas Lehrer 's relationship had to be applied in the case of iodide. When ribosomes were incubated with virginiamycin M, the fluorescence quenching ability of acrylamide and iodide was significantly reduced. Conclusions are as follows: a) the 3- hydroxypicolinyl residue of virginiamycin S is buried within an open well on the ribosome surface and is likely to be involved in the interaction with the binding site; b) the accessibility to the well is partly controlled by electrostatic forces; c) interaction of ribosomes with virginiamycin M entails a conformational change whereby the access to the well is reduced. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the previously observed increase of the association constant of virginiamycin S to ribosomes incubated with virginiamycin M which was found to be due to the decrease of the dissociation rate constant (the association rate constant remains practically the same)."
https://openalex.org/W1561657570,"The effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) on protein phosphorylation was investigated in cultures of dissociated, purified chick sympathetic neurons labeled with inorganic [32P]phosphate or [35S]methionine. For at least 90 min after dissociation and purification of the neurons, overall protein phosphorylation was similar in the absence and presence of added NGF, indicating that the neurons were not unspecifically affected by this period of NGF deprivation. Addition of NGF resulted in a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of a 70,000-dalton protein, designated p70 . p70 existed in five isoelectric variants, referred to as p70 /1-5. p70 /1 was unphosphorylated and was the least acidic variant. p70 /2-5 contained progressively more phosphate and they were increasingly acidic. NGF, via dephosphorylation (or via a highly specific and very limited proteolysis), induced the conversion of p70 /5 and p70 /4 to p70 /2. The effect of NGF on p70 involved phosphothreonine residues to a greater extent than phosphoserine residues and occurred rapidly, being detectable after 5 min and complete after 15 min. 8-Br-cAMP did not mimic the effect of NGF on p70 . Depolarization of the neurons with high K+ and addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 produced effects on the phosphorylated p70 variants similar to those induced by NGF. The response of p70 to two distinct factors, NGF and depolarization, may suggest a role for this phosphoprotein in the survival of sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1602450378,"Abstract The rate at which a specific, purified form of microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (designated as the GT2P type of this enzyme) catalyzes the hydrolysis of UDP-glucuronic acid was measured with pure, delipidated enzyme and enzyme reconstituted with different lysophosphatidylcholines. This activity of the GT2P type of UDP-glucuronyltransferase is referred to as alpha-glucuronidase activity. For delipidated enzyme, the rate of hydrolysis of UDP-glucuronic acid catalyzed by GT2P extrapolated to infinite concentrations of UDP-glucuronic acid was 1 X 10(-9) mol/min/mg of protein. This compares with a rate of glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol of 96 X 10(-9) mol/min/mg of enzyme, for delipidated enzyme. Addition of oleoyl- or myristoyllysophosphatidylcholine to GT2P did not affect the alpha-glucuronidase activity significantly. This activity was stimulated, however, in the presence of compounds that bind at the aglycone site but that do not undergo glucuronidation. alpha-Glucuronidase activity extrapolated to infinite concentration of UDP-glucuronic acid was 4.0 X 10(-9) mol/min/mg for delipidated enzyme assayed in the presence of less than saturating concentrations of p-nitrophenyl phenyl ether. Moreover, when the aglycone site of GT2P was occupied by ethers, the alpha-glucuronidase activity of this enzyme was enhanced by addition of phospholipids to delipidated enzyme. The extent of activation of the alpha-glucuronidase activity of GT2P, when the aglycone site was occupied, depended on the acyl chain of the lipid added to delipidated enzyme. These data indicate that the GT2P form of UDP-glucuronyltransferase catalyzes the hydrolysis of UDP-glucuronic acid at a significant rate and that lysophosphatidylcholines can influence this rate."
