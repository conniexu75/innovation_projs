https://openalex.org/W1971931044,"Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a human genetic syndrome characterized by the development of benign tumors in a variety of tissues, as well as rare malignancies. Two different genetic loci have been implicated in TSC; one of these loci, the tuberous sclerosis-2 gene (TSC2), encodes an open reading frame with a putative protein product of 1784 amino acids. The putative TSC2 product (tuberin) contains a region of limited homology to the catalytic domain of Rap1GAP. We have generated antisera against the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of tuberin, and these antisera specifically recognize a 180-kDa protein in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses. A wide variety of human cell lines express the 180-kDa tuberin protein, and subcellular fractionation revealed that most tuberin is found in a membrane/particulate (100,000 × g) fraction. Immunoprecipitates of native tuberin contain an activity that specifically stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rap1a. These results were confirmed in assays with a C-terminal fragment of tuberin, expressed in bacteria or Sf9 cells. Tuberin did not stimulate the GTPase activity of Rap2, Ha-Ras, Rac, or Rho. These results suggest that the loss of tuberin leads to constitutive activation of Rap1 in tumors of patients with tuberous sclerosis.

Members of the Ras-related family of small GTP-binding proteins are involved in many different biological functions(1Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 469-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). These proteins, which bind and hydrolyze GTP, are active when bound to GTP and inactive in the GDP-bound state(3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 4Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide binding by the Ras-related GTPases is regulated by cellular enzymes. Cellular regulatory proteins include both positive regulators, the guanine nucleotide exchange factors and negative regulators, known as GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs)1( 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase accelerating proteinsNF1neurofibromatosis type 1TSCtuberous sclerosisTub-Ntuberin which encodes amino acids Ala-2 to Ala-306Tub-Ctuberin which encodes amino acids Leu-1387 to Val-1784GSTglutathione S-transferaseDHdbl-homology regionPBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) (5Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The GAP proteins act by stimulating the intrinsic GTPase of the GTP-binding proteins, keeping them in the inactive, GDP-bound state(4Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.

The Ras subfamily of small molecular weight GTPases is known to regulate mitogenic signal transduction pathways linking plasma membrane receptors to the nucleus. Thus Ras proteins are critical in controlling the proliferation of many diverse cell types(4Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 6Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The critical role of GAP proteins in regulating the activity of the Ras-like GTPases has been demonstrated by studies of the human genetic disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The product of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, neurofibromin, acts as a specific GAP for Ras proteins (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Loss of neurofibromin expression is associated with the constitutive activation of Ras in cell lines derived from tumors of patients with NF1(7Basu T.N. Gutmann D.H. Fletcher J.A. Glover T.W.

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) presents many striking parallels with NF1, including autosomal dominant inheritance, the appearance of benign tumors and other abnormalities in multiple organ systems, and development of rare malignancies in affected individuals(9Gomez M.R. Tuberous Sclerosis. Raven Press, New York1988Google Scholar). Unlike NF1, TSC has been linked to two different loci, TSC2 on chromosome 16, and an unidentified gene on chromosome 9 (TSC1)(10Janssen B. Sampson J. van der Est M. Deelen W. Verhoef S. Daniels I.

Loss of heterozygosity at the TSC2 locus has been demonstrated in tumors of human TSC patients, strongly suggesting that this gene functions as a tumor suppressor(12Green A.J. Smith M. Yates J.R.W. Nature Genet. 1994; 6: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This implication has been substantiated by studies of the Eker rat strain, in which susceptibility to bilateral renal cell carcinoma is caused by a germline mutation in the rat TSC2 gene, and tumor development is associated with somatic loss of heterozygosity at TSC2(13Yeung R.S. Xiao G.-H. Jin F. Lee W.-C. Testa J.R. Knudson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11413-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 14Kobayashi T. Hirayama Y. Kobayashi E. Kubo Y. Hino O. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The 5.5-kilobase transcript of TSC2 is widely expressed, consistent with the multiple organs affected in TSC, including the brain, heart, skin, kidneys, lungs, and others(9Gomez M.R. Tuberous Sclerosis. Raven Press, New York1988Google Scholar, 13Yeung R.S. Xiao G.-H. Jin F. Lee W.-C. Testa J.R. Knudson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The predicted TSC2 product, designated tuberin, comprises 1784 amino acids. A 58-amino acid region near the C terminus has limited homology (19 identical amino acids) with a portion of the catalytic domain of Rap1GAP(15Cell The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium. 1993; 75: 1305-1313Google Scholar). Rap1GAP acts as a negative regulator of the Rap1a and Rap1b GTPases, which share greater than 50% amino acid identity with Ras(16Pizon V. Lerosey I. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Although originally identified as an antagonist of Ras transformation (see “Discussion”), Rap1 (also referred to as K-rev1 and smg p21) has been shown to induce DNA synthesis and morphological changes when microinjected into Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells(18Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that like Ras, the Rap1 proteins may act as positive mitogenic signaling molecules. The homology between tuberin and Rap1GAP suggests a possible molecular similarity between neurofibromin, a regulatory GAP for Ras, and tuberin, a potential regulator of Rap1. Investigation of this possibility has awaited the identification and characterization of the TSC2 product. To address these questions, we have raised antisera to bacterial fusion proteins encoding the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of tuberin. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with these antisera have identified tuberin as a widely expressed 180-kDa molecule, with associated GAP activity that is specific for Rap1. These findings have potential implications for the tumor suppressor function of TSC2. Two cDNA fragments encoding regions of the human TSC2 gene were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech)(19Tung J.-S. Daugherty B.L. O'Neill L. Law S.W. Han J. Mark G.E. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 99-104Crossref Google Scholar). One encodes amino acids Ala-2 to Ala-306 of tuberin (Tub-N), and the other encodes amino acids Leu-1387 to Val-1784 (Tub-C)(15Cell The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium. 1993; 75: 1305-1313Google Scholar). The DNA fragments were cloned into the vector pGEX-4T2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using BamHI and SalI, for expression as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The DNA sequences of the fragments were verified by direct DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For control purposes, a region of the mouse CDC25mM/GRF gene, comprising the dbl-homology (DH) region (amino acids Arg-211 to Leu 512), was also cloned into pGEX-4T2(20Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Zippel R. Lowy D.R. Zhang K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For expression as a GST fusion protein in Sf9 cells, the fragment encoding Tub-C was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcG2T (Pharmingen) using BamHI and EcoRI. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection, and were cultured according to the conditions supplied. HB101 Escherichia coli cells bearing the pGEX-4T2 plasmids encoding GST-Tub-N, GST-Tub-C, or GST-DH were grown to an optical density of 1.0 (600 nm) and induced with 50 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 28°C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1/50 volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and lysed by sonication. Sonicated lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g to pellet insoluble material. Aliquots of the supernatants were used immediately for experiments measuring GAP activity. To estimate the concentration of the GST fusion proteins in the lysates, glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) were added to an aliquot of the supernatant, incubated for 2 h at 4°C, washed four times with PBS, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) together with purified carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) as a standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue-G (BDH). To isolate fusion proteins present in inclusion bodies, the bacteria were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM DTT. Unlysed cells were removed by low-speed centrifugation, and the inclusion bodies were pelleted by 15,000 × g for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, and 2 M urea, and repelleted. Concentration and purity were estimated by SDS-PAGE. The purity of GST-Tub-N and GST-Tub-C in these preparations was 80-90%. Acetone powder preparations of HB101 cells expressing GST-Tub-N, GST-Tub-C, and GST-DH were prepared as described(21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). 300-400 μg of purified GST-Tub-N and GST-Tub-C (in the form of inclusion bodies) were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits with Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections were carried out 3, 5, and 9 weeks later. For use in Western blotting, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was isolated from the sera of rabbits immunized with Tub-C by binding to protein A, and conjugated with digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-ϵ-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimidine ester according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). For analysis by combined immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, 107 cells per sample lane (in a volume of 300 μl) were used. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (22DeClue J.E. Cohen B.D. Lowy D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9914-9918Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), using 10 μl of antiserum (a 1:30 dilution). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% gels, and proteins were electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). For blocking experiments, antisera were incubated with acetone powder suspensions (0.1% w/v) of bacterial proteins for 2 h at 4°C, then clarified by centrifugation before use. Following electroblotting, the membrane was blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 3% bovine serum albumin. After blocking, the membrane was incubated with 15 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled anti-Tub-C IgG (for Fig. 2a, 2c, 3, and 4). Immunoblotted proteins were detected by incubation with sheep anti-digoxigenin Fab--alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and chemiluminescence substrate Lumi-Phos530 (Boehringer Mannheim). The immunoblot shown in Fig. 2b employed different nonconjugated antisera at a dilution of 1:2,000, as indicated. This blot was developed with an anti-rabbit peroxidase-based enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Kirkegaard and Perry). To estimate the molecular weight of tuberin, both prestained molecular weight standards (BRL) and unstained standards (Pharmacia) were employed. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with the baculovirus transfer vector pAcG2T-GST-Tub-C and BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen), and recombinant baculoviruses encoding the GST-Tub-C protein were isolated and enriched according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sf9 cells (3 × 107) were infected with virus (encoding either GST-Tub-C, or bovine papilloma virus L1 protein as a control), and were harvested after 50 h. Cells were washed with GAP assay buffer, and lysed by sonication in 1 ml of GAP assay buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the concentration of GST-Tub-C was estimated as for bacterial lysates. 1.4 × 108 K-562 cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and split in two. One portion of the cells was lysed with 2 ml of lysis buffer, while the other aliquot was used to prepare the 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) and particulate/membrane (P100) fractions, as described previously(22DeClue J.E. Cohen B.D. Lowy D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9914-9918Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Equal portions of the S100, P100, and the lysis-buffer lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described above. For each GAP assay reaction with immune complexes of tuberin, the anti-Tub-C serum was used to immunoprecipitate tuberin from lysates of 4 × 106 K-562, prepared in 120 μl of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, and the immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, then three times with GAP assay buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Then the beads were resuspended in GAP assay buffer in one-fourth of the original volume. GAP assays were carried out essentially as described(23Zhang K. Papageorge A.P. Martin P. Vass W.C. Olah Z. Polakis P. McCormick F. Lowy D.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1630-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μM GTP-binding proteins were loaded with 5 μM [γ-32P]GTP in loading buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate), in a volume of 10 μl, then diluted into 600 μl of cold GAP assay buffer with 10 μM unlabeled GTP. 50 μl of this mixture was then added to the different tuberin or GST-Tub-C preparations. Assays included 30 μl of native tuberin bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (isolated from 4 × 106 K-562 cells), 10 μl of crude (200 nM GST-Tub-C) bacterial lysate, or (1 μM GST-Tub-C) Sf9 cell lysate. Reactions were carried out in duplicate at 32°C, and 10-μl portions of each reaction were removed at the start or after the indicated times. Remaining p21-bound [γ-32P]GTP was determined by nitrocellulose filter binding. H6-tagged Ha-Ras and Rap1a, purified from Sf9 cells, were provided by Dr. Albert Reynolds; bacterial Rho and Rac were provided by Dr. Alan Hall. Rap2 was expressed as described in HB101 cells containing a rap2 expression plasmid, provided by Dr. Jean de Gunzburg(24Lerosey I. Chardin P. de Gunzburg J. Tavitian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4315-4321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To allow for the specific detection of tuberin, antisera were raised against an N-terminal and a C-terminal region of the predicted protein product (designated anti-Tub-N and anti-Tub-C, respectively) (Fig. 1). Extracts of the K-562 erythroleukemia cell line were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Tub-N, unrelated or preimmune sera. After SDS-PAGE analysis, immunoprecipitates were transferred to a filter, and the filter was incubated with anti-Tub-C serum (Fig. 2a). We observed the presence of a specific band of 180 kDa in the anti-Tub-N immunoprecipitates. Next, extracts of the G-401 Wilms tumor cell line were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-Tub-C or anti-Tub-N sera, and the immunoprecipitates were blotted. The blot was cut into strips, which were incubated with preimmune, anti-Tub-C, or unrelated serum (Fig. 2b). Again, a specific band of 180 kDa was detected in the anti-Tub-N and anti-Tub-C immunoprecipitates, but only when the blot was probed with anti-Tub-C serum (the anti-Tub-N serum did not bind to tuberin in immunoblot analyses). The observed migration of this band is close to the predicted molecular mass of tuberin (198 kDa)(15Cell The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium. 1993; 75: 1305-1313Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis provides a high degree of certainty that the observed protein is in fact tuberin, since antisera against different regions of tuberin were employed for immunoprecipitation and for immunoblotting. As additional proof of specificity, a significant reduction in the intensity of the 180-kDa band was observed following preincubation of the anti-Tub-N serum with an acetone powder extract prepared from E. coli expressing GST-Tub-N, but not by preincubation with acetone powder preparations of E. coli expressing GST-Tub-C or GST-DH (Fig. 2c). Immunoprecipitation of extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled K-562 and G-401 cells with these antisera again revealed a 180-kDa band, which could be specifically blocked by preadsorption with acetone powder preparations from E. coli expressing the cognate fusion protein, but not by preadsorption with control acetone powder preparations (data not shown). Immunoblot analyses performed without prior immunoprecipitation also revealed a 180-kDa protein in the cell lysates. However, the background when either procedure was employed singly was higher than in the combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analyses, which led us to use the latter procedure in most of the subsequent experiments. To determine the subcellular localization of tuberin, K-562 cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in the absence of detergent. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to yield membrane/particulate (P100) and nonparticulate (S100) fractions. Control lysates from an equal amount of cells were prepared with detergent, and each of the fractions was analyzed by immunoprecipitation (with anti-Tub-N, preimmune, or anti-Tub-C) followed by Western blotting (with anti-Tub-C). A substantial majority of the tuberin was recovered in the P100 fraction (Fig. 3), raising the possibility that tuberin may associate with the cell plasma membrane, or with intracellular membranes or organelles. The wide variety of organ systems affected in TSC patients suggests that the 180-kDa tuberin protein is expressed in many different cell types. Indeed, expression of the TSC2 mRNA in diverse cell types has been demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. We tested a panel of 13 different human cell lines for tuberin expression (Fig. 4). These lines represent a variety of cell types (see legend to Fig. 4). Cells were lysed, and portions of each lysate containing an equal amount of protein were subjected to combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis. With the exception of HL-60 and U-937 cells, tuberin was expressed in all of the cell lines tested. Interestingly, each of the tuberin-negative cell lines represents a different maturation level of the myelocytic/monocytic lineage; abnormalities in this lineage have not been linked to TSC patients(9Gomez M.R. Tuberous Sclerosis. Raven Press, New York1988Google Scholar, 25Lübbert M. Herrmann F. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1991; 77: 909-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small differences in the migration rate of tuberin were observed in some of the cell lines (e.g. SW-13 and HT-29 cells). These differences may reflect post-translational modification of tuberin, or the products of alternatively-spliced variants of the TSC2 mRNA. Splicing variants have been demonstrated for the TSC2 homolog in rats.2( 2R. S. Yeung, personal communication.) The region of tuberin bearing homology to Rap1GAP (58 amino acids) is substantially shorter than the Rap1GAP catalytic domain (331 residues), and is also shorter than the homology seen between different Ras-specific GAP proteins (about 350 residues)(3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 26Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, if tuberin does indeed function as a GAP for Rap1, then immunoprecipitates of tuberin should contain this type of activity. Therefore, native tuberin was isolated by immunoprecipitation from K-562 cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with [γ-32P]GTP-bound Rap1a to assay potential GAP activity (Fig. 5a). We observed significant levels of GAP activity toward Rap1a in the tuberin immunoprecipitates, but not in immunoprecipitates in which a control antiserum (anti-papillomavirus structural protein L2) was used. As a positive control, we analyzed the GAP activity toward Rap1a present in non-immunoprecipitated lysates of K-562 cells. Three μl of K-562 lysate contained more GAP activity toward Rap1a than tuberin immunocomplexes isolated from 120 μl of K-562 lysate. These differences may be due to incomplete isolation of tuberin from the lysates, although the reaction kinetics of Sepharose bead-bound tuberin are undoubtedly different from those of soluble proteins present in the K-562 lysate. In addition, the K-562 cells may express other sources of Rap1-specific GAP activity, such as one of the previously characterized Rap1GAP activities(23Zhang K. Papageorge A.P. Martin P. Vass W.C. Olah Z. Polakis P. McCormick F. Lowy D.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1630-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Polakis P.G. Rubinfeld B. Evans T. McCormick F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results described above strongly suggest that tuberin itself possesses GAP activity for Rap1, although we could not exclude the possibility that this activity is due to a coimmunoprecipitating Rap1GAP. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the ability of the GST-Tub-C fusion protein, which contains the last 398 amino acids (and includes the putative catalytic domain) of tuberin, to stimulate the GTPase activity of Rap1a. The GST-Tub-C protein, expressed in both E. coli and Sf9 cells, was tested for GAP activity toward Rap1a. When lysates of bacteria expressing GST-Tub-C were tested, a dose dependent, albeit weak, GAP activity was observed, while E. coli lysates expressing a control GST-fusion protein lacked detectable GAP activity (Fig. 5b). In addition, lysates of Sf9 cells expressing GST-Tub-C contained enhanced GAP activity toward Rap1a, when compared with lysates of Sf9 cells expressing a control protein (Fig. 5c). Insect cells express endogenous Rap1GAP, which probably accounts for the activity observed in the control cell lysates(28Hariharan I.K. Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 717-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of tuberin GAP activity, we incubated immunoprecipitates of native tuberin with [γ-32P]GTP-bound recombinant Rap1a, Rap2, Ras, or Rho proteins. The GAP activity of tuberin toward all four of the GTPase proteins was measured in the same experiment. Consistent with the results of Fig. 5a, immunoprecipitates with anti-tuberin antisera contained significant levels of GAP activity toward Rap1a, compared to control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6a). By contrast, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras, Rap2, and Rho was not stimulated by incubation with anti-tuberin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6, b, c, and d). In additional experiments, the GTPase activity of Rac was not enhanced by tuberin (data not shown). Here we have described the identification of the TSC2 gene product, tuberin, and its initial biochemical characterization. In particular, the discovery of tuberin-associated GAP activity toward Rap1a suggests that this activity represents a primary biochemical function of tuberin. Full-length native tuberin, isolated by immunoprecipitation, displayed significantly more GAP activity than a recombinant C-terminal fragment of tuberin, suggesting that this activity may be positively regulated by post-translational modification of tuberin in mammalian cells. Alternatively, full GAP activity may require a larger region of the C terminus than that which was tested (amino acids 1387-1784). In either case, it is clear that tuberin does interact physically with Rap1a, and the primary site of this interaction resides within the tuberin C terminus. Additional evidence that the C-terminal region of tuberin is critical for its biological function comes from the study of tumor induction in the Eker rat strain, which is caused by an insertion resulting in premature termination of tuberin upstream from the catalytic domain(13Yeung R.S.

Hino O. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These results do not, however, determine whether Rap1a represents the sole or even the primary target for the GAP activity of tuberin, as more than 50 small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins are known to be present inside mammalian cells(3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Rap1b, which represents the other isoform of Rap1, is likely to be sensitive to tuberin GAP activity, as Rap1b is highly homologous to Rap1a and no biochemical differences between the isoforms have been demonstrated(16Pizon V. Lerosey I. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Pizon P. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Touchot N. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that Ras, Rho, Rac, and especially Rap2 (which shares 60% homology with Rap1) are resistant to the GAP activity of tuberin strongly suggests that Rap1 is the primary target for this activity. The vast majority of tuberin was found in the particulate/membrane fraction of cells, consistent with the possibility that tuberin might co-localize with Rap1a, which is associated with intracellular vesicles (30Pizon V. Desjardins M. Bucci C. Parton R.G. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1661-1670PubMed Google Scholar). If Rap1 does serve as the primary target for the GAP activity of tuberin, the role of this protein in the development of tumors in TSC patients may be through one of several different mechanisms. Evidence that Rap1 mediates a positive growth signal has come from studies in which it was shown to induce DNA synthesis and morphological changes, when micro-injected into Swiss 3T3 cells(18Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In another study, a gain-of-function mutant in the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of rap1 was shown to result in a roughened eye phenotype. Revertants of this mutant displayed significantly lower expression of the rap1 gene. Loss-of-function mutants of rap1 were found to be lethal, suggesting a positive role for the rap1 product in cell proliferation or cell viability (28Hariharan I.K. Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 717-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In light of these findings suggesting a positive signaling role for Rap1, the presumed lack of functional tuberin in tumors of patients with TSC and in renal cell tumors of the Eker rat may reflect aberrant regulation of Rap1, resulting in its constitutive activation. While tuberin is clearly not the sole source of Rap1GAP activity in K-562 cells, its activity could be critical in certain cell types, particularly in cells that are predisposed to tumor formation in TSC patients. In this scenario, tuberin would be functionally analogous to the NF1 product neurofibromin, a RasGAP critical for regulation of Ras in tumor cells of NF1 patients(7Basu T.N. Gutmann D.H. Fletcher J.A. Glover T.W. Collins F.S. Downward J. Nature. 1992; 356: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 8DeClue J.E. Papageorge A.G. Fletcher J.A. Diehl S.R. Ratner N. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Cell. 1992; 69: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that while neurofibromin is critical as a regulator of GTP·Ras in Schwann cells, it is not required as a regulator in other cell types (e.g. NIH 3T3)(31Johnson M.R. DeClue J.E. Felzmann S. Vass W.C. Xu G. White R. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Kim H. Kombrinck K. Marchioni M. Ratner N. DeClue J. Oncogene. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). In spite of this fact, overexpression of NF1 does inhibit the growth of NIH 3T3(31Johnson M.R. DeClue J.E. Felzmann S. Vass W.C. Xu G. White R. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One explanation for these findings is that neurofibromin binds to Ras, preventing Ras from interacting with its mitogenic effectors. Such a model could also apply to tuberin and Rap1a: loss of tuberin expression in cells would free up Rap1, thereby allowing it to transmit a positive signal through its effectors. An alternative model for the function of tuberin and Rap1 is suggested by studies which have raised the possibility that Rap1 has a negative effect on cell growth. These studies originated with the demonstration that rap1a can antagonize ras-induced transformation. rap1a was identified as a cDNA that, when overexpressed, could cause reversion of the transformed phenotype in NIH 3T3 bearing an oncogenic K-ras gene(17Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of constitutively active rap1 (valine 12) was shown to inhibit the activation of MAP kinase following simulation with epidermal growth factor and lysophosphatidic acid, although with less efficiency than a dominant-inhibitory mutant of ras (rasN17)(33Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated that Rap1 is capable of binding to all of the putative mitogenic effectors for mammalian Ras: RasGAP, Raf, and phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase(34Frech M. John J. Pizon V. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Clark R. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1990; 249: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar).3( 3J. Downward, personal communication.) These results have been interpreted as supporting a model whereby Rap1 antagonizes Ras through competitive binding of Rap1 to Ras effector molecules. An alternative (although not mutually exclusive) possibility is that Rap1 proteins participate in the transduction of growth-inhibitory signals, thereby overcoming the mitogenic signals originating from Ras(36Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In accordance with this scenario, tuberin might function as an effector protein (as well as a GAP) for Rap1, and the loss of tuberin expression would prevent transmission of the growth-inhibitory signals originating from Rap1. While Rap1 is likely to be a primary target for the GAP activity of tuberin, we cannot exclude the possible involvement of other small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. Recently, Spa-1, a protein with homology to Rap1GAP and tuberin, was shown to have GAP activity toward both Rap1 and the nuclear-localized, Ras-related GTPase Ran(37Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur-E-Kamal M.S.A. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Also, given the fact that Rap1 binds to RasGAP with high affinity, it is possible that tuberin suppresses cell growth by binding to Ras, without stimulating its GTPase. In future studies, we will pursue the possibility that the tumor suppressor function of tuberin is related to its ability to regulate, or interact with, other members of the Ras superfamily in addition to Rap1. Cell lines derived from tumors of the Eker rat should greatly facilitate these investigations of the tumor suppressor function of tuberin.

This response is dependent on a strong enhancer element (Z) and weaker elements (X and −27).

Thus, the DR1 motif in the Z element is not sufficient to constitute a PPRE. Moreover, the binding of PPARα·RXRα to the Z element requires sequences immediately 5′ of the DR1.

Peroxisome proliferators are non-genotoxic carcinogens that cause profound changes in the subcellular structure and lipid metabolism of hepatocytes in rodents(1Rao M.S. Reddy J.K.

A well characterized biochemical marker for the action of peroxisome proliferators is the induction of the enzymes that catalyze the peroxisomal β-oxidation and microsomal ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids. Recent studies have shown that peroxisome proliferators induce transcription of the rat fatty acid acyl-CoA oxidase gene (3Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S.

The most distal element (X) provides a weak response in the presence of cotransfected PPARα, and deletion of this element from CYP4A6 reporter constructs results in a 2-fold drop in response to peroxisome proliferators(5Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the Z element from CYP4A6 reporter constructs results in the abolition of significant peroxisome proliferator responses in the presence of cotransfected PPARα. The proximal element(−27) is a cryptic element in that it is only activated in cotransfection studies when RXRα is overexpressed together with PPARα. The cryptic nature of the −27 element has been shown to be due to the fact that it binds PPARα·RXRα very inefficiently(6Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

This would suggest a level of promiscuity in the regulation of the genes controlled by these elements, and, in fact, ARP-1 and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor-1 have been shown to antagonize peroxisome proliferator signaling(6Palmer C.N.A.

These additional sequences form an extended binding site that is conserved within natural PPREs.RESULTSAs previously shown(5Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cotransfection of CYP4A6 reporter constructs pLUCA6-880 and pLUCA6-663 (Fig. 1) with an expression vector for PPAR-G (a mutant form of mPPARα that displays an enhanced response to peroxisome proliferators) revealed that sequences 5′ of the direct repeat (DR1) were required to confer responsiveness to peroxisome proliferators. pLUCA6-880 is activated 13.3-fold by the inclusion of a peroxisome proliferator (Wy-14,643) in the culture medium, whereas pLUCA6-663 does not respond to Wy-14,643. An oligonucleotide that spanned the deletion site (Z) was found to confer a peroxisome proliferator response to the non-responsive pLUCA6-155 construct. This element contains four imperfect repeats of the nuclear receptor binding site (AGGTCA) (half sites). We would anticipate that the binding of a PPARα·RXRα heterodimer would require two such half sites, with a zinc finger from each receptor interacting with one of these repeats. The portion of the Z element found in pLUCA6-663 contains an imperfect direct repeated sequence (DR1) that is formed with half sites 2 and 3. DR1 motifs have been found in the PPREs of other genes, including the acyl-CoA oxidase gene, and are known to bind RXR homodimers. However, half sites 2 and 3 are retained in the inactive pLUCA6-663 construct. It appears that it is the disruption of half site 1 that leads to a loss of response in the −663 construct. Half site 1 (3′-AGTTCA-5′) is known to bind retinoic acid receptors with a high efficiency(21Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J.-Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Carlberg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This sequence forms imperfect inverted palindromes with the directly repeated half sites 2, 3, and 4. Nuclear receptors are known to bind inverted palindromic sequences of different spacings(22Carlberg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Carlberg C. Bendik I. Wyss A. Meier E. Sturzenbecker L.J. Grippo J.F. Hunziker W. Nature. 1993; 361: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).To determine the minimal sequences required for the binding of PPARα·RXRα to the Z element, EMSAs of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing various combinations of these repeated sequences were performed. For this purpose, the murine PPARα was expressed as a fusion protein with GST, and the human RXRα was expressed as a fusion protein with the MBP. As previously shown(6Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a complex is observed for PPARα·RXRα with the Z element (Fig. 2B, left panel, Z1234). Truncation of the Z element by six nucleotides on the 5′-end and three nucleotides on the 3′-end does not reduce the binding of PPARα·RXRα (Fig. 2B, left panel, Z123). This result demonstrates that half site 4 is not involved in the binding of PPARα·RXRα. Truncations of the 5′-end by a further six nucleotides, which disrupts half site 1, results in a loss of binding of PPARα·RXRα (Fig. 2B, left panel, Z234, Z23). Deletion of a further nine nucleotides from the 3′-end, which removes half site 3, results in a loss of binding of PPARα·RXRα (Fig. 2B, left panel, Z12). EMSA employing finer truncations of the Z123 oligonucleotide revealed that progressive truncations that disrupt half site 1 result in a progressive loss of PPARα·RXRα binding (Fig. 2, center panel, Z123-Z23). Truncations 3′ of half site 3 revealed the requirement of one additional nucleotide (Fig. 2B, center panel, ZD6-ZVVS) for the binding of PPARα·RXRα. Therefore, it appears that the minimal PPARα·RXRα binding sequence spans the regions corresponding to half sites 1, 2, and 3. Mutagenesis of half site 2 (Fig. 2B, left panel, Z13) results in the loss of PPARα·RXRα binding. The requirement for three half sites (1, 2, and 3) was unexpected as the binding of a heterodimer should require only two repeats. As such, we decided to compare the binding requirements of PPARα·RXRα with those for ARP-1. EMSA was performed with the partially purified ARP-1/MBP fusion protein and double stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to various truncations of the Z element (Fig. 2B, right panel). ARP-1 forms a single complex with the Z element in contrast to that seen with the −27 element of CYP4A6 and other characterized ARP-1 binding sites where both monomeric and dimeric binding is observed(6Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mobility of the complex formed with the Z element approximates that of the lower mobility complex seen with the −27 element. The lower mobility complex is presumed to consist of a dimeric rather than monomeric complex as the slower mobility of the complex is likely to reflect a larger molecular weight. The appearance of a single, dimeric complex with the Z element and ARP-1 suggests that the monomer binds to the Z element with a very low efficiency. Truncations that disrupt half site 1 and abolish PPARα·RXRα binding do not affect ARP-1 binding (Fig. 2B, right panel, Z123-Z23). ARP-1 binds readily to the Z23 oligonucleotide, indicating that only half sites 2 and 3 are required for binding; however, ARP-1 binding is abolished by the deletion of the 3′-nucleotide adjacent to the DR1 (Fig. 2B, right panel, ZD5 versus ZVVS). Therefore, the 3′-sequence requirements for the binding of ARP-1 are identical to those seen for RXRα·PPARα.Figure 2:Analysis of PPARα·RXRα binding to oligonucleotides containing different repeated half sites. A, the Z element contains four imperfect repeats of the nuclear receptor binding consensus sequence (AGGTCA) or “half sites” that are indicated by the arrows. Half sites 2 and 3 constitute a direct repeat with a spacing of one nucleotide. The sequences of truncated oligonucleotides used in panel B are shown. Changes from the wild type sequence are denoted in bold and lower case. B, EMSA analysis was performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides that were truncated to assess the contribution of flanking nucleotides to PPARα·RXRα and ARP-1 binding of the Z element. Affinity-purified PPARα/GST (1000 ng), RXRα/MBP (200 ng), and ARP-1/MBP (200 ng) fusion proteins were used in this assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The half site 1 region is required for the function of the Z element and the binding of PPARα·RXRα but is not required for the binding of ARP-1 (Fig. 2B). This region, along with half site 2, constitutes an imperfect palindrome that is not conserved between PPREs. Comparison with other known PPRE sequences reveals that the region 5′ of the DR1, which constitutes half site 1 of the Z element, exhibits a loose consensus (C(A/G)(A/G)A(A/T)CT) (Fig. 3). This consensus does not appear to be similar to the core nuclear receptor binding sequence (AGGTCA) but does resemble the extended consensus binding site for the monomeric nuclear receptors (Rev-ErbAα, NGFI-B, and ROR) that contains an A-T-rich region 5′ of a single AGGTCA motif (24Harding H.P.

Equivalent grouped mutations have been shown to abolish binding of ARP-1 to the apolipoprotein CIIIB element and the CYP4A6 −27 element (6Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J.

Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of half sites 2 and 3 greatly diminished the binding of PPARα·RXRα and ARP-1, confirming the importance of the DR1 motif for binding of these receptors. Mutations that disrupt the nuclear receptor binding motif in half site 1 but retain an A-T-rich motif similar to the monomeric nuclear receptor binding site (Zm1b) did not affect the binding of PPARα·RXRα to the Z element. In contrast, mutations (Zm1c and Zm5) that disrupt the loose consensus in the extended binding site region display diminished binding to PPARα·RXRα (Fig. 4B) but have no significant effect on ARP-1 binding. These results confirm the specific requirement for sequences 5′ of the DR1 in the binding of PPARα·RXRα and demonstrate the requirement for an extended binding site such as that seen for the monomeric receptors.To test the effects of these mutations on transcriptional responses to peroxisome proliferators, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the above mutations in the 5′-flanking regions of the CYP4A6 gene. Cotransfection of mutant CYP4A6 reporter constructs and the expression vector for PPARα revealed that the mutations in half site 3 that severely reduced PPARα·RXRα binding to the Z element also reduced the transcriptional response to peroxisome proliferators (Fig. 5, 880 versus Zm3). This reduction is not as complete as may have been expected from the DNA binding studies, suggesting that the other elements (X and −27) may partially compensate for the loss of function of the Z element. Mutation of the −27 element in the CYP4A6 reporter construct (880m) has little effect on its own (Fig. 5, 880 versus 880m), although previous studies have shown that this mutation abolishes the binding of PPARα·RXRα to this element(6Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The −880m construct was used to analyze the other mutations of the Z element to minimize the effects of the −27 element in this analysis. Using these double mutant CYP4A6 reporter constructs, it is clear that mutations that diminish binding of PPARα·RXRα to the Z element also abolish the response to peroxisome proliferators (Fig. 5, Zm1c-d, Zm2-d, Zm3-d). Mutations that do not affect DNA binding of PPARα·RXRα do not diminish the response to peroxisome proliferators (Fig. 5, Zm1b-d, Zm4-d). Mutation of half sites 2 and 3 (Fig. 5, Zm2-d, Zm3-d) results in a loss of responsiveness to peroxisome proliferators, demonstrating the requirement for the DR1 in the function of the Z element. The Zm1c-d construct, which contains mutations in the extended binding site, also shows no response to peroxisome proliferators. This result, along with the deletion analysis of the CYP4A6 reporter constructs (Fig. 1), demonstrates the requirement of the sequences 5′ of the DR1 for the function of the Z element.Figure 5:Transactivation of mutant CYP4A6 promoter constructs by mPPAR-G. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate the CYP4A6 Z element in the reporter construct pLUCA6-880 to generate pLUCA6-880Zm3 (Zm3). This and the other mutants were also cloned into pLUCA6-880m to generate the respective double mutant clones pLUCA6-880Zm1b-d (Zm1b-d), pLUCA6-880Zm1c-d (Zm1c-d), pLUCA6-880Zm2-d (Zm2-d), pLUCA6-880Zm3-d (Zm3-d), and pLUCA6-880Zm4-d (Zm4-d). These reporter constructs were cotransfected with pCMV-PPARα-G into RK13 cells. After incubation with DNA for 16 h, the cells were washed and then either solvent (ME2SO; no drug) or peroxisome proliferator (Wy-14,643) was added to fresh medium for an additional incubation of 48 h. The bar graphs represent the mean values plus standard deviation obtained from three independent transfections and show the activity normalized to that obtained with pLUCA6-880 in the presence of peroxisome proliferator.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Z element binds RXR homodimers very weakly; this is in contrast to certain other DR1-containing elements, such as the rat cellular retinol binding protein II RXRE(12Mangelsdorf D.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat cellular retinol binding protein II RXRE contains a DR1 that is a perfect repeat of the AGGTCA motif, which binds RXRα homodimers efficiently and confers a response to both all-trans and 9-cis retinoic acid(27Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The natural PPRE elements, such as the Z element, are divergent from the idealized DR1 sequence (Fig. 3). This divergence may reduce the binding of RXRα homodimers, and the extended binding site may stabilize the binding of PPARα·RXRα heterodimers to these divergent sequences.Oligonucleotides containing a perfect consensus DR1 and either a consensus or divergent extended 5′-binding site (DR1P and DR1M, respectively) were assayed for their ability to bind RXRα, PPARα, PPARα·RXRα, and ARP-1 (Fig. 6). These results were compared to those obtained with natural elements that contain imperfect direct repeats. DR1P and DR1M display significant binding to RXRα (Fig. 6A, complexes I and II). The 5′-extended binding site on the DR1P element appears to diminish RXRα binding (Fig. 6B). The binding of RXRα to DR1P and DR1M is about 20-fold greater than that seen with the APOCIIIB and ACOXA elements and over 100-fold greater than that seen with the other elements (Fig. 6B).Figure 6:Analysis of PPARα, RXRα, and ARP-1 binding to DR1 containing elements. A, EMSA analysis was performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides that correspond to DR1 containing elements that have been shown to be regulated by nuclear receptors. Binding assays used crude bacterial lysates containing expressed PPARα (6 μg) or RXRα/MBP(0.5 μg) fusion protein or affinity-purified ARP-1/MBP fusion protein (70 ng). RXRα homodimer complexes are shown (I and II) as are the putative PPARα·RXRα heterodimeric complexes (III) and the ARP-1 monomer (M) and homodimer (D) complexes. B, the sequences of the PPREs used in the above binding assays are shown. Also shown is the number of matches the 5′-region has with the consensus sequence and a summary of the binding results obtained from the phosphorimager analysis. The values shown represent relative binding activities (% oligonucleotide bound) normalized to those obtained with the DR1P oligonucleotide pair. Perfect nuclear receptor binding sites are indicated in bold type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The addition of PPARα and RXRα to DR1P and DR1M results in a complex of greater mobility than that seen with RXRα alone (Fig. 6A, complex III). The binding to DR1M demonstrates that the extended binding site is not required for the binding of PPARα·RXRα to a perfect direct repeat of the consensus nuclear receptor binding motif. The DR1P oligonucleotide binds the PPARα·RXRα more efficiently than DR1M (Fig. 6B), suggesting a modulatory role for the extended half site. A complex of similar mobility is formed with the addition of both PPARα and RXRα to the natural elements. The degree of binding of PPARα·RXRα to the natural elements is relatively similar to that observed for the consensus DR1, except for the APOCIIIB element and the CYP4A6-X and −27 elements (Fig. 6B). The APOCIIIB element has not been shown to function as a PPRE, and the CYP4A6-X and −27 elements are known to be weak PPREs.The addition of ARP-1 to the DR1P and DR1M oligonucleotide pairs results in the formation of a single complex (Fig. 6A) that presumably consists of a homodimer (D) of ARP-1. A complex of similar mobility is seen for the other elements; however, complexes of higher mobility (M) are seen for the APOCIIIB, ACOXA, FABP, and CYP4A6-27 elements. These complexes may consist of monomeric ARP-1 binding to the single consensus half sites seen in these elements. The binding of ARP-1 to the PPREs that contain two divergent half sites (Fig. 6B, Z, BIF, HMG) is greatly reduced compared to the other elements.These results demonstrate that the extended binding site is not required for the binding of PPARα·RXRα to idealized DR1 sequences.

Here we address the determinants of Ape AP endonuclease activity using duplex DNA substrates that contain synthetic analogs of AP sites: tetrahydrofuranyl (F), propanediol (P), ethanediol (E), or 2-(aminobutyl)-1,3-propanediol (Q). The last of these, a branched abasic structure, was a poor substrate for which Ape had kcat > 1000-fold lower than for F. In contrast, the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for E or P of Ape purified from HeLa cells was only 5-8-fold lower than for F. Positioning a phosphorothioate ester immediately 5′ to F inhibited Ape incision activity 20-fold (Rp isomer) or > 10,000-fold (Sp isomer). Although Ape did not have detectable endonuclease activity toward single-stranded substrates or unmodified double-stranded DNA, the enzyme displayed a low level of 3′-exonuclease activity for duplex DNA (<0.03% of its AP endonuclease activity), which was influenced by the reaction conditions. The base positioned opposite F did not dramatically affect the cleavage efficiency of Ape, but an F:F arrangement was cleaved at approximately one-third of the efficiency of F:C. A 3′-mismatch diminished P and E cleavage only slightly and F not at all. A 5′-mismatch reduced the Ape cleavage rate 4-10-fold for F and ~100-fold for P and E.

Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar; 33Wallace S.S. Environ. Mol.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that ~10,000 AP sites are generated per mammalian cell/day by purine-glycosyl bond hydrolysis under normal physiological conditions (Lindahl and Nyberg, 1972); other sources of AP sites add to this burden. Abasic sites are potentially lethal and mutagenic (Loeb and Preston, 1986). To defend against these consequences, cells possess “class II” (hydrolytic) AP endonucleases that cleave on the 5′-side of AP sites to produce 3′-OH groups and 5′-deoxyribose 5-phosphate residues (Demple and Harrison, 1994). Release of the 5′-abasic residue and DNA repair synthesis and ligation complete the repair process (Demple and Harrison, 1994). apurinic/apyrimidinic tetrahydrofuranyl propanediol ethanediol 2-(aminobutyl)-1,3-propanediol the phosphorothioate diastereomers base pair(s). A characteristic form of oxidative DNA damage is free radical-initiated breaks bearing 3′-phosphates or 3′-phosphoglycolate esters (7Giloni L. Takeshita M. Johnson F. Iden C. Grollman A.P. J. Biol.

These oxidative damages, along with the 3′-deoxyribose products of DNA glycosylase-associated “class I” AP endonuclease (β-lyase) activities (Demple and Harrison, 1994), are refractory to DNA polymerases. The “class II” AP endonucleases also have 3′-repair diesterase activity specific for this collection of lesions (Demple and Harrison, 1994). Two families of “class II” AP endonuclease/3′-repair diesterase enzymes have been identified. Endonuclease IV of Escherichia coli and Apn1 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are homologous nucleases (19Popoff S.C. Spira A.I. Johnson A.W. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) that perform demonstrable roles in correcting oxidative or alkylation damages in vivo (2Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitzer S.F. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 20Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Gralla E.B. Demple B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking Apn1 display a substantially increased spontaneous mutation rate (Ramotar et al., 1991; 11Kunz B.A. Henson E.S. Roche H. Ramotar D. Nunoshiba T. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8165-8169Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which underscores the role of AP endonucleases in preventing mutagenesis due to DNA damage caused by by-products of normal metabolism. The second family of AP endonuclease/3′-repair diesterases includes E. coli exonuclease III and the predominant human AP endonuclease called Ape protein ((5Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar); also called Hap1 (21Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), Apex (27Seki S. Hatsushika M. Watanabe S. Akiyama K. Nagao K. Tsutsui K. Biochimi. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or Ref1 (37Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan T.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar)). Exonuclease III has a clear in vivo repair function in E. coli (Demple et al., 1986; Cunningham et al., 1986). Expression of the human AP endonuclease in E. coli can substitute for exonuclease III in repair of alkylation-induced AP sites, but evidently not efficiently for repair of oxidative damage (Demple et al., 1991; 22Robson C.N. Milne A.M. Pappin D.J.C. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; Seki et al., 1992). This pattern is consistent with the in vitro properties of Ape, which has a relatively low 3′-repair activity (present at ~1/200 of its AP endonuclease activity; Chen et al., 1991). Thus, other human enzymes may be involved in removal of 3′ damages (Chen et al., 1991; 35Winters T.A. Weinfeld M. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ape displays a powerful hydrolytic AP endonuclease activity about 10-fold greater than found for exonuclease III (10Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Chen et al., 1991). A detailed understanding of the requirements of the Ape enzyme for substrate recognition and cleavage is clearly desirable. We have approached this goal by determining the activity of purified human AP endonuclease on a variety of synthetic oligonucleotide substrates containing AP site analogs. The oligonucleotides employed in these studies were synthesized as described previously (31Takeuchi M. Lillis R. Demple B. Takeshita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21907-21914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for the oligonucleotide containing 2-(aminobutyl)-1,3-propanediol residue (Q), which was purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Emeryville, CA). Structures of abasic sites are shown in Fig. 1, and the sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotides are displayed in. Bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) and [3H]dTTP (specific activity, 70-90 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Exonuclease III was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNase I was obtained from Sigma. Human Ape protein was purified from HeLa S3 cell extracts essentially as described by Chen et al.(1991), except that the Affi-Gel blue step was omitted. Ape enzyme activity was detected during the purification by monitoring the release of radiolabeled 3′-phosphoglycolaldehyde residues from a synthetic DNA substrate (Chen et al., 1991). The purified Ape protein used here had an AP endonuclease activity of 5.3 × 105 units/mg of protein, determined using a synthetic substrate (12Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme cleaves or releases 1 pmol of damaged sites/min under standard conditions (13Levin J.D. Shapiro R. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22893-22898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Chen et al., 1991). Two plasmids were constructed to express Ape protein for purification from E. coli. pDW204 was generated by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment containing the Ape coding region into the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of the pKEN2 vector (a gift from Dr. G. L. Verdine). Its expression in lacIq1 strains is inducible by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside under the control of a tac promoter. pGEX-Ape (graciously provided by Drs. Mark R. Kelley and James P. Carney) was constructed by inserting the Ape coding sequence into a BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) behind the tac promoter and in frame with the glutathione S-transferase gene. Intact Ape protein was prepared as follows. Overnight cultures of DW5281 (Δxth nfo-1::kan derivative of strain XA90) containing pDW204 were diluted 1:100 into LB broth and grown for 2 h at 37°C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 4 h of shaking at 37°C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 125 mM KCl, 10% glycerol. The cells were lysed by agitation with glass beads in a Mini-Bead-Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the soluble material was applied to a column of phosphocellulose (Whatman P-11) equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 125 mM KCl, 10% glycerol. The column was washed with several column volumes of equilibration buffer, and the bound material was then eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (125-600 mM). Fractions containing full-length Ape protein (determined by immunoblotting; Demple et al.(1991)) were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep 30 apparatus (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The phosphocellulose pool was further fractionated on an AcA54 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol. Fractions were analyzed for AP endonuclease activity and protein concentration (determined by Coomassie Blue staining), and the active fractions were pooled to yield “recombinant Ape.” For purification of glutathione S-transferase-Ape fusion protein, BL21 cells containing pGEX-Ape construct were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as described for DW5281/pDW204. After collection and resuspension, cells were lysed by sonication, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. The column was washed with equilibration buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, Ape-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma), and the active fractions were pooled. To release Ape from the hybrid protein, samples were incubated with CaCl2 (6 mM final concentration) and Factor Xa (0.5 units; Pierce, Rockford, IL), and the cleavage was performed overnight at 4°C. The “clipped” protein was applied to a small phosphocellulose column as described above and eluted with buffer containing 400 mM KCl. Oligonucleotides containing abasic sites were 5′-end-labeled by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA strand to be labeled was always in molar excess over the ATP. The kinase was heat-inactivated by incubation at 90°C for 2 min; the reaction was placed immediately on ice, and an equimolar amount of the complementary oligonucleotide was added. This mixture was heated at 56°C for 10 min, and the two DNA strands were annealed, first at room temperature for 1 h and then at 4°C overnight. Reactions to measure incision activity of Ape were performed in 10 μl of 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100 (Chen et al., 1991) containing the indicated amounts of double-stranded DNA substrate. After incubation at 37°C with various amounts of Ape protein for the indicated times, the reactions were stopped by placing them on ice and immediately adding 5 μl of formamide solution (Sambrook et al., 1989). The samples were then heated at 65°C for 5 min, and 3-μl aliquots were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels run at 20 V/cm. After electrophoresis, the gels were autoradiographed to locate the labeled substrate and product oligodeoxynucleotides. The conversion of substrate to product was calculated by excising the substrate and product bands, counting the radioactivity in the gel slices in a Beckman LS 1801 scintillation counter, and calculating fractional conversion (fractional conversion = cpm in product/(cpm in product + cpm in substrate)). Enzymatic reactions utilizing endonuclease IV (AP endonuclease activity of 80,000 units/mg; Levin et al.(1988)) or exonuclease III (22,000 units/mg; Life Technologies, Inc.) with MgCl2 were performed as described by Takeuchi et al.(1994). To specifically measure exonuclease activity of Ape, two methods were employed. For the first method, the procedure described by Seki et al.(1991), using 3′-end-labeled copolymers, was implemented. These experiments were performed with various Ape protein preparations. In the second method, poly(dA-dT) duplex DNA containing a 32P-radiolabeled dUMP approximately every 600 nucleotides (Levin et al., 1991) was treated with DNase I (see figure legends for concentration) for 2 min at room temperature in Ape AP endonuclease buffer (see “Enzymatic Reactions” of this section). DNase I was subsequently inactivated by incubating for 5 min at 65°C, and the reaction was placed on ice. Approximately 1 pmol of the resulting DNA substrate was then incubated with recombinant Ape produced in bacteria or exonuclease III for 30 min at 37°C. The DNA polymer was precipitated on ice for 10 min by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.65 M. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the free radiolabeled nucleotides in the acid-soluble supernatant were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitation of Ape protein with rabbit antiserum and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) was performed essentially as described by Chen et al.(1991), except that the primary and secondary incubations were shortened to 2 and 1 h, respectively. Oligonucleotides containing synthetic AP sites (ethanediol (E), propanediol (P), or furanyl (F) moieties) were 5′-end-labeled and annealed to the unlabeled complementary strand with deoxycytosine positioned opposite the abasic site (sequences 1, 2, or 3 annealed to sequence 7; see). Ape incision activity on the resulting labeled 18-bp, double-stranded DNA substrates was estimated by calculating the percent conversion of substrate (18 bp) to product (9 bp) after separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Time course experiments revealed that Ape catalyzed incision of the three substrates at nearly equal rates (Fig. 2; see below). The kinetic parameters for these reactions were determined by varying substrate concentrations. These studies revealed a <2.5-fold variation in the turnover number (kcat), while the specificity constants (kcat/Km) for these abasic sites varied only ~8-fold (F > P > E), primarily due to >10-fold range for apparent Km (Table I). None of these sites was cleaved in single-stranded DNA, and a 10-molar excess of unlabeled AP site containing single-stranded DNA did not alter Ape incision rates for duplex DNA substrates (data not shown).Table I:List of oligodeoxynucleotides Open table in a new tab We also explored the action of Ape on a commercially available oligonucleotide substrate containing a branched abasic site, a 2-(aminobutyl)-1,3-propanediol residue (Q, sequence 4 in; Fig. 1). In order to detect Ape-mediated incision at Q, a concentration of enzyme was required that was >1000-fold higher than needed for F (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11). Similarly, concentrations of E. coli exonuclease III that converted nearly all of the F-containing substrate to product demonstrated very little endonucleolytic activity on Q, although some exonuclease activity was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). A 10-fold higher amount of exonuclease III did not dramatically increase the amount of product generated following incubation with Q (Fig. 3, lane 7), but incision of Q by E. coli endonuclease IV occurred at a rate only ~8-fold slower than for F (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). In previous studies of Ape protein isolated from HeLa cells, we were unable to detect significant 3′-exonuclease activity using an end-labeled, blunt-ended duplex DNA substrate (Chen et al., 1991). However, it seemed possible that the exonuclease activity reported for this protein by others (Seki et al., 1991, 1992, 28Seki S. Takata A. Nakamura T. Akiyama K. Watanabe S. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) could depend on the substrate or reaction conditions. We therefore adopted the approach of Seki et al.(1991) and investigated exonuclease activity of Ape purified from HeLa cells and of recombinant protein isolated by two different procedures from E. coli, either as intact Ape or as the Ape segment liberated from a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (see “Experimental Procedures”). These experiments revealed a low but consistent amount of exonuclease activity for all three forms of Ape (I). This activity depended on the assay buffer, and was observed at levels 1.5-7-fold higher in the reaction buffer of Seki et al. (1991) than in our standard conditions. The possibility that the exonuclease detected in our experiments might be due to a contaminant was addressed in immunological studies. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum generated against highly purified Ape from HeLa cells (Chen et al., 1991) immunoprecipitated the exonuclease activity associated with both HeLa-derived Ape protein and recombinant Ape isolated from E. coli (Fig. 4A). It is very unlikely that cross-reacting material other than Ape protein would be present in both of these preparations. Thus, the weak 3′-exonuclease is probably an activity of Ape itself. An alternative approach with a different substrate revealed no significant exonuclease activity for recombinant Ape protein under our standard reaction conditions (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the exonuclease constituting a minor activity of Ape, the expected sizes of substrate and product were observed in assays of Ape with oligonucleotide substrates (see Fig. 2, 3, and 6). Since the phosphodiester cleaved by Ape is positioned immediately 5′ to the abasic site (Chen et al., 1991), we examined the effects on Ape activity of substituting this phosphate with a phosphorothioate residue (sequences 5 and 6 in; Fig. 1). Ape actively incised a duplex with an Rp phosphorothioate at a rate of approximately one-twentieth of that seen for an F substrate with a conventional phosphodiester (Fig. 5). Cleavage of the corresponding Sp isomer was not detected (Fig. 5); the calculated cleavage rate of Ape for the Sp isomer was <10-4 of that found for F. Inhibition by 5′-phosphorothioates is consistent with this site as the target for hydrolysis by Ape. The overall requirements of Ape for duplex DNA structure around the cleavage target site were explored using a series of substrates containing different bases in the opposing strand (sequences 12-18 in) or base mismatches located in different positions (sequences 1-3 and 8-11 in), or by varying the position of the abasic site along the duplex. The identity of the base opposite an F residue did not significantly influence the rate of cleavage by Ape (Table II). However, a substrate containing a F:F pair was incised at only approximately one-third of the rate of substrates with a normal base in the opposite strand (Table III). We have not determined to what extent this reduction is due to cleavage of the unlabeled strand by Ape before the enzyme interacts with the labeled strand. Preliminary experiments2( 2D. M. Wilson III and B. Demple, unpublished data. )indicate that such cleavage might be inhibitory.Table II:Kinetic parameters of Ape for duplex DNA substrates containing synthetic AP sites Open table in a new tab Table III:Exonuclease activities of native and recombinant Ape proteins Open table in a new tab A mismatch placed immediately 5′ to an F moiety reduced the rate of Ape cleavage by ~4-fold compared with F in a fully base-paired context (Table IV). An adjacent 5′-mismatch had an even more pronounced effect on the E or P sites, reducing the Ape incision activity ~100-fold (Table V). In contrast, a base mismatch on the 3′-side had only marginal effects on the cleavage rate for any of the substrates. Mismatches on both the 5′- and the 3′-sides had an even greater inhibitory effect on the Ape endonuclease activity than a 5′-mismatch alone, with the relative effect of the dual mismatch particularly pronounced in the case of the F moiety (Table V). Thus, Ape seems to have a stronger requirement for duplex DNA structure 5′ to the abasic site than it does for the 3′-side.Table IV:Effect of the base positioned opposite F on endonuclease activity Open table in a new tab Table V:Effects of flanking mismatches on endonuclease activity Open table in a new tab Activity of Ape was also analyzed using a series of 18-bp duplex substrates with F placed at 1-17 bases from the 5′ terminus. Incision by Ape was detected only when F was flanked by at least 4 base pairs 5′ and 3 base pairs 3′ to the lesion (Fig. 6). Cleavage by Ape on the substrate with F at position 15 (with 3 base pairs on the 3′-side) was significantly diminished compared with the substrate with F at position 14 (Fig. 6). Analysis of these reactions using a DNA sequencing gel (Sambrook et al., 1989) confirmed that little, if any, cleavage was occurring with F at positions 1-4 or 16 and 17 (data not shown). The mode of substrate recognition by AP endonucleases has been the subject of discussion for nearly 2 decades, initially in an effort to account for the apparently diverse activities of bacterial enzymes such as E. coli exonuclease III (34Weiss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1896-1901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their limited exonuclease activity against undamaged DNA, the eukaryotic class II AP endonucleases hydrolyze a broad array of substrates ranging from intact AP sites to 3′-terminal nucleotide fragments to 3′-phosphates (Demple and Harrison, 1994). The recognition mechanism(s) of this class of enzymes must, therefore, accommodate different types of DNA damage, seemingly in all sequence contexts, while ignoring the structural fluctuations of normal DNA. The studies presented here represent the first systematic effort to define key elements of substrate recognition and incision by Ape, the main AP endonuclease of human cells. The substrate profile for Ape was similar to that found for E. coli exonuclease III in the presence of Ca2+ (Takeuchi et al., 1994). The relatively robust activity of these enzymes against E (ethanediol derivative) contrasts with the profile for E. coli endonuclease IV, for which E is a poor substrate (30Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Takeuchi et al. 1994). In a more limited study, the bovine AP endonuclease homologous to exonuclease III (Robson et al., 1991) acted relatively efficiently on E (25Sanderson B.J.S. Chang C.-N. Grollman A.P. Henner W.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The opposite preference obtains for the branched Q substrate, which is utilized poorly by Ape and exonuclease III (Ca2+) but effectively by endonuclease IV. These preferences may be summarized as follows: the Ape/exonuclease III class prefers abasic sites without branches at carbon 4 (equivalent to carbon 2 in Q; Fig. 1), but will tolerate distortions of phosphodiester spacing implicit in the structure of E. A detailed assessment of the structural requirements for Ape acting on abasic sites is warranted, since different types of abasic sites may be formed under different circumstances. In addition to AP sites formed by acid- or glycosylase-catalyzed base hydrolysis (15Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar; Wallace, 1988; Demple and Harrison, 1994), free radical agents such as x-rays (32von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor and Francis, London1987Google Scholar) or bleomycin (29Steighner R.J. Povirk L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8350-8354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) form modified abasic sites containing oxidized forms of deoxyribose. Enzymes such as the Ape protein may have to cope with these lesions as the products of metabolic and environmental mutagens. Indeed, recent work has shown that exonuclease III and endonuclease IV of E. coli, which represent the two families of “class II” AP endonucleases (Demple and Harrison 1994), distinguish strongly between abasic sites oxidized at the 1 or the 4 position (Häring et al., 1994). It remains to be determined how Ape protein acts on these modified sites. The duplex DNA context is of importance for Ape, as it is for exonuclease III (Takeuchi et al., 1994). As suggested by Weiss(1976), the double-helical structure on the 5′-side of the abasic site is much more important than that on the 3′-side. Thus, Ape protein requires at least four base pairs 5′ to the lesion, but no more than three base pairs on the 3′-side. Ape and exonuclease III may be able to cleave duplex substrates as short as eight base pairs, although neither enzyme attacks abasic sites in single-stranded DNA. Consistent with the evident requirement that AP endonucleases act on damages produced anywhere in the genome, the nature of the nucleotide opposite the abasic site is essentially irrelevant. An exception was the case where F was opposed by another F (abasic) site. Although we have not directly addressed the possibility that this poor activity is due to prior cleavage of the unlabeled DNA strand, the fact that the extent of substrate cleavage in these assays was always ≤20% argues against this interpretation. The poor activity of Ape on such a bistranded substrate may underlie the biological effectiveness of antitumor drugs such as bleomycin, which generate bistranded lesions in abundance (Steighner and Povirk, 1990). One key point addressed here was the 3′-exonuclease activity reported for mammalian AP endonucleases (Seki et al., 1991, 1992, 1993). Several other groups (18Nes I.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Kane and Linn, 1981; Sanderson et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1991; 36Winters T.A. Henner W.D. Russell P.S. McCullough A. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) failed to detect such an activity, but employed different substrates and different reaction conditions. We made an effort here to reproduce the assay of Seki et al.(1991) and were able to detect a very low level of exonuclease activity that was stimulated when using their conditions. This activity was sensitive to the nature of the reaction buffer and was more pronounced under conditions of high osmolarity (0.25 M sucrose). It also appears that the detailed nature of the duplex DNA substrate affects this activity. Since the exonuclease was detected both for native Ape purified from HeLa cells and for recombinant protein isolated by two different procedures from bacteria, it seems unlikely to have arisen from a contaminant common to all these situations; this conclusion was bolstered by immunological experiments. The very weak intrinsic exonuclease of Ape (4 orders of magnitude lower than the AP endonuclease) may instead reflect the homology of this protein to more potent exonucleases from E. coli and Drosophila (24Sander M. Carter M. Huang S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biological relevance of such a weak activity is not obvious, it could arise either from a small amount of modified (truncated?) Ape protein or from some minor component of the heterogeneous poly(dA-dT) substrate. A more puissant activity toward a more specialized DNA structure could be significant biologically. The powerful effects of a 5′-phosphorothioate on cleavage by the Ape protein merit comment. The simplest interpretation of this result is that this phosphate is attacked by the enzyme during cleavage (Demple and Harrison, 1994). The inhibitory effect of such a substitution is consistent with the homology between Ape protein and exonuclease III (6Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More noteworthy is the stereospecific effect of the Sp isomer, which might suggest a stereospecific attack by Ape. Structural studies of these proteins are required to address this and other fundamental issues. The recent report (17Mol C.D. Kuo C.-F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) of a crystal structure for exonuclease III suggests that such information may soon be at hand. Dashes represent the identical sequence as for oligonucleotide 1 (sequences 2-11), oligonucleotide 12 (sequences 13 and 14), or oligonucleotide 14 (sequences 15-18). Sequences for oligonucleotides 5 and 6 are identical to the sequence 1, except for the centrally located 5′-phosphorothioate F analogs, denoted Rps and Sps. Underlined letters indicate either the AP site analog or the base positioned opposite the AP site. Reactions containing 8-400 nM duplex DNA substrate were performed under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) for 5 min at 37°C. Ape (35,500 Da) was present at a final concentration of 100 pg/ml (2.8 pM). Values of Km and kcat were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. 3′-Exonuclease activity was determined using a 3′-[3H]dTMP-labeled poly (dA-dT) substrate prepared as described by Seki et al. (1991) but using either the reaction buffer of Chen et al. (1991) as standard conditions or that of Seki et al. (1991) as modified conditions. AP endonuclease activity was assayed according to Levin and Demple (1990) as modified by Chen et al. (1991). The isolation of recombinant Ape proteins is described under “Experimental Procedures.” AP endo, AP endonuclease activity; 3′-exo, 3′-exonuclease activity. Enzymatic activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” with Ape present at final concentrations of 0.1 and 1 ng/ml and with Ape activity within the linear range.

https://openalex.org/W1943923258,"Many physiological and pathological processes involve tissue remodeling due in part to degradation of extracellular matrix. Several factors limit current approaches used for detection of matrix-degrading enzymes in tissues. Matrix metallopro- teinases (MMPs), enzymes specialized in catabolism of extracellular matrix constituents, require processing from inactive zymogen precursors to gain enzymatic function. Presently available antibodies do not distinguish between precursor and proteolytically processed forms of MMPs. Also, ubiquitous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) could prevent matrix degradation by MMPs even if the enzymes were in an active form. For these reasons immunocy- tochemistry does not provide information regarding the functional state of these enzymes. Biochemical studies of tissue extracts preclude localization and entail the possibility of artifactual activation of the enzymes consequent to tissue disruption. To obviate these problems, we have adapted substrate zymography to frozen tissue sections to assess net proteolytic activity in situ. We report here the details and the validation of this methodology. Initial experiments defined casein fluorescently labeled with resorufin as a useful substrate for detecting stromelysin, and fluo- resceinated gelatin or autoradiographic emulsion as suitable for detecting gelatinolytic activity by this approach. Either IIMP-1 or the Zn chelator 1, 10- phenanthroline reduced the zymographic activity in cryosections of atheroma from humans or rabbits. Inhibitors of serine proteases did not reduce the extent of substrate lysis substantially. In situ zymography preserves the fine morphological details of the tissue and can complement the study of enzyme ex-pression by other microscopic techniques, such as immunocytochemistry. This approach may prove generally applicable for the detection of protease activity in tissue sections permitting exploration of the roles of these enzymes in pathobiology.—Galis, Z. S., Sukhova, G.

This is the first description of the cloning of a glial cell inward rectifier potassium channel, which may be responsible for K+ buffering action of glial cells in the brain. Neuronal excitation causes an increase of extracellular potassium ions (K+) at synaptic sites in the central nervous system, which if uncorrected would result in the loss of synaptic transmission by depolarizing the membrane. Glial cells, which surround neuronal cells, are supposed to transport the accumulated K+ from proximal to distal portions of the cells. This regulatory function of glial cells was first proposed as a spatial buffering mechanism of K+ for astrocytes in the optic nerves (Orkand et al., 1966Orkand R.K. Nicholls J.G. Kuffler S.W. J. Neurophysiol. 1966; 29: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and also termed the siphoning mechanism of K+ for Müller cells of the retina (Newman et al., 1984Newman E.A. Frambach D.A. Odette L.L. Science. 1984; 225: 1174-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In this hypothesis, K+ that accumulates locally due to neural excitation would enter glial cells wherever the local reversal potential for K+ is more positive than the resting potential of the glial cell. The elevated intracellular K+ would then be rapidly shunted by current flow from a proximal to a more distal region of the cell. At the distal region of glial cells or endfeet of Müller cells, the resting potential would be more positive than the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK),1( 1The abbreviations used are: EKequilibrium potential for K+ROMKinwardly rectifying ATP-regulated potassium channel from the outer medulla of rat kidneyIRKinward rectifier potassium channelGIRKG protein-activated muscarinic potassium channelKATPATP-sensitive potassium channelKABinward rectifying K+ channel with an ATP-binding domainPCRpolymerase chain reaction[K+]external potassium ion concentrationSsiemen(s)Poopen probabilityτtime constant.) 1The abbreviations used are: EKequilibrium potential for K+ROMKinwardly rectifying ATP-regulated potassium channel from the outer medulla of rat kidneyIRKinward rectifier potassium channelGIRKG protein-activated muscarinic potassium channelKATPATP-sensitive potassium channelKABinward rectifying K+ channel with an ATP-binding domainPCRpolymerase chain reaction[K+]external potassium ion concentrationSsiemen(s)Poopen probabilityτtime constant. which allows K+ to come out to extracellular fluid. Along with K+, chloride ions (Cl−) and water will also move passively across glial cells. This K+ movement is considered to occur through inward rectifier potassium channels in glial cell membranes.

The sequences of the 5′(N1) and 3′ primers(N3) were derived from ROMK1 (Ho et al., 1993Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) and are as follows (N represents A/G/C/T): N1 (5′-CA(A/G) GTN ACN AT(A/C/T) GGN TA(C/T) GG-3′, the sequence corresponding to nucleotides 415-434) and N3 (5′-AA NAC NAC NA(G/T) (T/C)TC (A/G)AA (A/G)TC-3′, nucleotides 868-887), respectively. PCR amplification was performed according to the following schedule: five cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 46°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min, followed by 26 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel and excised for subsequent subcloning and sequence determination. Through this procedure, we identified a new cDNA clone, pA. Using this as a probe, 1.5 × 105 phage clones of a rat forebrain cDNA library (Moriyoshi et al., 1991Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar) were hybridized for the isolation of full-sized cDNAs. Thirty independent clones were isolated and selected by the digestion of internal HindIII sites. A representative clone, pA11, was analyzed using an oocyte expression system as described below. Both strands of the cDNA sequences were determined by the chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52244) Google Scholar). pA11s6, which is a deleted form of pA11 (approximately 220 base pairs of the 5′-non-coding region were deleted from pA11), was transcribed in vitro as described previously (Takahashi et al., 1994Takahashi N. Morishige K. Jahangir A. Yamada M. Findlay I. Koyama H. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23274-23279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcript was dissolved in sterile water and injected (50 nl of a 1 μg/μl solution) into manually defolliculated oocytes. After injection, oocytes were incubated in a modified Barths' solution at 18°C, and electrophysiological studies were undertaken 48-96 h later. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were carried out with a commercially available amplifier (Turbo Clamp TEC 01C, Tamm, Germany) with microelectrodes, which, when filled with 3 M KCl, had resistances of ~0.5-1.5 megohms. Oocytes were bathed in a solution, which contained 90 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH), and 150 μM niflumic acid to block the endogenous chloride current. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at different holding potentials, and voltage steps of 1.5 s duration were applied to the cells in 10-mV increments every 5 s. Single-channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached patch configuration using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List, Darmstadt, Germany). Both pipette and bath solutions contained 140 mM KCl, 1.4 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH). Electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (20-22°C). Data were stored on video tapes using a PCM converter system (VR-10, Instrutech Corp., New York, NY). For analysis, the data were reproduced, low pass-filtered at 600 Hz (−3 dB) by an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency devices, Haverhill, MA), sampled at 3 kHz and analyzed off-line on a computer (Macintosh Quadra 700, Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, CA) with a standard program (EP Analisis, Human Intelligence Inc., Rochester, MN). The same filter as Koyama et al., 1994Koyama H. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Zanelli J.S. Fass D.N. Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar was used for hybridization. Hybridization using a random primer-labeled probe was performed with a SacI-digested fragment (0.6 kilobase) of KAB-2 in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.08% Ficoll, 0.08% polyvinylpyrolidone, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% NaH2PO4, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, at 42°C for 17 h. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was used as a control to verify that equivalent amounts of mRNA had been transferred. Blots were washed at moderate stringency (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 55°C for 15 min) and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) with an intensifying screen at −70°C. Seven male Wistar rats weighing 200 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and then decapitated. Brains were dissected, frozen quickly in powdered dry ice, and then stored at −80°C. Sections (20 μm) were cut on a cryostat and thaw mounted on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated slides. The BstXI-SacI fragment (nucleotide positions 703-1070) of KAB-2 cDNA was used as a template. 35S-Labeled antisense and sense riboprobe were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (for antisense probe) or T3 RNA polymerase (for sense probe) in the presence of [35S]UTP. Hybridization and washing conditions were used as described previously (Yoshimura et al., 1993Yoshimura R. Kiyama H. Kimura T. Araki T. Maeno H. Tanizawa O. Tohyama M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) except that treatment of sections by proteinase K was carried out for 30 s. For film autoradiography, slides were exposed to Fuji RX film (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 1 week. For emulsion autoradiography, slides were dipped in an emulsion (K5 type, Ilford Scientific Product, Mobberley, Cheshire, United Kingdom) and then exposed for 2-4 weeks. A number of cDNAs of potassium channels with two transmembrane segments have been cloned recently, and the size of this family is increasing rapidly (Ho et al., 1993Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J.

We synthesized sets of degenerate primers corresponding to the conserved amino acid sequences in the known members of this family and used them to amplify cDNA templated by rat brain mRNA. Of a total of 30 PCR clones analyzed, one novel clone was isolated, and its full-length cDNA was identified by screening the rat brain cDNA library.

A potential N-glycosylation site was seen at Asn in the predicted extracellular domain of the M1-H5 linker, a feature consistent with ROMK1 and GIRK1. A Walker type-A motif (GX4GKX7(I/V)) representing a phosphate-binding loop and a single putative ATP-binding site (Walker et al., 1982Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar; Saraste et al., 1990Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) occurred at the position corresponding to that of ROMK1 described by Ho et al., 1993Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar. Furthermore, KAB-2 also contained potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (Pearson and Kemp, 1991Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The sequence of KAB-2 is compared with those of ROMK1, IRK1, and GIRK1 in Fig. 1B. The deduced amino acid sequence of KAB-2 showed 53, 43, and 43% identity with those of ROMK1, IRK1, and GIRK1, respectively. In the pore-forming region (H5), the amino acid sequence of KAB-2 was 88% identical to those of ROMK1 and IRK1, and 65% identical to that of GIRK1. These homology data indicate that this clone is more closely related to ROMK1 than the other potassium channels with two membrane-spanning segments. Fig. 2 illustrates the results obtained from Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA derived from a KAB-2 clone. In a bathing solution containing 90 mM K+ ([K+]o) (top traces in Fig. 2, A, C, and E), hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 mV revealed rapid activation (<10 ms) of large inward currents. The effect of [K+]o on the KAB-2 current is depicted in Fig. 2(A and B). As [K+]o was lowered from 90 mM to 45, 20, and 10 mM, the slope conductance of KAB-2 current decreased from 17 μS to 13, 10, and 6 μS, respectively. The reversal potential was in good agreement with EK predicted from the Nernst equation at the different [K+]o. Outward currents at potentials positive to EK were considerably less than those predicted by a linear current-voltage relationship. Thus, KAB-2 current shares this property of the classical type of inward rectifier potassium channels (Sakmann and Trube, 1984Sakmann B. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1984; 347: 659-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar; Kurachi, 1985Kurachi Y. J.

External Ba2+ clearly induced a time- and voltage-dependent block, in a concentration-dependent manner (3-30 μM), with a comparatively small effect upon the instantaneous current, but a marked influence upon the steady-state current (Fig. 2, C and D). These concentrations of Ba2+ slightly reduced the outward currents recorded by voltage steps to positive membrane potentials. When compared to Ba2+, Cs+ exhibited less of a time-dependent effect upon the KAB-2 current; nevertheless, it showed a clear voltage dependence of the block in a concentration-dependent manner (30-300 μM) (Fig. 2, E and F). Single-channel currents flowing through KAB-2 were recorded in cell-attached configuration using oocytes that were injected with KAB-2 cRNA (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, Xenopus oocytes injected with KAB-2 cRNA expressed channel currents that exhibited two distinct conducting states as described below (Fig. 3, A and B). In both cases, currents that passed through these channels were observed much more prominently in the inward direction than in the outward direction and, thus, showed a strong inwardly rectifying property (Fig. 3A). The mean slope conductance of inward current flowing through the high conducting-state channel (Fig. 3A, a and c) was 36 ± 4 pS (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and that of the low conducting-state channel (Fig. 3A, b and d) was 21 ± 2 pS (mean ± S.D., n = 4). For convenience in the following description, we will refer to these as the “36-pS” and the “21-pS” channels. In individual oocytes, either of the two conducting-state channels was usually expressed, but sometimes both conducting-state channels were detected in a single patch (Fig. 3B). We did not observe any smooth transitions between the 36-pS and 21-pS channels without overlapping of the two. Therefore, the 21-pS channel is unlikely to be a sublevel of the 36-pS channel. We examined the effects of intracellular ATP on channels in inside-out patches (Fig. 3C). The channel activity decreased spontaneously after patch excision. When 3 mM Mg-ATP was added to the internal solution, the channel activity resumed. This result demonstrates that intracellular Mg-ATP is required to sustain KAB-2 channel activity, which is consistent with the presence of a Walker-A motif on this clone. The steady-state open probability (Po) of KAB-2 was estimated from amplitude histograms constructed from 3-min continuous recordings at potentials between −40 and −100 mV (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4A (a) shows examples of the amplitude histogram of 36-pS channels at −100 and −60 mV. The steady-state Po of the channel was calculated as the ratio of the area under the open peak to the total area of the histogram. Steady-state Po values of the 36-pS and 21-pS channels decreased slightly as the membrane was hyperpolarized from −40 to −100 mV (Fig. 4A, b). The gating kinetics of the current fluctuations through single channels of KAB-2 were analyzed using current records of patches containing one channel (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4B (a) shows an example of the frequency histograms of the open and closed times of a 21-pS channel recorded at −80 mV. The frequency histogram of open time could be fitted by a single exponential at potentials from −40 to −100 mV (upper graphs in Fig. 4B, b; 36-pS (left) and 21-pS (right) channels). The time constants (τo) from both channels for the open time histogram showed little voltage dependence at potentials between −60 and −100 mV. τo of the 36-pS channel was constant at ~100 ms, and that of the 21-pS channel varied from 100 to 200 ms. As the membrane was depolarized to potentials positive to −40 mV, channel flickerings during bursts increased. This is probably due to the intrinsic activation gating of these inward-rectifying K+ channels (Kurachi, 1985Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 1985; 366: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which resulted in the decrease of channel Po at potentials > −30 mV (data not shown). The activation gating flickerings of these channels, however, appeared at different potentials from channel to channel. It appeared at potentials > −20 mV in the case of Fig. 3A (a) and at > +20 mV in the case of Fig. 3A (b). On the other hand, the histogram of the closed time was fitted by a sum of two exponentials at potentials between −40 and −100 mV (lower graphs in Fig. 4B (b); 36-pS (left) and 21-pS (right) channels). Both time constants of the slow components (τcs, open symbols) increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized from −40 to −100 mV, whereas those of the fast components (τef, filled symbols) remained essentially constant at these potentials. The KAB-2 mRNA size and distribution were examined by Northern blot hybridization. A 5.5-kilobase mRNA was detected strongly both in forebrain and cerebellum and less in kidney, but not in heart or skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). Further distribution of the KAB-2 mRNA in the brain was examined in detail with the in situ hybridization technique. KAB-2 mRNA was expressed in a variety of regions throughout the brain. White matter of the cerebellum, sensory root of trigeminal ganglion, middle cerebellar peduncle, and corpus callosum contained high amounts of KAB-2 mRNA, suggesting KAB-2 mRNA exists in oligodendrocytes (Fig. 6). A dense cluster of silver grains originated at the Purkinje cell layer and extended out into the molecular layer (Fig. 6, E and F). Examination of this region using high power bright-field microscopy confirmed that Purkinje cells themselves were unlabeled by KAB-2 cRNA probe (data not shown). Silver grains were clustered over small cells surrounding the Purkinje cells. The position of these labeled cells suggests that they are Bergmann glia. Moderate level of KAB-2 mRNA positive signals were also seen in other brain regions such as hippocampus (CA1-3 and dentate gyrus), thalamus, inferior colliculus, motor trigeminal nucleus, superior olive, and facial nucleus (Fig. 6, B and C). Clear accumulation of the silver grain on these neurons was not found under microscopic observation, suggesting that the signals may be derived from glial cells. These results suggest that KAB-2 mRNA is expressed selectively in glial cells of the central nervous system. Several independent cDNA clones of inwardly rectifying potassium channels have been currently identified as two membrane-spanning segment type potassium channels (Ho et al., 1993Ho K. Nichols C.G.

Nature. 1994; 370: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel cDNA clone, KAB-2, which includes a Walker type-A motif occurring at the corresponding position in the ROMK1 sequence (Ho et al., 1993Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). As judged from its primary structure, the protein described here encoded a novel two membrane-spanning segment type potassium channel. The amino acid comparison indicates that this clone is more closely related to ROMK1 than other two membrane-spanning type potassium channels. As illustrated in Fig. 7, four major groups of these potassium channels may be classified based upon published sequences: 1) Kir, a classical inward rectifier potassium channel (IRK1, IRK2, and IRK3), 2) KG, a G protein-activated potassium channel (GIRK1), 3) KATP, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP-1), and 4) KAB, an inward rectifier potassium channel with an ATP-binding domain (KAB-1, originally identified as ROMK1; see Ho et al., 1993Ho K.

Thus, KAB-2 may be a member of the subfamily of two transmembrane type potassium channels with an ATP-binding domain. The electrophysiological characteristics of KAB-2 at the whole cell current level (i.e. the dependence of the slope conductance on [K+]o, rapid activation upon hyperpolarizing pulses, and the time- and voltage-dependent block by Ba2+ and Cs+) were the same as those of classical inward rectifier potassium channels seen in a variety of cell types, including IRK1-3. The KAB-1 (ROMK1) current expressed in oocytes does not rectify noticeably (Ho et al., 1993Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Recent experiments using site-directed mutagenesis show that aspartic acid (D) in the second transmembrane (M2) segment of IRK1, corresponding to asparagine(N) in KAB-1 (ROMK1), plays a role both in the control of polyamine-mediated channel gating and in the blocking by intracellular Mg2+ (Stanfield et al., 1994Stanfield P.R.

Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). This residue is glutamic acid (E) in KAB-2 where the charge is conserved. As shown in the mutation D172E in IRK1 (Stanfield et al., 1994Stanfield P.R. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Khan I.A. Brammar W.J. Conley E.C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the KAB-2 current expressed in oocytes shows strong rectification like the IRK1-3 currents. At the level of single-channel recording, the polyamine-mediated intrinsic activation gating appeared consistently at potentials positive to −40 ~−30 mV in IRK1, while it appeared at various potentials in KAB-2. The activation flickerings of KAB-2 were detected at potentials positive to −40 mV in some cases, but only positive to +20 mV in other cases (see Fig. 3A, a and c). This variability of the voltage dependence of activation gating of KAB-2 might be related to the glutamic acid residue of the M2 segment. The functional roles of inward rectifier potassium channels in the brain have been studied extensively in glial cells. A fundamental difference between glial and neuronal membranes is that glial cells have a much larger resting conductance, which has been attributed to inward rectifier potassium channels existing in glial cells (Barres, 1991Barres B.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, electrophysiological studies including the patch-clamp technique have clarified glial function of spatial potassium buffering or siphoning and extracellular potassium accumulation through inward rectifier potassium channels (see, e.g., Newman et al., 1984Newman E.A. Frambach D.A. Odette L.L. Science. 1984; 225: 1174-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar; Brew et al., 1986Brew H. Gray P.T.A. Mobbs P. Attwell D.

In salamander Müller cells, a single population of the inward rectifier potassium channels of 28 pS with 98 mM [K+]o has been identified (Newman, 1993Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3333-3345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rabbit Müller cells, three distinct types of channels have been identified; weak inward rectifiers of 360 pS locate mainly at the endfeet, and moderate and strong inward rectifiers (60 pS and 105 pS, respectively) exist in the cell bodies (Nilius and Reichenbach, 1988Nilius B. Reichenbach A. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Barres et al., 1988Barres B.A. Chun L.L.Y. Corey D.P. Glia. 1988; 1: 10-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar described cultured oligodendrocytes as expressing an inward rectifying potassium current that is mediated by 30-pS and 120-pS channels. The unitary conductances of the inward rectifying potassium channels in bovine oligodendrocytes and human malignant glioma cells are 29 pS and 27 pS, respectively (McLarnon and Kim, 1989McLarnon J.G. Kim S.U. Glia. 1989; 2: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; Brismar and Collins, 1989Brismar T. Collins V.P. Brain Res. 1989; 480: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The approximately 30-pS channels shown above might correspond to the 36-pS channel of KAB-2. These multiple channels electrophysiologically identified suggest the further heterogeneity of two transmembrane segment type potassium channels in glial cells. At the single-channel level, we identified two distinct conducting channels derived from a single clone (KAB-2). This might indicate that a single clone could cause the distinct conduction levels by assembling in different manners and partly explain previous description of multiple types of inward rectifier potassium channels in glial cells. Expression of KAB-2 mRNA in the brain is different from that of other inward rectifying potassium channels. mRNAs for IRK1, IRK2, IRK3, and GIRK1 were detected in neurons (Morishige et al., 1993Morishige K.

FEBS lett. 1994; 348: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar),2 while KAB-2 mRNA was expressed predominantly in glial cells such as oligodendrocytes and Bergmann glial cells. Immunocytochemistry by specific antibodies against KAB-2, combining double staining with the glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody, confirms that astrocytes derived from primary culture cells also express KAB-2.3( 3Y. Horio, A. Inanobe, T. Takumi, and Y. Kurachi, unpublished data.) A recent in situ hybridization study showed that KAB-1 (ROMK1) mRNA, which mainly expresses in kidney, was also expressed in cortex and hippocampus in the brain but did not appear to be expressed in glial cells (Kenna et al., 1994Kenna S. Röper J. Ho K. Hebert S. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the KAB-2 channel is identified, for the first time, as a glial cell inward rectifier potassium channel. Availability of this cloned KAB-2 channel should enable us to understand at the molecular level how inward rectifier potassium channels play a physiological function in glial cells.

Expression of this gene in adipose tissue as well as in adipose stromal cells maintained in the presence of serum and glucocorticoids is regulated by a distal TATA-less promoter, I.4, which contains a glucocorticoid response element, an Sp1 binding site, and an interferon-γ activation site (GAS) element. The stimulatory action of serum (in the presence of dexamethasone) can be replaced by interleukin (IL)-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin-M, as well as by IL-6, providing the IL-6 soluble receptor is also present. Stimulation of the cells by these factors led to rapid phosphorylation of Jak1, but not Jak2 or Jak3, on tyrosine residues. STAT3 but not STAT1 was also phosphorylated and bound to the GAS element in the I.4 promoter region. When regions of this promoter were fused upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transfected into the cells, mutagenesis or deletion of the GAS element led to complete loss of reporter gene expression. Since adipose tissue is the major site of estrogen biosynthesis in men and in postmenopausal women, this pathway involving a Jak/STAT signaling mechanism acting together with glucocorticoids and Sp1 appears to be the principal means where-by estrogen biosynthesis is regulated in the elderly.

The significance of adipose tissue as a source of estrogens was first recognized some 20 years ago by MacDonald, Siiteri, and their colleagues (7Hemsell D.L. Grodin J.M. Brenner P.F. Siiteri P.K.

They found that not only was there a striking increase with obesity, suggesting that most of the extragonadal conversion occurred in adipose tissue, but also that there was an equally striking increase with age for any given body weight. Estrogen biosynthesis is catalyzed by an enzyme known as aromatase P450 (11Thompson Jr., E.A. Siiteri P.K. J. Biol.

CYP19 is a member of the P450 superfamily of genes, which currently contains over 300 members in some 36 gene families(15Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W.

Typically, these enzymes catalyze the insertion of oxygen atoms derived from molecular oxygen into organic molecules to form hydroxyl groups. In the case of P450arom, three such attacks by molecular oxygen give rise to loss of the C19 angular methyl group of the steroid substrate as formic acid, with concomitant aromatization of the A-ring to give the phenolic A-ring characteristic of estrogens(16Thompson Jr., E.A.

A few years ago we and others cloned and characterized the CYP19 gene, which encodes human P450arom(17Means G.D. Mahendroo M. Corbin C.J. Mathis J.M. Powell F.E. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol.

Sequencing of rapid amplification of cDNA ends-generated cDNA clones derived from P450arom transcripts present in the various tissue sites of expression revealed that the 5′-termini of these transcripts differ from one another in a tissue-specific fashion upstream of a common site in the 5′-untranslated region(20Means G.D.

Using these sequences as probes to screen genomic libraries, it was found that these 5′-termini correspond to untranslated exons that are spliced into the P450arom transcripts in a tissue-specific fashion, due to the use of tissue-specific promoters. Placental transcripts contain at their 5′-ends untranslated exon I.1, which is located at least 40 kilobases upstream from the start of translation in exon II(20Means G.D. Kilgore M.W. Mahendroo M.S.

This is because placental expression is driven from a powerful distal placental promoter, I.1, upstream of untranslated exon I.1. On the other hand, transcripts in the ovary contain sequence at their 5′-ends that is immediately upstream of the start of translation. This is because expression of the gene in the ovary utilizes a proximal promoter, promoter II. By contrast, transcripts in adipose tissue contain yet another distal untranslated exon, I.4, which is located in the gene 20 kilobases downstream from exon I.1 (24Mahendroo M.S. Means G.D.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Toda K. Simpson E.R. Mendelson C.R. Shizuta Y. Kilgore M.W. Mol.

Commun. 1994; 198: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Splicing of these untranslated exons to form the mature transcripts occurs at a common 3′-splice junction, which is upstream of the start of translation. This means that although transcripts in different tissues have different 5′-termini, the protein encoded by these transcripts is always the same, regardless of the tissue site of expression; thus, there is only one human P450arom enzyme encoded by a single copy gene. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with an internal standard, we have studied aromatase expression in samples of adipose tissue obtained from women of various ages and have found a marked increase in the specific content of P450arom transcripts in adipose tissue with increasing age, thus providing a molecular basis for the previous observation that the fractional conversion of circulating androstenedione to estrone increases with age(29Bulun S.E. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1994; 78: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are marked regional variations in aromatase expression, with the highest values being found in adipose from buttocks and thighs as compared with abdomen and breast(29Bulun S.E.

We also used this reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique to examine regional variations in aromatase expression in breast adipose tissue and have found that highest expression occurs in adipose tissue proximal to a tumor, as compared with that distal to a tumor(31Bulun S.E.

This is in agreement with previous observations regarding the regional distribution of aromatase activity within breast adipose (33O'Neill J.S. Elton R.A. Miller W.R. Br. Med.

Pathol. 1994; 25: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These results suggest there is cross-talk between a breast tumor and the surrounding adipose cells in terms of the ability of the latter to synthesize estrogens and that factors produced by developing breast tumors may set up local gradients of estrogen biosynthesis in the surrounding fat via paracrine mechanisms(36Simpson E.R. Mahendroo M.S. Means G.D. Kilgore M.W. Hinshelwood M.M. Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. Ito Y. Fisher C.R. Michael M.D. Mendelson C.R. Bulun S.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). We also found that aromatase expression does not occur in adipocytes but rather in the stromal cells that surround the adipocytes, and that may themselves be preadipocytes(37Price T. Aitken J. Head J. Mahendroo M.S. Means G.D. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1992; 74: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These stromal cells grow in culture as fibroblasts. Consequently we have employed these cells in primary culture as a model system to study the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis in adipose tissue(38Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. MacDonald P.C. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1981; 53: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). When serum is present in the culture medium, expression is stimulated by glucocorticoids including dexamethasone(39Simpson E.R. Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5690-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Under these conditions P450arom transcripts contain primarily untranslated exon I.4 at their 5′-ends(25Mahendroo M.S. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19463-19470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently have characterized the region of the CYP19 gene upstream of exon I.4 and have found it to contain a TATA-less promoter as well as an upstream glucocorticoid response element and an Sp1 sequence within the untranslated exon, both of which are required for expression of reporter gene constructs in the presence of serum and glucocorticoids (40Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we found this region to contain an interferon-γ activating sequence (GAS)1( 1The abbreviations used are: GASinterferon-γ activation siteSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionILinterleukinLIFleukemia inhibitory factorOSMoncostatin-MRIPAradioimmune precipitation bufferPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasebpbase pair(s)FCSfetal calf serum.) element. Such sequences are known to bind transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family (41Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

In the present study we have observed for the first time that the effect of serum to stimulate aromatase expression in human adipose stromal cells (in the presence of glucocorticoids) can be mimicked by specific factors, namely members of the interleukin-11 (IL-11), oncostatin-M (OSM), IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) lymphokine family. This stimulation is mediated by a member of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases as well as a STAT transcription factor, which binds to the GAS element within promoter I.4 of the P450arom gene. Thus we have uncovered a regulatory pathway whereby expression of the P450arom gene, via the distal promoter I.4, is stimulated by members of the above cytokine family. Since P450arom transcripts in adipose tissue appear to be derived primarily from expression of promoter I.4 and since adipose tissue is the major site of estrogen biosynthesis in men and in postmenopausal women(44MacDonald P.C. Madden J.D. Brenner P.F. Wilson J.D. Siiteri P.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1979; 49: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), this pathway composed of a Jak/STAT signaling mechanism acting in conjunction with glucocorticoids and Sp1 appears to be the principal means whereby estrogen biosynthesis is regulated in the elderly.

Endocrinol. & Metab. 1981; 53: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and maintained in primary culture in Waymouth's enriched medium containing 10% Nu serum (10% v/v) (Collaborative Research Inc.) and allowed to grow to confluence (5-6 days) before treatment. At this time, serum was removed for 24 h, and the cells were treated with 250 nM dexamethasone for 48 h before recombinant human IL-11, OSM, IL-6, and LIF were added at various concentrations and times depending on the different requirements for each experiment. Aromatase activity was determined by the incorporation of tritium into [3H]water from [1β-3H]androstenedione as described previously (38Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. MacDonald P.C. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1981; 53: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Cooper et al.(45Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) and Dignam et al.(46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were cooled on ice, scraped from the plates, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in modified RIPA (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM phenanthroline, 10 mM pepstein, 0.1% leupeptin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min on ice. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 4°C. For nuclear extracts, after cells were swollen in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer (containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as in RIPA) they were homogenized with 12 strokes of an all glass Dounce homogenizer (B type pestle). Nuclei were centrifuged, and the pellet was then suspended in 500 μl of chilled buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.7, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5% dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as in RIPA). After centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at −70°C until used. Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described by Harlow and Lane (47Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) or following instructions of the manufacturers of the respective antibodies. Lysates were incubated with nonimmune serum and Protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of 50% slurry) for 1 h, followed by centrifugation. Antibodies were incubated with lysates (100 μg) overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were isolated with Protein A- or Protein G-coupled agarose or Sepharose (Oncogene Sciences or Sigma) and washed carefully 3 times with the same lysis buffer mentioned above. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and incubated with the appropriate antibody followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham International, U.K.). Chimeric DNA constructs containing the GAS element in the genomic region flanking the 5′-end of promoter I.4 of the human CYP19 gene were prepared using polymerase chain reaction. These constructs were fused upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. For mutagenesis, an 800-bp fragment containing the GAS element was digested by HindIII and EcoRI and gel-purified to generate the template for mutagenesis. The GAS element was mutated from TTCCTGTGAA to TTCGACTGAA by polymerase chain reaction. The mutated fragment also was fused upstream of the CAT reporter gene. The fidelity of mutagenesis was verified by dideoxy sequencing using a Sequenase DNA kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The transfection was performed by means of calcium phosphate coprecipitation with minor modifications as described(40Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly confluent adipose stromal cells in primary culture were transfected with 20 μg of cesium chloride-purified plasmid. Glycerol shock was carried out for 1 min. The cells were allowed to recover overnight in serum-containing media, serum-starved for 24 h, and then treated with 250 nM dexamethasone for 48 h and 10 ng/ml IL-11 overnight. The transfected cells were then harvested and lysed by means of freeze/thaw 3 times. Total protein was estimated with a kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). The CAT assay was performed using normalized amounts of cell proteins, which were incubated for 6-8 h at 37°C. The products of CAT reactions were analyzed by silica gel thin layer chromatography followed by autoradiography. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GGGTGTTTCCTGTGAAAGTT-3′) was Klenow-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and then incubated (5000 cpm) with nuclear extracts (5 μg) on ice for 10 min. For the competition assay, the unlabeled oligonucleotide used as competitor was added simultaneously with the labeled fragment at various ratios. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis using an 8% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA as running buffer. Southwestern blotting analysis was done following the procedure described by Singh et al.(48Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Nuclear extracts (60 μg) were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was processed through a denaturation/renaturation cycle with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Then the membrane was hybridized with the Klenow-labeled probe employed in gel shift analysis, followed by washing and autoradiography. Generally, experiments were performed at least 3 times on separate occasions, and frequently more, to generate consistent results. In previous studies we observed that the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids on aromatase activity in cultured human adipose stromal cells was manifest only if serum was present in the medium(39Simpson E.R. Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5690-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a number of lymphokines, namely IL-11, OSM, and LIF can mimic the action of serum to stimulate aromatase activity of adipose stromal cells in the presence of dexamethasone but not in its absence. In the case of IL-11 and OSM, the effect far exceeded that of serum. Following exposure for 24 h, half-maximal stimulation by IL-11 and OSM was achieved at concentrations of ~2-4 ng/ml (~10-10M), although the stimulation by LIF was maximal at 0.5 ng/ml. The time course of stimulation by IL-11 (Fig. 1B) was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase lasting 12 h followed by a slower phase extending beyond 48 h of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1C, IL-6 had no stimulatory activity up to a concentration of 20 ng/ml, either in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. However, a stimulatory action of IL-6 was manifest upon addition of the IL-6 soluble receptor at concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 ng/ml. At concentrations of IL-6 and its receptor of 20 ng/ml each, stimulation was equal to that achieved by adding OSM at a saturating concentration of 10 ng/ml. In other experiments, interferon-α and interferon-γ were found to have no effect to stimulate aromatase activity of these cells (data not shown). To determine whether Jak kinases are involved in the action of IL-11 to activate estrogen biosynthesis in adipose stromal cells, we examined their ability to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of IL-11 (Fig. 2). Adipose stromal cells prepared from mammoplasty and abdominoplasty samples and maintained in primary culture were treated with dexamethasone for 48 h with or without IL-11 (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. The cells were lysed, the Jak kinases were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE. The gels were subsequently blotted to filters and probed with a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine. IL-11 stimulation resulted in the appearance of a band of ~130 kDa, which was immunoprecipitated using antibodies to JAK1 and was undetectable in the absence of IL-11. By contrast, Jak2 kinase was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine since the Jak2 band (~130 kDa) was evident prior to the IL-11 treatment, and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 did not change even after IL-11 stimulation. By contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 was not apparent with or without IL-11 treatment. Similar results were obtained using LIF and OSM. Nonimmune serum and an unrelated immune serum failed to precipitate proteins of 130 kDa (data not shown). Additionally, the 130-kDa bands corresponding to Jak1 and Jak2 were not observed when the immunoprecipitations were conducted in the the presence of peptides used to raise these antibodies (data not shown). Probing with a mixture of Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 antisera showed that no change in the amount of kinase protein occurred within the time frame of the experiment (lower panel). It is concluded that in human adipose stromal cells, Jak2 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and only Jak1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to IL-11 treatment under the conditions employed here. A similar situation has been reported to occur in T-lymphocytes stimulated with interferon-α(49Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 were examined using the same cell lysates as utilized above, and the results are shown in Fig. 3A. Phosphorylation was maximal 10 min after IL-11 addition and then subsequently declined. In a study of the concentration dependence of Jak1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), it was observed that phosphorylation was undetectable employing IL-11 at a concentration of 1 ng/ml. Phosphorylation was detectable when 5 ng/ml IL-11 was used (visible on the original autoradiograph if not on the printed figure) and reached a maximum at a concentration of IL-11 of 10 ng/ml. ( 2C. Schindler, personal communication.) Since OSM and LIF also stimulate aromatase activity in adipose stromal cells in primary culture, their action to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 was also examined. Adipose stromal cells were treated with dexamethasone for 48 h and with FCS (15%), OSM (5 ng/ml), IL-11 (5 ng/ml), and LIF (5 ng/ml) for 10 min. The cells were lysed, the cell lysates were mixed with Jak1 antibody, and the precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. The effects of herbimycin A (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), H7 (a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor), and cycloheximide on Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation were also examined. As shown in Fig. 4, OSM and LIF could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 to about the same extent as IL-11. The tyrosine phosphory"

Western blots and immunoprecipitation using antibodies raised against the T3-binding domain of the T3 nuclear receptor c-Erb A α1 indicated that at least the 43-kDa protein was c-Erb A α1-related. In addition, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the occurrence of a c-Erb A α1-related mitochondrial protein that specifically binds to a natural or a palindromic thyroid-responsive element. Moreover, this protein specifically binds to a direct repeat 2 sequence located in the D-loop of the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, electron microscopy studies allowed the direct observation of a c-Erb A-related protein in mitochondria. Lastly, the relative amounts of the 43-kDa protein related to c-Erb A α1 were in good correlation with the known mitochondrial mass in three typical tissues. Interestingly, expression of a truncated form of the c-Erb A α1 nuclear receptor in CV1 cells was associated with a mitochondrial localization and a stimulation of mitochondrial activity. These results supply evidence of the localization of a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily in the mitochondrial matrix involved in the regulation of mitochondrial activity that could act as a mitochondrial T3-dependent transcription factor.

Therefore, this hormone is considered to be the major regulator of mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis (Mutvei et al., 1989aMutvei A. Husman B. Andersson G. Nelson B.D. Acta Endocrinol. 1989; 121: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). T3 also stimulates the mitochondrial metabolism (Soboll et al., 1992Soboll S. Horst C. Hummerich H. Schumacher J.P. Seitz H.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and particularly oxidative phosphorylations (Sterling et al., 1977Sterling K. Milch P.O. Brenner M.A. Lazarus J.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 7-18Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar have shown that thyroid hormone could control state 3 respiration. Some of these effects could involve the activation of mitochondrial gene transcription induced by T3 (De Leo et al., 1976De Leo T. Di Meo S. Barletta A. Martino G. Goglia F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

In addition, an early mitochondrial T3 uptake after [125I]T3 administration has been reported in electron microscopy studies (Sterling et al., 1984bSterling K. Campbell G.A. Taliadouros G.S. Nunez E.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 236: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, evidence of at least one high affinity T3-binding site was provided by [125I]T3 binding studies in the mitochondria (Sterling and Milch, 1975Sterling K. Milch P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; Goglia et al., 1981Goglia F. Torresani J. Bugli P. Barletta A. Liverini G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Commun. 1982; 106: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that a T3 mitochondrial receptor (Ka = 1010M-1; molecular mass = 28 kDa) is located in the organelle's inner membrane (Sterling et al., 1984bSterling K. Campbell G.A. Taliadouros G.S. Nunez E.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 236: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of a direct pathway in the mitochondrial action of T3 is still debated. Therefore, the characterization of the mitochondrial T3 receptor could be an important tool to verify the existence of such a pathway. The ADP/ATP translocator has been proposed as a putative T3 mitochondrial receptor (Sterling, 1986). Unfortunately, in agreement with Rasmussen et al., 1989Rasmussen U.B. Köhrle J. Rokos H. Hesch R.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, we were unable to observe any T3 binding activity of this protein, neither in mitochondria nor by testing the purified protein (kindly provided by Dr. Brandolin, Grenoble, France). Nuclear T3 receptors are encoded by two different loci leading to the synthesis of three T3-binding proteins (c-Erb A β1, β2, and α1) sharing homology in the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains. In addition to the full-length 46-kDa c-Erb A α1 protein, Bigler and Eisenman(1988) have reported the occurrence of several smaller size cellular c-Erb A α proteins in chicken erythroid cells, some of which display an extranuclear location. On the basis of these observations, we searched for the presence of protein(s) related to c-Erb A in mitochondria, and we report here the existence in the mitochondrial matrix of a 43-kDa protein related to c-Erb A α1 with thyroid-responsive element (T3RE) and T3 binding activities. Male Wistar rats (body weight, 200 g) were injected with Triton WR 1339 (75 mg of Triton/100 g of body weight in order to reduce lysosome density) 4 days before euthanasia. Animals were sacrificed after a 16-h period of food deprivation to reduce cellular stocks of lipids and glycogen. Liver mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugations and purified using a sucrose gradient (1.02/1.68 M) according to Fleischer and Kervina(1974) and Szczesna-Kaczmarek(1990). Mitoplast, inner membrane, outer membrane, and matrix fractions were obtained using digitonin and Lubrol, as described previously by Greenawalt(1974). Lysosome, microsome, plasma membrane, and nuclei fractions were obtained according to Fleischer and Kervina(1974). The purity of mitochondrial preparations was tested by measuring the specific activities of acid phosphatase (lysosomes; De Duve(1967)), glucose-6-phosphatase (microsomes; Morré(1971)), and 5′-nucleotidase (plasma membranes; Morré(1971)). Monoamine oxidase (outer membrane; Ragan et al., 1987Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach.

Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 130-145Google Scholar) were also measured to test the submitochondrial fractions (data not shown). Nuclear contaminations were assessed by Western blots of specific nuclear proteins (lamin A, CREB, and c-Erb A β). Lamin A was detected using an antibody kindly provided by Höger et al., 1991Höger T.I. Grund C. Franke W.W. Krohne G. Europ. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 150-156PubMed Google Scholar and revealed using a second antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase. c-Erb A β was detected using RHTII antiserum and revealed by 125I-protein A. CREB was detected using anti-rat CREB (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, UBI, Lake Placid, NY) and revealed using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Electron micrograph was performed on purified rat liver mitochondria. The pellet was fixed by 1% glutaraldehyde/1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, washed in PBS, postfixed in OsO4, and embedded in Epon. T3-binding proteins were detected using a [125I]T3 photoaffinity label derivative (T3-PAL), which covalently binds to these proteins after ultraviolet irradiation. [125I]T3-PAL was synthetized and protein labeling was performed according to Horowitz and Samuels(1988). The 100-μg protein samples were electrophoresed in a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli, 1970) and autoradiographed. T3-PAL labeling was performed without and with a previous incubation of mitochondrial proteins with a 1000-fold molar excess of cold T3-PAL in order to assess labeling specificity. Western blots of mitochondrial proteins were performed using two different rabbit antisera (IRS 21 and RHTII). IRS 21 is directed against a bacterially expressed protein containing 99 amino acid residues of MS2 polymerase fused to the 96 amino acid residues of the hormone-binding domain of the human c-Erb A α1 nuclear T3 receptor (Sap et al., 1986Sap J. Munoz A. Damm K. Goldberg Y. Ghysdael J. Leutz A. Beug H. Vennström B. Nature. 1986; 324: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). RHTII antiserum is raised against the following amino acid sequence: Glu-Cys-Pro-Thr-Glu-Leu-Phe-Pro-Pro-Leu-Phe-Leu-Glu-Val-Phe-Glu (399-414 of c-Erb A α1 xenopus receptor, 392-407 of c-Erb A α1 chicken receptor, 391-406 of c-Erb A α1 rat receptor, and 440-455 of c-Erb A β rat receptor). Immunoprecipitation of [125I]T3-PAL-binding proteins was performed with IRS 21 antiserum (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Coning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Prior to gel mobility shift assays, purified mitochondria were lysed at 4°C for 60 min with two volumes of solution A (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 M KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P40). After centrifugation of the lysate (130,000 × g for 60 min), the supernatant was dialyzed in solution B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol) with 50 mM KCl and was loaded onto a heparin-agarose column equilibrated in solution B/50 mM KCl. The column was washed with solution B/50 mM KCl and eluted with solution B/300 mM KCl. Fractions containing proteins were pooled and concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended and then dialyzed in solution B/50 mM KCl. Gel mobility shift assays were performed according to Graupner et al., 1989Graupner G. Wills K.N. Tzukerman M. Zhang X. Pfahl M. Nature. 1989; 340: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar using a 32P-labeled palindromic T3RE as a probe (GATCCTCAGGTCATGACCTGAA). Specificity of DNA binding was tested by competition with 200 ng of cold palindromic T3RE or with a similar amount of a mutated carbonic anhydrase II T3RE unable to bind nuclear T3 receptors (Pal-I: GATCCGAGTGGTGATTCAACTGCTA). A natural T3RE (Pal-2) identified on the upstream sequence (−669/-650) of the anhydrase carbonic II gene (Disela et al., 1991Disela C. Glineur C. Bugge T. Sap J. Stengl G. Dodgson J. Stunnenberg H.

Similar experiments were performed using a synthetic oligonucleotide (TAGCCGTCAAGGCATGAAGGTCAGCAC) corresponding to a direct repeat sequence (DR2) (Bogazzi et al., 1994Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D.

Electron microscopy was performed on Wistar rat liver preparations (cryoultramicrotomy and immunolabeling). Specimens were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4°C. The fixed specimens were infused with 2.3 M sucrose, rapidly frozen. Ultrathin frozen sections (80 nm) were prepared and transferred onto Formvar films on electron microscope grids. They were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.65 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5% ovalbumin and then incubated with RHTII antiserum (diluted 1/1000 in PBS) for 45 min. After the washes, the sections were incubated for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit antiserum diluted 1/25 in 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.65 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5% ovalbumin. Ultrathin sections were then osmicated, dehydrated, stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, and examined in a Zeiss EM902 electron microscope. Simian CV1 cells (ATCC CCL 70) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were carefully washed in PBS and fixed for 10 min in freshly prepared 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde with 0.05% Tween 20. The cells were again washed in PBS and incubated in methanol for 10 min at −20°C. Cells were then incubated in 50 mM glycine for 5 min and washed in PBS. Fixed cells were blocked for 20 min in normal goat serum and incubated in a mixture of rabbit RHTII antiserum (final dilution 1/100) and monoclonal antibody against mitochondria (anti-mitok, Chemicon International, Inc.; final dilution, 1/30) in PBS plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing for 3 × 5 min in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, cells were incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. After a final 3 × 5 min wash in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, culture dishes were mounted and photographed using a standard Zeiss Axiophot immunofluorescence microscope. CV1 cells stably expressing truncated Erb A protein were obtained by transfecting plasmid pF1Δmet1 (kindly provided by Bigler and Eisenman; Bigler et al., 1992Bigler J. Hokanson W. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2406-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One day prior to transfection, the cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish. DNA was transfected into those cells by the Ca3(PO4)2 coprecipitation method with pSV-neo as a selectable marker. Individual clones were grown in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml). Mitochondrial activity was observed in living cells by measurement of rhodamine 123 uptake (Johnson et al., 1980Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) as a marker of mitochondrial membrane potential (Chen, 1988Chen L.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) and of cytochrome oxidase activity (Wharton and Tzagaloff, 1967Wharton D.C. Tzagaloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy examination did not demonstrate the occurrence of extramitochondrial components in our preparations (Fig. 1A). Measurements of specific activities of acid phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and 5′-nucleotidase demonstrate that contaminations by lysosome, microsome, and membrane proteins were always minimal (5.2, 9.8, and 4.3%, respectively; Fig. 1B). Moreover, a nucleus-specific protein, lamin A, was not detected by Western blot in 100 and 200 μg of mitochondrial proteins, whereas it was clearly apparent in 10 μg of nuclear proteins (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the nuclear cAMP-dependent transcription factor CREB was easily detected in 10 μg of nuclear proteins and was on the brink of detection in 5 μg of nuclear proteins; however, it was not detected in 400 and 200 μg of mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 1D). In addition, although RHTII antiserum recognizes the c-Erb A α1 and β forms of T3 nuclear receptors, in our mitochondrial preparations, we were unable to detect c-Erb A β, the major isoform in liver nuclei (Fig. 1E). We searched for T3-binding proteins in purified mitochondrial preparations from rat liver. In all samples, three proteins were identified by [125I]T3-PAL labeling (Fig. 2A) with apparent molecular mass in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of approximately 43, 41, and 28 kDa. In agreement with the data of Rasmussen et al., 1989Rasmussen U.B. Köhrle J. Rokos H. Hesch R.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, a T3-PAL signal could not be detected in the 30-kDa range, indicating that the ADP/ATP translocator is unlikely to bind T3 significantly. Furthermore, a purified preparation of the ADP/ATP translocator could not be labeled after incubation in the presence of [125I]T3-PAL (data not shown). Labeling of the 43-, 41-, and 28-kDa proteins is specific, because it is competed with a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled T3-PAL (Fig. 2A). Similarly sized proteins (43, 41, and 28 kDa) were observed by immunoblotting analysis of mitochondrial extracts using IRS 21, a specific anti-Erb A α antibody (Fig. 2B). IRS 21 is directed against a bacterially expressed MS2 polymerase/c-Erb A α fusion protein. Blockade of c-Erb A α IRS 21 antibody with its nominal antigen or the use of an antibody directed against the MS2-encoded domain of the fusion protein indicated that antibody binding to the 41-kDa protein was not specific (Fig. 2F). In addition, Western blot performed with RHTII antiserum only specifically detected a 43-kDa protein in mitochondrial preparations (Fig. 2G). Following mitochondrial subfractionation, we showed that 43 and-28-kDa proteins were detected by T3-PAL labeling (data not shown) and Western blots (IRS 21, Fig. 2C) in the mitoplast fraction. Whereas the 28-kDa protein was for the most part localized in the inner membrane, the 43-kDa protein showed a major localization in the matrix, although lower relative amounts could be detected in the inner membrane fraction. Interestingly, Western blots performed with RHTII antiserum also detected a 43-kDa protein in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 2D). As verified by Western blots (IRS 21), no signal corresponding to the 43-kDa protein appeared on lysosome, microsome, membrane, and nuclear preparations (Fig. 2H), demonstrating a specific mitochondrial localization. Using IRS 21 antibody and T3-PAL-labeled mitochondrial preparations, we were able to immunoprecipitate a 43-kDa [125I]T3-PAL-labeled protein. This did not significantly occur when the antibody was preincubated with an excess of the MS2/Erb A α protein (Fig. 2E). Therefore, the 43-kDa T3-binding protein was identified to be immunologically related to the 43-kDa protein detected by Western blot. In agreement with this set of data, using RHTII antibody in electron microscopy studies, we have directly observed a specific liver mitochondrial labeling, which does not appear when using the preimmune serum or the c-Erb A preabsorbed antiserum (Fig. 3). In order to further extend similarities between the mitochondrial 43-kDa protein and the c-Erb A α1 nuclear receptor, we analyzed the DNA binding properties of the mitochondrial protein. The 43-kDa [125I]T3-PAL-labeled mitochondrial protein bound to DNA cellulose and to heparin-agarose columns (data not shown). Gel mobility shift assays performed with mitochondrial preparations partially purified on heparin-agarose showed that a protein or a protein complex binds to a palindromic T3RE (Fig. 4, A and B) and a natural T3RE identified on the chicken carbonic anhydrase II gene (data not shown). An excess of cold T3RE was found to compete binding to the probe, whereas a similar molar excess of a mutated T3RE unable to bind T3 receptors did not, thus demonstrating specificity of the binding (Fig. 4A). Moreover, in contrast to nonspecific antisera (raised against MS2 and rat ADP/ATP translocator), IRS 21 and RHTII antisera suppressed the signal observed for mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 4B). Because RHTII antiserum only detects the 43-kDa protein in heparin-agarose purified mitochondrial extracts, these results demonstrate that the 43-kDa protein also shares strong homology in the DNA-binding domain with the nuclear T3 receptors. Interestingly, a similar retardation band was observed after interaction of heparin-agarose-purified mitochondrial extracts with a DR2 sequence located in the D-loop of the rat mitochondrial genome (Fig. 5). This result clearly indicated that the 43-kDa protein binds to a specific sequence residing in the D-loop area, which contains the promotors and is not transcribed. Because Sterling et al., 1977Sterling K. Milch P.O. Brenner M.A. Lazarus J.H. Science. 1977; 197: 996-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar reported the absence of mitochondrial T3 receptors in adult rat brain, we performed photoaffinity labeling and Western blots of rat brain mitochondrial proteins. As shown in Fig. 6A, the 43-kDa protein was not detected in these preparations. We have compared the amounts of the 43-kDa protein in mitochondria obtained from three tissues showing great differences in mitochondrial mass: brown adipose tissue, liver, and white adipose tissue in decreasing order. This study was performed using purified mitochondria from 12-day-old rabbits, in which brown and white adipose tissues are easily collected simultaneously. We showed that the relative mitochondrial amounts of the 43-kDa protein are higher in brown adipose tissue than in liver and are higher in liver than in white adipose tissue (Fig. 6B). Therefore, a clear relationship exists between the mitochondrial mass and the amount of the 43-kDa protein in the mitochondrion, thus suggesting an important mitochondrial function for this protein. Because the 43-kDa protein shared strong homology in the DNA and T3-binding domains with the nuclear T3 receptors, the lower molecular weight of the mitochondrial protein could be explained by deletion of the hinge region or of the N-terminal domain of c-Erb A α1 receptor. However, Lin et al., 1992Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar have reported that deletion of the hinge region abolished T3 binding activity of the protein. Therefore, using the pF1Δmet1 plasmid, we overexpressed in CV1 cells a truncated c-Erb A α1 protein lacking the N-terminal domain (A/B domains) of the nuclear receptor. Interestingly, we observed a strong increase in mitochondrial staining by RHTII antibody when compared with control cells (transfected with the empty vector, pEMSV; Fig. 7). This result strongly suggested that the overexpressed protein displayed a major mitochondrial location. Lastly, overexpression of the truncated protein induced a strong stimulation of rhodamine 123 uptake (Fig. 8A) and cytochrome oxidase activity (Fig. 8B). All these data clearly indicated that a mitochondrial truncated c-Erb A α1 protein strongly affects the organelle function. Our data recording mitochondrial T3-binding proteins confirm the results of the Sterling group, who reported the presence of a 28-kDa T3-binding protein in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In addition, we show that a 43-kDa T3-binding protein is present in the mitochondrial matrix. This binding site was not observed by the Sterling group, probably because purification steps leading to the concept of a 28-kDa mitochondrial receptor were performed using inner membrane preparations after discarding matrix proteins (Sterling et al., 1984aSterling K. Campbell G.A. Brenner M.A. Acta Endocrinol. 1984; 105: 391-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we report here that at least one mitochondrial T3-binding protein is related to c-Erb A-encoded nuclear receptors. Among these T3-binding proteins, we also observed a 41-kDa protein obviously not related to c-Erb A nuclear receptors. We observed by T3-PAL binding (data not shown) that it was also detected in microsome, plasma membrane, and lysosome preparations, thus ruling out a specific mitochondrial localization. Our results concerning the 28-kDa T3-binding protein are not fully conclusive; the recognition specificity by IRS 21 remains unclear, and we were unable to immunoprecipitate this protein by IRS 21 and to detect it by RHTII antiserum. However, these negative data could be explained by the very low amounts of the 28-kDa protein recorded into mitochondria. By contrast, the mitochondrial 43-kDa protein is clearly related to the c-Erb A α1 nuclear receptor. Antisera raised against two different amino acid sequences of the T3-binding domain of c-Erb A specifically detect this protein in the matrix. Moreover, a 43-kDa T3-binding protein is specifically immunoprecipitated by IRS 21 antiserum. Lastly, gel retardation experiments demonstrate that this mitochondrial protein binds to T3REs DNA sequences. This set of data strongly suggests that this protein shares homology in the DNA binding and T3-binding domains with c-Erb A nuclear receptors. The identification of a protein related to c-Erb A α1 in the mitochondrion is not the consequence of contamination of our preparations by nuclei or components of other cell compartments because (a) Contaminations by lysosome, microsome, and membrane proteins were always minimal, as verified by measurements of specific markers. (b) Nucleus-specific proteins lamin A and CREB were not detected in our mitochondrial preparations. (c) RHTII antibody recognizes c-Erb A α1 and β forms; although the β form is at least four times more abundant than the α1 form in rat liver nuclei (Schwartz et al., 1992Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Ling N.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11794-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Rodd et al., 1992Rodd C. Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Oppenheimer J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2559-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect c-Erb A β in our mitochondrial preparations. If the localization of a c-Erb A protein into the mitochondrion was the result of nuclear contaminations, a major β form would be detected. (d) As verified by Western blot, the signal corresponding to the 43-kDa protein appeared only in mitochondrial preparations. (e) Treatment of mitochondria with trypsin did not affect the 43-kDa signal in Western blot experiments (data not shown). (f) In situ electron microscopy studies bring direct evidence of the presence of a protein related to c-Erb A in the mitochondrion. Indeed, the 43-kDa protein related to c-Erb A α1 displays a specific mitochondrial localization. Interestingly, we observed that the T3-binding 43-kDa protein related to c-Erb A α1 was not detectable in adult rat brain mitochondria, in agreement with the previously reported lack of T3 receptors in these mitochondria (Sterling et al., 1977Sterling K. Milch P.O. Brenner M.A. Lazarus J.H. Science. 1977; 197: 996-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, the positive relation recorded between the amounts of this protein into the organelle and the mitochondrial mass of three characteristic tissues strongly suggests a possible involvement of the 43-kDa protein in the regulation of mitochondriogenesis, a T3-regulated process (Gustafsson et al., 1965Gustafsson R. Tata J.R. Lindberg J. Ernster L. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 26: 555-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar; Kadenbach, 1966Kadenbach B. Targer J.M. Papa S. Quagliariello E. Slater E.C. Regulation of Metabolic Processes in Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1966: 508-517Google Scholar; Jakovilcic et al., 1978Jakovilcic S. Swift H.H. Gross N.J. Rabinowitz R. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All these data strongly suggest that the 43-kDa protein is a putative T3 mitochondrial receptor. This hypothesis is well supported by the additional observation that overexpression of a truncated c-Erb A α1 protein displaying a mitochondrial localization induced a strong stimulation of the organelle activity assessed by rhodamine 123 uptake and cytochrome oxidase activity, a well known target of T3 influence at the mitochondrial level. The origin and function of this protein is finally questioned. Taking into account the sequence of the mitochondrial genome in several species, the 43-kDa protein related to c-Erb A α1 is clearly encoded by a nuclear gene and is translocated into the mitochondrion. To date, five different c-erb A mRNAs have been identified in rats, encoding c-Erb A β1, β2, α1, α2, and α3 (v II) proteins. Despite intensive studies, no additional mRNAs have been identified that could lead to the specific synthesis of a 43-kDa c-Erb A α1 protein. Using polymerase chain reaction in rat liver mRNAs preparations, we were also unable to detect c-erb A α1 mRNAs other than that encoding the 46-kDa protein (data not shown). Nevertheless, the possibility of such a mRNA could not be excluded. Another possibility is raised by the observation of Sap et al., 1986Sap J. Munoz A. Damm K. Goldberg Y. Ghysdael J. Leutz A. Beug H. Vennström B. Nature. 1986; 324: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar that in vitro translation of a chicken c-erb A α1 mRNA gives rise to two major proteins with molecular mass of 46 kDa (as expected) and approximately 40 kDa. The same was observed by these workers after transfection of the c-erb A α1 cDNA in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Therefore, the c-erb A α1 mRNA can encode two proteins. Additional support is supplied by the identification of several c-Erb A α1 proteins in cells (Bigler and Eisenman, 1988), and the observation that some of them have an extranuclear localization. In addition, Bigler et al., 1992Bigler J. Hokanson W. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2406-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar reported that the smaller receptor forms are generated by alternative translational initiations at internal AUGs in full-length erb A α1 mRNA. Therefore, we suggest that the mitochondrial 43 kDa T3-binding protein could be the product of the mRNA c-erb A α1 using an internal AUG. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that overexpression of a truncated c-Erb A α1 protein corresponding to the product obtained by utilization of the first internal AUG lead to the synthesis of a mitochondrial protein inducing a stimulation of mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, the 43-kDa T3-binding protein is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and thus is in physical contact with mitochondrial DNA. Several studies reported that T3 stimulates mitochondrial gene transcription (De Leo et al., 1976De Leo T. Di Meo S. Barletta A. Martino G. Goglia F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1976; 366: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Martino et al., 1986Martino G. Covello C. De Giovanni R. Filipelli R. Pitrelli G. Mol. Biol.

We have shown that this 43-kDa protein is strongly related to the c-Erb A α1 nuclear receptor, a well known T3-dependent transcription factor. This protein displayed a sequence-specific DNA binding activity and particularly is able to bind to a specific sequence of the mitochondrial D-loop. Therefore, it could be proposed that the 43-kDa T3-binding protein could be the first hormone-dependent transcription factor identified in the mitochondrion. In conclusion, our work suggests the presence of a T3 mitochondrial receptor, which has the truncated form of the T3 nuclear receptor c-Erb A α1 in the mitochondrial matrix, which could act as a T3-dependent transcription factor. This hypothesis could explain the specific action of thyroid hormone on the mitochondria, particularly the stimulation of mitochondrial gene transcription induced by T3.

Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Immediately after IFNα stimulation, several signaling proteins in the receptor complex become tyrosine-phosphorylated, including the α and β subunits of the Type I IFN receptor (2Platanias L.C.

Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and their activation early in the IFNα signaling cascade is presumed to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of various downstream signaling molecules. Expression of Jak-1 and Tyk-2 rescues an IFNα response in certain insensitive cell lines, suggesting that these tyrosine kinases or related members of the Janus family are essential for IFNα action(4Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M.

Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar).Several proteins are substrates for IFNα-dependent tyrosine kinase activity. In response to IFNα treatment of cells, the Stat-2, Stat-1α, and Stat-1β components of the transcriptional activator ISGF3α are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine and associate with a 48-kDa protein (ISGF3γ) to form an active complex(10Fu X.-Y.

This complex translocates to the nucleus and initiates gene transcription during binding to interferon-stimulated response elements (10-13). In addition, the vav proto-oncogene product (p95vav) is tyrosine-phosphorylated during IFNα stimulation (14Platanias L.C. Sweet M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3143-3146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, its precise role in the signal transduction of IFNα remains to be determined. The involvement of multiple pathways in IFNα signaling is consistent with its pleiotropic biological effects on cells and tissues.Many growth factor receptors, including those for epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, associate directly through their autophosphorylation sites with a common set of signaling proteins that contain SH2 domains, including the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase, Grb-2, SH-PTP2, phospholipase Cγ, and Ras-GAP(15Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The receptors for insulin, IGF-1, and IL-4, however, do not strongly associate with most SH2 proteins known to be involved in their signaling pathways(16Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Instead, they stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of docking proteins in the IRS signaling family, notably IRS-1, which binds directly to various SH2 proteins(16Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F.

We report that IFNα also engages the IRS signaling system, as evidenced by the rapid IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in several hematopoietic cell lines. We also demonstrate that the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3′-kinase binds via its SH2 domains the IFNα-induced phosphorylated form of IRS-1, and that PI 3′-kinase activity can be detected in association with IRS-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and ReagentsThe U-266 (human myeloma), Daudi (lymphoblastoid), and MOLT-4 (acute T-cell leukemia) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 10% (v/v) defined calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and antibiotics. Human recombinant IFNα2 was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche and Schering-Plough. The antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G-10) and the monoclonal antibody against the regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and were used for immunoblotting. Nonimmune rabbit IgG was obtained from Sigma. The polyclonal αIRS-1PH antibody was raised against a GST fusion protein of a region of rat IRS-1 (amino acid residues 1-135) containing its pleckstrin homology domain. An antibody (αIRS-1CT) against a synthetic peptide (TYASINFQKQPEDRQ), corresponding to a sequence present in the C terminus of IRS-1, was raised in rabbits. The polyclonal antibodies against recombinant rat IRS-1 and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase have been described elsewhwere (20Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J.

After stimulation, the cells were rapidly centrifuged and lysed in a phosphorylation lysis buffer (0.5-1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Hepes, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and, after five washes with phosphorylation lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) or polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon) filters, and the residual binding sites on the filters were blocked by incubating with TBST (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% bovine serum albumin) for 1-3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The filters were subsequently incubated with the antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) kit following the manufacturer's procedure (Amersham).Preparation of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion ProteinsGlutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the nSH2 and cSH2 domains of PI 3′-kinase (22Myers Jr., M.G.

Briefly, after 2 h of additional growth, bacteria were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0. Lysed bacteria were spun for 25 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) and used for binding assays.Assays for PI 3′-Kinase ActivityPI 3′-kinase activity assays on αIRS-1PH immunoprecipitates obtained from IFNα- or insulin-stimulated cells were performed as described previously(24Backer J.M.

Briefly, after IFNα or insulin stimulation, serum-starved Daudi cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and twice with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM Na3VO4 (Buffer A). The cells were lysed in 1 ml of Buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were washed in PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μM Na3VO4 (three times), 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM LiCl2 and 100 μM Na3VO4 (three times), and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 μM Na3VO4 (twice). The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. 10 μl of 100 mM MnCl2 and 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (2 μg/μl) sonicated in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA were added to each pellet. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 440 μM ATP containing 30 μCi of [32P]ATP. After incubation for 10 min at 22°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 N HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). The samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate which was coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe performed experiments in which the patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IFNα or insulin in hematopoietic cells were studied. We noticed that both IFNα and insulin stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of a common 170-kDa protein in U-266 cells (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of this protein was similar to the mass of the insulin receptor substrate-1(17Sun X.-J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), suggesting that IFNα uses an IRS signaling protein to mediate certain biologic responses.To determine if IRS-1 is involved in IFNα signaling, lysates from control or stimulated U-266 or Daudi cells were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against IRS-1 and immunoblotted with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of a 170-kDa protein, corresponding to IRS-1, was consistently detected in U-266 but not in Daudi cells. However, IFNα and insulin strongly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in both cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). The IFNα-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 1 min of treatment of Daudi or MOLT-4 cells and diminishing after 90 min (Fig. 2C). It was also dose-dependent, exhibiting a similar response pattern with the phosphorylation of Stat proteins (Fig. 2D).Figure 2:Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to IFNα and insulin. Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots. A, serum-starved U-266 cells were treated with IFNα (104 units/ml) for 5 min at 37°C as indicated, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1PH, αIRS-1CT, or normal rabbit serum (RS) as indicated. B, Daudi cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα (104 units/ml) or insulin (1 μM) for 3 min at 37°C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either nonimmune RIgG or a polyclonal antibody against baculovirus-generated rat IRS-1 as indicated. C, time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Cells were stimulated with 104 units/ml IFNα for the indicated time points, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either nonimmune RIgG or an antibody against recombinant rat IRS-1 as indicated. D, serum-starved U-266 cells were treated for 30 min at 37°C with the indicated amounts of IFNα, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either αIRS-1CT (lanes 1-4) or with a polyclonal antibody against Stat-2 (lanes 5-8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1 binds to several SH2 proteins, including the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of the PI 3′-kinase(20Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). To determine whether IRS-1 binds p85 during IFNα stimulation, immunoprecipitates obtained with an anti-p85 antibody from Daudi cell lysates were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine (4G-10). Following IFNα or insulin treatment of the cells, a 170-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was detected in the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. This phosphoprotein co-migrated with IRS-1 immunoprecipitated directly with αIRS-1PH (Fig. 3A). Moreover, anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates contained p85α only after IFNα or insulin stimulation (Fig. 3B). The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of IRS-1 from IFNα- or insulin-stimulated cells also bound to a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (Fig. 3C and 3D). Similar results were obtained using a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85.2( 2S. Uddin and L. C. Platanias, unpublished data. )Thus, IFNα stimulates the association of IRS-1 with the PI 3′-kinase, and this interaction most likely requires the SH2 domains in p85(22Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.-J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells (4 × 107/lane) were incubated for 5 min at 37°C in the presence or absence of IFNα (104 units/ml) or insulin (1 μM) as indicated, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with normal RIgG, αp85, or αIRS-1PH, as indicated. B, cells (5 × 107/lane) were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα or insulin for 7 min at 37°C as indicated, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1PH, normal RIgG, or αp85 as indicated and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody against p85α. C, cells (9 × 107/lane) were stimulated with IFNα or insulin for 5 min at 37°C as indicated, and cell lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with either GST alone or a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85α, both of which were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine. D, cells (1.5 × 108/lane) were incubated for 3 min with IFNα as indicated, and cell lysates were bound to either GST alone or a GST-nSH2 fusion protein. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with αIRS-1CT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PI 3′-kinase appears to play an important role in various biological responses and is activated by many growth factors and cytokines(25Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Its activation by insulin occurs during association with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1(20Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI 3′-kinase activity is detected in association with IRS-1 during IFNα stimulation, PI 3′-kinase assays were carried out on αIRS-1 immunoprecipitates. Before stimulation, a basal level of PI 3′-kinase activity was detected in the αIRS-1 immunoprecipitates, which was equivalent to the nonspecific activity detected in immunoprecipitates with preimmune rabbit serum (Fig. 4). IFNα or insulin stimulated the association of PI 3′-kinase activity with IRS-1 that was immunoprecipitated specifically with αIRS-1PH (Fig. 4). It is likely that the PI 3′-kinase is activated by IFNα during its association with IRS-1.Figure 4:Association of PI 3′-kinase activity with IRS-1 during IFNα or insulin stimulation in Daudi cells. Serum-starved cells were treated for 5 min in the absence or presence of IFNα (104 units/ml) or insulin (100 nM) as indicated, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1PH or preimmune serum, and immunoprecipitates were assayed in triplicate for PI 3′-kinase activity. The lower spots in the TLC plate represent the origin, and the upper spots represent the phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol substrate. Data were plotted as the average -fold activation ± S.E. for triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of IFNα signaling between the plasma membrane and nucleus. The Jak-Stat pathway provides a plausible mechanism for the regulated assembly of ISGF-3, which regulates expression of genes containing the IFN-stimulated response elements(13Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism used by IFNα to regulate other signaling pathways, however, is poorly understood. Our finding that IFNα stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 suggests the existence of a pathway for the regulated engagement of additional SH2 signaling proteins during IFNα stimulation. It will be important to identify other SH2 proteins engaged by IRS-1 in response to IFNα, as well as in response to IFNβ and IFNω, which also induce its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues.2IRS-1 plays a central role in the signal transduction of insulin and interleukin-4, and its signaling functions appear to be essential for the mitogenic effects of these ligands(19Wang L.-M. Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that IRS-1 may also be involved in growth hormone signaling (26Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Yip R. Lobo R.B. Tai L.-R. Goodman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30085-30088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein contains many potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in various hydrophobic contexts(16Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These tyrosine residues play a dual role as substrates for upstream tyrosine kinases and as specific docking sites for downstream SH2 proteins. At least eight tyrosine residues in IRS-1 undergo phosphorylation by the activated insulin receptor, including residues 460, 608, 628, 939, and 987, which are in YXXM/YMXM motifs and bind to p85 which activates the PI 3′-kinase(20Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Three other motifs are also phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, including Y895VNI, which binds Grb-2, and Y1172IDL and Y1222ASI which bind SH-PTP2(27Sun X.-J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies to determine the motifs of IRS-1 that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IFNα should provide valuable information on the mechanisms by which the signaling specificity is established through the common use of this protein by different cytokines and growth factors.We currently think that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase regulates the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of IRS proteins, whereas the receptors for IL-4 and IFNα use Janus family tyrosine kinases to accomplish such phosphorylation; however, direct evidence that IRS-1 acts as a substrate for Janus kinases during IFNα stimulation remains to be obtained. Many receptors activate the Janus family of tyrosine kinases, but most of them do not phosphorylate IRS-1. The identity of the elements responsible for this selectivity are unknown. Interestingly, the receptors for insulin, IGF-1, and IL-4 contain a common amino acid sequence motif, LxxxxNPxYxss, which appears to contribute to the interaction of these receptors with IRS-1(28Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar); however, this sequence motif is not found in the cloned components of the Type I IFN receptor(8Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 29Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), suggesting that a different motif may be involved or another subunit remains to be found.The shared use of the IRS signaling pathway establishes a common link between apparently distinct signaling systems for insulin, IGF-1, IL-4, and IFNα. Recently, Larner et al.(30Larner A.C. Petricoin E.F. Nakagawa Y. Finbloom D.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1944-1950PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that IL-4 attenuates the transcriptional activation of IFN-induced cellular gene expression in monocytes and related cell lines. Although the mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown, our results raise the possibility of an antagonism between IFNα and IL-4 occurring through the common use of proteins in the IRS signaling system. If this hypothesis is correct, then insulin and IGF-1 may also influence IFNα signaling. Additional work in this area should reveal important relationships between these apparently distinct factors and others as well.

Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Immediately after IFNα stimulation, several signaling proteins in the receptor complex become tyrosine-phosphorylated, including the α and β subunits of the Type I IFN receptor (2Platanias L.C.

Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and their activation early in the IFNα signaling cascade is presumed to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of various downstream signaling molecules. Expression of Jak-1 and Tyk-2 rescues an IFNα response in certain insensitive cell lines, suggesting that these tyrosine kinases or related members of the Janus family are essential for IFNα action(4Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M.

Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar).Several proteins are substrates for IFNα-dependent tyrosine kinase activity. In response to IFNα treatment of cells, the Stat-2, Stat-1α, and Stat-1β components of the transcriptional activator ISGF3α are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine and associate with a 48-kDa protein (ISGF3γ) to form an active complex(10Fu X.-Y.

This complex translocates to the nucleus and initiates gene transcription during binding to interferon-stimulated response elements (10-13). In addition, the vav proto-oncogene product (p95vav) is tyrosine-phosphorylated during IFNα stimulation (14Platanias L.C. Sweet M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3143-3146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, its precise role in the signal transduction of IFNα remains to be determined. The involvement of multiple pathways in IFNα signaling is consistent with its pleiotropic biological effects on cells and tissues.Many growth factor receptors, including those for epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, associate directly through their autophosphorylation sites with a common set of signaling proteins that contain SH2 domains, including the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase, Grb-2, SH-PTP2, phospholipase Cγ, and Ras-GAP(15Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The receptors for insulin, IGF-1, and IL-4, however, do not strongly associate with most SH2 proteins known to be involved in their signaling pathways(16Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Instead, they stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of docking proteins in the IRS signaling family, notably IRS-1, which binds directly to various SH2 proteins(16Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F.

We report that IFNα also engages the IRS signaling system, as evidenced by the rapid IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in several hematopoietic cell lines. We also demonstrate that the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3′-kinase binds via its SH2 domains the IFNα-induced phosphorylated form of IRS-1, and that PI 3′-kinase activity can be detected in association with IRS-1."

Recent electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that recoverin may regulate the photoresponse by inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find in both cell homogenates and reconstituted systems that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin occurs over a significantly higher free Ca2+ range than previously reported. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 1.5-3 μM free Ca2+ and is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of ∼2. Measurements of transducin activation demonstrate that this inhibition prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin. Ca2+-recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity, and Ca2+-dependent binding of recoverin to rod outer segment membranes is not required for its action. Extrapolation of the in vitro data to in vivo conditions based on simple mass action calculations places the Ca2+-recoverin regulation within the physiological free Ca2+ range in intact rod outer segment. The data are consistent with a model in which the fall in free Ca2+ that accompanies rod excitation exerts negative feedback by relieving inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation.

A drop in free Ca2+ following illumination appears to be a key regulatory step during recovery of the photoresponse and during light adaptation (see Refs. 1McNaughton P.A. Physiol.

Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), several studies have suggested that the Ca2+ effect on cGMP phosphodiesterase might be mediated by a Ca2+-binding protein, recoverin, through its inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation (8Klenchin V.A.

Consistent with this inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation, physiological experiments have shown that recoverin and its homologues can slow photoresponse recovery(11Gray-Keller M.P. Polans A.S. Palczewski K. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 523-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).

This paper addresses several questions that are important in establishing the physiological relevance of the Ca2+-recoverin system in ROS.1( 1The abbreviations used are: ROSrod outer segment(s)RKrhodopsin kinaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)BAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. )1) What is the free Ca2+ concentration range over which recoverin inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation is relaxed? 2) What is the mechanism of recoverin inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation? 3) Do the in vitro biochemical data support the proposed physiological role of recoverin in living photoreceptors? The data show that Ca2+-recoverin acts directly on RK to decrease its catalytic activity and that no components other than rhodopsin, kinase, and recoverin are required.

[γ-32P]ATP and [γ-35S]GTP were purchased from DuPont NEN; Percoll and Heparin HiTrap columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., potassium isethionate was from Kodak; Chelex 100 resin was from Bio-Rad; 1 M CaCl2 solution was from BDH; BAPTA and Fluo-3 were from Molecular Probes; and bis-Tris propane was from Calbiochem. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The standard buffer used in all experiments contained 105 mM potassium isethionate, 5 mM sodium isethionate, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8. It was purified from calcium ion contamination on a Chelex 100 column prior to addition of MgCl2 so that Ca2+ concentration was below 1 μM. Intact frog ROS were purified as described(19Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that CaCl2 concentration in Percoll was decreased to 0.1 mM. ROS were resuspended in the standard buffer and homogenized with a motorized tissue grinder to minimize any diffusional limitations caused by disk stacks(20Dumke C.L. Arshavsky V.Y. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. Pugh Jr., E.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 1071-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Bovine ROS were purified under infrared illumination as described(21McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Methods in Neurosciences: Photoreceptor Cells. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 123-130Google Scholar). The same method of bovine ROS isolation was used for RK purification, but all sucrose solutions were prepared in 10 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, and the procedure was performed in room light. Bovine and frog recoverin were purified (22Polans A.S. Crabb J. Palczewski K. Hargrave P.A. Methods in Neurosciences: Photoreceptor Cells. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 248-260Google Scholar) and stored at −70°C. The concentration of recoverin was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 36,400.2( 2A. Polans, personal communication. )RK was extracted as described (23Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 2568-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracted RK was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 0.4% Tween 80, pH 8.0, and loaded on a 1 × 3.5-cm DEAE-cellulose column at 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris, 0.2% Tween 80, pH 8.0) and then with 100 ml of 35 mM NaCl in buffer A, and RK was eluted with a 35-135 mM NaCl gradient (0.2 ml/min; total volume, 45 ml). Fractions containing RK were loaded on a 1-ml Heparin HiTrap column equilibrated with buffer B (10 mM bis-Tris propane, 0.064% Tween 80, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8). The column was washed with 125 mM KCl in buffer B, and RK was eluted with 250 mM KCl at 0.06 ml/min. A set of 4× stock solutions with different CaCl2 concentrations and fixed BAPTA concentration in standard buffer was prepared (1× = 5 mM BAPTA). Free Ca2+ in 4-fold diluted solutions was measured. For the free Ca2+ range of 10 nM to 5 μM, Fluo-3 dye was used. The Kd of Fluo-3 for Ca2+, 450 nM, was derived from its fluorescence in solutions of 10-70 nM free Ca2+ buffered with BAPTA according to the estimates of the program BAD(26Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Preparation of accurate BAPTA solutions required gravimetric determination of the water content (∼10%) of the commercially obtained BAPTA. For free Ca2+ that was ≥10 μM, a Ca2+-selective electrode (Microelectrodes, Inc., Londonderry, NH) was used following recommendations of the manufacturer. A control determination showed that frog ROS suspensions containing up to 20 μM rhodopsin do not change free Ca2+. Samples of intact frog ROS with different rhodopsin concentrations (19Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, heated for 30 min at 60°C, and run on a 15% polyacrylamide gel in parallel with purified recoverin standards. The intensity of recoverin bands was determined by densitometric analysis with the aid of a Foto/analyst system and Collage software (Fotodyne, New Berlin, WI) using laplacian edge detection and local background subtraction. Calculations assumed molecular masses of 23 and 39 kDa for recoverin and rhodopsin, respectively. Frog RK activity was measured in ROS suspensions of 20 μM rhodopsin unless otherwise indicated. Bovine RK activity was measured using urea-treated ROS membranes as a substrate (final concentration, 10 μM rhodopsin). ROS, a CaCl2/BAPTA stock solution, and recoverin if necessary were mixed in a final volume of 15 μl in the dark, the suspension was illuminated (bleached), and 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (0.4-0.8 mM) was added (control experiments have shown that the order in which reactants are mixed is not important; the same extent of RK inhibition is obtained if the reaction is initiated by bleaching of rhodopsin in the presence of ATP). After 1-2 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of 6% trichloroacetic acid or 100 mM EDTA, 100 mM KF, pH 7.5. 32Pi incorporation was measured using one of the following methods. For low levels of bleached rhodopsin, the excised rhodopsin bands from 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were dissolved in 30% H2O2. For bleaches of 5-100%, samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters, washed with 6 × 1 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and dissolved in 2 ml of glacial acetic acid. The dissolved samples were counted by liquid scintillation. The gain of GTPγS binding following a calibrated light flash was measured by filter binding under the same conditions as those used for rhodopsin phosphorylation with the exception that samples contained 100 μM [γ-35S]GTP and cold ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min and quenched with 100 mM GTP, 100 mM hydroxylamine, pH 7.8. Curve fitting used the Marquardt-Levenberg least squares algorithm available in SigmaPlot software. The data from individual experiments shown in Fig. 1A and 3 were first fit to a double sigmoid function (see “Results”) and then normalized by the value of Pmax (maximal rhodopsin phosphorylation) obtained. In Fig. 2A, in order to combine data from individual experiments that showed similar slopes on varying backgrounds, a first-order regression coefficient b (y = ax + b) for each individual data set was subtracted from the data, which were then normalized by the value at 0.1 μg of recoverin. The data from individual experiments shown in Fig. 2B were first fit to the function, P=X−Vmax.RKm+R(Eq. 1) where P is the rhodopsin phosphorylation and R is concentration of recoverin and then normalized by the value of X obtained. Normalized data from different experiments were combined and curve fits were performed without averaging. All data points shown are the means ± S.D. of at least two experiments.Figure 2:Estimation of recoverin amount in frog ROS and inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation as a function of recoverin concentration. A, determination of the rhodopsin/recoverin ratio in osmotically intact frog ROS. Integrated recoverin band intensities of recoverin standards and whole ROS samples are shown (pooled data from 5 separate gels). The data are consistent with a rhodopsin/recoverin ratio of 174 ± 18. Inset, a representative gel used for recoverin quantitation (from left to right): 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, and 0.11 μg of recoverin and three ROS samples (15, 20, and 25 μg of rhodopsin). The upper bands seen in the ROS samples were identified as recoverin based on Western blotting analysis, and the fact that they run at exactly the same position as purified bovine recoverin when the cytosolic ROS fraction is analyzed by electrophoresis. The retardation in case of whole ROS is caused by gel overloading with respect to rhodopsin. B, dependence of the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation on recoverin concentration in 10 mM rhodopsin whole frog ROS at 25 μM (●) and 2 mM (○) free Ca2+. The curve is drawn according to the Michaelis-Menten equation with Vmax = 71.8 and Km = 3.4 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dependence of rhodopsin phosphorylation on free Ca2+ for whole frog ROS in the absence and presence of exogenous recoverin is shown in Fig. 1A. A biphasic character of the free Ca2+ titration is observed. This is best explained by assuming that inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation occurs independently at micromolar and millimolar free Ca2+ ranges. The data can be fit to the relation P=Pmax⋅(1−CamCam+Kmhigh)⋅(1−a⋅ CanCan+Knrec)(Eq. 2) where Ca denotes free Ca2+ concentration and P is the amount of phosphate incorporated into rhodopsin normalized by maximal rhodopsin phosphorylation Pmax. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, this expression describes a combination of “low Ca2+ inhibition” (a sigmoid curve with a fractional amplitude a, half-maximal free Ca2+ concentration Krec, and a Hill coefficient of n) (Fig. 1B, curve 1) and “high Ca2+ inhibition” (a sigmoid function with corresponding parameters Khigh and m) (Fig. 1B, curve 2) that results in a biphasic Ca2+ dependence (Fig. 1B, curve 3) that closely resembles the experimental data. The curve fitting shows that parameter a (the amplitude of low Ca2+ inhibition) increases with increasing recoverin concentration, whereas other parameters do not change significantly. The high Ca2+ inhibition shows half-saturation in the range of 0.4-0.7 mM free Ca2+ and is unlikely to be of physiological relevance. The reconstitution experiment shown below (see Fig. 4) demonstrates that it does not require recoverin and is therefore an intrinsic property of RK. Similar inhibition of purified RK by near-millimolar Ca2+ was previously reported(27Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2306-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We thus conclude that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation at micromolar free Ca2+ is recoverin-specific and refer to it as the “recoverin effect.” Qualitatively, the results depicted in Fig. 1 are similar to those already published(8Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): A48Google Scholar, 10Gorodovikova E.N. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Kawamura S. Cox J.A. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The important distinction, however, is that we find a higher half-saturating free Ca2+ for the recoverin effect (about 2 μMversus 0.1-0.2 μM). Finding a half-saturating free Ca2+ value that is an order of magnitude higher than that reported by two other laboratories has compelled us to consider this discrepancy carefully. We cannot confidently assign a reason for the difference but propose that it is due to several intrinsic difficulties in calcium buffering with EGTA. A problem that is frequently overlooked is that the high affinity of EGTA for Ca2+ and its strong pH sensitivity result in large errors in free Ca2+ if even slight errors in the concentrations of protons, chelator, or Ca2+ are introduced (for detailed discussion, see Refs. 29Miller D.J. Smith G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C160-C166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 30McGuigan J.A.S. Luthi D. Buri A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 69: 1733-1749Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To ensure accuracy and reproducibility of calcium buffering, we have directly measured free Ca2+ in solutions used for the experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”) and thus believe that our approach gives more reliable estimates. We have determined the amount of endogenous recoverin present in our osmotically intact ROS preparations and found that its molar ratio to rhodopsin is approximately 1:174 ± 18 (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation in whole frog ROS as a function of the total concentration of recoverin at saturating free Ca2+ concentrations can then be described by a simple hyperbola with half-saturation at 3.4 ± 0.3 μM recoverin (Fig. 2B). To verify that the reported effect of recoverin on cGMP phosphodiesterase activity (6Kawamura S. Murakami M. Nature. 1991; 349: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) is not a direct stimulation of cGMP phosphodiesterase by Ca2+-recoverin and that the recoverin action prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin, we tested whether the recoverin effect could be detected on the level of transducin activation. The longer the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin, the larger the number of transducin molecules it is able to activate, provided that the availability of transducin is not limiting. Therefore, the total amount of GTPγS bound to transducin following a dim flash will be a function of the rate of rhodopsin inactivation. Fig. 3 demonstrates that addition of recoverin to ROS in 10 μM free Ca2+ causes an increased gain of GTPγS binding that is consistent with an inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation. The simplest hypothesis for the mechanism of recoverin action is direct inhibition of RK. The Ca2+ dependence of rhodopsin phosphorylation obtained with purified bovine recoverin, RK, and urea-treated ROS is shown in Fig. 4A, and the protein preparations are shown in Fig. 4B. It is clear that all features of Ca2+ inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation (high calcium inhibition, the Ca2+ range for the recoverin effect, and a Hill coefficient close to 2) can be reconstituted with these purified proteins without involvement of any additional factors. Fig. 5 summarizes data from experiments testing several alternative mechanisms of recoverin inhibition of RK. First, recoverin might prevent access of RK to bleached rhodopsin. For such a competitive inhibition the extent of the recoverin effect should be greater at lower substrate concentrations. Fig. 5A demonstrates, to the contrary, that the recoverin effect does not depend on the amount of bleached rhodopsin present. Second, Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of recoverin might play a role in recoverin function. To find out whether only membrane-bound recoverin is able to inhibit RK, the extent of the recoverin effect in the presence of 10 and 100 μM rhodopsin was compared. Because the Kd of myristoylated recoverin for ROS membranes is ∼200 μM rhodopsin(17Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), this 10-fold increase of membrane concentration should correspond to a 10-fold increase of the amount of membrane-bound recoverin. Only a very small difference was found (Fig. 5B), probably attributable to less reliable Ca2+ buffering in the presence of high concentrations of proteins and lipids. Finally, there is the possibility that Ca2+-recoverin increases RK's Km for ATP so that the 100-200 μM ATP used in the previous experiments was not saturating in the presence of recoverin. Under this scenario the recoverin effect should diminish with increasing ATP concentration. Fig. 5C shows that it is not the case; the same result is obtained with 100 μM and 1 mM ATP. Inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin can be observed in vitro above 1 μM free Ca2+ and requires the presence of micromolar concentrations of recoverin (Fig. 1A). Reconstitution of the recoverin effect demonstrates that it reflects a direct inhibition of RK by Ca2+-recoverin (Fig. 4, see also Refs. 9Chen C.-K. Hurley J.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1994; 35 (abstr.): 1485Google Scholar and 10Gorodovikova E.N. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that the recoverin effect is independent of the concentration of RK substrates (Fig. 5, A and C) strongly suggests that recoverin inhibits the catalytic activity of RK. Two lines of evidence suggest that membrane binding of recoverin does not dramatically affect its ability to inhibit RK. First, it has been shown that nonacylated recombinant recoverin that does not bind to membranes exhibits the same inhibitory activity as the native protein (28Kawamura S. Cox J.A. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).3( 3P. D. Calvert, V. A. Klenchin, and M. D. Bownds, manuscript in preparation. )Second, the data in Fig. 5B, taken together with the low affinity of recoverin for membranes(17Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), indicate that membrane binding is not required for recoverin inhibition of RK. Our data provide an estimate of the affinity of recoverin for Ca2+. Assuming that Ca2+-recoverin-bound RK does not phosphorylate rhodopsin, the extent of the recoverin effect is determined by the percent of RK that is bound to recoverin. This is given by an equilibrium 2Ca + Rec + RK↔K1Ca2Rec + RK↔K2Ca2RecRK(Eq. 3) where Rec is recoverin and K1 and K2 are equilibrium dissociation constants for the two reactions. Because a Hill coefficient value close to 2 was found experimentally (Fig. 1A and 4A), for simplicity we presume two binding sites with equal macroscopic binding constants for Ca2+. An analysis of this equilibrium under conditions of buffered Ca2+ reveals that 1) When the total recoverin concentration is 10-fold or more higher than RK, the recoverin effect is independent of RK concentration and 2) at saturating free Ca2+, the recoverin concentration required for the half-maximal amplitude of the recoverin effect is equal to K2. Therefore, only K1 remains to be varied in order to find a fit for the experimental data. A K1 of 4.5 μM, along with a K2 of 3.4 μM (from Fig. 2B), is found to provide a reasonable fit for the data (Fig. 6, curve 1). Our indirect estimate of 4.5 μM for K1 is in agreement with flow dialysis measurements of Ca2+ binding to native recoverin that showtwo sites with affinities of about 2.7 and 3.8 μM2 and to myristoylated recombinant recoverin that show cooperative Ca2+ binding with a Hill coefficient of 1.75 and half-saturation at 17 μM Ca2+(31Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This analysis also provides an indirect but, we think, compelling reason that previously reported free Ca2+ ranges for the recoverin effect in vitro are in error: In order to observe a K1/2 of 0.1-0.2 μM free Ca2+ for the recoverin effect when recoverin is 5-10 μM(7Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Gorodovikova E.N. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Kawamura S. Cox J.A. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), one would need to set K1 at 0.1-0.3 μM, very far from the values determined experimentally. We have an apparent problem. The data seem to portray recoverin as a low potency inhibitor acting at micromolar free Ca2+ levels, whereas the free Ca2+ concentration in dark ROS is 200-600 nM and falls to much lower levels on illumination(32Korenbrot J.I. Miller D.L. Vision Res. 1989; 29: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Lagnado L. Cervetto L. McNaughton P.A. J. Physiol. 1992; 455: 111-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34McCarthy S.T. Younger J.P. Owen W.G. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2076-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 849-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The problem is resolved by extrapolation of the data to in vivo conditions, which brings the recoverin effect into the physiological free Ca2+ range. Note first that at 10.1 μM total recoverin the theoretical half-saturating free Ca2+ (K1/2 = 2.2 μM; Fig. 6, curve 1) is lower than the K1 of 4.5 μM used in the calculations. The nature of such a shift is easy to understand; the Kd of recoverin for Ca2+ dictates what proportion of recoverin is Ca2+-bound, whereas the percentage of RK bound to Ca2+-recoverin is a function of the absolute concentration of Ca2+-bound recoverin. Under presumed in vivo conditions of 34 μM recoverin (based on 6 mM cytoplasmic rhodopsin concentration (36Liebman P.A. Dartnall H.J.A. Handbook of Sensory Physiology. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1972: 481-528Google Scholar) and the rhodopsin/recoverin ratio of 174 that we determined), the calculated half-saturating free Ca2+ for the recoverin effect is 1.4 μM.4( 4For this calculation to be strictly performed, one also needs to know the in vivo RK concentration. However, its variation would only slightly affect the amplitude of the inhibition and would not affect the free Ca2+ range over which it occurs. The maximal inhibition at 34 μM recoverin, for example, varies from 73 to 90% for recoverin to RK ratios of 1 and 10, respectively. Because no bands comparable in intensity to recoverin are found in the region of 65-75 kDa (besides the rhodopsin dimer) and because of the difference in the molecular weights of the proteins, we presume here the ratio 5:1. )A further factor that will affect the free Ca2+ range of recoverin action in vivo is the ability of myristoylated Ca2+-recoverin to bind to membranes. As Zozulya and Stryer (17Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) point out, at physiologically high membrane concentrations the Ca2+ titration curve of recoverin binding to membranes should have a K1/2 lower than recoverin's affinity for Ca2+. The same holds true for Ca2+ binding to recoverin. Binding of Ca2+-recoverin to membrane shifts the equilibrium of the binding between Ca2+ and recoverin toward the formation of more Ca2+-recoverin complexes. With K1 = 4.5 μM and a Ca2+-recoverin Kd for membranes of 230 μM rhodopsin (from Ref. 16; Fig. 3), a calculated Ca2+ titration curve of recoverin under presumed in vivo conditions of 6 mM rhodopsin and 34 μM recoverin has a K1/2 of 0.87 μM free Ca2+ (not shown). If, under the high membrane concentrations found in ROS, myristoylated recoverin is expected to be half-saturated with Ca2+ at 0.87 μM, to estimate the percentage of RK not bound to Ca2+-recoverin in vivo as a function of free Ca2+, one should take not the true recoverin affinity for Ca2+ (∼4.5 μM), as we did above, but its effective value of 0.87 μM. Fig. 6, curve 2, shows how this results in a further shift of the predicted range of the recoverin effect toward lower free Ca2+ values, yielding a K1/2 of 271 nM free Ca2+, which is within the physiological range. This leads us to an important conclusion: even though myristoylation of recoverin per se is not required for its inhibition of RK (Ref. 28 and this study), under in vivo conditions this posttranlational modification might determine the free Ca2+ range of the recoverin effect! As demonstrated by Ames et al.(31Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), another important function of recoverin myristoylation is that it induces positive cooperativity of Ca2+ binding by recoverin, making it a more efficient sensor of Ca2+ changes. The low affinity of recoverin for Ca2+ has an important physiological implication. Given that the rate of association between Ca2+ and Ca2+-binding proteins is about 2 × 107(37Klee C.B. Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 35-56Google Scholar), the micromolar Kd of the Ca2+-recoverin complex means that its dissociation is rapid, and the lifetime of the complex is on the order of tens of milliseconds. This should allow photoreceptors to track changes in free Ca2+ concentration without delay. As we show above, the low affinity for Ca2+ does not impair recoverin's ability to sense free Ca2+ concentrations significantly lower than Kd, provided that the Ca2+-bound form of recoverin selectively binds to membrane and high enough concentrations of recoverin are present. The observations presented in this paper, taken together with previous studies(7Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 9Chen C.-K. Hurley J.B. Invest.

The extrapolation presented here is not meant to be definitive but points to a solution for the apparent discrepancy between in vitro data and the physiological free Ca2+ range. Moreover, it suggests the possibility that the efficiency of the Ca2+ feedback on the level of rhodopsin phosphorylation might in turn be modulated by changes in the percentage of N-acylated recoverin and the exact chemical nature of the modification.

https://openalex.org/W2051631129,"P-glycoprotein confers multidrug resistance upon cells in which it is highly expressed, reducing the effectiveness of numerous cytotoxic drugs, including many of those used for chemotherapy of cancer. Although P-glycoprotein is widely believed to function as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump, the unusually broad substrate specificity of P-glycoprotein has engendered the proposal of other, less direct mechanisms. None of the hypothetical mechanisms has been definitively tested, however, in a purified system where other cellular components and processes are absent. We have used a fluorescent substrate of P-glycoprotein, Hoechst 33342, to measure transport activity in real-time of highly purified P-glycoprotein in a reconstituted liposome system in which the P-glycoprotein has a uniformly inside-out orientation. Using this system, we demonstrated MgATPdependent, chemosensitizer-inhibitable transport of Hoechst 33342. Transport was prevented by omission of Mg2+, by substitution of nonhydrolyzable adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate for ATP, by inhibition of the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein with vanadate and N-ethylmaleimide, and by the chemosensitizers verapamil and amiodarone. Measurements of intraliposomal pH during Hoechst 33342 transport detected no large pH changes in P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes. These results are inconsistent with a mechanism in which P-glycoprotein affects drug accumulation by directly altering intracellular pH. The Hoechst 33342 transport assay results are consistent with mechanisms in which P-glycoprotein alone is sufficient to transport drugs out of the membrane bilayer.

The Hoechst 33342 transport assay results are consistent with mechanisms in which P-glycoprotein alone is sufficient to transport drugs out of the membrane bilayer. P-glycoprotein is a 170-kDa mammalian plasma membrane ATPase belonging to a large superfamily of integral membrane transport proteins, the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily or traffic ATPases (16Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar; 8Doige C.A. Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein is unusual, however, in having a very broad specificity for dissimilar lipophilic or amphiphilic substrates (7Chin K.-V. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). There are three P-glycoprotein genes in rodents and two (classes I and III) in humans (6Childs S. Ling V. DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Important Advances in Oncology. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 21-36Google Scholar). Cells which express class I or class II, but not class III, P-glycoprotein in substantial amounts exhibit the multidrug resistance phenotype, in which they are resistant to a wide variety of structurally unrelated cytotoxic compounds (15Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar; 10Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance, including that mediated by P-glycoprotein, is a serious problem limiting the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy. It is of clinical as well as biochemical interest, therefore, to develop an understanding of the mechanism by which P-glycoprotein confers multidrug resistance upon cells. Reduced drug accumulation in P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cells is the result of an increased rate of drug efflux (21Nielsen D. Skovsgaard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar; 4Altenberg G.A. Vanoye C.G. Horton J.K. Reuss L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4654-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in some cases a decreased rate of drug influx (32Stein W.D. Cardarelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar; 18Homolya L. Holló A. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain how P-glycoprotein performs this function. In the conventional model for a transporter, P-glycoprotein binds substrates in the cytoplasm and expels them directly into the extracellular medium, using ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. In the “hydrophobic vacuum cleaner” model (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993), P-glycoprotein interacts directly with substrates in the plasma membrane and pumps them out of the cell, accounting for both increased drug efflux and decreased drug influx rates (the substrates are expelled prior to entering the cytoplasm), as well as for the hydrophobic or amphiphilic nature of the known substrates. According to the “flippase” model (17Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), P-glycoprotein encounters drugs in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and flips them to the outer leaflet from which they diffuse into the extracellular medium. In a completely different model, P-glycoprotein raises the intracellular pH ( 26Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12555-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and/or depolarizes the plasma membrane electrical potential (27Roepe P.D. Wei L.Y. Cruz J. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11042-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) of the cell by acting as a proton pump, a chloride channel, or by a less direct means, thereby reducing intracellular accumulation of weakly basic, cationic, lipophilic compounds or reducing pH-dependent binding of the compounds to their intracellular targets. This model avoids the necessity of P-glycoprotein having to recognize numerous, structurally diverse compounds. For the most part, P-glycoprotein function has been studied with whole cell or plasma membrane systems in which numerous proteins and other cellular components and processes may complicate interpretation of the data. With studies of P-glycoprotein function, these confounding variables include differences between multidrug resistant and sensitive cells, such as differences in intracellular pH and plasma membrane electrical potential, membrane lipid composition, and energy metabolism. In addition, it has been proposed that drug transport by P-glycoprotein involves other cellular components such as glutathione S-transferase ( 35West I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 42-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 (reviewed in 12Gatmaitan Z.C. Arias I.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1993; 24: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Distinguishing definitively between hypotheses would be greatly facilitated by the availability of a means of measuring drug transport by purified P-glycoprotein reconstituted into unilamellar lipid vesicles where the pH and membrane potential can be controlled or monitored, the lipid composition is the same for control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes, the only source of energy is ATP hydrolysis by P-glycoprotein, and systems for chemically modifying xenobiotic substances are not present. 30Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar reported transport of radiolabeled colchicine by partially purified and reconstituted P-glycoprotein. We described previously (Shapiro and Ling, 1994) a method for purifying class I hamster P-glycoprotein to a high degree and reconstituting it into a lipid milieu with retention of ATPase activity. In this paper, we describe fluorescence-based methods for continuous monitoring of transport of Hoechst 33342 by purified, reconstituted P-glycoprotein. This assay demonstrates for the first time that highly purified P-glycoprotein is capable of multidrug transport and has been used to distinguish between hypothetical mechanisms of P-glycoprotein function. P-glycoprotein was purified as described (Shapiro and Ling, 1994) with a few modifications. The pre-elution wash of the immunoaffinity column with 10 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM CHAPS1( 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonateAMP-PNPadenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateDPXp-xylene-bispyridinium bromideIAEDANS5-((((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acidoctyl glucosiden-octyl-β-D-glucopyranosidepyranine8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acidSDM4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. )(Calbiochem) was pooled with the subsequent two fractions. These latter fractions were doubled in volume to 10 ml each. The 30-ml pool was then concentrated to 600-800 μl. These modifications doubled the yield of P-glycoprotein from the immunoaffinity column without loss of purity. 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide 5-((((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. For most experiments, about 10 μg of purified P-glycoprotein in 50 μl of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM CHAPS was mixed with 0.5 mg of sonicated, crude soybean L-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma), 17.5 mM octyl glucoside (Sigma), 50 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.4), 125 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA in 150 μl. The phosphatidylcholine pellets were suspended in water at 20 mg/ml with a Dounce homogenizer and sonicated for 15 min under nitrogen in a glass tube in a bath-type sonicator at room temperature. The mixture was incubated 45 min on ice, then applied to a 0.8 × 19-cm column of Sephadex G-50-80 equilibrated with 50 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.4), 125 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The column was eluted with the same buffer. Liposomes were collected from the void volume between about 3.4 and 4.1 ml of eluted volume. Control liposomes were prepared with the same composition but lacking P-glycoprotein. The quantities of control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes were compared by their ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra between 250 and 550 nm, a combination of absorbance and light scattering. The spectra for the two types of liposomes were parallel except for a small excess absorbance centered at about 280 nm in the P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes due to the absorbance of the protein. For experiments in which pyranine (Molecular Probes) was included in the liposomes, except for the experiment shown in Fig. 1, 1 mM neutralized pyranine was included in the reconstitution mixture. In addition, 200 μl of 1 mM pyranine in buffer was preloaded onto the Sephadex columns prior to application of the reconstitution mixture to prevent loss of the pyranine from the reconstitution mixture by gel filtration. See the legend to Fig. 1 for the details of the reconstitution performed for the experiments shown there. The internal volume of the liposome preparations was determined by incorporating pyranine or dithiothreitol-IAEDANS (IAEDANS (Molecular Probes) reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol) into the liposome interior using the procedures described above, except that 10 mM pyranine or 19 mM dithiothreitol-IAEDANS was used instead of 1 mM pyranine. The pyranine and dithiothreitol-IAEDANS concentrations of the resulting liposome suspensions were determined by absorbance spectroscopy, using extinction coefficients of 21,000 M-1-cm-1 at 454 nm for pyranine and 57,000 M-1-cm-1 at 334 nm for IAEDANS, with correction for light scattering due to the liposomes. The internal volume of 10 mM pyranine or 19 mM dithiothreitol-IAEDANS required to yield the measured concentration in the measured volume of liposome suspension was calculated. The internal volume of liposomes prepared as described was 1.17 ± 0.09 μl (n = 5). About 92% of the included pyranine was unquenched by 10 mM of externally added DPX (Molecular Probes), a potent quencher of pyranine fluorescence, demonstrating that nearly all the pyranine was localized internally and that the liposomes were tightly sealed. A 300-μl aliquot of control or P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes having the same amount of liposomes was placed in a quartz fluorescence cuvette with a 2-mm path length for excitation and a 10-mm path length for emission. Fluorescence intensity was measured with an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer at 1-s intervals using 355 nm excitation and 457 nm emission. The excitation and emission bandwidths were 0.5 and 16 nm, respectively. The narrow excitation bandwidth was used to eliminate photobleaching caused by strong illumination. After 100 s of data acquisition, 3 μl of 2.5 mM Hoechst 33342 in water was added. Hoechst 33342 binding to the liposomes was essentially complete within 30 s, as judged by the fluorescence increase. About 90% of the Hoechst 33342 added became bound to the lipid. This was determined by pelleting the liposomes by ultracentrifugation and measuring the Hoechst 33342 concentration in the supernatant spectrophotometrically. After a further 900 s, 16 μl of 50 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.4), 60 mM MgCl2, 30 mM Na4ATP, and 40 mM dithiothreitol was added to initiate transport. The addition did not alter the external chloride concentration. Dithiothreitol was included because it slightly stimulates ATP hydrolysis by P-glycoprotein (Shapiro and Ling, 1994). Other additions were made as described in the figure legends. Mixing was performed manually, which required 30 s, during which data acquisition was halted. Transport was monitored for 2400 s. For all transport measurements, fluorescence intensity versus time traces were normalized to an intensity value of 1 just prior to the addition of MgATP. To show the effect of P-glycoprotein, the normalized trace for control liposomes was often subtracted from the normalized trace for P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes. The signal noise in many measurements was very large due to the high photomultiplier gain needed because of the low intensity of the exciting light used to avoid photobleaching. To reduce this noise, time points were often averaged over a moving 15-s window. When comparing subtracted traces, the vertical positions of some traces were shifted for clarity. Occasional large, temporary, vertical deviations from the trace base line are instrument artifacts. The pH-sensitive fluorophore pyranine was used to measure the intraliposomal pH (19Kano K. Fendler J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 509: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar; 34Young X.K. Metabolite Transport across the Chloroplast Inner Envelope Membrane. 1992; (Ph. D Thesis, Cornell University)Google Scholar). Fluorescence excitation spectra of 10 μM pyranine in 50 mM Tricine-NaOH, 125 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA buffers of various pH at 37°C were measured to establish a pH calibration curve for pyranine. The emission wavelength was 515.2 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were both 4 nm. The ratio of fluorescence at the pH-sensitive excitation wavelength, 452.6 nm, to the fluorescence at the pH-insensitive excitation wavelength, 419.0 nm, was plotted against the pH of the buffer, measured at 37°C after the spectra were collected. The resulting calibration curve (Fig. 8A) was linear over the pH range of 6.5-7.5. For measurements of intraliposomal pH during transport of Hoechst 33342, liposomes containing 1 mM pyranine were used. Pyranine fluorescence was monitored at 515.2 nm while the excitation wavelength switched between 452.6 and 419.0 nm. One ratio measurement was made every 5 s, and the corresponding pH values were obtained from the calibration curve. Where DPX was used, it was added to 10 mM to the liposome suspension from a concentrated stock solution in 50 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.4), 125 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The ATPase activity of reconstituted P-glycoprotein was measured as described in Shapiro and Ling(1994). Crude soybean L-α-phosphatidylcholine was chosen as the source of lipid for reconstituting P-glycoprotein for transport measurements. The advantages of this lipid are its low cost, ease of handling, and its formation of tightly sealed unilamellar vesicles. For 0.5 mg of lipid and 10 μg of P-glycoprotein in 200 μl of the reconstitution mixture, the concentration of the detergent octyl glucoside was varied in order to optimize the reconstitution for retention of ATPase activity, assuming that ATP hydrolysis is coupled to transport, and maximal intraliposomal volume, so that there will be somewhere for the transported substrate to go. The internal volume, measured by the amount of pyranine incorporated, was maximal when 17.5 mM octyl glucoside was used (Fig. 1A). (The reconstitution mixture also contained 0.5 mM CHAPS, which causes a small amount of reconstitution in the absence of octyl glucoside (Shapiro and Ling, 1994).) The ATPase activity of the resulting P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes, however, was maximized by minimizing the octyl glucoside concentration, but no pyranine was incorporated into the resulting liposomes. Nearly half the ATPase activity was lost when 17.5 mM octyl glucoside was used. This appears to reflect a reduction in the amount of P-glycoprotein incorporated into the liposomes (Fig. 1B). In contrast, higher detergent concentrations improved the incorporation of P-glycoprotein but resulted in even greater losses of ATPase activity, suggesting either that the protein was damaged by high octyl glucoside concentrations or that the catalytic sites were primarily inside the liposomes. For transport experiments, 17.5 mM octyl glucoside was used in the reconstitution mixture to maximize the internal volume of the liposomes while maintaining acceptable ATPase activity. ATP was added only externally. We attempted to determine the orientation of P-glycoprotein in the liposome membranes using the CHAPS permeabilization method of 30Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, who found that a 2-fold increase in the ATPase activity of reconstituted, partially purified P-glycoprotein occurred in the presence of 2 mM CHAPS to permeabilize the liposomes to ATP. The interpretation of this result was that 50% of the P-glycoprotein was right-side-out, i.e. with its catalytic sites inside the liposomes. Our liposomes were also permeabilized by 2 mM CHAPS: 94% of the fluorescence of 10 mM entrapped pyranine was quenched by the addition of 2 mM CHAPS in the presence of 10 mM external DPX, an impermeant quencher of pyranine fluorescence (data not shown). In contrast to the results of 30Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, however, the ATPase activity of our reconstituted P-glycoprotein was not increased by the addition of 2 mM CHAPS. Instead, the ATPase activity was slightly decreased (Fig. 2A). This result is consistent with the P-glycoprotein having a uniformly inside-out orientation. Higher CHAPS concentrations increased the ATPase activity, with a 6-fold increase occurring at 6-10 mM CHAPS (Fig. 2A). This result was surprising because concentrations of CHAPS in excess of 2 mM were previously found to inhibit the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein in detergent solution (Shapiro and Ling, 1994). The specific ATPase activity of reconstituted P-glycoprotein in the presence of 8 mM CHAPS is much higher (at least 1.3 μmol/min-mg assuming a recovery of 5 μg of P-glycoprotein in the liposomes) than the specific activity of the purified P-glycoprotein prior to reconstitution (0.3 μmol/min-mg; Shapiro and Ling, 1994). CHAPS may stimulate the ATPase activity of reconstituted P-glycoprotein, much as chemosensitizers like verapamil do (Shapiro and Ling, 1994). The ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (Shapiro and Ling, 1994) and other reagents that react with cysteine residues (9Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide can be prevented by inclusion of MgATP (2Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that cysteine residues in or near the catalytic sites are the targets for the inhibitors. To confirm the orientation of reconstituted P-glycoprotein, we treated it with 100 μM 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SDM); Molecular Probes), a membrane-impermeant maleimide, to inhibit external catalytic sites. SDM did not cause leakage of the liposomes, according to the pyranine quenching assay mentioned above. After removal of the excess reagent, the liposomes were permeabilized with 8 mM CHAPS. If there were internal catalytic sites, the addition of CHAPS should have elicited catalytic activity from them. Instead, there was virtually no ATPase activity (Fig. 2B). The above results are completely consistent with the conclusion that the reconstituted P-glycoprotein was uniformly in the inside-out orientation. Furthermore, these results indicate that the increased ATPase activity in the presence of CHAPS is due to stimulation of the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein rather than exposure of internal catalytic sites. The lipophilic nature of the substrates is a serious problem in designing an assay for transport by P-glycoprotein reconstituted into liposomes because of the high lipid-to-protein ratio, typically 50:1 by mass, as compared to about 1:1 for plasma membranes. The substrates concentrate in the lipid phase, creating a very high background of bound substrate. Thus the substrate transported into the liposomes is difficult to detect above the background of lipid-bound substrate. To overcome this problem we used fluorescence techniques to continuously monitor transport. By collecting many data points over time, we were able to detect small changes in fluorescence intensity due to transport against a high background fluorescence. In addition, continuous monitoring allows an entire time course to be collected from a single specimen. Hoechst 33342 was previously shown to be excluded from multidrug-resistant cells expressing P-glycoprotein (20Lalande M.E. Ling V. Miller R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar; 5Chen A.Y. Yu C. Bodley A. Peng L.F. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1332-1337PubMed Google Scholar) and is apparently a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Hoechst 33342 may have potential use in chemotherapy because it inhibits topoisomerase I (5Chen A.Y. Yu C. Bodley A. Peng L.F. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1332-1337PubMed Google Scholar). Hoechst 33342 competes with the photoaffinity reagent and P-glycoprotein substrate azidopine for binding to P-glycoprotein (Fig. 3), demonstrating that Hoechst 33342 interacts directly with P-glycoprotein. That the inhibition of photolabeling was not due simply to absorption of the ultraviolet light by Hoechst 33342 is demonstrated by the presence of a second photolabeled band at low molecular weight, the labeling intensity of which is unchanged by Hoechst 33342. Hoechst 33342 at 25 μM has no effect on the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes (data not shown). Other known P-glycoprotein substrates such as daunorubicin and colchicine also have little or no effect on ATPase activity (Shapiro and Ling, 1994), whereas chemosensitizers such as verapamil, amiodarone, and trifluoperazine, and some substrates, such as vinblastine, cause substantial enhancements of the ATPase activity. Hoechst 33342 is widely used for its property of exhibiting vastly increased fluorescence upon binding to DNA. We found that Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was also greatly increased by binding to liposomes (Fig. 4). We made use of this property in designing an assay for transport by purified, reconstituted P-glycoprotein. Fig. 4 shows the degree of fluorescence enhancement of Hoechst 33342 as a function of the concentration of degraded herring sperm DNA (Sigma) or crude soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The effect saturated at about 0.5 mg/ml lipid and a fluorescence enhancement of about 750-fold, about half the fluorescence enhancement achieved with DNA. A molecule of Hoechst 33342 experiences essentially a 100% fluorescence decrease upon going from the lipid to the aqueous phase. Therefore, if P-glycoprotein transports Hoechst 33342 from the liposome membrane to the interior aqueous space of liposomes, the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence should decrease. The fractional decrease in fluorescence intensity will be equal to the fraction of lipid-bound Hoechst 33342 transported. As can be seen in Fig. 5, after addition of ATP the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence of P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes decreased with time with respect to the control liposomes as the Hoechst 33342 was removed from the membrane by P-glycoprotein. The large, variable, instantaneous fluorescence drop occurring at 1000 s was due to the addition of the ATP-containing solution. A 5% drop was caused by dilution. Additional loss of fluorescence may have been caused by binding of Hoechst 33342 to ATP, thereby reducing the amount of lipid-bound Hoechst 33342. Finally, a slight acidification due to addition and dilution of the concentrated MgATP stock solution contributed to the instantaneous decrease in Hoechst 33342 fluorescence. The typical size of this drop was about 15%, but there was variation between experiments between about 5 and 20%. The reason for this variation is unknown. There was no consistent difference between control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes in the size of the instantaneous fluorescence drop. The extent of the slow, usually linear fluorescence decrease due to Hoechst 33342 transport by P-glycoprotein following addition of MgATP was typically about 5% in 40 min, varying between 3 and 7%. This variation was probably due to variations in the amount of P-glycoprotein reconstituted as well as in the activity of the P-glycoprotein from different preparations. In some cases, it was necessary to begin the reconstitution with 20 μg of P-glycoprotein rather than 10 μg to achieve the 5% fluorescence decrease. This signal represents a net rate of transport of about 9 pmol/min, or about 6 nmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein, assuming a typical 50% recovery of P-glycoprotein in the reconstitution. The turnover number was therefore 1 molecule of Hoechst 33342 transported/min/molecule of P-glycoprotein. This slow rate represents the difference between the rate of Hoechst 33342 transport out of the membrane and the rate of rebinding of transported Hoechst 33342 to the membrane. The actual rate of transport is likely to be much faster than the measured rate because the rebinding rate is high; about 90% of 25 μM added Hoechst 33342 binds to the liposomes within 30 s (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5). The rate of ATP hydrolysis is about 50 times faster than the apparent rate of transport. By incorporating DNA into the aqueous interior of the liposomes, an increasing fluorescence due to transport could be seen,2( 2A. B. Shapiro and V. Ling, unpublished results. )demonstrating that the Hoechst 33342 was transported into the liposome interior. As discussed below (Fig. 8C), 25 μM Hoechst 33342 can cause liposome aggregation and fusion. Fusion causes transient leakage of the liposome membranes. There does not appear to be any difference in the rate of fusion between control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes. Liposome aggregation and fusion do not affect the transport measurement, which detects removal of Hoechst 33342 from the lipid phase, not concentration of the substrate in the aqueous phase. The purified transport system allows us to determine whether transport is coupled to the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein. Our previous studies of the ATPase activity of purified, reconstituted P-glycoprotein, as well as studies of the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein done by others (Shapiro and Ling, 1994 and references therein), demonstrated that the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein requires divalent cations such as Mg2+, and is inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of sodium orthovanadate and N-ethylmaleimide. Fig. 6A shows that transport of Hoechst 33342 by P-glycoprotein was inhibited by omission of Mg2+ and by 50 μM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a concentration which completely inhibits P-glycoprotein ATPase activity. Fig. 6B shows that Hoechst 33342 transport was inhibited by reaction of the reconstituted P-glycoprotein with 50 μMN-ethylmaleimide. Inhibition was partially prevented by inclusion of 3 mM MgATP during the reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. 1Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar showed that MgATP protects P-glycoprotein ATPase activity against inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. Furthermore, transport of Hoechst 33342 by P-glycoprotein was not supported by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) (Fig. 6C). These results demonstrate that Hoechst 33342 transport by P-glycoprotein requires ATP hydrolysis. Numerous compounds act as multidrug resistance modulators, or chemosensitizers, restoring drug sensitivity to multidrug-resistant cells. The purified transport system allows us to determine whether chemosensitization is due to a direct effect on P-glycoprotein. In our assay, neither verapamil nor amiodarone appeared to cause substantial inhibition of Hoechst 33342 transport at 25 μM Hoechst 33342 (data not shown). Inhibition by verapamil and amiodarone was apparent, however, when the Hoechst 33342 concentration was reduced to 2 μM (Fig. 7). It may be that the chemosensitizers do not compete effectively with Hoechst 33342 for binding to P-glycoprotein under the conditions of high lipid concentration in the transport assay. Because of the hypothesis that P-glycoprotein may transport drugs indirectly by raising intracellular pH (Roepe, 1992), we monitored the intraliposomal pH using the pH-sensitive, hydrophilic fluorophore pyranine entrapped in the liposomes. In the absence of Hoechst 33342, the pH inside the control liposomes was stable (Fig. 8B). After the addition of MgATP, which caused a slight acidification of the external pH, the internal pH of the control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes gradually decreased as the small proton gradient dissipated as protons leaked into the liposomes. Of possible significance was a small but reproducible pH rise inside P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes with no Hoechst 33342, which was not observed in control liposomes. The reason for this is unknown. It could not have been an energy-dependent process because it occurred prior to the addition of MgATP. There were no large differences in intraliposomal pH between control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes in the absence of Hoechst 33342 following ATP addition, which demonstrates that P-glycoprotein does not act as an ATP-dependent proton translocator. During the course of intraliposomal pH measurements in the presence of Hoechst 33342, we discovered that, as a function of time, Hoechst 33342 caused the liposomes to aggregate and leak, probably due to liposome fusion. Liposome leakage allowed pyranine to escape from the liposomes so that the pH measurement did not represent only the internal pH. By adding the non-lipid permeant pyranine quencher DPX to the outside of the liposomes, we restricted the pH measurement at each time point to those liposomes which had not yet undergone fusion and leakage (Fig. 8C). At the 10 mM concentration of DPX used, pyranine fluorescence was completely quenched if the liposomes had released their pyranine or allowed entrance of DPX. In the absence of Hoechst 33342, leakage of the liposomes does not occur, and the results look like those of Fig. 8B (Table I). The large decrease in pyranine fluorescence at both excitation wavelengths after addition of Hoechst 33342 shows that, over time, most of the liposomes eventually become leaky. The ratiometric method of determining the pH is insensitive to the fluorescence intensity, however. In the experiment shown in Fig. 8C, the internal pH of the P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes was slightly lower than that of the control liposomes (Table I). This difference was not consistently observed, however; in another experiment (not shown), the P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes had a slightly higher internal pH than the control liposomes.TABLE ISummary of pH measurements inside liposomes Open table in a new tab After addition of MgATP, there was no significant change in the difference in internal pH between control and P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes (Fig. 8C and). If P-glycoprotein were acting as an ATP-dependent proton pump, but were only present in a fraction of the liposomes, the acidification might be missed. The pH measurement is sensitive to a change of about 0.01 pH units, although the measurement variation is somewhat greater, at most 0.1 pH units. Although we do not know what fraction of the liposomes contain one or more active P-glycoprotein molecules, if we conservatively estimate that only 20% of the liposomes contained proton-pumping P-glycoprotein, which created an internal acidification of one pH unit from 7.0 to 6.0, then the measured internal pH would appear to be 6.55 for the entire liposome population. No such large changes specific to P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes occurred after addition of MgATP in our experiments (Table I). Furthermore, the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone had no effect on the internal pH (Table I). It is therefore quite unlikely that P-glycoprotein transports Hoechst 33342 indirectly by creating a pH gradient. By using purified, reconstituted P-glycoprotein, we have demonstrated for the first time that P-glycoprotein by itself is capable of direct drug transport. The reconstituted system behaves qualitatively like P-glycoprotein in vivo with respect to the requirement for ATP hydrolysis and inhibition by chemosensitizers. Our system makes it possible to test definitively hypotheses about P-glycoprotein function (such as the “hydrophobic vacuum cleaner” hypothesis (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993)). A fluorescence method was devised specifically to distinguish movement of the transported substrate between lipid and aqueous phases, which is not possible with assays that measure the uptake of radioactive substrates. The results of the Hoechst 33342 transport assay support the concept that transport occurs from the membrane because the assay measures loss of Hoechst 33342 from the lipid phase. An essential criterion for an active transporter is that it be able to pump its substrate against a concentration gradient. Multidrug-resistant cells typically maintain intracellular drug concentrations well below the extracellular concentrations. 30Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar reported accumulation of colchicine against a 5.6-fold concentration gradient by reconstituted, partially purified P-glycoprotein. Similarly, Ruetz and Gros(1994) reported accumulation of colchicine by P-glycoprotein-containing yeast secretory vesicles to 7-fold higher internal than external concentration. 28Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar demonstrated concentrative uptake of vinblastine by P-glycoprotein-containing inside-out plasma membrane vesicles. As stated above, the leakage of liposomes caused by Hoechst 33342-induced aggregation in our system makes it difficult to determine the amount by which P-glycoprotein concentrates Hoechst 33342 inside the liposomes. Another consideration is that the majority of the Hoechst 33342 is bound to the lipid membranes. The concentration of Hoechst 33342 in the external aqueous phase is therefore much lower than the 25 μM average concentration, whereas the concentration in the lipid phase, which has a very small volume compared to the external aqueous phase, is very much higher. This situation makes discussion of substrate gradients problematic under conditions where the concentration of lipids is high, as in proteoliposomes. In our assay, P-glycoprotein was actually transporting Hoechst 33342 down its concentration gradient, but this required energy because of the strong partitioning of the dye into the lipid phase. The lack of enhanced acidification of the liposome interior by P-glycoprotein enables us to conclude that P-glycoprotein is not directly responsible for the increased intracellular pH of some multidrug-resistant cell lines, and that this alkalinization is not necessary to account for P-glycoprotein-mediated decreases in intracellular drug accumulation. Similarly, our measurements allow us to rule out alteration of the membrane potential as the means by which P-glycoprotein affects drug accumulation. In our experiments, there was no membrane potential set up across the liposome membranes initially, nor was there at any time a chloride gradient by which P-glycoprotein could create a membrane potential by acting as a chloride channel, as has been proposed (33Valverde M. Diaz M. Seplveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar; 14Gill D.R. Hyde S. Higgins C.F. Valverde M.A. Mintenig G.M. Seplveda F.V. Cell. 1992; 71: 23-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The lack of acidification of the interior of P-glycoprotein-containing liposomes relative to the interior of control liposomes rules out the generation of a membrane potential by proton pumping by P-glycoprotein. Another demonstration that the mechanism of action of P-glycoprotein is not to alter the plasma membrane electrical potential is the observation by Ruetz and Gros(1994) that P-glycoprotein-containing yeast secretory vesicles could take up vinblastine against an unfavorable membrane potential. The apparent rate of Hoechst 33342 transport by P-glycoprotein in proteoliposomes was very slow. ATP-dependent transporters usually exhibit tight coupling of ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport. P-glycoprotein, however, has a high basal rate of ATP hydrolysis (Shapiro and Ling, and references therein). In our transport assay, P-glycoprotein hydrolyzed about 50 ATP molecules/molecule of Hoechst 33342 transported. This poor coupling represents excess ATP hydrolysis due to both the basal rate of ATP hydrolysis and futile cycling of the Hoechst 33342 between lipid and aqueous phases. It will be a challenge for the future to devise a method to prevent rebinding of the substrate to the lipid in order to determine the true rate of Hoechst 33342 transport by P-glycoprotein. Many questions remain regarding the function of P-glycoprotein. If P-glycoprotein encounters its substrates in the membrane, as our results and those of others suggest (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993), then in which leaflet of the membrane is the substrate encountered, and how is the energy released by ATP hydrolysis transduced into vectorial substrate movement? Why do some chemosensitizers increase the rate of ATP hydrolysis by P-glycoprotein while inhibiting drug transport? Why do some substrates have no effect on the basal ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, and why does P-glycoprotein have ATPase activity in the absence of any substrate? How can P-glycoprotein recognize and actively transport numerous chemically distinct compounds? Does P-glycoprotein function as a monomer or an oligomer (see 23Poruchynsky M.S. Ling V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4163-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)? What role does post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, play in drug transport? By studying purified P-glycoprotein reconstituted into liposomes, we have begun to develop a system which is enabling us to solve many of these questions about P-glycoprotein. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Ian Tanock for allowing us extensive use of his spectrofluorometers and to Dr. David Hedley for the suggestion to try Hoechst 33342 in the transport assay. We are also grateful to Francis Tan for many valuable scientific discussions, to Monika Duthie and Farida Sarangi for technical support, and to Stephanie Sulpizi for large scale cell culture."

https://openalex.org/W2045563357,"B16 mouse melanoma cells adhere to and spread on laminin. We have previously shown that cell spreading is uncoupled from adhesion when unglycosylated laminin is used as a substratum; spreading was restored by a Pronase digest of laminin which became inactive when it was specifically depleted of its mannoside peptides; spreading was also specifically restored by mannosides such as mannan, Man9, and Man6, but not Man3. The effector mannosides bind to a cell surface receptor, previously shown by direct and indirect methods. We have now identified the receptor as cell surface calreticulin by isolating it via mannan affinity chromatography and showing its sequence identity with mouse calreticulin. Anti-calreticulin antibodies confirm this identity, decorate the B16 cell surface, and block cell spreading. Purified B16 cell calreticulin from whole cell lysates successfully competes with cell surface calreticulin and prevents cell spreading. The composite data implicate cell surface calreticulin as a putative lectin that must be occupied to initiate spreading of laminin-adherent B16 cells.

It is well established that components of the extracellular matrix (ECM)1( 1The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideTBSTris-buffered salineNHSN-hydroxysuccinimideHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIgYimmunoglobulin YBSAbovine serum albuminEHSEngelbreth-Holm-SwarmIgGimmunoglobulin GDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. )are able to support adhesion and spreading of a variety of cell types. In many cases, the interaction of cell surface integrins with specific peptide sequences in the ECM molecules is responsible for triggering the adhesion and spreading response (9Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Integrin ectodomains undergo well characterized interactions with components of the ECM, whereas integrin cytoplasmic domains are known to interact with a variety of cytoskeletal components, including α-actinin and talin. Although details of the signaling mechanisms remain to be elucidated, integrin-ECM interactions result in the clustering of integrins into focal contacts, where they provide a site on the cell membrane for tethering the cytoskeleton, and for the subsequent initiation of signaling events which mediate cell spreading (27Schaller M. Parsons J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). extracellular matrix phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride Tris-buffered saline N-hydroxysuccinimide high pressure liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoglobulin Y bovine serum albumin Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm immunoglobulin G Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. We have previously demonstrated that B16 mouse melanoma cells plated onto laminin demonstrate rapid adhesion followed by extensive spreading. A number of studies indicate that β1 integrins are involved in the adhesion process. 19Kramer R.H. Vu M. Cheng Y.F. Ramos D.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1991; 10: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar have clearly described the involvement of β1 integrins in the adhesion of mouse melanoma cells to the ECM. In addition, our laboratory has demonstrated the clustering of β1 integrins at focal contacts when B16 cells are seeded onto a laminin substratum (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994a). Although integrin-ECM interactions are important for cell adhesion in this system, cell adhesion and spreading are uncoupled when these cells adhere to laminin which is devoid of its repertoire of N-linked carbohydrates (7Dean J.W. Chandrasekaran S. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12553-12562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those carbohydrates span a range of structures from oligomannosides to complex tri- and tetra-antennary substituents; relative abundance of the different structures is quite variable (2Arumugham R.G. Hsieh T.C. Tanzer M.L. Laine R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; 11Fujiwara S. Shinkai H. Deutzmann R. Paulsson M. Timpl R. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; 18Knibbs R.N. Perini F. Goldstein I.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6379-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A Pronase digest of laminin restores cell spreading, but it is ineffective when specifically depleted of its mannoside peptides; spreading is also specifically restored by suitable mannosides, e.g. mannan, Man9, and Man6, but not Man3 (4Chandrasekaran S. Tanzer M.L. Giniger M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3367-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chandrasekaran S. Tanzer M.L. Giniger M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3356-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This response appears to be a surface receptor mediated event, as demonstrated by visualization of mannoside probes, and by binding studies with radiolabeled Man9 (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994a). Although interactions of β1 integrins with the protein backbone of laminin are an important component in B16 cell adhesion, our data clearly indicate that the carbohydrate moieties of laminin play a critical role in triggering cell spreading. Furthermore, binding of effector mannosides in the absence of integrin binding is ineffective for initiating B16 cell adhesion or spreading (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994b), implying that a specific order of ligand occupancy must occur for such cellular responsiveness. Thus, both integrin and lectin must either be occupied simultaneously, or integrin occupancy must be followed by lectin occupancy, if cell spreading is to occur. Identification and characterization of the responding B16 cell surface lectin became our next objective. Cell surface lectins which recognize mannosides are potential candidates but have not previously been implicated in cytoskeletal responses (31Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have isolated the B16 surface putative lectin responsible for initiation of spreading of laminin-adherent cells. The putative lectin is mouse calreticulin, as shown by sequence identity, antibody immunostaining of calreticulin in B16 cell lysates, on cell surfaces and of purified B16 cell calreticulin. Antibodies block cell spreading, as does exogenous B16 calreticulin, serving as a competitor. These composite results indicate that cell surface calreticulin must be engaged to trigger spreading of laminin-adherent B16 mouse melanoma cells. Mannan affinity matrix was prepared by coupling yeast mannan (Sigma) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using the protocol provided by the vendor. Routinely, B16 cells from eight 245-mm2 plates were released at early confluence by incubation with 2 mM EDTA in ice-cold Earle's basic salt solution. Cells were washed three times with PBS (20 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and subsequently lysed in 40 ml of a buffer composed of 0.02 M Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM MnCl2 In addition, the lysis buffer contained the following protease inhibitors: 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM PMSF. Following lysis, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified lysate was mixed with 3 ml of mannan affinity matrix and allowed to rotate end-over-end at 4°C overnight. Gel was subsequently transferred to a column and washed with three column volumes of lysis buffer, followed by elution with a buffer composed of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF. Alternatively, 50 mM mannose was substituted for EDTA in the elution buffer. Where indicated, cells were surface labeled prior to lysis with NHS-biotin or sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) essentially as described by 16Hurley W. Finkelstein E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar. Assessment of cells before and after the labeling procedure indicated that both total cell number and cell viability did not change significantly. Mannan affinity-purified calreticulin obtained from B16 cell lysates was concentrated and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein was subsequently blotted onto Problot membrane (Applied Biosystems) and visualized via staining with Coomassie Blue. Tryptic digestion of the protein, HPLC purification of the subsequent peptides, and N-terminal microsequencing of purified peptides was performed by the Macromolecular Structure Facility, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI. Rabbit anti-human calreticulin antiserum was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Neshanic Station, NJ. Sheep anti-human calreticulin antiserum was the generous gift of Dr. H.-D. Söling, Georg-August-Universität, Göttingen, Germany. Purified avian IgY was prepared from the egg yolks of a White Leghorn hen immunized with mannan affinity-purified B16 calreticulin. Prior to immunization, the protein was further purified by SDS-PAGE, and immunization was achieved by intramuscular injection of 100 μg of purified protein in a slurry of polyacrylamide and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. An identical boost was administered 1 month following initial immunization. Purification of IgY was achieved using serial polyethylene glycol precipitations of yolk protein, as described previously (1Akita E.M. Nakai S. J. Food Sci. 1992; 57: 629-634Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Control IgY was purified from the yolks of eggs collected prior to immunization. Both preparations were monitored for purity by SDS-PAGE. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of 20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar under reducing conditions. For all polyacrylamide electrophoretic experiments 5-15% gels were used. Where indicated, electrophoretically separated proteins were blotted onto supported nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) using the method of 32Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar. Immunodetection of calreticulin on nitrocellulose filters was achieved essentially using the protocol supplied by Affinity Bioreagents. Visualization of immunoreactive proteins was achieved using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Corp.). B16 melanoma cells were seeded under standard conditions onto glass coverslips that had been precoated with purified EHS tumor laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 50 μg/ml in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were allowed to grow overnight under standard temperature and atmospheric conditions. All labeling steps were carried out at room temperature and were followed by three washes in PBS. Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 3% fresh paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and, where indicated, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Fixed cells were subsequently blocked by incubation with 20 mg/ml purified swine IgG (Sigma) for 1 h, and calreticulin was labeled using sheep anti-human calreticulin antibody at a dilution of 1:50 in PBS containing 1% BSA, followed by incubation for 45 min. Samples were then blocked with a solution of 4 mg/ml swine IgG in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h and treated with fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Pierce) at a concentration of 30 μg/ml for 45 min. Coverslips were mounted in a solution of 2.5% n-propyl gallate in 1:1 PBS:glycerol, and the samples were observed with a Nikon Optiphote microscope. Cell-spreading assays were essentially performed as described previously (Chandrasekaran, 1994b). Purified preimmune and postimmunization chicken antibodies were extensively dialyzed against PBS prior to use in cell spreading assays. B16 cells at approximately 80,000 cells/ml of serum-free DMEM were incubated with indicated concentrations of IgY for 30 min on ice. Cells were then seeded at 8000 cells/well, in the same solution, in non-tissue culture-treated plastic 96-well plates (Falcon) which contained a surface of 5 μg/well EHS tumor laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following 1 h of incubation at standard temperature and atmospheric conditions, cells were fixed and stained as described previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994b). To assess cell spreading on laminin, 5 μg of laminin/well in PBS was dried overnight in triplicate wells in plastic non-tissue culture-treated 96-well plates. Subsequently, wells were washed, and cells were seeded, as described previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994b). To assess the effects of purified calreticulin on spreading induced by a laminin substratum, 5 μg/well laminin was incubated with purified calreticulin at a molar ratio of 1:20 (laminin:calreticulin) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM MnCl2 at room temperature for 2 h in triplicate wells in non-tissue culture-treated 96-well plates. Plates were subsequently treated as described above, and assessment of cell spreading was performed as described previously (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994b). For controls, hemoglobin (Sigma) or BSA (Pierce) were substituted for calreticulin, at a molar ratio to laminin of 20:1. In order to purify the cell surface lectin responsible for triggering cell spreading, an oligomannoside affinity column was prepared by coupling yeast mannan to agarose beads. Mannan affinity chromatography has been previously used successfully to purify plasma lectins (15Holmskov U. Teisner B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Jensenius J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10120-10125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the methodology was adapted to our needs. When a clarified lysate of B16 cells was passed over the affinity matrix, we noted the retardation and significant purification of a 60-kDa protein; the protein could be eluted with suitable concentrations of either mannose or EDTA. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, biotinylation of cell surface proteins prior to cell lysis and purification indicates that a portion of the 60-kDa oligomannoside-binding protein resides on the cell surface. Cell surface labeling using either NHS-biotin or sulfo-NHS-biotin yielded similar results. Lane 6 serves as a control which shows that the 60-kDa protein does not have intrinsic streptavidin binding properties. Other controls were done which showed: 1) intracellular actin was not biotinylated by the surface labeling procedure; and 2) a pseudo-affinity column, prepared without mannan, did not bind the 60 kDa protein. Identification of the 60-kDa protein was achieved by N-terminal microsequencing of tryptic peptides obtained from purified protein. These analyses provided complete sequences of two different tryptides and a partial sequence of a third tryptide (Fig. 2). These fragments were identical to mouse calreticulin; although calreticulin is a highly conserved protein, the lysine at position 63 is unique to mouse calreticulin. This result lends confidence that the sequence is genuine and derives from the B16 mouse cells rather than from the culture medium or some nonspecific contamination. Western blot analyses revealed that B16 cell lysates showed a single immunoreactive protein with anti-calreticulin antiserum. As expected based on amino acid sequence identity, the mannan affinity-purified molecule demonstrated strong immunoreactivity with the anti-calreticulin antibodies that were tested (Fig. 3). We were also able to demonstrate that the B16 protein purified via mannan affinity chromatography migrated in register with calreticulin purified from rat liver endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3). Immunostaining of B16 cells demonstrated that surfaces become decorated with anti-calreticulin antibody on both nonpermeabilized and permeabilized cells. The surface decoration is more prominent in the former cells, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum is more prominent in the latter cells. In addition, bright punctate clusters of antibody are seen in the circumnuclear region of permeabilized cells; double immunofluorescence shows that β1 integrins co-localize with calreticulin in these clusters (not shown). Competition experiments showed that purified B16 cell calreticulin successfully prevented cell spreading (Fig. 4). Anti-calreticulin antibodies also prevented cell spreading; a preparation of avian immune IgY had an effective range of 0.8 through 1.4 μg/μl for complete inhibition of spreading (Fig. 4). Partial spreading was not scored in this assay; presumably the effective range will be broader if partial spreading is scored. The composite results implicate B16 cell surface calreticulin as the effector lectin that must be engaged by a suitable mannoside to initiate spreading of laminin-adherent cells. Although calreticulin was initially identified as a calcium-binding protein residing in the endoplasmic reticulum, data from a variety of laboratories have subsequently demonstrated its presence in a number of additional cellular compartments; in some cells the molecule has also been reported to be perinuclear, intranuclear, cytosolic, and/or to reside on the cell surface (reviewed by 3Burns K. Atkinson E.A. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 152-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Dedhar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 269-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Nash P.D. Opas M. Michalak M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 135: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest to these studies that calreticulin has previously been identified on the surface of B16 cells where it serves as a major immunogen (12Gersten D.M. Bijwaard K.E. Law L.W. Hearing V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1096: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Gersten D.M. Moody D. Vieira W.D. Law L.W. Hearing V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the cell surface molecule is similar, if not identical, to calreticulin previously identified in other mouse cells and tissues (reviewed by 23Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Calreticulin also occurs on the surfaces of human leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells; the leukocyte form has been termed the collectin receptor, because it specifically binds plasma proteins of the collectin category (22Malhotra R. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1993; 93: 254-261PubMed Google Scholar). Some data suggest that leukocyte cell surface calreticulin may differ in molecular properties from cell interior calreticulin; differences in charge and size are reported (10Eggleton P. Lieu T.S. Zappi E.G. Sastry K. Coburn J. Zaner K.S. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. Ghebrehiwet B. Tauber A.I. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 72: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Calreticulin immunostaining has been visualized in a variety of cells (26Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In those experiments the cells had been permeabilized, and staining appears similar to that seen in Fig. 3B, where both cell surface and interior calreticulin are seen. In fact, when the authors depleted the cells of calreticulin by exposure to the calcium ionophore, A23187, the diffuse immunostaining disappeared and the endoplamic reticulum network became more prominent, suggesting that surface calreticulin may be shed; B16 cells and human leukocytes are known to shed calreticulin (Eggleton et al., 1994; Gersten et al., 1990, 1992). In addition, immunostaining of myotubes showed prominent “lacunae” of calreticulin which seemed to be associated with the cell surface (Opas et al., 1991). The different immunostained cells displayed diffuse patterns which are consistent with variable amounts of calreticulin on their cell surfaces. The staining of surface calreticulin in our studies (Fig. 3A) resembles the previously observed pattern of man-nan bound to the surface of the same line of B16 cells (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994a). B16 cells adhere to laminin via several β1 containing integrins (reviewed by Kramer et al.(1991)). We have previously demonstrated that integrins must either be engaged simultaneously with or prior to lectin engagement in order for cells to spread (Chandrasekaran et al., 1994a, 1994b), suggesting there must be cross-talk between cell surface calreticulin and integrins. The notion that integrins must work in concert with other cell surface receptors in order to mediate specific signaling events has been well established (14Gingell D. Jones G. Wigley C. Warn R. Cell Behaviour: Adhesion and Motility. Company of Biologists, Cambridge1993: 1-33Google Scholar; 29Schweighoffer T. Shaw S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; 6Damsky C. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). For example, 30Shattil S.J. Haimovich B. Cunningham M. Lipfert L. Parsons J.T. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar have recently demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a cytosolic tyrosine kinase that has been increasingly implicated in integrin-mediated cell signaling (28Schaller M. Parsons J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), requires simultaneous occupation of both integrin and agonist receptors on the surface of platelets. In light of these and other data, it is of interest that we observe significant increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase when adherent B16 cells commence spreading, i.e. upon occupation of both integrin and lectin receptors.2( 2T. K. White and M. L. Tanzer, unpublished data. )It is of particular interest that calreticulin has previously been demonstrated to co-localize with β1 integrins in clusters (focal contacts) in PC-3 cells (21Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); those clusters appear similar to the ones seen in Fig. 3B, which are probably focal contacts on the lower surface of the B16 cells where they are adherent to the laminin surface. In light of these observations, it is tempting to speculate that calreticulin may interact directly with the integrin ectodomains to mediate the cell signaling events which initiate cell spreading. In fact, calreticulin of the endoplasmic reticulum has recently been shown to be a molecular chaperone for immature N-linked glycoproteins (25Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and, based upon its extensive similarity to the well characterized molecular chaperone calnexin (33Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), calreticulin probably has discrete binding sites for: 1) protein recognition and 2) recognition of immature carbohydrates. Since B16 cell integrin ectodomains are N-glycosylated with mature glycosyl groups (17Kawano T. Takasaki S. Tao T.W. Kobata A. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), cell surface calreticulin would probably bind to integrins via its protein recognition domain, leaving its lectin recognition domain available for binding to the laminin mannosides. Direct protein-protein interactions between the integrins and calreticulin have been demonstrated; Leung-Hagesteijn et al. (1994) have shown that calreticulin binds specifically to integrins via its N-terminal region. This binding takes place via the highly conserved KXGFFKR consensus sequence found in the cytoplasmic domain of the α integrin subunits. Although these observations are not compatible with the present findings, which would implicate calreticulin interactions with integrin ectodomains, the composite data are suggestive that cell surface calreticulin may interact directly with the integrins on the cell surface and thereby mediate signal transduction events. In summary, the ability of laminin-adherent B16 mouse melanoma cells to spread is dependent upon engagement of the ligand binding site of cell surface calreticulin. Specific oligomannosides, namely Man6-8, present in mouse tumor laminin and mouse cell-secreted laminin, must be recognized by B16 cell surface calreticulin. Such recognition must either be at the time that the integrin is engaged or subsequently, in order for the cells to spread. Future studies should determine how cell surface calreticulin communicates with β1 integrins of B16 cells and how it reaches the cell surface from the interior. We are grateful to Dr. Ari Helenius for providing purified rat liver calreticulin. We thank Dr. H.-D. Söling for the generous gift of anti-calreticulin antiserum used in these studies. We would also like to thank Dr. Gloria Gronowicz for helpful suggestions concerning fluorescent labeling studies and Joe Leykam of the Michigan State University Macromolecular Structure Facility for helpful discussions concerning microsequencing of the purified protein."

The amino acid sequences of the purified CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase, and peptides obtained by lysylendopeptidase digestion, were used to synthesize specific oligonucleotide primers. A mouse cDNA clone of the enzyme was obtained by a combination of the polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The sequence of the clone contained an open reading frame coding for a protein of 577 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 66 kDa. The deduced sequence included the amino acid sequences obtained for the purified enzyme and peptides, and a complete match was obtained for 159 residues. The enzyme has neither a signal peptide sequence nor a membrane spanning domain, which is consistent with localization of the enzyme in the cytosol. Transfection of a cDNA construct to COS-1 cells increased the enzyme activity and the amount of NeuGc. Comparison of the sequence with GenBank data indicated that no similar sequence has been reported so far. Northern blot analysis of various mouse tissues with the enzyme cDNA as a probe indicated that expression of NeuGc is related to the level of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase mRNA.

Some reports suggested that NeuGc was produced from NeuAc through enzymatic hydroxylation of the N-acetyl residue of free NeuAc, CMP-NeuAc, or glycoconjugate-linked NeuAc(7Schauer R. Wember M.

Biochem. 1977; 77: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but recent results have indicated that the major mechanism for biosynthesis of NeuGc is hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc(9Shaw L.

In addition, the hydroxylation is carried out by an electron transport system, which includes NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase. The hydroxylase accepts electrons from cytochrome b5 and catalyzes the terminal reaction(12Kozutsumi Y. Kawano T. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem.

The regulation of NeuGc and CMP-NeuGc expressions in mouse and rat tissues was suggested to be dependent on the level of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity(14Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Takematsu H.

NeuGc is barely detectable in the brain of most mammals, although the sialic acid content of brain is quite high(21Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 528: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Polysialic acids of N-CAM and gangliosides, which are regarded to be functionally important in neural tissues, contain NeuAc and not NeuGc. Thus, brain-specific suppression of NeuGc is evident but its functional role is unknown. Normal chicken and human tissues do not contain NeuGc. The occurrence of NeuGc in human T cells activated in vitro (22Wakamiya N. Osada Y. Wang D. Nakajima K. Kato S. Kurimura T. Naiki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and various types of human cancer tissues (23Hirabayashi Y. Higashi H. Kato S. Taniguchi M. Matsumoto M. Jpn. J.

Cancer. 1990; 65: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was demonstrated by immunological methods. Although the occurrence of NeuGc remains to be confirmed by chemical methods, it is possible that NeuGc would be an excellent cancer-associated antigen or tumor marker. The specialized physiological functions of NeuAc and NeuGc are not clear at present. Influenza virus hemeagglutinins bind glycoconjugates that contain NeuAc and NeuGc with different affinities, and the neuraminic acids may play a role in determining susceptibility to viral infection(28Nobusawa E. Aoyama T. Kato H. Suzuki Y. Tateno Y. Nakajima K. Virology. 1991; 182: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A cell adhesion molecule on marginal zone macrophages, sialoadhesin, preferentially recognizes NeuAc-Gal-GalNAc structure but not NeuGc-Gal-GalNAc(29Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Crocker P.R. Glycoconjugate J. 1993; 10: 330Crossref Google Scholar). These examples suggest that sialic acid difference is biologically important in recognition events mediated by carbohydrates. To elucidate the mechanisms for species- and tissue-specific and cancer associated regulations of NeuGc expression, information about the structure of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is required. Here we report the cDNA cloning of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase, analysis of its mRNA expression in mouse tissues, and detection of the similar sequences in several animal species. Purification of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase was described previously(15Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9024-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot (37 μg) of the finally purified enzyme was lyophilized and then dissolved in 40 μl of 8 M urea. After dilution with 120 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 0.4 μg of lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemicals) was added, followed by incubation at 37°C overnight. The resulting peptide fragments were separated by HPLC on a Wakosil 5C18 column (4 × 150 mm; Wako Pure Chemicals). Elution was performed with a linear concentration gradient of acetonitrile, 0-60%, in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, in 60 min. Twelve major peaks were recovered and subjected to protein sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was also performed using 6 μg of the purified hydroxylase. Degenerate oligonucleotides designed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of the lysylendopeptidase-digested peptides and the intact enzyme, as shown in Fig. 1A, were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer. Each oligonucleotide primer contained either an EcoRI or HindIII recognition sequence at the 5′-end. A pool of cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription with random primers using mouse liver total RNA as a template. PCR was performed using sense and antisense primers (125 pmol each), and 1.3 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 1 μg of cDNA(30Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out by 30 cycles of 94°C for 0.5 min, 37°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min, using a Zymoreactor II thermal cycler (Atto Corp.). The PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. After being digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, the PCR amplified fragments were subjected to electrophoresis, excised from the gel, purified with a QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and then subcloned into Bluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The constructs were transfected into XL1-Blue strain. Clones with the inserts were identified by color selection with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside, and plasmid DNAs were isolated from Escherichia coli grown in small scale cultures(31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequencing reaction with a thermal cycler was performed with Dye Deoxy terminators (Applied Biosystems) and Ampli Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The M13 universal primer or several synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used. Gel electrophoresis and analysis of data were performed with a 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Three clones were sequenced to compensate for misreading by Taq polymerase. In the case of the 5′-non-coding sequence, the PCR amplified fragments were directly sequenced, without subcloning, using specific oligonucleotides as primers. Hydropathy indexes by Kyte-Doolittle (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) were estimated with a sliding window of nine amino acids. To amplify the entire coding region of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase, two primers, each of which contains either the 5′- or 3′-end of coding region and BamHI recognition sequence at the 5′-end, were synthesized. Amplified fragments with mouse liver cDNA were digested with BamHI (Takara Shuzo Corp.) and inserted into a Bluescript II vector. An insert, the sequence of which was confirmed to be the same as the cloned sequence, was ligated into BamHI site of the expression vector, pdKCR(33Fukunaga R. Sakawa Y. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A construct of the correct direction was amplified in a large scale, and purified by two cycles of CsCl gradient centrifugation(31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). COS-1 cells obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Bank were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and kanamycin. Six dishes of COS-1 cells (5 × 105 cells/10 cm dish) were transfected with the purified plasmid (20 μg/dish) by calcium phosphate precipitation methods(34Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). At 60 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, washed, and collected by centrifugation. One-fifth of the pelleted cells was subjected to the determination of sialic acid species according to Hara et al.(35Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pelleted cells were hydrolyzed in 0.9 ml of 0.05 N H2SO4 at 80°C for 3 h, and released sialic acids were treated with 3.6 ml of 3. 5 mM of 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene in 1.7 M acetic acid at 50°C for 2.5 h. NeuAc and NeuGc were determined by HPLC with a TSK-gel ODS-80TM column (Tosoh). Four-fifths of the pelleted cells were homogenized, and the cytosolic fraction was used for the determination of protein concentration and CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity as previously reported (14Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Takematsu H. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Glycoconjugate J. 1993; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from mouse tissues was prepared using an ISOGEN acid phenol procedure kit (Wako Pure Chemicals) and Oligotex dT30 (Takara Shuzo Corp.), following the manufacturers' protocols. Approximately 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA samples was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred to a MagnaGraph nylon membrane filter (Micron Separations Inc.). A radiolabeled probe (3 × 109 counts/min/μg) was prepared with a gel-purified cDNA containing the whole coding region of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase or 2.0-kb human β-actin cDNA (Clontech) using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Corp.). Hybridization was performed overnight at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC (1 × SSC, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5% skim milk, 1.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA. The blot was washed twice in 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 10 min, and then three times in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 20 min. The bands were visualized and quantified with a Fujix BAS 2000 Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). A BIOS EVO Blot digested with EcoRI was purchased from BIOS Laboratories. The amount of DNA blotted is adjusted to assure the same copy number of the genome available among seven species. Preparation of a radiolabeled probe was performed in the same way as described for Northern blot analysis. Hybridization was performed essentially as for Northern blot analysis except that the proportion of formamide was decreased to 37.5%. After overnight hybridization, the blot was washed with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 50°C, and finally 65°C. The radioactivity was monitored with a Fujix BAS 2000 Bio-imaging Analyzer. Discrete bands were visible only after the washing at 65°C. The amino acid sequences of the two major peptides and the NH2 terminus are shown in Fig. 1A, and these sequences were used for designing mixed oligonucleotide primers for PCR. First, a fragment of 158 bp was amplified from mouse liver cDNA with sets of degenerated primers designed for peptides a and b (pr. 2 and a-pr. 1, respectively, in Fig. 1A). This fragment could not be amplified with the cDNA prepared from mouse brain, which was used as a negative control because it does not express CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase(14Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Takematsu H. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Glycoconjugate J. 1993; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was subcloned into Bluescript II KS+ and then sequenced. Based on the sequence, completely matched oligonucleotide primers (a-pr. 2 and pr. 3, see Fig. 1B and 2) were synthesized for further experiments. The next PCR was performed between pr. 1, designed for the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and a-pr. 1. On this PCR, no specific band was visibly amplified, but when an aliquot of the reaction product was diluted and subjected to a second PCR (30Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar) with a primer corresponding exactly to an inner sequence (a-pr. 2) and pr. 1, a fragment of 1.5 kb pairs was amplified. This fragment seemed to cover the whole coding region of the enzyme except for the 5′- and 3′-ends, as judged on comparison of its size with the molecular mass of the hydroxylase(15Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9024-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the fragment had an inner EcoRI site, the PCR product was digested with EcoRI, ligated into the EcoRI site of Bluescript II KS+, and then sequenced. Antisense primers (a-pr. 3 and a-pr. 4) were synthesized for the following experiments (see Fig. 1B and 2). For amplification of the 5′-end of the cDNA, a template was prepared by reverse transcription with a-pr. 3 and polyadenylation of the 5′-end (30Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). A 650-bp fragment was amplified by PCR with oligo(dT) and a-pr. 4, as shown in Fig. 1B, and a part of the fragment was sequenced. The 3′-end of the cDNA was also amplified with pr. 3 and oligo(dT), using a cDNA prepared by reverse transcription with oligo(dT) as a primer. Approximately 250- and 700-bp fragments were amplified. The 250-bp fragment and a part of the 700-bp fragment were sequenced, and the sequences indicated that the 700-bp fragment included the 250-bp fragment and both contained an 89-bp coding sequence. The merged sequence of the overlapping cDNA fragments indicated a single open reading frame, and about 100-bp 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. The nucleotide sequence (1731 bp) and the deduced amino acid sequence (577 amino acids) for the open reading frame are shown in Fig. 2. Although the 5′-untranslated region has not been completely sequenced, stop codons were emerged at −93, −59, and −46 in each of three frames. There are adjoining methionines at the potential site for translation initiation. The upper methionine was tentatively taken as an initiation site. The first four amino acids at the NH2 terminus could not be detected on sequencing of the purified hydroxylase, and thus these amino acids were cleaved, possibly through post-translational processing or artificial cleavage during the purification. All the amino acid sequences of the 12 lysylendopeptidase-digested peptides and NH2 terminus of the purified enzyme, 159 amino acid residues long in total, were found in the open reading frame of the deduced amino acid sequence (underlined in Fig. 2). The molecular mass calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence is 66 kDa, which is in good accordance with that determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (64 kDa)(15Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9024-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A search of GenBank data revealed no similar sequence reported so far. A hydropathy plot (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) of the enzyme did not identify a potential transmembrane region, suggesting that the enzyme is translated on free ribosomes as a cytosolic protein. As shown in Table I, the COS-1 cells transfected with the cloned cDNA contained an increased amount of NeuGc, compared with a mock transfectant. This change is confirmed to be due to the increase of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity. The results all togehter indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes for mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase.Table IExpression of cloned cDNA in COS-1 cells Open table in a new tab To test the possibility that the expression of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase regulates the tissue-specific expression of NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates, mRNA isolated from mouse brain, thymus, liver, kidney, and spleen was probed at high stringency with a radiolabeled cDNA fragment. It was reported that NeuGc was hardly detected in the brain gangliosides, whereas both NeuAc and NeuGc were expressed in the other tissues(18Nakamura K. Hashimoto Y. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, 3.6 and 10 kb mRNA bands were detected for all tissues except brain (Fig. 3). The intensity ratio of 3.6 and 10 kb mRNA bands is almost the same among tissues expressing NeuGc, and both bands are not detected in the brain. The 10-kb transcript, which is much longer than the cDNA we obtained, would be a product of alternative splicing or use of alternative polyadenylation signals in a 3′-untranslated region. As shown in Fig. 4, human and fish genomic DNAs contain cross-hybridizing sequences, whereas chicken, frog, lobster, and mussel DNAs were negative. These data are quite interesting because expression of NeuGc was detected in several human cancerous tissues (23Hirabayashi Y. Higashi H. Kato S. Taniguchi M. Matsumoto M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1987; 78: 614-620PubMed Google Scholar, 24Higashi H. Naiki M. Matuo S. Okouchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Higashi H.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18269-18276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not in chickens or frogs(37Hidari K. Itonori S. Sanai Y. Ohashi M. Kasama T. Nagai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sialic acid have not been detected in bivalves to date(38Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. Svetashev V.I. Zhukova I.G. Smirnova G.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 34: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the amino acid sequence of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase enabled us to design oligonucleotide primers and to generate cDNA that encoded the entire protein and approximately 100 bp of both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. The structure of this enzyme is not similar to other known hydroxylases, which is consistent with its unique substrate specificity for CMP-NeuAc. Several sialyltransferases contain a conserved amino acid sequence known as the “sialylmotif,” which may be a site that recognizes sialic acid(39Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-11500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but this motif was not present in the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase. The enzyme was purified from the cytoplasm(15Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9024-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but electron transport systems are usually located in microsomal membranes. Alternatively, one might suppose that the hydroxylase is a transmembrane protein or contains a phosphatidylinositol-anchor and that it is artificially solubilized during the purification by the action of proteinases or phospholipase C. However, the nucleotide sequence of the hydroxylase obtained in this study did not contain transmembrane domain and signal peptides for membrane insertion, confirming the cytosolic origin of the enzyme. We suggest the following models to explain how the soluble enzyme interacts with the electron transport system. 1) soluble CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase interacts for a short time with cytochrome b5 on microsomes, when the transfer of electrons occurs; or 2) soluble forms of cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase are involved in the reaction. At present, the latter idea is unlikely because mRNA encoding only the microsomal form of cytochrome b5 was observed in mouse liver(40Takematsu H. Kawano T. Koyama S. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 115: 381-386Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To clarify this point, reconstitution experiments mimicking the in vivo interaction between soluble CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and the membrane-bound electron transport system are required. The relationship between the level of mRNA of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and the expression of NeuGc in glycoconjugates was confirmed in several tissues. The inability of the brain to produce NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates (18Nakamura K. Hashimoto Y. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 528: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was evidenced by the absence of the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase mRNA (Fig. 3). Sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates in the brain are considered to be functionally important. For example, polysialylation of N-CAM reduces homophilic interaction and cellular adhesion(1Landmesser L. Dahm L. Tang J.C. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1990; 4: 655-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), tetrasialoganglioside GQ1b potentiates neuritogenesis(41Tsuji S. Yamashita T. Nagai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and gangliosides exhibit cell type-specific distribution(42Saito M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Kotani M. Kawashima I. Ozawa H. Terashima T. Tai T. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sialic acids of these functionally important sialoglycoconjugates are all NeuAc. It is unclear at present why the expression of NeuGc should be suppressed in the brain. Overexpression of the hydroxylase in the brain of experimental animals could provide insight into this issue. Although the expression of NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates was detected in some cancerous tissues(23Hirabayashi Y. Higashi H. Kato S. Taniguchi M. Matsumoto M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1987; 78: 614-620PubMed Google Scholar, 24Higashi H. Naiki M. Matuo S. Okouchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Higashi H.

Cancer. 1990; 65: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the existence of human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase has not been documented previously. The detection of a cross-hybridizing sequence in the human genome suggests participation of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activation in the tumor-associated expression of NeuGc-glycoconjugates. It will be interesting to determine if hydroxylase mRNA can be detected in cancerous tissues. A related fragment was also detected in a fish genome. In some salmonid fish, the species-specific expression of poly-NeuGc-glycoproteins in the eggs was reported(36Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18269-18276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, investigation of the expression of the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase gene in salmonid fish eggs is also of interest. CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase, which regulates the overall velocity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylation, may be responsible for the species- and tissue-specific expression of NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates(14Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Takematsu H. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Glycoconjugate J. 1993; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the synthesis of oligosaccharide structures is dependent upon not only the level of glycosyltransferases, but also the amounts of the acceptor oligosaccharides and donor nucleotide sugars, the activities of glycosyltransferases do not always correlate well with the abundance of oligosaccharide structures expressed in the cells. On the other hand, CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase modifies the structure of the donor and may directly regulate the expression of NeuGc in glycoconjugates. The expression of NeuGc-glycoconjugates may also be regulated by factors other than the hydroxylase itself, e.g. post-translational modification of the enzyme, regulation of the accessibility of cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductases, reutilization of incorporated NeuGc or NeuGc-glycoconjugates as a source of CMP-sialic acids(44Kawashima I. Ozawa H. Kotani M. Suzuki M. Kawano T. Gomibuchi M. Tai T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and involvement of sialyltransferases and CMP-sialic acid transporters specific to either CMP-NeuAc or CMP-NeuGc, although there are no data to support such specificity at present(45Higga H.H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8838-8849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Lepers A. Shaw L. Cacan R. Schauer R. Montreuil J. Verbert A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Modification of sialic acids from NeuAc to NeuGc by artificial expression of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase in cultured cells or animals is now possible because of availability of cDNA. Further studies of the enzyme, using the hydroxylase cDNA, will facilitate elucidation of functions of NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates and the mechanisms of NeuGc expression in ontogeny and phylogeny. After 60 h, the transfectant and the mock transfectant were harvested and subjected to the sialic acid analysis and the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase assay. CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activities in the cytosolic fractions were measured. We are grateful to Drs. Kiyomitsu Nara, Hideo Kubo, and Yoko Nadaoka of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science for the suggestions and technical support, and Dr. Hiroshi Kurata, Yukiko Tamagawa, and Mitsuyo Ohkawa of Kyoto University for their technical advice and support.

The availability of OAS, of which the cellular concentration is strictly controlled by SATase, regulates the biosynthetic flow of cysteine(14Rennenberg H.

Nevertheless, no cDNA clones have been isolated from plants, probably because of the low level of enzyme protein and subsequent difficulty in purification to homogeneity. From bacteria, in contrast, the genes for SATase in the cys regulon were recently cloned and sequenced(21Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tei H. Murata K.

SATase in Salmonella typhimurium is regulated by feedback inhibition by the end product, L-cysteine, and forms a multi-enzyme complex, the so-called “cysteine synthase complex,” with CSase(24Kredich N.M.

The aim of the present study is to clarify the regulatory role of SATase in cysteine biosynthesis in plants by cloning a plant enzyme, in comparison with a bacterial system. For the molecular cloning of SATase from plants, the problem was the low quantity of enzyme protein, probably 100-fold less than that of CSase on an activity basis(19Nakamura K. Tamura G. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 649-656Google Scholar, 20Ruffet M.-L. Droux M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The strategy involving protein purification, amino acid sequence determination, and subsequent screening of a library with synthetic oligonucleotides, which we employed previously for the cloning of CSases(3Saito K. Miura N. Yamazaki M. Hirano H. Murakoshi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8078-8082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Saito K. Tatsuguchi K. Murakoshi I. Hirano H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), seems not to be efficient. Alternatively, we succeeded in the isolation of a CSase cDNA from Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) by genetic complementation in an Escherichia coli Cys- auxotroph using an expression library(8Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed the same strategy, involving functional rescue of the E. coli Cys- mutation, for the isolation of cDNA encoding SATase from watermelon. In watermelon, β-(pyrazole-1-yl)-L-alanine (β-PA), a secondary non-protein amino acid found in Curcurbitaceae plants, is produced on the coupling OAS and pyrazole through the action of CSase (25Ikegami F. Kaneko M. Kamiyama H. Murakoshi I. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 697-701Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The isolated cDNA was overexpressed in E. coli, and the recombinant SATase was purified for antibody preparation and catalytic investigation. The regulatory roles of SATase were elucidated and discussed in relation with the control of primary and secondary metabolism. The expression cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was prepared from 8-day-old seedlings (cotyledons removed) of C. vulgaris cv. Kinro (Sakata Co., Yokohama, Japan) as described previously(8Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant pBluescript cDNAs were excised in vivo from the λZAPII vector, and plasmid DNA was purified as described(8Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A Cys- auxotroph, E. coli JM39/5 (F+, cysE51, recA56)(21Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with the plasmid library by electroporation using an apparatus from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) according to the supplier's recommended protocol, and then plated on M9 agar medium (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (500 μM) at 37°C for 2 days. The DNA sequence was determined by single-strand sequencing after subcloning into an M13 phage vector on both strands by the dideoxy method using a series of synthetic primers. For DNA-blot hybridization, total DNA was prepared from ~10-14-day-old etiolated C. vulgaris seedlings as described previously(8Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DNA (20 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes, separated in a 0.7% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon filter (Hybond-N+), and then hybridized with the random primer-labeled cDNA insert of pSAT2 as a 32P-labeled probe. The final wash of the filter was performed in 0.1 × SSPE (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. For RNA gel blots, total RNA was isolated from cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots of 16-day-old etiolated or green C. vulgaris seedlings by the reported method(28Simoens C.R. Peleman J. Valvekens D. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total RNA (40 μg) was denatured and separated in a formaldehyde/agarose (1.2%) gel, followed by transfer to a Hybond-N+ filter. Hybridization was performed as described (8Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with the 32P-labeled probe. The final wash of the filter was performed in 0.1 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 20 min. NdeI sites were created on both ends of the SATase coding region of pSAT2 by polymerase chain reaction engineering using two synthetic primers: NdeI F, 5′-ACTCCCATATGCCAGTTGGTGAGCT-3′; NdeI R, 5′-ACGATCATATGACAAGGGCATAATG-3′. The engineered cDNA fragment was inserted into the NdeI site of pET3a (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) (Novagen-Takara, Kyoto, Japan) to afford pSEY1, in which the cDNA was placed under a strong ɸ10 promoter in the sense orientation. The cloned SATase gene was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3, pLysE), in which the gene for lysogenic T7 RNA polymerase under the lacUV5 promoter is induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The recombinant SATase accumulated (up to 10-20% of the soluble proteins) in E. coli was purified to homogeneity. Briefly, cells (10 g) were disrupted in buffer A (40 ml) containing 200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA by sonication. The supernatant obtained on centrifugation at 10,000 × g (1440 mg of protein) was subjected to fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate (20-80% saturation). The precipitate re-dissolved in buffer B containing 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA was desalted by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column and then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column. The absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.5 M) in buffer B. The combined fractions containing SATase were divided into two parts, 12 and 58 mg, and further purified by preparative disc SDS-PAGE (Nippon-Eido, Tokyo, Japan) for antibody preparation and gel filtration chromatography on an Ultraspherogel SEC 3000 HPLC column (Beckman Instruments Inc.) to study the catalytic properties, respectively. The SATase activity was determined by two methods, either by monitoring of the decrease in A232 due to the thioester bond of acetyl-CoA (30Baecker P.A. Wedding R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or by coupling reaction with CSase forming cysteine(31Nakamura K. Hayama A. Masada M. Fukushima K. Tamura G. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 885-891Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), followed by calorimetric assay. For the thioester-bond cleavage assay, the standard mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM acetyl-CoA, 1 mML-serine, and enzyme solution, in a final volume of 600 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of L-serine and carried out at 25°C. The initial velocity of the decrease in absorbance at 232 nm was monitored. For the coupling reaction with CSase, the standard assay mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM acetyl-CoA, 5 mML-serine, 1 mM Na2S, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.7 units of recombinant CSase from C. vulgaris(26Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the enzyme solution, in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was performed at 30°C for 5-30 min, and the amount of L-cysteine was determined as described (3Saito K. Miura N. Yamazaki M. Hirano H. Murakoshi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8078-8082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Western blotting and immunostaining were carried out on an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) using phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Life Technologies, Inc.) as substrates. The rabbit primary antibody was prepared against the recombinant SATase purified from E. coli extracts and used at 1:400 dilution. The strategy used for the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding SATase was to screen an expression library that functionally complemented the cysE mutation in E. coli. The Cys- auxotrophic E. coli strains, JM39/5 and JM15 (F-, cysE50, tfr-8) mutated cysE locus, which are unable to grow on minimal medium lacking cysteine, were used for direct functional rescue of the Cys- auxotroph. Approximately 1.5 × 105 independent pBluescript clones divided into 17 pools (pool 1, comprising 5 × 104 clones, and pools 2-17, each comprising 0.65 × 104 clones) after being amplified 300-fold were screened by transformation in E. coli JM39/5. On transformation with pool 1, approximately 300 colonies appeared on selection for cysteine prototrophy; pools 2-17 gave no positive colonies. Restriction enzyme and cross-hybridization analyses indicated that these positive clones were identical, because they resulted from multiple representation of the same clone, which was designated as pSAT2. This plasmid could complement E. coli JM15 as well as JM39/5. The protein extract of E. coli JM39/5 harboring pSAT2 exhibited comparable SATase activity (cysteine formation dependent upon serine and acetyl-CoA, 9.3 ± 0.6 nmol/min/mg protein) to that of the positive control plasmid, pWT2(21Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar), carrying the cysE gene (14.7 ± 0.6 nmol/min/mg protein), confirming the identity of the insert on pSAT2 encoding catalytically functional SATase. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clone revealed a 1140-base pair insert containing an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 294 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31,536 Da (Fig. 1). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of pSAT2 with a protein data bank indicated a homology with the bacterial proteins exhibiting SATase activity (Fig. 2). The cysE gene in E. coli(21Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tei H. Murata K. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), S. typhimurium(23Sivaprasad A.V. Kuczek E.S. Bawden C.S. Rogers G.E. Accessionnumber X59594. EMBL Data Bank, Heidelberg1991Google Scholar), and Buchnera aphidicola(32Lai C.Y. Baumann P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are assumed to encode SATase for cysteine biosynthesis. The nifP product showing SATase activity in Azotobacter chroococcum is involved in nodulation(33Evans D.J. Jones R. Woodley P.R. Wilborn J.R. Robson R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5457-5469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Higher homology was detected in the carboxyl half of the pSAT2 protein, suggesting the presence of the catalytic domain in this part. In particular, the region from Gly-209 to Val-263 (boxed in Fig. 2) is conserved in the sequences of other acetyltransferases and related proteins, i.e.NodL proteins from Rhizobium meliloti(34Baev N. Kondorosi A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Rhizobium leguminosarum(35Surin B.P. Downie J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), virgiamycin acetyltransferase from Staphylococcus aureus(36Allignet J. Loncle V. Simenel C. Delepierre M. El Solh N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from E. coli(37Parent R. Roy P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2891-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens(38Tennigkeit J. Matzura H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and galactoside acetyltransferase (LacA protein) from E. coli(39Hediger M.A. Johnson D.F. Nierlich D.P. Zabin I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6414-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These facts suggested that this region is likely the binding site for acetyl-CoA, which is conserved among acetyltransferases.Figure 2:Multiple alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of three proteins exhibiting SATase activity and the consensus sequence. Dashes indicate gaps in the sequences for the best alignment. Asterisk indicates an identical amino acid residue. Cv SAT, SATase from C. vulgaris; Ec cysE, cysE product (SATase) of E. coli (21Denk D.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5457-5469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possessing SATase activity. The boxed region is conserved among several acetyltransferases other than SATase and, thus, presumed to be the acetyl-CoA binding domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, hybridizing bands corresponding to 14 kb on BamHI, 3.5 kb on EcoRI, 7 kb on EcoRV, and 2.4 kb on HindIII digestion appeared. These results indicated the presence of a single copy of the SATase gene, designated as sat, in C. vulgaris. RNA-blot hybridization showed that a 1.5-kb transcript was expressed in a relatively constitutive manner but preferentially in the hypocotyls of etiolated seedlings (Fig. 3). This expression pattern suggested that the pSAT2 clone presumably encodes an extra-chloroplastic isoform of SATase (see below). The recombinant SATase was overproduced in E. coli BL21 cells up to 10-20% of the soluble protein using a ET vector system with a strong T7 promoter/polymerase. The SATase protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography as the initial two steps. For antibody preparation, the denatured protein was finally purified by preparative disc SDS-PAGE to an apparent homogeneity in a yield of 1.3 mg from 240 mg of crude E. coli protein. For catalytic studies, the non-denatured protein was finally purified by gel filtration on an HPLC column to ~95% homogeneity, as judged on SDS-PAGE, in a yield of 18 mg, exhibiting SATase activity of 14.2 units/mg from 1200 mg of crude protein of 1.3 units/mg. Western blot analysis of partially fractionated protein extracts of watermelon seedlings indicated that an immunoreactive SATase protein exhibiting the same molecular mass as that of the recombinant protein on SDS-PAGE was preferentially accumulated in etiolated seedlings, but with lower abundance in green seedlings (Fig. 4). No immunoreactive protein was detected in stromal proteins of chloroplasts. These findings suggested that the present clone encodes an extra-chloroplastic, presumably cytoplasmic, isoform of SATase. The catalytic and regulatory properties of SATase were investigated using the purified recombinant protein. The optimum pH was in the range of 7.6-8.0 in Tris buffer. The Km values were determined to be 0.59 mM for L-serine and 0.13 mM acetyl-CoA, being comparable with those reported previously for plant SATases(18Nakamura K. Hayama A. Masada M. Fukushima K. Tamura G. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 689-693Google Scholar, 19Nakamura K. Tamura G. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 649-656Google Scholar, 20Ruffet M.-L. Droux M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The SATase activity was inhibited by L-cysteine, a final product of the biosynthetic pathway, in a typical non-competitive manner. The Ki values of L-cysteine were determined to be 3.7 μM for L-serine and 5.6 μM for acetyl-CoA, as shown in Fig. 5. The concentration for 50% inhibition (IC50) under the standard assay conditions was 2.9 μM, being of the same order for that of E. coli SATase (1.1 μM)(40Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4955-4965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect was specific to L-cysteine, only weak activities being detected with D-cysteine (39% inhibition at 1 mM) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (18% inhibition at 1 mM). L-cystine, DL-homocysteine, L-methionine, glutathione, and SO42- ion showed neither an inhibitory nor a stimulating effect up to 1 mM. Interestingly, β-PA, which is also an end product of this biosynthetic pathway, exhibited no inhibitory action at 1 mM. CoA-SH showed inhibitory activity in a competitive manner as to acetyl-CoA (Ki = 64 μM). The formation of a multi-enzyme complex of SATase and CSase, both from watermelon, was detected by using the recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli (Fig. 6). CSase and SATase alone formed homotropic complexes of molecular masses of ~40-60 kDa and ~150-210 kDa, respectively. After mixing and disruption of E. coli cells accumulating the two proteins, the elution positions of the activities of both CSase and SATase shifted to higher molecular mass positions of ~450-550 kDa on gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 6, A and B). This multi-enzyme complex exhibited immunoreactive bands against both CSase and SATase antibodies (Fig. 6C). Other fractions not shown in Fig. 6C also contained minor amounts of immunoreactive proteins, for example, SATase in fraction 2 in AB-2 and CSase in fraction 4 in AB-3, being comparable with the elution pattern of enzymatic activity. However, it was evident that the high molecular mass complex was formed from two recombinant proteins. This complex of CSase and SATase was not dissociated in the presence of OAS (2 mM), unlike in the case of the bacterial enzymes(24Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter C.M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 419-428Google Scholar). In the present study, a cDNA clone encoding a plant SATase was isolated from a watermelon library by direct functional rescue of a cysE mutation in E. coli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cloning and identification of a SATase gene from higher plants. In bacteria, SATase and the reaction product, OAS, formed through its enzymatic action have been assumed to play key roles in the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis. In the plant system, it has been suggested, by physiological studies, that the availability of OAS is one of the major limiting factors for cysteine biosynthesis(14Rennenberg H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 560-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Neuenschwander U. Suter M. Brunold C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory function of SATase has not been precisely elucidated so far, because of the lack of molecular information of a plant SATase. Our present data clearly indicate the important regulatory role of SATase, i.e. allosteric feedback inhibition by cysteine at a low concentration (IC50 = 2.9 μM), as illustrated in Fig. S1. The cellular concentration of cysteine is normally ~10 nmol/g fresh weight(16Saito K. Kurosawa M. Tatsuguchi K. Takagi Y. Murakoshi I. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Rennenberg H. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 2771-2781Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, the feedback inhibition at this physiological concentration certainly plays a central role in regulation, since mRNA expression of the sat gene seemed rather constitutive (Fig. 3). In watermelon, β-PA, a secondary non-protein amino acid generally found in Curcurbitaceae plants(42Fowden L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1964; 33: 173-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is formed from OAS and pyrazole through the action of CSase(25Ikegami F. Kaneko M. Kamiyama H. Murakoshi I. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 697-701Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, β-PA is also regarded as an end product of the cysteine biosynthetic pathway. β-PA, however, exhibited no inhibitory effect on SATase activity even at a high concentration (1 mM), in contrast with the potent inhibitory action of L-cysteine. This means that the formation of cysteine is strictly controlled by allosteric inhibition toward SATase, whereas this control mechanism does not operate for the biosynthesis of β-PA (Fig. S1). In fact, the cellular concentration of β-PA was reported to be as high as ~10 μmol/g tissue of watermelon seeds (43Noe F.F. Fowden L. Biochem. J. 1960; 77: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Dunnill P.M. Fowden L. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 388-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cucumber seedlings (45Brown H.G. Flayeh K.A.M. Gallon J.R. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 863-867Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The availability of pyrazole from 1,3-diaminopropane is postulated to be a limiting factor for β-PA formation(46Brown H.G. Diffin F.M. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 469-478Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These findings regarding the differences in regulation of the biosynthesis of cysteine and β-PA may reflect one of the general aspects for the evolutionary and regulatory relations of primary and secondary metabolism in higher plants. The biological functions of β-PA in plants have not been clearly determined; however, binding to glutamic acid receptors in animal brains was recently demonstrated(47Ikegami F. Kusama-Eguchi K. Sugiyama E. Watanabe K. Lambein F. Murakoshi I. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1994; 18: 360-362Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This may imply that β-PA acts as a deterrent compound against predators, which is suggested to be a general function of plant secondary metabolites(48Luckner M. Secondary Metabolism in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). Another characteristic feature of the plant SATase revealed in the present study is the formation of a high molecular mass multi-enzyme complex by the recombinant SATase and CSase. This character was first reported for a bacterial enzyme (24Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter C.M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 419-428Google Scholar) and recently for plant enzymes (19Nakamura K. Tamura G. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 649-656Google Scholar, 20Ruffet M.-L. Droux M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Through the formation of the multi-enzyme complex, the metabolic flow of intermediates from serine to cysteine can more efficiently occur preventing the diffusion of intermediary OAS. The possibility of metabolic channeling by the multi-enzyme complex of bacterial enzymes has been discussed previously by Cook and Wedding (49Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178 (1977): 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the protein-protein interaction leading to the multi-enzyme complex and the regulatory role in cysteine biosynthesis in further detail by using the recombinant proteins. It has been suggested that multiple forms of SATase exist and are localized in subcellular compartments of plant cells, like those of CSase(50Brunold C. Suter M. Planta. 1982; 155: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 51Smith I.K. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 477-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the chloroplastic isoform was purified from spinach leaves(20Ruffet M.-L. Droux M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The present clone isolated from watermelon seedlings seems to encode a cytoplasmic isoform for the following reasons: 1) the immunoreactive protein was detected preferentially in etiolated seedlings to green seedlings but not detected in chloroplastic stroma, 2) no transit peptide-like sequence was identified in the deduced amino acid sequence, and 3) the clone was isolated from a library constructed from etiolated seedlings, from which we could isolate only the cytoplasmic CSase cDNA(8Noji M. Murakoshi I. Saito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since the site for sulfate reduction to sulfide is in chloroplasts(52Brunold C. Rennenberg H. Brunold C. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Sulfur Nutrition and Sulfur Assimilation in Higher Plants. SPB Publishing, Hague, Netherlands1990: 13-32Google Scholar), chloroplasts are probably the major compartment for de novo cysteine biosynthesis. In the future, it will be necessary to clarify the subcellular network of cysteine biosynthesis. We thank Prof. A. Böck, Lehrstuhl für Mikrobiologie der Universität München, München, Germany, and Dr. B. Bachmann, Department of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, for kindly supplying E. coli JM39/5 and JM15, respectively. Note Added in Proof-After submission of this paper, the nucleotide sequence of a SATase from Arabidopsis thaliana was deposited to the GenBank/EMBL Data Bank with accession number L34076 by Ruffet et al. The deduced amino acid sequence of A. thaliana clone showed 54% homology with that of watermelon."
https://openalex.org/W1983827472,"The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex comprises four polypeptides: the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX) and GP V. To determine the requirements for cell-surface expression of GP V, we transiently expressed the recombinant polypeptide in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by cotransfection with plasmids for the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex and in CHO cells that stably express different combinations of the GP Ib-IX complex subunits. Glycoprotein V expressed alone was detectable on the cell surface, and the level was not augmented by cotransfection with any one of the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex. However, when GP V was expressed in cells that stably express combinations of GP Ib-IX complex subunits, its expression on the cell surface was greater in all the cell lines that contained GP Ibα than in wild-type CHO cells. That GP V associates with GP Ibα was also suggested by confocal microscopy studies: GP V colocalized with GP Ibα in CHO αβIX (cells that express GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX), CHO αβ, and CHO αIX cells, but did not colocalize with GP Ibβ in CHO βIX cells. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of GP V from cells expressing GP Ibα led to coprecipitation of the latter polypeptide; neither GP Ibβ nor GP IX coprecipitated with GP V from CHO βIX cells. Taken together, these data indicate that GP V associates with the GP Ib-IX complex through a direct interaction with GP Ibα and establish the topology of the GP Ib-IX-V subunits on the cell surface. The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex comprises four polypeptides: the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX) and GP V. To determine the requirements for cell-surface expression of GP V, we transiently expressed the recombinant polypeptide in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by cotransfection with plasmids for the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex and in CHO cells that stably express different combinations of the GP Ib-IX complex subunits. Glycoprotein V expressed alone was detectable on the cell surface, and the level was not augmented by cotransfection with any one of the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex. However, when GP V was expressed in cells that stably express combinations of GP Ib-IX complex subunits, its expression on the cell surface was greater in all the cell lines that contained GP Ibα than in wild-type CHO cells. That GP V associates with GP Ibα was also suggested by confocal microscopy studies: GP V colocalized with GP Ibα in CHO αβIX (cells that express GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX), CHO αβ, and CHO αIX cells, but did not colocalize with GP Ibβ in CHO βIX cells. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of GP V from cells expressing GP Ibα led to coprecipitation of the latter polypeptide; neither GP Ibβ nor GP IX coprecipitated with GP V from CHO βIX cells. Taken together, these data indicate that GP V associates with the GP Ib-IX complex through a direct interaction with GP Ibα and establish the topology of the GP Ib-IX-V subunits on the cell surface. Glycoprotein (GP)1( 1The abbreviations used are: GPglycoproteinCHOChinese hamster ovary.) V is one of four homologous polypeptides complexed on the platelet surface to form a receptor for von Willebrand factor(1Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hickey M.J. Hagen F.S. Yagi M. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This receptor, the GP Ib-IX-V complex, mediates adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial matrix at sites in the vasculature where the endothelium has been removed(4Roth G.J. Blood. 1991; 77: 5-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion by this mechanism increases as shear rates increase, which explains its importance in preventing hemorrhage from capillary or arteriole injury. glycoprotein Chinese hamster ovary. The GP Ib-IX-V polypeptides each span the plasma membrane once and are present in a stoichiometry of 2:2:2:1 for GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V, respectively(1Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these polypeptides are also evolutionarily related to one another, belonging to a family of proteins whose common feature is the presence of a structural motif with one or several tandem repeats of a sequence containing periodic spacing of leucines and with disulfide loops that flank the leucine-rich repeats(5López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). All of the leucine-rich polypeptides of the platelet membrane are missing in classic forms of the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder in which the hemorrhagic episodes can be life-threatening(6George J.N. Nurden A.T. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1994: 726-740Google Scholar). Because each polypeptide is encoded by its own gene, this finding strongly suggests that surface expression may require coordinate expression of all of the polypeptides. Studies in transfected cells and mutations described in Bernard-Soulier syndrome support this hypothesis. We have shown that a functional GP Ib-IX complex (lacking GP V) is expressed on the surfaces of transfected mammalian cells by cotransfection of its three subunits and that transfection of less than the full complex decreases the levels of GP Ibα expressed on the cell surface(7López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex retains many of the functions and structural features of the platelet complex, including its ability to bind von Willebrand factor and a number of conformation-sensitive antibodies and to associate with actin-binding protein in the cytoskeleton. Recent studies have shown that GP Ibβ can form partial complexes with both GP Ibα and GP IX, but the latter two polypeptides associate only loosely, if at all(8López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association with GP Ibβ also increases the expression on the cell surface of both GP Ibα (7López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GP IX(8López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although GP V is also missing in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, these studies indicate that it is less likely than the other polypeptides to be required for the cell-surface expression of GP Ib-IX, but it may nonetheless contribute to its stability. On the other hand, the findings that platelets from patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome caused by mutations of either GP Ibα (9De La Salle C. Baas M-J. Lanza F. Schwartz A. Hanau D. Chevalier J. Gachet C. Briquel M-E. Cazenave J-P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 89: 501-509Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or GP IX (10Clemetson J.M. Kyrle P.A. Brenner B. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) express less GP V than do normal platelets suggest that GP V requires the GP Ib-IX complex for its expression on the cell surface. In the studies reported here, we examined the requirements for cell-surface expression of GP V and studied the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex with which it associates. The expression plasmid ZEM229R was a kind gift from Dr. Eileen Mulvihill of ZymoGenetics, Inc. and has been described in detail(11Busby S.J. Mulvihill E. Rao D. Kumar A.A. Lioubin P. Heipel M.

Briefly, it contains bacterial sequences and the β-lactamase gene for propagation in bacteria and growth in ampicillin-containing media. Transcription of cloned DNA is under the control of the modified mouse MT-1 promoter (which permits constitutive expression in mammalian cells) and an SV40 enhancer. A BamHI fragment of the gene for GP V, corresponding to nucleotides 2311 to 7452 of the sequence published by Lanza and colleagues(3Lanza F. Morales M. de La Salle C. Cazenave J.-P. Clemetson K.J. Shimomura T. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was ligated into ZEM229R to generate the expression vector ZEMGPV. CHO DUK- cells (ATCC CRL 9096, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) and transfected cells stably expressing various combinations of the GP Ib-IX subunits were used for transient GP V expression. The stable lines have been described (7López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8López J.A. Weisman S.

In the latter three CHO cell lines, expression of the transfected polypeptides has been amplified by growth in progressively increasing concentrations of methotrexate(8López J.A. Weisman S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO αβIX were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). CHO αβ, CHO αIX, and CHO βIX were grown in α-minimal essential medium without nucleosides and containing 400 μg/ml G418 and 80 μM methotrexate (Sigma). The cells were transfected as described previously (8López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dong J.-F. Li C.Q. López J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using lipofection to deliver the plasmid DNA. Analysis of GP V expression was carried out 48-72 h after transfection. Four types of transfections were carried out: 1) transfection of ZEMGPV alone into CHO DUK-, CHO αβIX, CHO αβ, CHO αIX, and CHO βIX cells; 2) cotransfection into CHO DUK- cells of ZEMGPV with plasmids for each of the other subunits of the GP Ib-IX-V complex; 3) cotransfection of ZEMGPV with a plasmid for GP Ibα or with ZEM229R into CHO βIX cells; and 4) transfection of L2H cells with the GPV plasmid or with ZEM229R. The cells were analyzed for surface expression of GP V or GP Ibα by flow cytometry after being labeled with monoclonal antibodies against either of the two polypeptides. Cells transfected with the expression plasmid alone served as negative controls for transfection. The antibodies used were SW16 ‡ for GP V (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) and AN51 (14McMichael A.J. Rust N.A. Pilch J.R. Sochynsky R. Morton J. Mason D.Y. Ruan C. Tobelem G. Caen J. Br. J. Haematol. 1981; 49: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for GP Ibα. Cells were labeled with the antibodies as described previously(8López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their fluorescence was analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACStar flow cytometer after stimulation of the fluorescein with an argon ion laser at a wavelength of 488 nm. Emission was detected at 520 nm. In CHO αβIX, CHO αβ, CHO αIX, and CHO βIX cell lines transfected with GP V, subcellular localization of GP V was compared to the localization of one of the polypeptides that is expressed constitutively. In all of the cells that contain GP Ibα, this polypeptide was detected with a polyclonal antibody(7López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in CHO βIX cells, polyclonal anti-GP Ibβ (7López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. SW16 was used to detect GP V. The monoclonal antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and the polyclonal antibodies were detected with biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Forty-eight to 72 h after transient transfection with ZEMGPV, the cells, which were grown directly on glass chamber slides (Titer-tek, Nunc, Naperville, IL), were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). The cells were then incubated with the two primary antibodies for 1 h, washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the secondary antibodies for an additional 30 min. The secondary antibodies were then removed, the cells washed again several times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red was added and incubated for 30 min. After several more washes, the cells were either examined immediately by microscopy or stored in the dark at 4°C until they were examined. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System. These experiments were performed on cells transiently transfected with ZEMGPV 48-72 h after the transfection. The cells, which were grown in 35-mm cell culture dishes, were washed twice in cysteine-free α-minimal essential medium, then incubated in this medium for 30 min before adding to the medium 100 μCi/dish of [35S]cysteine (ICN, Irvine, CA). After incubating the cells in radioactive medium for 4 h, the medium was removed and the cells washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in digitonin lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1.6 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% digitonin) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove debris. The lysate was then incubated overnight at 4°C with fixed Staphylococcus aureas cells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) to preclear the lysate. After the cells were removed by centrifugation, the lysate was incubated in 10 μg/ml SW16 before adding Pansorbin beads that had been pre-equilibrated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (5 μg/ml, 4 h, 37°C). The beads were incubated with the lysate for 4 h at 4°C, then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended and washed twice in digitonin lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated, radiolabeled proteins were removed from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 5 min and were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the dried gel was evaluated by autoradiography on a Fuji phosphorimager (Model BAS 1000). To examine the requirements for cell-surface expression of GP V, a plasmid containing a fragment of its gene that includes the entire coding region (designated ZEMGPV) was transfected into CHO DUK- cells or CHO cells expressing various combinations of the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex (Fig. 1A). Plasma-membrane expression of GP V was examined by flow cytometry 48-72 h after transfection using the anti-GP V monoclonal antibody SW16. As a control for the nonspecific effects of transfection on fluorescence, CHO DUK- cells sham-transfected with the expression plasmid ZEM229R were also examined. Transient expression of GP V by itself resulted in significant expression of the polypeptide on the cell surface compared to the level of background fluorescence in sham-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). When the level of expression in cells expressing different GP Ib-IX complex subunits was examined, only cells that expressed GP Ibα displayed GP V on their surfaces at levels greater than the cells transfected with GP V alone (Fig. 1C). The level of expression in CHO βIX cells was not significantly different from that in CHO DUK- cells. To determine if any one of the GP Ib-IX complex polypeptides enhances GP V expression on the plasma membrane, ZEMGPV was cotransfected individually with plasmids for each of the other three polypeptides. None of the three GP Ib-IX polypeptides enhanced GP V surface levels by transient coexpression (Fig. 2), which may indicate that higher levels of the auxiliary polypeptide are needed than can be achieved with transient expression, or that GP Ibα must be coexpressed with either GP Ibβ or GP IX to associate with GP V. GP V was immunoprecipitated with SW16 from metabolically labeled CHO cells transiently expressing only GP V or coexpressing GP V with one of the other GP Ib-IX polypeptides. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation studies were performed using a digitonin-containing buffer, a condition that has been shown in platelets to maintain the association between GP V and the GP Ib-IX complex(1Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One major radiolabeled polypeptide, with an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa, was immunoprecipitated, whether the cells had been transfected with GP V alone or cotransfected with GP V and one of the GP Ib-IX polypeptides (Fig. 3A). A different pattern of immunoprecipitated polypeptides emerged when GP V was transiently expressed in cells that stably express either the full GP Ib-IX complex or combinations of two subunits. The immunoprecipitates from cells that express GP Ibα contained two other specific radioactive bands (Fig. 3B). The smaller of these bands, at about 83 kDa, corresponds to the molecular mass of mature GP V found in platelets. The larger one, migrating at about 125 kDa, is identical to the molecular mass of GP Ibα expressed in CHO cells(7López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only the 70-kDa band was observed in the immunoprecipitate from CHO βIX cells, which express high levels of both GP Ibβ and GP IX(8López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several faster-migrating bands were also precipitated from the GP Ibα-containing cells; their identities are unclear, but they may represent degradation products. Thus, it appears that association of GP V with the GP Ib-IX complex is mediated through GP Ibα, and that the association probably allows GP V to traverse intracellular compartments, allowing for the complete maturation of its N-glycan chains. Our data to this point indicated that GP V associates with the complex solely through GP Ibα and that neither GP Ibβ nor GP IX associate with GP V in the absence of GP Ibα. Another explanation for our findings, however, could be that GP V associates weakly with GP Ibβ-GP IX but that this association neither increases plasma membrane expression of GP V nor can be detected by immunoprecipitation under the conditions we used. We therefore used confocal microscopy to examine the subcellular locations of GP V and one of the other polypeptides in cells expressing the different GP Ib-IX subunits. In cells expressing GP Ibα (CHO αβIX, CHO αβ, and CHO αIX), expression of GP Ibα was examined concomitantly with expression of GP V (Fig. 4), whereas in CHO βIX cells expression of GP Ibβ and GP V was examined (Fig. 5). In all cases the cells were rendered permeable to the antibodies with 0.1% Triton X-100. Glycoprotein V and GP Ibα colocalized perfectly in the three cell lines that express GP Ibα; in CHO αβIX cells a major portion of both polypeptides was found on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). In contrast, although GP V and GP Ibβ were both expressed in CHO βIX cells transfected with GP V and were both found in what appears to be the Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum, there were extensive regions where the two polypeptides did not colocalize (Fig. 5).Figure 5:GP V and GP Ibβ do not colocalize in CHO βIX cells transiently expressing GP V. Confocal microscope images of immunostained cells prepared as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Glycoprotein V was detected with SW16, and GP Ibβ with a polyclonal antiserum. The distributions of GP V and GP Ibβ are represented in pseudocolor, red for GP V and green for GP Ibβ. The center panel shows the two images merged. In this image red represents regions containing GP V and devoid of GP Ibβ; vice versa for green. Yellow represents regions of overlap. There are numerous regions where the polypeptides do not colocalize, in both the juxtanuclear and peripheral regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By examining the expression of GP Ibα in L2H cells 48 h after they were transfected with a plasmid for GP V, we tested the possibility that, like GP Ibβ and GP IX, GP V might further increase expression of GP Ibα on the cell surface. No significant increase in the plasma membrane level of GP Ibα was detected in these cells (Fig. 6A) despite the fact that GP V was expressed quite efficiently (Fig. 6B). This result may have been due to a pre-existing high plasma membrane level of GP Ibα on the cell surface, which would have made an additional contribution from GP V on the surface level of GP Ibα difficult to detect. We therefore also examined the surface expression of GP Ibα after transient expression in CHO βIX cells, with cotransfection either of a control plasmid or of ZEMGPV. In this case, although the efficiency of transfection was poor, the surface level of GP Ibα did appear to be augmented slightly by GP V (Fig. 7). We report here the requirements for plasma membrane expression of GP V and its associations with the other polypeptides of the GP Ib-IX-V complex. Glycoprotein V did not require an association with the GP Ib-IX complex to reach the plasma membrane in transiently transfected cells, but this association was required for its most efficient expression on the plasma membrane. The association of GP V with GP Ib-IX appears to be mediated by a direct interaction with GP Ibα, a conclusion supported by three lines of evidence: 1) the cell-surface expression of GP V increases when the polypeptide is expressed in cell lines that contain GP Ibα; 2) GP V antibodies coprecipitate GP Ibα from cell lysates; and 3) GP V is colocalized with GP Ibα in CHO αβIX, CHO αβ, and CHO αIX cells but in CHO βIX cells significant lack of colocalization with GP Ibβ is observed. Thus, an understanding is emerging of the interrelationships of the leucine-rich polypeptides on the platelet plasma membrane. Recently, we showed that GP Ibβ associates independently with GP IX and GP Ibα but were unable to demonstrate association of GP IX with GP Ibα (8López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When combined with the finding in the current article that GP V associates with GP Ibα, these data suggest that the actual topology of the GP Ib-IX-V complex is as shown in Fig. 8. This scheme shows GP V associating with two GP Ibα molecules, an arrangement that is not proven but which is suggested by the relative numbers of the two polypeptides on the platelet surface(1Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise regions through which the GP Ib-IX-V complex polypeptides associate have not been defined. Although each of the four polypeptides contains a leucine-rich motif, it is not clear how these motifs function in linking the polypeptides. Mutations in this motif in GP IX associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome suggest that this region may have a role in the association between GP Ibβ and GP IX(10Clemetson J.M. Kyrle P.A. Brenner B. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wright S.D. Michaelides K. Johnson D.J.D. West N.C. Tuddenham E.G.D. Blood. 1993; 81: 2339-2347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2( 2G. Sae-Tung and J. A. López, submitted for publication.) The leucine-rich motifs are not likely to be involved in the association between GP V and GP Ibα, however, as GP V remains associated with the part of the GP Ib-IX complex that remains on the plasma membrane after the amino-terminal 45-kDa region of GP Ibα is removed by protease treatment(1Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The questions of whether association with GP Ib-IX increases plasma membrane expression of GP V and vice versa were both addressed in the current article. Glycoprotein V was clearly expressed on the plasma membranes of transiently transfected CHO cells in the absence of any of the subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex. This may reflect the situation in platelets and megakaryocytes, or may indicate that GP V surface expression or stability in CHO cells is affected by proteins not present in platelets. Two lines of evidence indicate that this expression on the plasma membrane is not very efficient. The first is the observation that much higher levels of GP V on the plasma membrane are achieved in the presence of GP Ibα. Second, although the GP V that appears on the cell surface in the single-subunit transfection has presumably undergone full post-translational modification, the immunoprecipitation and microscopy studies indicate that fully processed cell-surface GP V represents only a minor fraction of total GP V in cells that lack GP Ibα (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). In contrast to the important role of GP Ib-IX in cell-surface expression of GP V, GP V did not greatly increase surface levels of GP Ib-IX in our studies. However, these results may not adequately account for the potential contribution of GP V to cell-surface expression of GP Ibα. If GP Ibα is in excess of GP V and already efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane (which is the case in the studies involving transient expression of GP V in L2H cells, a stable cell line containing GP Ib-IX), the presence of GP V may have only a minor effect on the levels of GP Ibα that reach the plasma membrane. This interpretation is supported by the observation that confocal micrographs of cells expressing the full GP Ib-IX complex show virtually all of the complex on the cell surface (not shown), which implies that only a very small intracellular pool remains to be assisted to the cell surface if the cells are super-transfected with GP V. Glycoprotein V might significantly increase the surface level of GP Ibα when the latter polypeptide is not as efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane, i.e. when expressed in the absence of GP Ibβ or GP IX. We did not examine the effect of GP V on the surface levels of GP Ibα in this situation. Alternatively, GP V may increase GP Ib-IX levels when GP V is in excess, for example, if the GP Ib-IX plasmids were to be expressed transiently in cells that stably express GP V. In any event, the failure of GP V to significantly enhance surface expression of GP Ibα in the presence of GP Ibβ and GP IX decreases the likelihood that GP V mutations will lead to Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Nevertheless, the absence of GP V may cause other functional disorders of the platelets. In summary, in the current report we have defined the requirements for cell-surface expression of platelet GP V, one of four leucine-rich proteins on the platelet plasma membrane that make up the receptor for von Willebrand factor. These data provide further insight into the molecular nature of Bernard-Soulier syndrome and help to elucidate the structure of this receptor complex on the cell surface.

To identify the residue(s) that forms the oxygen-reactive radical, we utilized electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and the spin traps 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane and 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid (DBNBS). Metmyoglobin radical adducts had spectra typical of immobilized nitroxides that provided little structural information, but subsequent nonspecific protease treatment resulted in the detection of isotropic three-line spectra, indicative of a radical adduct centered on a tertiary carbon with no bonds to nitrogen or hydrogen. Similar isotropic three-line ESR spectra were obtained by spin trapping the oxidation product of tryptophan reacting with catalytic metmyoglobin and hydrogen peroxide. High resolution ESR spectra of DBNBS/trp and of the protease-treated DBNBS/metMb were simulated using superhyperfine coupling to a nitrogen and three non-equivalent hydrogens, consistent with a radical adduct formed at C-3 of the indole ring. Oxidation of tryptophan by catalytic metMb and hydrogen peroxide resulted in spin trap-inhibitable oxygen consumption, consistent with formation of a peroxyl radical. The above results support self-peroxidation of a tryptophan residue in the reaction between metMb and hydrogen peroxide.

Metmyoglobin radical adducts had spectra typical of immobilized nitroxides that provided little structural information, but subsequent nonspecific protease treatment resulted in the detection of isotropic three-line spectra, indicative of a radical adduct centered on a tertiary carbon with no bonds to nitrogen or hydrogen. Similar isotropic three-line ESR spectra were obtained by spin trapping the oxidation product of tryptophan reacting with catalytic metmyoglobin and hydrogen peroxide. High resolution ESR spectra of DBNBS/trp and of the protease-treated DBNBS/metMb were simulated using superhyperfine coupling to a nitrogen and three non-equivalent hydrogens, consistent with a radical adduct formed at C-3 of the indole ring. Oxidation of tryptophan by catalytic metMb and hydrogen peroxide resulted in spin trap-inhibitable oxygen consumption, consistent with formation of a peroxyl radical. The above results support self-peroxidation of a tryptophan residue in the reaction between metMb and hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative damage to tissues has become a recurring theme as a mechanism for the induction of a variety of medical conditions (1Janssen Y.M.W. Van Houten B. Borm P.J.A. Mossman B.T. Lab.

Since the 1950's, metMb has been known to react with hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the one-electron oxidation of ferric heme to form ferryl heme(10George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem.

J. 1991; 277: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the protein-centered radical is still under debate. Many previous investigations have concluded that the free radical is centered on a tyrosine residue(17Harada K. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Miki H.

Recently, however, site-directed mutagenesis studies, in which all of the tyrosine residues have been removed(26Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rao S.I. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Commun. 1992; 16: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Kelman D.J. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7458-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that another amino acid residue in addition to tyrosine must also be involved. The identity of the latter amino acid residue has not been determined. In this investigation, we utilize the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy spin-trapping technique using the nitroso-based spin traps 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid (DBNBS)1( 1The abbreviations used are: DBNBS3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acidMNP2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. )and 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP) to investigate the nature of the amino acid residue modified in the reaction between horse heart metMb and hydrogen peroxide. The spin trapping results indicate that the globin radical that has been spin trapped is centered on a tryptophan residue. 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. Horse heart metMb, proteinase K, tryptophan, tyrosine, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were acquired from Sigma. MNP dimer and sodium cyanide were obtained from Aldrich. 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt was purchased from OMRF Spin Trap Source (Oklahoma City, OK). Pronase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Hydrogen peroxide was obtained from Mallincrodt (St. Louis, MO). Chelex 100 was purchased from Bio-Rad. Glycylglycyltryptophan (gly-gly-trp), glycyltryptophylglycine (gly-trp-gly), and tryptophylglycylglycine (trp-gly-gly) were acquired from Accurate Chemical and Scientific (Westbury, NY). Tryptophan-indole-D5 was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). 2,6-dideutero-3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid was prepared by Robert Sik (NIEHS), following the published procedure(32Kaur H. Leung K.H.W. Perkins M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1981; : 142-143Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All experiments were done in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, treated with chelex by the batch method, and contained diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid at a final concentration of 50 μM. When MNP was used as the spin trap, metMb, tryptophan, or peptides were dissolved into a solution of MNP (23 mM) prepared by stirring overnight at room temperature. In all experiments, hydrogen peroxide was added to the remaining reagents immediately before transfer of the solution to a quartz ESR flat cell, which was then positioned into the microwave cavity (TM110) of a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer. Instrument parameters are reported in the figure legends for each individual scan. Spectral simulations were calculated and optimized to a minimum sum of squared residuals using a program developed by David Duling (33Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) (available over the Internet). When samples were subjected to dialysis, several milliliters of sample were prepared, a small aliquot was scanned, and the remaining sample was placed in dialysis tubing (molecular weight cutoff 3,500) and dialyzed overnight against one 2-liter charge of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Following dialysis, a small aliquot was removed and scanned, and the remaining sample was subjected to protease treatment as described in the figure legends. Control experiments were performed in parallel with complete incubations. All experiments were performed in chelex-treated 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 50 μM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. When MNP was used, all further reagents were dissolved in prepared MNP solutions. MetMb was added after a base line had been established with no subsequent difference in the base line being observed. Hydrogen peroxide (final concentration, 100 μM unless otherwise noted) was then added. Data were collected using a YSI oxygraph equipped with a computer interface using a Clark oxygen electrode. Addition of equimolar hydrogen peroxide to metMb in the presence of DBNBS resulted in the detection of an ESR spectrum characteristic of a highly immobilized nitroxide (Fig. 1A). Overnight dialysis of the product resulted in only slight changes in the shape of the ESR spectrum, indicating that the radical adduct has a molecular weight greater than 3,500 (Fig. 1B). No spectra could be detected in the absence of either metMb or hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, C, D, and F). Addition of hydrogen peroxide to the hydrogen peroxide-free control after dialysis did not result in detection of any ESR signal (Fig. 1E). Inclusion of sodium cyanide (10 mM) prevented detection of the immobilized nitroxide (data not shown). Treatment of the product with Pronase resulted in the detection of a nearly isotropic three-line spectrum with a hyperfine coupling constant of 13.6 G (Fig. 1G). Treatment of the product with proteinase K resulted in detection of a spectrum similar to that observed when Pronase was used (data not shown). When the reaction between metMb and hydrogen peroxide was investigated with MNP, the ESR spectrum of the resulting solution was similar to that observed in the presence of DBNBS (Fig. 2A). Only moderate decay of the immobilized nitroxide occurred upon dialysis (Fig. 2B). When hydrogen peroxide was excluded, a three-line spectrum with a nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant of 17.2 G was detected, characteristic of di-t-butylnitroxide, a decomposition product of MNP (Fig. 2D). The three-line spectrum was removed by dialysis, confirming that it was not a protein-centered radical adduct (Fig. 2E). Treatment of the product with Pronase (Fig. 2F) resulted in the detection of a three-line spectrum with aN = 15.5 G, which was dependent upon hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2G); the ESR spectra obtained when proteinase K was used in place of Pronase gave a similar spectrum, except that a significant contribution from immobilized nitroxide was also observed (data not shown). The three-line spectra obtained after treatment of oxidized metMb with nonspecific proteases (Fig. 1G and 2F) are indicative of a tertiary carbon-centered radical adduct. The lack of additional hyperfine structure in the spectrum indicates that the tertiary carbon atom in the adduct has no bonds to atoms with nuclear spin such as nitrogen. The most reasonably oxidizable tertiary carbon atoms in proteins are C-3 of the indole ring of tryptophan and C-4 of the phenol ring of tyrosine. The peroxidase activity of metMb (5Shiga T. Imaizumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 154: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used to oxidize free amino acids to identify the type of amino acid residue modified. Free tryptophan (20 mM), free tyrosine (saturated, approximately 3 mM), or free histidine (20 mM) was added to a catalytic concentration of metMb in the presence of a spin trap, and hydrogen peroxide was added to the solution to initiate the reactions. No amino acid-dependent radical adducts were detected when either tyrosine or histidine was used with either spin trap. When tryptophan was studied using DBNBS as the spin trap, a very strong three-line signal (aN = 13.6 G) nearly identical to that observed from metMb and hydrogen peroxide after proteinase treatment was detected (Fig. 3, A and B). The adduct was also observed in the absence of metMb, and further study demonstrated that the adduct formation was independent of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen as well (Fig. 3B). The spontaneous ene reaction between DBNBS and tryptophan to form a pseudo radical adduct has been reported(34Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The broadening of the high field line in the triplet in Fig. 3A relative to that in Fig. 3B is the result of slower molecular motion, consistent with a higher molecular weight of the radical adduct(s) from protease-treated metMb. When tryptophan was incubated with MNP, hydrogen peroxide, and catalytic concentrations of metMb, a three-line ESR spectrum was detected with hyperfine coupling constant aN = 16.1 G (Fig. 4B). The detected spectrum was different from the spectrum obtained from Pronase-treated metMb, which had a nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant aN = 15.5 G (Fig. 4A). When either hydrogen peroxide or metMb was removed from the incubation, a three-line spectrum with a nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant characteristic of di-t-butylnitroxide was detected (data not shown). A radical adduct of N-acetyl-tryptophan with MNP has been reported with a nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant identical to that which we detected from the protease-treated MNP/metMb (35Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 53-62Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The presence of amide bonds at the amino terminus of the amino acid residue is expected to have similar effects on the nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant of the radical adduct(35Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 53-62Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To investigate that possibility, we used metMb as a peroxidase to oxidize the tryptophan residues in the tripeptides trp-gly-gly, gly-trp-gly, and gly-gly-trp using MNP as a spin trap to detect the resulting radicals. The hyperfine coupling constants for the observed spectra range from 16.1 G for trp-gly-gly to 15.75 G for gly-gly-trp, indicating that the difference between free tryptophan and the protein-derived adduct could be due to the amino acid residues that retain amide bonds to the tryptophan residue during nonspecific protease treatment of oxidized metMb, particularly on its α-amine. The ene reaction between DBNBS and tryptophan results in the formation of a pseudo radical adduct that has an identical structure to the adduct formed through a radical pathway(34Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The adduct is produced in sufficiently high concentration to resolve small hyperfine coupling constants from magnetic nuclei β to the carbon at which the radical adduct is formed (See for the structure of the adduct). With the use of a smaller modulation amplitude (0.1 G), each broad line of the observed three-line spectrum was determined to be composed of a number of overlapping lines (Fig. 5A). The middle line of the high resolution spectrum of DBNBS/trp was simulated using contributions from a nitrogen atom, three non-equivalent protons, and the expected two meta-protons of the spin trap, and the simulation was optimized using an iterative process in which each parameter is varied until the minimum residual is achieved. Details of the method and the program utilized have been published(33Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). A 0.1-G modulation amplitude scan of the middle line of the radical adduct produced by Pronase treatment of DBNBS/metMb gave rise to a similar, but not identical, superhyperfine structure (Fig. 5E). To account for effects of amide bonds to the tryptophan in the protease-treated metMb sample, the tripeptides trp-gly-gly, gly-trp-gly, and gly-gly-trp were studied in a similar manner (Fig. 5, B-D). The hyperfine coupling constants from the optimized simulation for each experimental spectrum are reported in. To identify the atoms contributing hyperfine coupling in the various DBNBS adducts, indole-deuterated tryptophan and DBNBS deuterated on the meta positions were utilized. Deuteration of DBNBS removed the hyperfine interaction of two equivalent protons, which had contributed a 1:2:1 triplet to the superhyperfine structure, most notably in the outermost shoulders in the spectrum (Fig. 6, B compared to A), demonstrating the contribution of the meta-protons of the spin trap to the spectrum. When indole-deuterated tryptophan was used, a proton hyperfine coupling was replaced by a much smaller deuterium coupling, demonstrating hyperfine interaction with an indole ring hydrogen (Fig. 6C). The use of both deuterated tryptophan and deuterated spin trap greatly simplified the spectrum in the expected manner (Fig. 6D).Figure 6:Effects of deuteration on the high resolution ESR scans of the reaction between tryptophan and DBNBS in the presence of catalytic metMb. Computer simulations (dashed lines) were obtained as reported in Fig. 5. ESR parameters are the same as reported in Fig. 5.

The rate of oxygen consumption was dependent upon the concentration of metMb (data not shown). Slight oxygen evolution was detected when hydrogen peroxide was added to metMb in the absence of tryptophan, consistent with the known catalase activity of metMb (Fig. 7D)(5Shiga T. Imaizumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 154: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). No oxygen consumption was observed when tryptophan was replaced by either tyrosine or histidine (data not shown). The initial spin-trapping data obtained with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide to discern the nature of the electron-donating residue in metMb demonstrated that a free radical was formed(20Xu Y. Asghar A. Gray J.I. Pearson A.M. Haug A. Grulke E.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1990; 38: 1494-1497Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Davies M.J. Free Radical Res.

Piette L.H. Korean Biochem. J. 1989; 22: 196-201Google Scholar). The original assignment to a peroxyl radical adduct (21Davies M.J. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Newman E.S.R. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was subsequently demonstrated to be in error (24, 28), but no additional structural information was obtained. Likewise, the whole-protein data acquired in this study using the nitroso spin traps provided little structural information (Fig. 1 and 3). The high degree of rotational anisotropy observed in nitroso-spin trap/whole protein radical adducts can be removed by proteolysis, which results in fragmentation of the protein to form relatively freely rotating peptides that give isotropic spectra(37Davies M.J. Gilbert B.C. Haywood R.M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 15: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such was the case for both DBNBS/metMb and MNP/metMb, resulting in a great enhancement of the information content of the spectra (Figs. 1G and 2G). The similarity of the spectrum obtained by Pronase treatment of DBNBS/metMb to that of DBNBS/trp strongly suggests that the globin-centered radical resides on a tryptophan residue. The conclusion that the radical is centered on the indole ring, and in particular on C-3, is corroborated by the resolution of the superhyperfine coupling from each of the lines of the primary triplet, which were very convincingly simulated using coupling to a nitrogen, three non-equivalent hydrogens, and the two equivalent meta-hydrogens from the DBNBS (Fig. 5A,). Previous reports of similar spectra acquired from tryptophan and DBNBS have assigned the radical to either C-3 of the indole ring (34Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or to the α-carbon of the amino acid(37Davies M.J. Gilbert B.C. Haywood R.M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 15: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The latter assignment seems unlikely due to the lack of the expected hyperfine coupling to the α-amine nitrogen. Previous studies using different techniques have demonstrated that tryptophan radicals centered on the indole ring are formed with significant free electron density residing on C-3(35Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 53-62Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Jovanovic S.V. Simic M.G. J. Free Radicals Biol. & Med. 1985; 1: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Pailthorpe M.T. Nicholls C.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1971; 14: 135-145Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Calculated electron densities of the indole ring-centered tryptophan radical have shown that the greatest electron density resides on C-3(40Hoffman B.M. Roberts J.E. Kang C.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minor difference between the highly resolved spectrum obtained from free tryptophan and that obtained from the Pronase-treated DBNBS/metMb can be accounted for by changes in the relative orientations of the methylene protons induced by the steric effects of additional amino acids on the amino and carboxyl groups of tryptophan that can increase or decrease the magnitudes of hyperfine coupling constants(41Knecht K.T. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar), as demonstrated with the spectra obtained using the trp-gly2 tripeptides. In addition, the molecular inhomogeneity, resulting from nonspecific protease treatment of the intact DBNBS/metMb and reflected in the increased linewidth used in the optimized simulation of the metMb-derived adduct (Table I), contributes to the deviation between the protein-derived and tryptophan spectra. Finally, the formation of the radical adduct at C-3 of the indole ring creates a chiral center that results in the possibility of the formation of a pair of diastereomers, which could themselves have non-identical spectra, thereby also contributing significant line broadening(41Knecht K.T. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar).Table I:Hyperfine coupling constants in Gauss used to simulate the ESR spectra from solutions of tryptophan and DBNBS Open table in a new tab The hydrogen peroxide-independent addition of DBNBS to tryptophan, demonstrated in Fig. 3B, suggested that this tryptophan adduct might be formed by direct reaction of the spin trap with the tryptophan residues of the protein, either before or after proteolysis. DBNBS has been shown to react with biological compounds, including tryptophan, to give non-radical-derived adducts(34Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The product of the ene reaction of DBNBS with an unsaturated system is a hydroxylamine that must then be oxidized to form an ESR-active nitroxide(34Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No radical adduct spectrum was detected upon addition of hydrogen peroxide to the dialyzed control incubation between metMb and DBNBS (Fig. 1E), showing that the ene reaction using hydrogen peroxide to oxidize the proposed hydroxylamine intermediate is not the pathway for DBNBS/metMb formation. The inhibition of adduct formation by cyanide, which coordinates heme iron and prevents access by the peroxide, thereby eliminating peroxidase chemistry, demonstrated the requirement for heme oxidation in the formation of the protein-centered radical adduct. The results of the spin trapping experiments using MNP confirm the hydrogen peroxide dependence of globin-centered radical formation and also demonstrate that the radical adduct is centered on a tertiary carbon. The observed difference between the aN for the Pronase-treated MNP/metMb and for MNP/trp can be accounted for by the presence of amide(s) on the primary amine, the primary carboxylic acid, or both groups of tryptophan in the hydrolysate, as demonstrated by the observed aN values for the tryptophan tripeptides. Effects of amidation, ionization, and acetylation of the functional groups of tryptophan similar to those observed here have been reported(37Davies M.J. Gilbert B.C. Haywood R.M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 15: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that a tyrosine peroxyl radical is the spin-trapped radical in hydrogen peroxide-treated metMb(21Davies M.J. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Newman E.S.R. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A spin-trapping study of radicals formed from tyrosine by pulsed radiolysis using MNP did not report a spectrum at neutral pH, and spectra acquired in basic and acidic solutions exhibited different hyperfine coupling constants from those determined for the Pronase-treated metMb(42Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 43-52Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The present results provide strong evidence that the globin-centered radical that is spin trapped following the reaction of metMb with hydrogen peroxide is centered on a tryptophan residue. The formation of tryptophan radicals in intact proteins has been demonstrated(43Murakami J. Okazaki M. Shiga T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 44Goodin D.B. McRee D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3313-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 45Sahlin M. Lassmann G. Potsch S. Slaby A. Sjoberg B.-M. Graslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11699-11702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of a tryptophan residue as an oxidized site is also consistent with the studies performed by Ortiz de Montellano and co-workers(26Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rao S.I. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which a direct ESR signal identical to that of the native protein is observed in the site-directed mutant protein, which lacks all tyrosine residues. However, the dityrosine cross-linking of sperm whale metMb (18Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the covalent binding of tyrosine to heme in horse metMb(6Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as ESR studies(17Harada K. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), all indicate that the oxidation of metMb by hydrogen peroxide forms one or more tyrosine radicals. Transfer of the oxidative equivalent between tryptophan and tyrosine residues is suggested by the similarity of their oxidation potentials(46Butler J. Land E.J. Prutz W.A. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 150-162Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 47DeFelippis M.R. Murthy C.P. Faraggi M. Klapper M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Previous spin-trapping studies have demonstrated that oxygen competes with the spin trap for the the primary radical, and direct ESR has demonstrated that the radical detected in frozen solution is a peroxyl radical(24Kelman D.J. Mason R.P. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 16: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Kelman D.J. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7458-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan radical formed photochemically has been shown to react with oxygen during its decomposition(48Tassin J.D. Borkman R.F. Photochem. Photobiol. 1980; 32: 577-585Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 49Szajdzinska-Pietek E. Bednarek J. Plonka A. J. Photochem. Photobiol. A: Chem. 1993; 75: 131-136Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We found that tryptophan oxidation by the catalytic peroxidase activity of metMb consumed oxygen from the solution (Fig. 7), a reaction that was inhibited by the inclusion of the spin traps DBNBS and MNP. That result is consistent with the previously reported competition between the spin traps and oxygen for the globin radical formed in the metMb/hydrogen peroxide system(28Kelman D.J. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7458-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since free tryptophan radical reacts with oxygen, it is likely that a tryptophan radical in a protein would also do so to form a peroxyl radical. We examined a computer-generated space-filling model calculated using theoretical van der Waals atomic radii from the crystal structure of horse metMb(50Evans S.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Both tryptophan residues of metMb were found to be in contact with the solvent, with tryptophan 7 having more surface contact than either of the tyrosine residues. The generation of a protein-centered radical has been suggested to be necessary for the oxidation of styrene by metMb and hydrogen peroxide (51Choe Y.S. Rao S.I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present results provide strong evidence that the globin-centered radical that is detected by ESR and spin trapping is centered on a tryptophan residue. Spectral evidence strongly indicates that the radical adduct is formed at the C-3 carbon of the indole ring, which is also the most likely atom at which oxygen addition to form the peroxyl radical occurs, as is shown in Fig. SI. Whether the radical adduct is formed on only one or both of the tryptophan residues in metMb, which a search of the metMb sequences in the PIR protein data base revealed to be rigidly conserved among terrestrial vertebrates, cannot be resolved at this time. The presence of the globin radical on a tryptophan residue that is near the surface of the protein provides a mechanism for the catalytic activity of metMb in the oxidation, peroxidation, or epoxidation of large substrates that do not have ready access to the heme iron. Asterisk indicates a chiral carbon."

The SNARE hypothesis predicts that all eukaryotic cells should have families of v- and t-SNAREs that mediate different secretory pathways(9Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Indeed, homologues of SNAREs were identified in yeast as components involved in distinct steps of the secretory pathways(13Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we show, by means of biochemical and morphological analyses, that syntaxin 1 is associated with chromaffin granules, which mediate the secretion of catecholamine from adrenal chromaffin cells. The present finding raises the possibility that syntaxin is a component of v-SNARE as well as one of t-SNARE on the plasma membrane. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize both brain syntaxins 1A and 1B (mAb 10H5), and brain syntaxin 1B (mAb 6H1) were produced as described previously(2Yoshida A. Oho C. Omori A. Kuwahara R. Ito T. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24925-24928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against a fusion protein comprising β-galactosidase and brain syntaxin 1 was produced as described previously(14Inoue A. Akagawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1992; 187: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An anti-chromogranin A antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with the antigen. Anti-VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 and anti-SNAP-25 antibodies were raised in rabbits using synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 2-18 (SATAATVPPAAPAGEGP) of VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 and carboxyl-terminal residues 195-206 (ANQRATKMLGSG) of SNAP-25, respectively. Anti-Na+,H+ exchanger and anti-adrenodoxin antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. M. Kawakita (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science) and Dr. M. Sakaguchi (Kyushyu University), respectively. A polyclonal anti-SNAP antibody that recognizes α- and β-isoforms was kindly donated by Dr. J. E. Rothman (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). An antibody against dopamine β-hydroxylase was obtained from Eugene Tech International, Inc. Chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla were isolated according to the method of Nelson et al.(15Nelson N. Cidon S. Moriyama Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 0-4°C. Ten bovine adrenal medullae were homogenized in 130 ml of homogenation buffer (0.3 M sucrose, 4 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS, pH 8.0) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with a Polytron homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was suspended in 130 ml of homogenation buffer and then centrifuged once again. The resulting pellet was suspended in 20 ml of homogenization buffer, and 10-ml portions of the suspension were layered on discontinuous gradients formed from 16 ml of 1.2 M sucrose and 11 ml of 1.8 M sucrose in 4 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 53,000 × g for 14 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor, chromaffin granules were recovered as a pellet. After hypoosmotic treatment of the isolated granules, chromaffin granule membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 40 min. For equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, a postnuclear supernatant obtained from adrenal medullae was layered on a discontinuous gradient formed from 0.9 ml each of 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 M sucrose in 4 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS, pH 8.0, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 17 h in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were recovered from the top, and the precipitate at the bottom was dissolved in 0.5 ml of homogenation buffer. The proteins were precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.02% deoxycholic acid and then subjected to SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli(16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling of frozen sections of rat adrenal medullae and cerebellum was performed as described previously (17Koh S. Yamamoto A. Inoue A. Inoue Y. Akagawa K. Kawamura Y. Kawamoto K. Tashiro Y. J. Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using gold conjugates of goat anti-rabbit IgGs (5 nm in diameter, A525 nm = 0.08). Chromaffin granule membranes were solubilized with 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, 250 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mM PIPES, pH 7.2. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min, 500 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of a control antibody (mAb MAC-L1, which reacts with chicken Ca2+ channel but not Ca2+ channel from other sources) or 5 μg of mAb 10H5 at 0°C for 1 h. To this solution was added 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After gentle shaking overnight, the resin was washed three times with 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mM PIPES, pH 7.2. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin 1 and anti-VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 antibodies. Since chromaffin granules are highly dense organelles, they can be isolated to near homogeneity (more than 90% pure) by centrifugation (15, 18). Fig. 1A shows the purity of chromaffin granules isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The granule fraction contained dopamine β-hydroxylase and chromogranin A, membrane-bound and soluble marker proteins of chromaffin granules, respectively, but did not contain significant amounts of plasma membrane marker proteins (Na+,K+ exchanger and Na+,K+-ATPase) or a mitochondrial marker protein, adrenodoxin. Fig. 1B shows the results of immunoblotting with antibodies against components of the SNARE complex. Consistent with the results of Baumert et al.(19Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and Hodel et al.(20Hodel A. Schäfer T. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8623-8626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 was present in the isolated granule fraction. SNAP-25 was not detected in either the total membrane fraction or the granule membrane fraction. This probably reflects the fact that the level of SNAP-25 in the adrenal medulla is about 20-fold lower than that in the brain(21Roth D. Burgoyne R.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As will be described below, SNAP-25 was detected when larger amounts of proteins were subjected to immunoblotting. Although Hodel et al.(20Hodel A. Schäfer T. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8623-8626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that syntaxin 1 is exclusively localized in the plasma membrane fraction, we did detect a protein that is recognized by a monoclonal anti-brain syntaxin 1 antibody (mAb 10H5) in the chromaffin granule membrane. Immunoblotting with a brain syntaxin 1B-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 6H1) revealed that this protein is syntaxin 1B (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when chromaffin granules were purified by centrifugation on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (18Meyer D.I. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9854-9859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). We next examined whether or not syntaxin 1 is cosedimented with chromaffin granules on equilibrium centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2, minor amounts of chromogranin A were detected in fractions 1 and 2, but the majority was recovered in higher density fractions, especially in the precipitate. This implies that the homogenation process did not markedly disrupt chromaffin granules and that the fractionation was satisfactory. Fractions 4-6 contained SNAP-25, VAMP/synaptobrevin-2, and syntaxin 1, suggesting that these fractions comprise the plasma membrane and small light vesicles. Consistent with our previous finding that NSF is tightly associated with rat brain synaptic vesicles(22Hong R.-M. Mori H. Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), NSF and SNAPs were detected in fractions 4-6, which contain small light vesicles. Morgan and Burgoyne (23Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) also showed that significant amounts of NSF and SNAPs are associated with membranes in chromaffin cells, although Rothman (10Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar) insisted that NSF and SNAPs, which are involved in the formation of the 20 S NSF.SNAP.SNARE complex, are cytosolic proteins. Fractions 9 and 10 and the precipitate contained VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 and syntaxin 1, with small amounts of NSF and SNAPs. These results again suggest that syntaxin 1 is associated with chromaffin granules. To confirm the association of syntaxin 1 with chromaffin granules, we investigated the localization of syntaxin 1 in frozen ultrathin sections of adrenal medulla by the immunogold labeling method. For this purpose, a polyclonal antibody against a fusion protein comprising β-galactosidase and syntaxin 1 (14Inoue A. Akagawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1992; 187: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used because monoclonal antibodies against syntaxin 1 (mAbs 10H5 and 6H1) are not applicable to the immunogold labeling method. The polyclonal antibody mainly recognized two bands of about 35 kDa, and a minor fuzzy band of about 17 kDa, of an adrenal medulla membrane preparation (the minor band is not obvious in Fig. 1C because it is very faint). The minor band was most likely of a proteolytic fragment of syntaxin 1, because it was also recognized by monoclonal antibodies against syntaxins 1A and 1B (mAb 10H5), syntaxin 1B (mAb 6H1), and HPC-1. As shown in Fig. 3(A and B), a significant number of gold particles was observed on the cytoplasmic side of chromaffin granules. Quantitative analysis confirmed the presence of syntaxin 1 on chromaffin granules (Table I). This labeling pattern was quite different from that of cerebellum. In the cerebellum, syntaxin 1 was mainly detected on the plasma membrane and less on synaptic vesicles (Fig. 3C and Ref. 17).Table I:Density of gold particles on membranes Open table in a new tab Syntaxin 1 on the plasma membrane can form a complex with VAMP/synaptobrevin-2, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, and Rab 3A(1Bennett M.K.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We wondered whether or not syntaxin 1 associated with chromaffin granules is functionally equivalent to that on the plasma membrane. To answer this question, we examined whether syntaxin 1 and VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 in chromaffin granules are co-immunoprecipitated or not. As shown in Fig. 4, a significant amount of VAMP/synaptobrevin-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with mAb 10H5. This suggests that syntaxin 1 in chromaffin granules is functionally equivalent to that on the plasma membrane. Subcellular fractionation revealed that syntaxin 1B is associated with chromaffin granules. The possibility that syntaxin 1B detected in isolated granule membranes was derived from contaminating plasma membranes was unequivocally excluded by the fact that three plasma membrane marker proteins, Na+,K+-ATPase, Na+,H+ exchanger (Fig. 1A), and SNAP-25 (Fig. 2), were not significantly present in the chromaffin granule fraction. Hodel et al.(20Hodel A. Schäfer T. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8623-8626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that syntaxin 1A or 1B is not present in chromaffin granules. Since their anti-syntaxin antibody reacted well with syntaxin 1A but poorly with syntaxin 1B, it is likely that the amount of syntaxin 1B in their chromaffin granule preparation subjected to immunoblotting was lower than the limit of detection with the poorly reactive antibody. The association of syntaxin 1 with chromaffin granules was confirmed by means of the immunogold labeling method (Fig. 3), although we could not determine which isoform of syntaxin 1 is associated with chromaffin granules by this method because the polyclonal antibody used for labeling recognizes isoforms of syntaxin 1 (Fig. 1C). The present finding that syntaxin 1 is associated with chromaffin granules is consistent with recently accumulated results suggesting that syntaxin is a component of transport vesicles as well as one of the target membranes.

In yeast, the early effect of depletion of Sed5p, which is likely to be the yeast homologue of syntaxin 5, leads to elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum rather than a change in the Golgi apparatus(25Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This effect can be explained by the idea that Sed5p interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum, in which transport vesicles are formed. On electron microscopic analysis, Koh et al.(17Koh S. Yamamoto A.

The present finding combined with these results may raise the possibility that syntaxin plays a role as v-SNARE in addition to the previously suggested role as t-SNARE.

https://openalex.org/W1621875089,"Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a transcriptional activator that binds to the interleukin-2 promoter and is believed to be responsible for T-cell-specific interleukin-2 gene expression. Here we demonstrate using electrophoretic mobility shift assays that nuclear NFAT can be induced in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cell line and rat bone marrow-derived mast cells upon cross-linkage of the high affinity receptor (FcϵRI) for immunoglobulin E (IgE). Receptor-dependent activation of NFAT was mimicked by the combination of the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate and the calcium ionophore ionomycin. The induced binding activity was specific for the NFAT recognition motif because competition with nonradioactive NFAT oligonucleotide abolished the DNA binding activity, whereas nonradioactive oligonucleotides recognized by the transcription factors NFκB, glucocorticoid receptors, and TFIID did not. An oligonucleotide representing the AP-1 recognition sequence also blocked the NFAT DNA binding activity, as did a combination of anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, AP-1-binding proteins were found to be induced in RBL-2H3 cells under the same conditions as was the NFAT binding activity. Together these data suggest that the NFAT complex in mast cells contains Fos and Jun proteins as does NFAT in T-cells. The appearance of nuclear NFAT binding activity was dependent in part upon calcium mobilization, as buffering the antigen-induced calcium rise with intracellular BAPTA strongly inhibited NFAT activation. Prevention of calcium influx with external EGTA also inhibited NFAT activation, indicating that release of calcium from internal stores was insufficient for sustained activation of mast cell NFAT. Cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, blocked the induction of NFAT-DNA binding activity, implicating calcineurin as a key signaling enzyme in this pathway. These results suggest that NFAT is present in the mast cell line RBL-2H3 and in primary bone marrow-derived mast cells, is similar in subunit composition to the T-cell NFAT, and may play a role in calcium-dependent signal transduction in mast cells.

Although selective expression of NFAT is thought to account for the T-cell specificity of IL-2 gene expression, recent evidence suggests the possibility that NFAT may be one in a family of related transcription factors that regulate the transcription of cytokine genes in other leukocytes. The present work was undertaken to determine whether NFAT-related activity can be induced in mast cells via cross-linkage of the receptor with high affinity for IgE (FcϵRI). nuclear factor of activated T-cells nuclear factor of activated T-cells, preexisting nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytosolic receptor with high affinity for IgE interleukin electrophorectic mobility shift assay rat basophilic leukemia rat bone marrow-derived mast cells protein kinase C phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate bovine serum albumin trinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)eth-ane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Tris-borate-EDTA buffer cyclosporin A. Although the exact molecular make-up of the NFAT complex is unknown, there is evidence that it is composed of a lymphocyte-specific cytoplasmic component (or components) present in unactivated cells, designated NFATp/c, and a ubiquitous, inducible nuclear component containing Fos and Jun proteins (Jain et al., 1992Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar; Ullman et al., 1990Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar. Cross-linkage of the T-cell receptor results in two intracellular signals required for the assembly of active NFAT in the nucleus: activation of protein kinase C and mobilization of cytosolic calcium. The activation of PKC is necessary for the transcription of Fos and Jun genes (Jain et al., 1992Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar; Northrop et al., 1993Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an increase in intracellular calcium is required for the translocation of NFATp into the nucleus (Flanagan et al., 1991Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The translocation of NFATp from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is thought to be controlled either directly or indirectly by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (Clipstone and Crabtree, 1992Clipstone N. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The role of calcineurin in this signaling pathway has been further substantiated by the fact that a constitutively active form of calcineurin can bypass the calcium requirement for IL-2 transcriptional activation (O'Keefe et al., 1992O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 block transcription of the IL-2 gene by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and preventing the intracellular translocation of NFATp (McCaffrey et al., 1993aMcCaffrey P.G.

Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Once assembled in the nucleus, the NFAT complex initiates transcription by binding to two sequence-specific binding sites located in the enhancer region of the IL-2 promoter (Shaw et al., 1988Shaw J. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway emanating from the FcϵRI in mast cells shares many relevant features with the T cell receptor-initiated pathway, including an increase in intracellular calcium (Beaven et al., 1984) and activation of PKC, which in turn modulates the expression of AP-1 binding proteins such as Jun and Fos (Lewin et al., 1993; Baranes and Razin, 1991). Antigen-activated mast cells produce cytokines such as IL-3, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-1 (Kaye et al., 1992; Wodnar-Filipowicz et al., 1989; Plaut et al., 1989), and NFAT binding sites have been identified in the regulatory regions of several of these genes (reviewed in Rao, 1994). The NFAT binding site located in the intergenic enhancer region of the IL-3/GM-CSF genes has been shown to bind NFAT from activated T-cells (Cockerill et al., 1993), and CsA inhibits the induction of DNA binding activity directed to this site in Jurkat cells treated with PMA and ionomycin. CsA blocks the FcϵRI-dependent induction of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, apparently through the mediation of some of the same immunophilin proteins present in T-cells (Hultsch et al., 1991Hultsch T. Albers M.W. Schreiber S.L. Hohman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6223-6229Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar; Kaye et al., 1992Kaye R.E. Fruman D.A. Bierer B.E. Albers M.W.

A. 1992; 89: 8542-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This CsA sensitivity suggests a possible role for calcineurin in the FcϵRI-mediated expression of cytokine genes in mast cells. Given the presence of NFAT binding sites in the regulatory regions of cytokines induced by FcϵRI cross-linkage, a key question is, does NFAT mediate transduction of signals from the FcϵRI to the nucleus? Here we show that antigenic stimulation through the Fcϵ receptor induces NFAT DNA binding activity in two types of rat mast cells. The presumed NFAT complex in mast cells, like that in T-cells, contains AP-1 proteins in association with (an)other species conferring specificity for the NFAT recognition motif. Induction of NFAT binding activity by the FcϵRI was mimicked by simultaneous treatment with the PKC activator PMA and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, required calcium mobilization, and was blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor, CsA. The presence of NFAT in mast cells and its activation via the FcϵRI suggest that it may mediate the terminal steps of signal transduction via the FcϵRI, namely the transcription of one or more cytokine genes. The RBL-2H3 (RBL) cell line was maintained in 75-cm2 flasks as monolayers in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Earle's salts) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (Barsumian et al., 1981). The cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. Every 4 days the cells were removed by trypsinization and passed to new flasks at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/20 ml of medium. Rat bone marrow-derived mast cells (RBMMC) were cultured from bone marrow of 3-5-week-old Fisher 344 rats in the presence of recombinant murine stem cell factor and rat interleukin-3. Details of the culture methods and functional and molecular properties of this cell population are described elsewhere.( 2M. A. McCloskey, M. Haggerty, and Y.-x. Qian, submitted for publication.) For activation experiments, 4-day-old confluent monolayer cultures were used. When IgE-dependent activation was required, the cells were sensitized 12 h before the experiment by replacing the culture medium with medium containing approximately 3 μg/ml anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP) IgE produced from the IGEL a2 hybridoma (ATCC TIB 142) (Rudolph et al., 1981Rudolph A.K. Burrows P.D. Wabl M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 527-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). On the day of the experiment, cells were removed from the culture flasks by rinsing the monolayers twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.66 mM EDTA and then incubating the cells in the same solution for 4 min at 37°C. The cells were dislodged from the flasks, transferred to a centrifuge tube, and diluted 2:1 with Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in the same medium, and incubated for 90 min before stimulation. This incubation permitted decay of the initial NFAT activity induced by the cell isolation protocol itself (see “Discussion”). Cells were activated by adding concentrated stock solutions of the triggering agents directly to the cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells/ml). Trinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA) was used at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml, and PMA and ionomycin were used at 32 nM and 2 μM, respectively. CsA (Sandoz Research Institute, Hanover, NJ) stock solutions were prepared by first dissolving 1 mg of CsA in 100 μl of 100% ethanol containing 20 μl of Tween 20. The volume was adjusted to 1 ml with culture medium, and appropriate dilutions of this stock solution were made directly into the cell suspensions immediately following the 90-min incubation. The cells were pretreated with CsA 15 min before activation. In treatments where cells were triggered in the absence of calcium, the cells were incubated for 30 min in medium containing the calcium chelators before cell activation. Solid EGTA was added at a concentration of 3.2 mM to basal medium (1.8 mM Ca2+, 0.8 mM Mg2+) and the pH adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH. This yields an estimated free [Ca2+] of 80 nM. For chelation of extracellular calcium, cells were pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium containing EGTA. BAPTA-AM was added directly to the cell suspension as a concentrated stock solution in methyl sulfoxide to attain a final concentration of 20 μM. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (Mattila et al., 1990Mattila P.S. Ullman K.S. Fiering S. Emmel E.A. McCutcheon M. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Between 1-5 × 107 cells were used per time point. To begin the extractions the cells were pelleted and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with the following protease inhibitors added to all buffers immediately before use: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. After washing, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA). The cells were pelleted again, resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (buffer A plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40), and allowed to incubate on ice for 1 min. The cell suspension was then pipetted up and down once. At this point >90% of the cells were lysed, yielding intact nuclei as determined by trypan blue staining and light microscopy. Intact nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 315 μl of buffer C (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and 35 μl of 3 M (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.8. The resultant solution was mixed at 4°C for 30 min to extract nuclear proteins and then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 15 min. An equal volume of 3 M (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.8, was added to the supernatant. Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 50-100 μl of buffer C. The protein samples were desalted on P6DG columns (Bio-Rad), and protein concentrations were determined using a dye binding assay (Bradford, 1976). The samples were stored in aliquots at −80°C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were done as described previously (Mattila et al., 1990Mattila P.S. Ullman K.S. Fiering S. Emmel E.A. McCutcheon M. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Binding reactions for NFAT were carried out in a 20-μl volume containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1.7 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10-30 μg of nuclear protein. Binding reactions for AP-1 were carried out in a 20-μl volume consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 13 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1.7 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of nuclear proteins (Mattila et al., 1990Mattila P.S.

Competitor oligonucleotides and anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, catalog nos. sc-253X (Fos) and sc-44X (Jun)) were added at concentrations of 25 ng/20 μl and 1 μg/20 μl, respectively. Reaction mixtures containing competitor oligonucleotides or antibodies were incubated on ice for 10 min before the addition of 0.1-0.5 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides end-labeled with [ϳ-32P]dATP. The probe for NFAT was based upon the distal NFAT recognition site in the promoter for human IL-2 (Emmel et al., 1989Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). It was prepared for the binding assay by annealing the single-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGCCT-TCTGTATGAAACAGTTTTTCCTCC-3′ (Midland Certified Reagent Company, Midland, TX) in the presence of 50 mM NaCl. The probes for AP-1, NFκB, TFIID, and GRE were purchased as double-stranded oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, 5′-GCAGAGCATATAAGGTGAGGTAGGA-3′, and 5′-TCGACTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACT-3′, respectively. These oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [ϳ-32P]dATP as needed (Promega). After a 40-min incubation on ice, the binding reactions were electrophoresed on prerun 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (0.5 times TBE = 45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA) for 2.5 h at 150 V. The gels were dried on Whatman No. 3MM filter paper and autoradiographed. Because NFAT activity in the Jurkat human T-cell line has been extensively characterized (Shaw et al., 1988Shaw J. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar; Shaw et al., 1988Shaw J. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A.

Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), we used this cell line as a positive control in the present experiments. To test whether NFAT binding activity is present in activated mast cells, we stimulated RBL-2H3 cells and RBMMC either through the FcϵRI or with PMA and ionomycin. Figure 1:, Figure 2: show that in fact, NFAT binding activity was induced in RBL cells and RBMMC after a 2-h incubation with PMA and ionomycin (lanes 5 and 3, respectively), and also after a 2-h stimulation via the Fcϵ receptor with the multivalent antigen TNP-BSA (lanes 6 and 2, respectively). Both stimulation protocols caused the appearance of a band that migrated to a position similar to that of the band induced in Jurkat cells treated with PMA and ionomycin. Triggering RBMMC through the Fcϵ receptor induced only modest NFAT activity, compared with that induced by activating the cells with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2). To determine the specificity of the NFAT DNA binding activity induced in RBL cells, unlabeled oligonucleotides containing various recognition sequences were added in excess to the EMSA reaction. As expected, excess unlabeled NFAT oligonucleotide completely reversed the NFAT DNA binding activity present in the nuclear extracts from RBL and Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the presence of excess unlabeled NFκB, TFIID, and GRE oligonucleotides had no effect on the NFAT binding activity in either RBL or Jurkat nuclear extracts. Hence, the NFAT DNA binding activity induced in RBL cells by stimulation via the FcϵRI was highly specific for the NFAT recognition motif. As stimulation of RBL cells via the FcϵRI induces expression of the AP-1 transcription complex (Baranes and Razin, 1991Baranes D. Razin E. Blood. 1991; 78: 2354-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Lewin et al., 1984), which in T-cells assembles with NFATc/p to form the NFAT transcription complex, we tested the hypothesis that AP-1 forms part of this complex in mast cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotides indeed removed the NFAT band both in RBL and in Jurkat cells at least as completely as the unlabeled NFAT oligonucleotides did when present at the same concentration. This is consistent with the idea that, as with T-cells, AP-1 forms part of the NFAT complex in RBL cells. To further explore this possibility, we performed EMSA in the presence of antibodies to the AP-1 proteins Fos and Jun. Using nuclear proteins from RBL cells stimulated through the FcϵRI receptor, Fig. 3B shows that either the Fos or the Jun antibody alone slightly reduced the NFAT binding activity and caused the appearance of a faint band of decreased mobility (lanes 2 and 3). When used in combination, the Fos and Jun antibodies completely abrogated the NFAT DNA binding activity induced by FcϵRI cross-linkage (lane 4). When triggered through the FcϵRI, NFAT binding activity was detectable within 10 min after exposure to antigen, and the activity steadily increased for up to 120 min (Fig. 4A). A low background level of NFAT binding activity could be detected in unstimulated cells. This background activity varied between experiments but did not mask the increase in NFAT induced by cell activation. Having evidence that AP-1 proteins contribute to the NFAT transcriptional complex present in RBL cells, we examined the kinetics of appearance of AP-1 activity following cell activation through the FcϵRI. Fig. 4B shows that AP-1 activity appeared in RBL nuclear extracts in a similar kinetic pattern as did NFAT, although virtually no AP-1 binding activity was present prior to activation. A slight induction was detected at 10 min, followed by a gradual increase in AP-1 activity up to 120 min. The absolute amount of binding-competent AP-1 appears greater at all time points than that of the NFAT complex, given the smaller amount of extract used in the AP-1 assays; this suggests that the rate of appearance of AP-1 does not limit the rate of appearance of NFAT DNA binding activity. To determine whether the appearance of NFAT in the nucleus of RBL cells is calcium-dependent, cells were activated in the presence of extracellular EGTA sufficient to buffer extracellular calcium to ~80 nM. Alternatively, cells were incubated with the cell permeant BAPTA-AM (20 μM) for 30 min at 37°C, conditions previously determined to block the calcium rise produced by FcϵRI cross-linkage.( 3M. A. McCloskey, unpublished results.) The 30-min pretreatment with EGTA did not by itself induce NFAT binding activity above the level present in the cells incubated in medium alone (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 6). Similarly, incubating RBL cells in the presence of BAPTA-AM for 30 min prior to beginning the experiment and for 60 min after beginning the experiment did not induce the appearance of NFAT above the level of the control (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 3, and 4). However, preincubation of cells with BAPTA-AM did inhibit completely the induction of NFAT binding activity by antigen (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5). Triggering RBL cells with antigen in the presence of extracellular EGTA induced very modest NFAT binding activity, considerably less than that induced in the presence of external millimolar free [Ca2+] (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 7). Nevertheless, prevention of calcium influx with EGTA did not inhibit NFAT induction as completely as did intracellular BAPTA, which quenches the rise in intracellular calcium due to both release from internal stores and influx across the plasma membrane. Hence, intracellular release apparently can support a modest NFAT induction, but a large, sustained induction requires influx of extracellular calcium. To determine whether the calcium-dependent protein phophatase calcineurin is involved in the induction of NFAT binding activity in mast cells, we activated RBL cells with antigen in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor CsA at concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/ml. CsA at 1 and 10 ng/ml had no effect on antigen-induced NFAT binding activity, whereas 100 ng/ml CsA reduced the activity markedly and 1000 ng/ml completely blocked nuclear NFAT induction (Fig. 6). Using specific DNA binding as a criterion, activation of RBL cells by cross-linkage of the Fcϵ receptor induced NFAT activity quantitatively similar to that seen in Jurkat cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 1). NFAT was detected in RBL nuclear extracts within 10 min following antigenic stimulation, with the activity steadily increasing for at least 2 h (Fig. 4A). This is similar to the kinetics of appearance of nuclear NFAT activity in Jurkat human T-cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Shaw et al., 1988Shaw J. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although somewhat faster than the appearance of AP-1-dependent NFAT activity in murine Ar-5 T-cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3ϵ antibodies (McCaffrey et al., 1993bMcCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Because RBL cells are a transformed analog of mast cells, the possibility exists that the presence of NFAT activity in these cells is an artifact of the transformation process. To address this possibility, we also assayed a non-transformed mast cell population derived from rat bone marrow. These cells showed nuclear NFAT activity inducible under the same activation regimens used with RBL cells (Fig. 2). As in previous studies with lymphocytes (see, e.g., Shaw et al., 1988Shaw J. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), modest NFAT activity sometimes was detected in nuclear extracts from unstimulated RBL cells. This activity appeared within 15-30 min after cells were removed from the culture flasks and was dependent upon the presence of extracellular calcium. Nuclear extracts prepared from cells eluted with EDTA and not restored to medium that contained mM Ca2+ did not possess NFAT DNA binding activity. To reduce basal NFAT activity to a low, albeit detectable level, cells were incubated in calcium-replete medium for 90 min prior to antigenic stimulation. We have observed large, transient rises in intracellular [Ca2+] in RBL cells exposed to an air-water interface,3 suggesting that adventitious calcium influx during cell preparation may be responsible for basal NFAT activity (see below). Two findings indicate directly that the induction of NFAT activity by cross-linkage of the FcϵRI is likely to require an elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+]. First, removal of the steep [Ca2+] gradient across the plasma membrane by buffering external free [Ca2+] at ~80 nM with extracellular EGTA markedly, although not completely, reduced the NFAT activity induced by 60 min (Fig. 5). Second, pretreatment of cells with BAPTA-AM under conditions found to block the antigen-induced calcium signal3 completely inhibited induction of NFAT activity by antigen (Fig. 5). Thus, the appearance of NFAT DNA binding activity in the nucleus of RBL cells could be part of a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway like that postulated to mediate the translocation of NFATp/c in T-cells. That some nuclear NFAT activity appeared when influx of extracellular Ca2+ alone was prevented suggests that sufficient Ca2+ may be mobilized from intracellular stores to initiate formation of the active NFAT complex but that sustained activity requires Ca2+ influx. What role does calcium play in the induction of mast cell NFAT activity? The ability of CsA, a potent calcineurin inhibitor, to block NFAT induction suggests that as with T-cells, calcium-dependent activation of this serine/threonine phosphatase is a key step in activation of NFAT via the FcϵRI. Antigen-induced NFAT activity in RBL cells was not affected by CsA at a concentration of 1 and 10 ng/ml but was significantly reduced by CsA at 100 ng/ml and was completely blocked at 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 6). This is similar, although not identical, to the dose-response curve for CsA inhibition of NFAT activity obtained with Jurkat cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. Emmel et al., 1989Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar found that CsA at concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml inhibited only slightly the induction of NFAT activity in Jurkat cells, and detectable activity was still present even at 1 μg/ml CsA. Also in Jurkat cells, Mattila et al., 1990Mattila P.S. Ullman K.S. Fiering S. Emmel E.A. McCutcheon M. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar found no inhibition of NFAT binding activity with 1 ng/ml CsA, but a significant reduction in NFAT binding with 10 and 100 ng/ml CsA. Thus, the effective concentration of CsA for inhibiting NFAT induction in RBL cells is similar to that found in Jurkat cells. In mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells cultured in IL-3, CsA has been shown to inhibit antigen-induced production of IL1-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 mRNA at IC50 values of 4.4, 72, and 143 ng/ml, respectively (Kaye et al., 1992Kaye R.E. Fruman D.A. Bierer B.E. Albers M.W. Zydowsky L.D. Ho S.I. Jin Y. Castells M.C. Schreiber S.L. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8542-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our results showing that CsA inhibits substantially the induction of NFAT activity at a similar effective concentration (100 ng/ml) suggests that NFAT may play a role in the transcriptional activation of these genes in mast cells. AP-1 and NFAT activity appeared in the nucleus with a similar time course following antigenic stimulation of RBL cells (Fig. 4, A and B). An NFAT nuclear complex in T-cells is thought to contain AP-1, based in part upon the finding that AP-1 oligonucleotides reverse binding of this putative complex to the NFAT recognition sequence, whereas the latter has no effect on binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 recognition motif (Jain et al., 1992Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar; Northrop et al., 1993Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identical observations with RBL cells (Fig. 3A) suggest that the NFAT complex therein also contains AP-1, although AP-1 in isolation cannot bind tightly to the NFAT recognition motif (data not shown) (Ullman et al., 1990Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar; Jain et al., 1992Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Here, we show that antibodies to the AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun, in combination, completely block NFAT DNA binding, thus providing independent evidence that, as in T-cells, these proteins contribute to the mast cell NFAT complex (Fig. 3B). Of a variety of tissues tested so far (Verweij et al., 1990Verweij C.L. Guidos C. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15788-15795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transcription mediated by the distal NFAT site in the IL-2 promoter appears restricted to T- and B-lymphocytes, and to a subpopulation of cells in the dermis, where skin mast cells are concentrated. DNA binding activity specific for this site in B-cells also was confirmed in EMSA studies of Verweij et al., 1990Verweij C.L. Guidos C. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15788-15795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Yaseen et al., 1993Yaseen N.R. Maizel A.L. Wang F. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, although in the latter study transcriptional activity was not demonstrated. Given that unstimulated lymphocytes generally do not exhibit substantial NFAT activity, and that other tissues tested were not stimulated as were the T-cells used for comparison, the conclusion on tissue specificity remains tentative. Future examination of other cell types may reveal, as found here, that stimulation via relevant receptors or with PMA and ionomycin, induces NFAT activity. Two recent studies indicate that assembly of the NFAT complex(es) is likely to involve more components and more intricate mechanisms than originally envisaged. McCaffrey et al., 1993bMcCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar cloned a cDNA corresponding to the preexisting cytoplasmic component NFATp from murine T-cells. A truncated recombinant protein expressed from this cDNA was shown to bind directly the murine distal NFAT recognition motif from the IL-2 promoter, to combine with Fos and Jun proteins to form another DNA-binding complex, and to be constitutively expressed in T-cells but not L-cells (McCaffrey et al., 1993bMcCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). There appear to be three alternatively spliced products of this gene. A similar study with human T-cells adds a new twist to the shuttle model for NFAT assembly. Ullman et al., 1990Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar cloned a human gene encoding another cytosolic protein, NFATc, which was transcribed differentially from NFATp in different tissues. Unexpectedly, NFATc transcripts were absent or barely discernible in unstimulated T-cells and lymphoid tissue, although NFATp transcripts were present constitutively. PMA and ionomycin induced transcription of NFATc but had no effect on NFATp (Northrop et al., 1994Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine which if any of the constitutive and inducible cytosolic components participate in nuclear NFAT assembly in mast cells. The present results indicate that at least two types of mast cells, RBL-2H3 cells and rat bone marrow cultured mast cells, in addition to lymphocytes, express latent NFAT DNA binding activity. As with lymphocytes, the role of AP-1 in, and the precise subunit composition of the mast cell NFAT complex are key questions for ongoing research. Mast cells provide a unique opportunity for studies of NFAT assembly, in that they can be stimulated much more readily through a physiologically relevant pathway, antigen binding, than can T-cells. Future studies may soon reveal whether mast cell NFAT mediates the transcription of one or more cytokine genes elaborated in response to FcϵRI cross-linkage."

The psaI gene is located 90 base pairs downstream from psaL, and is transcribed on 0.94- and 0.32-kilobase transcripts. To identify the function of PsaI, we generated a cyanobacterial strain in which psaI has been interrupted by a gene for chloramphenicol resistance. The wild-type and the mutant cells showed comparable rates of photoautotrophic growth at 25°C. However, the mutant cells grew slower and contained less chlorophyll than the wild-type cells, when grown at 40°C. The PsaI-less membranes from cells grown at either temperature showed a small decrease in NADP+ photoreduction rate when compared to the wild-type membranes. Inactivation of psaI led to an 80% decrease in the PsaL level in the photosynthetic membranes and to a complete loss of PsaL in the purified photosystem I preparations, but had little effect on the accumulation of other photosystem I subunits. Upon solubilization with nonionic detergents, photosystem I trimers could be obtained from the wild-type, but not from the PsaI-less membranes. The PsaI-less photosystem I monomers did not contain detectable levels of PsaL. Therefore, a structural interaction between PsaL and PsaI may stabilize the association of PsaL with the photosystem I core. PsaL in the wild-type and PsaI-less membranes showed equal resistance to removal by chaotropic agents. However, PsaL in the PsaI-less strain exhibited an increased susceptibility to proteolysis. From these data, we conclude that PsaI has a crucial role in aiding normal structural organization of PsaL within the photosystem I complex and the absence of PsaI alters PsaL organization, leading to a small, but physiologically significant, defect in photosystem I function.

The PsaA and PsaB subunits of PS I form the heterodimeric core of the complex which harbors ~100 antenna chlorophyll a, the primary electron donor (P700), and a chain of electron acceptors (A0, A1, and FX). PsaC binds the terminal electron acceptors, FA and FB, which are two [4Fe-4S] centers. PsaD serves as a ferredoxin-docking site (5Zanetti G. Merati G. Eur. J.

The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 provides an attractive system for studying the organization and function of PS I. Its PS I complex is structurally and functionally similar to that from higher plants, but its genome is simpler and can be more easily manipulated. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 can take up extraneous DNA and incorporate it into the genome by homologous recombination(21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar), thus enabling one to mutate specific genes. We have embarked on a program to identify functions of the subunits of PS I through targeted mutagenesis of the genes encoding these subunits in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Previously, we have cloned the genes that code for PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaJ, and PsaL from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and subsequently generated mutants in which these genes have been interrupted or deleted(14Chitnis V.P. Xu Q. Yu L. Golbeck J.H. Nakamoto H. Xie D.-L. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

This approach has allowed us to demonstrate in vivo importance of these subunits in function and organization of PS I. In this paper, we describe molecular cloning, characterization, and targeted inactivation of psaI that codes for a 4-kDa hydrophobic protein of PS I. We investigated the role of PsaI in the function and structural organization of PS I using the PsaI-less strain. Oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the amino-terminal residues of PsaI (19Ikeuchi M. Sonoike K. Koike H. Pakrasi H. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 33: 1057-1063Google Scholar) were used to screen a genomic library of Synechocystis DNA in pBluescript II SK+/-. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive colonies by the alkaline lysis method and screened further by dot blots and Southern blots(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both strands of a 0.7-kb Sau3A fragment containing the psaI gene were completely sequenced. Overlapping deletions in this fragment were generated by exonuclease III digestion (27Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and their nucleotide sequences determined by the dideoxy termination method(28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were aligned and analyzed using GeneWorks software (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA). Southern blotting was performed using 1 μg of Synechocystis genomic DNA for each restriction digestion. For Northern analysis, total cellular RNA was isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, 10 μg of RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel and then transferred to Magnacharge nylon membranes (Fisher Biotech). A 200-bp fragment containing the complete psaI was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer labeling, and used as a probe in Southern and Northern analyses. Hybridization analyses were performed using a rapid hybridization mixture (Amersham Corp.). A mutant strain lacking psaI was generated by transforming the wild-type strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with DNA of a clone (pK81C) in which psaI was interrupted by a gene conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (see “Results” for more details). Transformation was carried out according to previously described methods(21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The transformants resistant to chloramphenicol were segregated for a few generations by a combination of single colony selection and growth in a liquid BG11 medium(14Chitnis V.P. Xu Q. Yu L.

Interruption of psaI in the mutant strain AIC9 was confirmed by Southern analysis. The wild-type and mutant AIC9 strain with inactive psaI were grown in BG-11 medium (21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar) with or without 5 mM glucose and 30 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol under a light intensity of 21 μmol m-2 s-1. Chlorophyll content in whole cells was determined according to Ref. 21. For high temperature growth experiments, the culture flasks were incubated in a 40°C water bath and the cultures were constantly aerated by bubbling air through the medium. The growth of bacterial cultures was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the cultures at 730 nm. Rates of oxygen evolution or uptake were determined according to Ref. 14. Chlorophyll to P700 ratios in the photosynthetic membranes were determined based on the oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectrum of P700(29Marsho T.V. Kok B. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 280-289Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Spectra of chlorophyll fluorescence emission at 77 K were measured with isolated photosynthetic membranes and PS I trimers. The samples were adjusted to 5 μg of chlorophyll (ml-1) in 60% (v/v) glycerol to minimize crystal fracturing and quickly cooled to 77 K in liquid N2. The photosynthetic membranes and PS I trimers were positioned in a 430-nm excitation beam, and the fluorescence spectra at wavelengths 600-850 nm were monitored with a SPEX Fluorolog (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) equipped with a Dewar assembly. The rate of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction was measured using a modified Shimadzu spectrophotometer according to Ref. 12, except that both ferredoxin and cytochrome c6 used in the reaction mixture were obtained from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Photosynthetic membranes from the wild-type and mutant cells were isolated and suspended in 0.4 M sucrose, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MOPS-HCl (pH 7.0)(14Chitnis V.P. Xu Q. Yu L. Golbeck J.H. Nakamoto H. Xie D.-L. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11678-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentrations were determined in 80% (v/v) acetone(30Arnon D. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate Triton X-100-solubilized PS I complexes, the membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100, and PS I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation(18Xu Q. Yu L. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate PS I monomers and trimers, the photosynthetic membranes were solubilized with n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside and fractionated by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation(15Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The PS I complexes purified by these procedures are suitable for analysis of PS I electron transport using native electron donors and acceptors(18Xu Q. Yu L. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photosynthetic membranes in the wild-type and PsaI-less strains were adjusted to 150 μg of chlorophyll (ml-1) and were treated with 10 mM glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Glutaraldehyde was stored at −20°C prior to use. The cross-linking reactions were quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 10 mM for 15 min. Subsequently, the samples were diluted with an excess of 10 mM MOPS-HCl (pH 7.0) and pelleted. The membrane samples were analyzed by Western blotting. For chaotropic extraction, photosynthetic membranes of the wild-type and AIC9 strains were adjusted to 200 μg of chlorophyll (ml-1) and exposed to 0, 1, 2, and 3 M NaI for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, the samples were diluted with an excess of 10 mM MOPS-HCl (pH 7.0) and pelleted. The pellets were resuspended, washed once, and analyzed by Western blotting. For protease treatments, the wild-type and AIC9 membranes were incubated with chymotrypsin (Sigma) (1 mg of protease/mg of chlorophyll) at 37°C for 0, 5, 20, and 40 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μM final concentration). PS I subunits in the protease-treated membranes were analyzed using Western blotting. The psaI gene was amplified using the PC264 and PC267 primers that added EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites at the beginning and end of the psaI open reading frame, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV restriction endonucleases and ligated into pGEX-KG vector that had been digested with EcoRI and EcoICRI enzymes(31Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The resultant clone contained psaI fused in-frame to the end of a gene that codes for glutathione S-transferase. The fused gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and inclusion bodies containing the fusion protein were isolated(31Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). After solubilization of the inclusion bodies with SDS, the glutathione S-transferase-PsaI fusion protein was separated using preparative Tricine/urea/SDS-PAGE, gel strip was excised and used to immunize rabbits. Postimmune specificity and titer were determined by Western blotting. Polypeptide composition of PS I was analyzed by modified Tricine/urea/SDS-PAGE(12Xu Q. Jung Y.S. Chitnis V.P. Guikema J.A. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver nitrate. Alternatively, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P) membranes (Millipore). Western blotting was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham). Polyclonal antibodies against Anacystis nidulans PsaA-PsaB were raised in rabbit(32Henry R.L. Takemoto L.J. Murphy J. Gallegos G.L. Guikema J.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against PsaC and PsaD were from Dr. John H. Golbeck, University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Antibodies against PsaF, PsaL, and PsaE were generated against the respective proteins from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803(25Xu Q. Odom W.R. Guikema J.A. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Xu Q. Armbrust T.S. Guikema J.A. Chitnis P.R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We synthesized an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of PsaI(19Ikeuchi M. Sonoike K. Koike H. Pakrasi H. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 33: 1057-1063Google Scholar). A genomic library was screened using a 32P-end-labeled probe and positive clones were isolated. Southern analysis of the pK81 plasmid indicated that the psaI gene resided in an 0.7-kb Sau3A fragment. In Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, psaI-specific probe hybridized to a single band in all restriction digests (data not shown), indicating that psaI is present as a single copy in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The nucleotide sequence of the region within the 0.7-kb fragment containing the psaI gene revealed an open reading frame comprising psaI gene (Fig. 1). It is 120 bp long and encodes a protein of 40 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence determined by chemical protein sequencing is found beginning at residue 1 of PsaI protein(19Ikeuchi M. Sonoike K. Koike H. Pakrasi H. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 33: 1057-1063Google Scholar). Therefore, the protein encoded by psaI is not post-translationally processed. In contrast, the product of psaI from another cyanobacterium, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, contains an NH2-terminal presequence(33Sonoike K. Ikeuchi M. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Examination of the nucleotide sequence also revealed the presence of an open reading frame that started 183 bp downstream from psaI and continued beyond the cloned fragment. The protein encoded by this open reading frame was homologous to MurG protein of E. coli that functions as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:N-acetylmuramyl-(pentapeptide)pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol N-acetylglucosamine transferase involved in the membrane steps of peptidoglycan synthesis(34Mengin-Lecreulx D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Another open reading frame that codes for PsaL of PS I was found 90 bp upstream from psaI(14Chitnis V.P. Xu Q. Yu L.

Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of PsaI indicated the presence of a 26-amino acid long hydrophobic domain flanked by hydrophilic amino and carboxyl termini (Fig. 2A).

The length and primary structure of the hydrophobic domain are highly conserved among PsaI proteins from cyanobacteria and higher plants. Plasmid pK81 was treated with NcoI that has a unique site in psaI (Fig. 1), the DNA ends were made blunt using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and a gene for chloramphenicol resistance was ligated to yield plasmid pK81C. In this plasmid, psaI is interrupted by the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase which was isolated from plasmid pUC4C (14Chitnis V.P. Xu Q. Yu L. Golbeck J.H. Nakamoto H. Xie D.-L. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11678-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after digestion with restriction endonuclease SmaI. The orientation of the resistance cassette with respect to psaI was determined to ensure that it would be transcribed in the same direction as psaL. The plasmid pK81C was used to transform the wild-type cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were selected and segregated to generate the AIC9 mutant strain. Fig. 3A shows the Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from the wild-type and AIC9 strains. The genomic DNAs were digested completely with EcoRI or HindIII, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA fragments containing the psaI gene. When digested with EcoRI, the probe for the PsaI-coding region hybridized with a 18-kb fragment in wild-type DNA but fragments of 15 and 3.2 kb were seen in the mutant DNA (Fig. 3A). Introduction of an additional EcoRI site in the mutant chromosome was expected since the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase contains an EcoRI site. In HindIII-digested DNAs, the probe recognized a 3.0-kb fragment in wild-type DNA but a 4.4-kb fragment in the mutant DNA, as expected due to insertion of the 1.4-kb DNA cassette containing the gene for chloramphenicol resistance. Therefore the AIC9 strain contains only the interrupted psaI gene. Total RNA was isolated from the wild-type and AIC9 mutant strains and used for Northern analysis of psaI transcripts. Northern hybridization of a psaI probe to total RNA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 revealed two distinct RNA species in the wild type (Fig. 3B). It seems that the psaI gene was transcribed on two distinct transcripts of 0.94 and 0.32 kb. The possibility that the smaller transcript was derived from processing of the larger transcript is less likely, because when psaL is interrupted in the ALC7-3 strain, the 0.32-kb transcript is present in normal amounts (data not shown). When the same Magnacharge nylon membrane was stripped of the psaI probe and hybridized with a probe for psaL, a RNA species of 0.94 kb was recognized (data not shown). Similarly, a DNA fragment could be amplified from total RNA of the wild-type strain by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction using a primer in the PsaL-coding region and a primer in the psaI gene (data not shown). Computer-assisted search of DNA sequences failed to identify any potential prokaryotic transcription termination sequences in the intergenic region between psaL and psaI. In contrast, the DNA sequences in the 3′-flanking region of psaI may form step-loop structures that are typical of prokaryotic transcriptional terminators. Therefore, the larger transcript is a bicistronic RNA for psaL and psaI. The smaller transcript may be derived from only the psaI gene (Fig. 3B). Northern hybridization of a psaI probe to total RNA in the AIC9 strain revealed only one RNA species (Fig. 3B). This species was smaller in size when compared with 0.32-kb psaI transcript in the wild type. This was expected as insertion of the chloramphenicol-resistance gene in psaI would introduce a transcriptional terminator. We generated a polyclonal antibody against PsaI using a glutathione S-transferase-PsaI fusion protein that was expressed in E. coli. Western blotting of the photosynthetic membrane proteins showed that the anti-PsaI antibodies specifically recognized a protein species that matched the position of PsaI (Fig. 3C). The PsaI subunit was absent in the AIC9 mutant strain. We also purified PS I complexes from the wild-type and AIC9 mutant strains and separated their polypeptides by Tricine/urea/SDS-PAGE to confirm the absence of PsaI in PS I. Electrophoresis resolved several low mass subunits of PS I, including PsaE, PsaC, PsaK, PsaI, PsaJ, and PsaM from the wild-type PS I (Fig. 3D). As expected from Southern, Northern, and Western analyses, the PS I preparation from the AIC9 mutant strain specifically lacked the 4-kDa PsaI subunit. Taken together, the AIC9 mutant strain had an interrupted psaI and lacked the PsaI subunit. Table I compares the photosynthetic characteristics of the wild-type and AIC9 strains. When the mutant and wild-type strains were grown at 25°C under photoautotrophic conditions, the doubling time of the AIC9 strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain (Table I). Furthermore, the mutant strain could normally grow under photoheterotrophic conditions in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-1-dimethylurea and glucose, indicating that the cyclic electron flow around PS I is normal in the absence of PsaI. Chlorophyll per cell remained similar in the mutant and wild-type cells. When grown at 40°C, the wild-type and mutant cells had 26- and 39.9-h doubling times, respectively. A similar decrease in growth rate was also observed in the PsaL-less strain (36.3-h doubling time). At higher temperature, the total cellular chlorophyll decreased in the mutant cells (3.7 μg of chlorophyll/OD at 730 nm), but not in the wild-type cells (4.3 μg of chlorophyll/OD at 730 nm).TABLE IPhotosynthetic characteristics the wild-type and AIC9 mutant strains Open table in a new tab The light-dependent oxygen evolution or uptake by whole cells were used as indicators of photosynthetic electron transfer. Both the wild-type and AIC9 cells showed about the same rate of overall photosynthetic activity (Table I). As expected, PS II activity remained unchanged in the mutant. To measure PS I activity (as the rate of oxygen uptake) in the intact cells, PS II activity was inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, and then ascorbate and diaminodurene were used to donate electrons to PS I. The rates of oxygen uptake due to electron transport through PS I were similar in the wild-type and mutant cells. The mutant photosynthetic membranes contained about the same numbers of chlorophylls per P700 as the wild-type, indicating that the absence of PsaI does not affect the number of active PS I reaction centers in the membranes. The chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra of isolated photosynthetic membranes were examined at 77 K following excitation at 430 nm. 77 K fluorescence emission spectrum of Synechocystis PS I exhibits a single peak with a maximum at 725 nm(41Shen G. Vermaas W.F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7379-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The wild-type and AIC9 mutant strains showed identical fluorescence emission maxima originating from PS I, suggesting that absence of PsaI did not cause significant changes in the organization of pigments. NADP+ photoreduction activity of PS I was determined using reduced cytochrome c6 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as the electron donor, oxidized ferredoxin from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as the electron acceptor, and spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase to catalyze NADPH production. The reductase activity of PS I in PsaI-less mutant membranes was ~15% less than that of the wild-type PS I. PsaL-less membranes also show a similar decrease in NADP+ photoreduction(12Xu Q. Jung Y.S.

https://openalex.org/W1969002716,"Prostaglandin (PG) E receptor EP3D is coupled to both Gi and Gs. To examine the roles of the interaction of α-carboxylic acid of PGE2 and its putative binding site, the arginine residue in the seventh transmembrane domain of EP3D, in receptor-G protein coupling, we have mutated the arginine residue to the noncharged glutamine. PGE2 with a negatively charged α-carboxylic acid and sulprostone, an EP3 agonist with a noncharged modified α-carboxylic acid, inhibited the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity via Gi activation in the EP3D receptor in the same concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the adenylate cyclase stimulation via Gs activation by sulprostone was much lower than that by PGE2. On the other hand, both PGE2 and sulprostone showed potent Gi activity but failed to show Gs activity in the mutant receptor. EP3D receptor showed a high affinity binding for PGE2 in the form coupled to either Gi or Gs. Although the mutant receptor showed high affinity binding when coupled to Gi, it lost high affinity binding in the condition of Gs coupling. Furthermore, sulprostone bound to the Gi-coupled EP3D receptor with higher affinity than the Gs-coupled receptor. Among various EP3 agonists, α-carboxylic acid-unmodified agonists showed both Gi and Gs activities, but the modified agonists showed only Gi activity. These findings suggest that the interaction between the α-carboxylic acid of PGE2 and the arginine residue of the receptor regulates the selectivity of the G protein coupling."

The dSos catalytic domain (residues 758-1125), expressed without the dSos NH2-terminal (residues 1-757) or adaptor-binding, COOH-terminal (residues 1126-1596) regions, exhibits intrinsic exchange activity as evidenced by its rescue of mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in endogenous GTP/GDP exchange activity. Here we show that this dSos catalytic domain fails to affect GTP.p21ras levels when expressed in cultured mammalian cells unless the NH2-terminal domain is also present. Surprisingly, the COOH-terminal, adaptor binding domain of dSos was not sufficient to confer p21ras exchange activity to the Sos catalytic domain in these cells in the absence of the NH2-terminal domain. This function of promoting catalytic domain activity could be localized by mutational analysis to the pleckstrin and Dbl homology sequences located just NH2-terminal to the catalytic domain.

https://openalex.org/W1604362023,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of various shear conditions on endothelial cell intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were loaded with Fluo-3 and exposed to flow in a parallel plate flow chamber designed for confocal microscopy. The flow medium was medium 199 (M-199), which was prepared with and without adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the presence of ATP, initiation of flow at a shear stress of 2.5 dyn/cm2 evoked a strong, sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i that gradually returned to baseline levels over 10 to 15 min. By contrast, in the absence of ATP, initiation of flow at 2.5 dyn/cm2 produced only transient increases in [Ca2+]i in a small proportion of the cells. As shear rate was increased from 2.5 to 15 dyn/cm2 in this medium, both the relative fluorescence of the monolayer and the proportion of cells across the monolayer that displayed calcium transients increased in a dose-dependent fashion. In conclusion, the response of an endothelial cell monolayer to increasing levels of shear is not only to increase [Ca2+]i within individual cells, but to increase the duration of response and the number of cells responding at the onset of shear. This recruitment of larger numbers of cells at higher levels of shear may represent a novel signaling mechanism within the endothelium."

CO binding studies on heme b595 have also given equivocal results, with optical measurements and potentiometric titrations appearing to differ(12Edwards C. Beer S. Siviram A. Chance B. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Smith A. Hill S. Anthony C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the use of optical spectroscopy to assign the absorbance bands in the Soret region is difficult, mainly because of band overlap and weak absorption, but in the α-band region three heme types have been distinguished(8Lorence R.M. Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2314-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The cytochrome bd complex is of particular interest not only because of its role in respiratory protection in A. vinelandii, where its enzyme activity is one of the highest of all the terminal oxidases, but also because the mechanism of oxygen reduction can be contrasted with that of the copper-containing oxidases. These latter oxidases also reduce oxygen to water in a binuclear heme/copper center with strong cooperativity between the two redox metals. Several well defined intermediates have been detected in this center(14Babcock G.T. Wikström M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The copper-containing oxidases have the additional capability of proton translocation(15Wikström M. Nature. 1977; 266: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), which is thought to involve coordination changes in or around the copper/heme binuclear center(16Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Wikström M. Bogachev A. Finel M. Morgan J.E. Puustinen A. Raitio M. Verkhovskaya M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In comparison, little is known about the reaction mechanism of the cytochrome bd oxidase, which shares no primary sequence homology with the copper-containing oxidases although mechanistic similarities exist. Oxygenated and peroxy states have been detected (18, 19) as well as an oxoferryl heme d(20Kahlow M.A. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reconstituted system is capable of forming a transmembrane electrochemical gradient, although without translocation of protons(21Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1051-1056Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At the oxygen reduction site, interaction between the high spin heme groups, b595 and d, has been suggested by EPR studies(7Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CO titrations (22Jɒnemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 345SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (23Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have led to the proposal of a heme-heme binuclear center at the oxygen binding site. In the present work, we have purified and characterized the complex from A. vinelandii in order to quantitate the binding of various ligands at the oxygen binding site. The results clearly show the presence of one heme d per cytochrome bd complex. In addition, the results of CO, NO, and CN- binding argue against the presence of a strongly interacting binuclear center in the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of the Cytochrome bd ComplexThe cytochrome bd-overexpressing A. vinelandii strain MK8 was grown essentially as described by Kelly et al.(1Kelly M.J.S. Poole R.K. Yates M.G. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4°C. Membranes from approximately 50 g, wet weight, of cells were prepared (1Kelly M.J.S. Poole R.K. Yates M.G. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mM EDTA and 0.5 M KCl. The membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (10 mg of protein/ml). Sodium cholate was added from a 10% (w/v) stock solution to give a final concentration of 2% (w/v), and the mixture was left stirring overnight. After centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min, the cytochrome bd-containing pellet was washed twice in phosphate buffer alone to remove the remaining cholate. The pellet was suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, (15 mg of protein/ml), and lauryl maltoside was added to a final concentration of 1.5% (w/v). The suspension was stirred for 1 h before being centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 15 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give 55% saturation. The mixture was left for 30 min and centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 15 min. The red pellet was discarded. Raising the ammonium sulfate concentration to 80% and adjusting the pH to 7.2 with dilute ammonium hydroxide precipitates the oxidase complex. The floating pellet was dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (10-15 mg of protein/ml) and stored under liquid nitrogen.Chemicals and AssaysThe protein concentration of vesicle suspensions and membrane protein preparations was measured by a modified Lowry method(24Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5290) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone-1 was a kind gift from Dr. R. Cammack (King's College London). Before use, it was chromatographed on Merck silica gel 60 TLC plates, using chloroform:hexane:diethylether 10:10:1 as solvent. The ubiquinone-1 was then dissolved in ethanol. The assay for oxidase activity was based on that described by Kita et al.(25Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 25°C containing 1 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.9, plus ubiquinone-1 and DTT1( 1The abbreviation used is: DTTdithiothreitol. )at the concentrations indicated. The reaction was started by adding 5-10 μg of cytochrome bd that had been pre-incubated on ice for 5 min in 10 μl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1 mM phospholipid (L-α-phosphatidylcholine from Soybean, Type IV-S, Sigma). Optical spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 210 spectrophotometer at room temperature, using a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm and a scan rate of 2 nm s-1. The spectra were stored in digitalized form for treatment. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in a minigel unit (10 × 7.5 cm) essentially as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) with the exception that the sample buffer contained 6% (w/v) SDS and 8 M urea in order to prevent aggregation of the oxidase complex. The samples were loaded onto the gel without prior incubation. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (2% in 45% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid) and destained in the same solvent without dye. Pyridine hemochrome spectra were determined by mixing 0.75 ml of diluted cytochrome preparation with 175 μl of pyridine and 75 μl of 1 M NaOH. The dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide oxidized difference spectrum was immediately recorded. The b-type hemes were quantified using an extinction coefficient of 24 mM-1 cm-1 (556 nm minus 540 nm)(27Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Continuous wave EPR measurements were recorded on a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer fitted with a TE103 rectangular cavity and a Hewlett-Packard microwave frequency counter 5350B and an Oxford instruments liquid helium flow cryostat ESR900. Spectra were base line-corrected by subtraction of a cavity spectrum of water/buffer under identical conditions. The iron and copper content of the samples was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Varian AA-1475 spectrometer.Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide Binding TitrationsNitric oxide was generated by reaction of 2 M sulfuric acid with sodium nitrite under nitrogen atmosphere and washed by passage through 1 M sodium hydroxide and water. Saturated solutions of carbon monoxide or nitric oxide were prepared by bubbling the respective gas through ice-cold water for 10 min. The concentration of the gas in solution was determined by titration of a myoglobin standard. Aliquots of the stock solution were added anaerobically to the reduced cytochrome preparation at room temperature. After equilibration (2-3 min), the spectrum was recorded over the range 400-700 nm. The end point of a titration was determined by bubbling the gas through the suspension at room temperature to obtain a saturated sample.RESULTSPurification of the Cytochrome bd ComplexCytochrome bd has been purified previously from E. coli(5Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9159-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Klebsiella pneumoniae(13Smith A. Hill S. Anthony C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Photobacterium phosphoreum(28Konishi K. Ouchi M. Kita K. Horikoshi I. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and A. vinelandii(6Kolonay Jr., J.F. Moshiri F. Gennis R.B. Kaysser T.M. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4177-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental conditions for the first three organisms cannot be directly applied to A. vinelandii, mainly because of the instability of the complex in the detergents used. We have developed a simple and fast procedure for purification of the complex from the overexpressing mutant strain MK8 of A. vinelandii based on ammonium sulfate precipitation. This was briefly described by Jɒnemann and Wrigglesworth(29Jɒnemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and a full characterization of the preparation is given here. Table I summarizes the results of a representative preparation of the cytochrome bd complex. The initial wash in KCl removes flavin and b/c-type cytochromes as judged from the optical spectra (results not shown). The crucial step appears to be the extraction in lauryl maltoside, where the oxidase is solubilized selectively. Any extra contaminating b-type cytochrome is precipitated by the subsequent ammonium sulfate treatment which was also shown, by EPR, to remove iron-sulfur complexes. An SDS gel of the final preparation (Fig. 1) shows the presence of two main bands indicative of polypeptides with molecular masses of 50 and 31 kDa. These values can be compared with values of 50.1 and 35 kDa as calculated from the nucleic acid sequences of the two subunits of cytochrome bd from A. vinelandii. (It should be noted that the values of 59.7 and 42 kDa quoted in the literature for this calculation (30Moshiri F. Chawla A. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6230-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are higher because no allowance for water removal on peptide bond formation was made.) Components with other molecular weights comprised less than 12% on the basis of densitometry scans of Coomassie-stained gels. A pyridine hemochrome spectrum of the purified complex (not shown) revealed only b-type (556 nm) and d-type (608 nm) hemes to be present. Quantitation of the hemes by this method depends on the extinction coefficient for the pyridine hemochromes. No reliable value has been found for d-type heme but an early value of 20.7 mM-1 cm-1 for b-type heme (41Fuhrhop J.-H. Smith K.M. Smith K.M. Pophyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1975: 804-808Google Scholar) has been remeasured as 24.0 mM-1 cm-1(27Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Using this latter figure, the present preparation contains 10.3 nmol of heme b/mg of protein (Table II). The iron content determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy was found to be 17.6 nmol/mg of protein (Table II), which is 1.7 times the amount of the total b-type heme content determined by the pyridine hemochrome method. As expected, no copper was detected in the final preparation. The final preparation oxidized ubiquinol-1 (ubiquinone-1 plus DTT) with specific activity similar to that of the preparation described by Kolonay et al.(6Kolonay Jr., J.F. Moshiri F. Gennis R.B. Kaysser T.M. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4177-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity with alternative substrates was lower, being 230 nmol of O2 consumed/s/mg of protein using duroquinol (250 μM plus 1 mM DTT) and 127 nmol O2 consumed/s/mg of protein with N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (1 mM plus 5 mM ascorbate).TABLE IPurification of cytochrome bd from A. vinelandii Open table in a new tab TABLE IIAnalysis of purified cytochrome bd complex from A. vinelandii Open table in a new tab Spectroscopic PropertiesThe absolute spectra of air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced complex are shown in Fig. 2 together with the difference spectrum. The main features are similar to those of the cytochrome bd complexes purified from P. phosphoreum(28Konishi K. Ouchi M. Kita K. Horikoshi I. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), E. coli(9Lorence R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7135-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and K. pneumoniae(13Smith A. Hill S. Anthony C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The samples as prepared contained a high proportion of the stable oxygenated species with a peak in the air-oxidized spectrum at 646 nm (trough in the difference spectrum at 650 nm). An indicative measure of the purity of the complex is the ratio of peak intensities in the reduced minus air-oxidized spectra at 560-580 nm and 630-650 nm, which approaches 1 for the purer preparations. The slight shoulder around 550 nm is not due to c-type cytochrome but has been ascribed to the β-band of heme b595 in E. coli(21Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1051-1056Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Green G.N. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of the air-oxidized purified complex is shown in Fig. 3(upper trace). Simulation of the spectrum in the high spin region suggests the presence of both axial and rhombic components. A prominent high spin axial component at g = 6 comprises over two-thirds of the signal and, in the E. coli complex, has been assigned to heme d(7Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Meinhardt S.W. Gennis R.B. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The remaining high spin rhombic features at g = 5.5 and g = 6.3 have been assigned to heme b595. Features associated with ferric low spin heme can be seen at g = 3.4 and around g = 2.55. The g = 3.4 signal has been shown in E. coli to titrate with an EM of 226 mV and has been assigned to heme b558(7Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Signals around g = 2.5 in the E. coli enzyme have been resolved into a combination of three different components including a rhombic form with gz and gy features at 2.61 and 2.48(11Meinhardt S.W. Gennis R.B. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The intensity of the signals was found to vary from preparation to preparation, but in redox titrations they all titrated with the same redox midpoint potential and have been ascribed to low spin ferric heme d(11Meinhardt S.W. Gennis R.B. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We ascribe the signal around g = 2 in the present preparation to a small amount of free radical with a signal close to the gz component of the high spin axial signal. A small amount of nonspecifically bound iron can be seen at g = 4.3, consistent with the iron content measured by atomic absorption being slightly higher than 1.5 times the total b-type heme, assuming a b/d heme ratio of 2:1.Figure 2:Absorption spectra of purified cytochrome bd complex from A. vinelandii.

The air-oxidized samples (26 μM) were suspended in potassium HEPES, pH 7 (upper trace) and in Tris-HCl, pH 9 (1-min exposure) (lower trace). Conditions of measurement were as follows: temperature, 5 K; microwave frequency, 9.35 GHz; microwave power, 20 mW; modulation amplitude, 10 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; gain, 2 × 104; time constant, 163 ms. The spectra are base line-corrected by subtraction of the spectrum of buffer measured under the same conditions. Simulated spectra (program by Neese (45Neese F.

The parameters used in the simulations were as follows: rhombic component, gx, gy, and gz at 6.20, 5.47, and 2.00, respectively, with linewidths 16.0 G, 19.5 G, and 100 G, and axial component, gx, gy, and gz at 5.915, 5.88, and 2.00, respectively, with linewidths 9.5 G, 40 G, and 100 G. See “Results” for the relative contributions of each component to the final spectra.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hydroxide Effects on the Air-oxidized Cytochrome bd OxidaseFig. 3(lower trace) shows the effect of short time exposure at alkaline pH on the EPR spectrum of the air-oxidized bd complex. The main change is a decrease in the high spin axial component and an increase in the rhombic signal. Changes in the optical spectrum at 646 nm (not shown) indicated that deoxygenation of heme d occurred at alkaline pH. Simulation of the EPR spectra (Fig. 3, dotted lines), assuming no pH-dependent change in the zero field-splitting parameters for the axial and rhombic components, indicates that the total intensity of the high spin components drops by approximately one-third at alkaline pH. However, most of this drop is due to a loss of the axial component. The relative amount of the rhombic species approximately doubled (from 28 to 74%), corresponding to an absolute increase by a factor of 1.8. It would appear that a pH-dependent removal of molecular oxygen from oxygenated heme d is associated with a change in the line shape of the high spin signal in the EPR spectrum. No significant changes were detected in the low spin region. In particular, no signals indicative of the formation of any low spin ferric complex with hydroxide (S = 0.25) could be identified. The EPR changes were fully reversible on resuspending the sample back in pH 7 buffer after ultrafiltration through an Amicon YM10 membrane.CO Binding to Reduced Cytochrome bdThe CO reduced minus reduced difference spectra of the purified complex at low (3 μM) and saturating (>0.8 mM) CO concentrations are shown in Fig. 4. Binding of CO induces changes in the α-band spectrum of reduced heme d. Titration of these changes (644 nm minus 623 nm) shows saturation at low (stoichiometric) amounts of CO (Fig. 5A), giving an average of 5.1 ± 0.4 (n = 4) nmol of CO bound/mg of protein, equivalent to 1 CO bound/complex (Table II). The difference spectrum in the Soret region for these titration experiments is more complex (Fig. 4). A clear trough can be seen at 443 nm, but also present is a double trough between 415 and 426 nm. At higher CO concentrations, no further changes occur in the heme d spectrum at 644 nm minus 623 nm, but a deepening of the trough at 426 nm occurs together with smaller changes at 560 nm and 590-600 nm. We attribute these changes to CO binding with low affinity to heme b595.Figure 4:CO reduced minus reduced difference spectrum at low (3 μM) (A) and high (approximately 1 mM) (B) CO concentrations.

A titration of the redshift of the heme d α-band on NO binding (653 nm minus 627 nm in the difference spectrum) results in 5.5 ± 0.4 nmol of NO bound/mg of protein (Fig. 5B). This high affinity binding is associated with changes in the Soret region of the optical spectrum at 443 nm and around 425 nm. On increasing the NO concentration to higher than stoichiometric amounts, features develop at 437, 560, and 595-600 nm, which we attribute to low affinity binding to heme b595. Binding of NO to reduced cytochrome bd also induces a heme-nitrosyl EPR spectrum (Fig. 7, trace a) with some similarities to that reported for the NO complex of the β-subunit of hemoglobin(42Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Erman J.E. Leigh Jr., J.S. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2447-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of this spectrum changes as the NO concentration is increased from stoichiometric amounts to higher levels (Fig. 7, trace b) consistent with NO binding to a separate heme site. Subtraction of the two spectra from each other (Fig. 7, upper trace) shows the low affinity species (appearing at high NO concentrations) to have strong rhombic symmetry similar to that seen in NO derivatives of several ferrous hemeproteins (42Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Erman J.E. Leigh Jr., J.S. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2447-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) including the α-subunit of hemoglobin(43Henry Y. Ducrocq C. Drapier J.-C. Servent D. Pellat C. Guissani A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A well resolved hyperfine structure was not obvious under the conditions used for either the low NO affinity or high NO affinity spectra. Samples for EPR were taken alongside the optical titrations, at low and high ligand concentrations. When quantified against a copper/EDTA standard, the spin concentration at stoichiometric amounts of NO was 5.2 nmol/mg of protein, increasing to 10 nmol/mg of protein at high NO concentrations. We conclude that there are two NO binding sites of equal concentration but different affinities. The spectral evidence indicates that these are heme d and heme b595,"

The major form has an apparent molecular mass of 155-175 kDa under standard conditions of SDS-PAGE or approximately 190 kDa (α1190) by Ferguson plot analysis (33De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A.

Anti-peptide antibodies directed against the COOH terminus of the predicted amino acid sequence of the α1 subunit detect only a small fraction of full-length protein (<5%) with an apparent molecular mass of 212 kDa (α1212)(32De Jongh K.S.

Nastainczyk W. Sieber M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the predicted amino acid sequence of the 212-kDa form of the α1 subunit contains three potential phosphorylation sites that are absent from the 190-kDa form, suggesting a possible mechanism for differential regulation of the two forms(32De Jongh K.S.

Studies of phosphorylation of calcium channel α1 subunits in skeletal muscle cells in culture indicate that phosphopeptides unique to the 212-kDa form are phosphorylated in intact cells(29Lai Y. Seagar M.J. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20839-20848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified the major site of in vitro phosphorylation of the full-length α1 subunit immunoprecipitated from purified calcium channel preparations as serine 1854(35Rotman E.I. De Jongh K.S. Florio V. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16100-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue was rapidly and specifically phosphorylated by cA-PK, at least 100-fold more rapidly than serine 687 in α1212. In this study, we utilized fetal rabbit skeletal muscle myotubes to examine the phosphorylation of the full-length α1 subunit by cA-PK and to identify the predominant residues in the full-length α1 subunit that are phosphorylated in vitro and in intact cells. Materials were obtained from the following sources: protein A-Sepharose, Triton X-100, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, pepstatin A, 8-cpt-cAMP, okadaic acid, penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, DNase I, ara-C, and crude trypsin II from Sigma; endoproteinase Lys-C, leupeptin, and aprotinin from Boehringer Mannheim; calpain inhibitors I and II and Microcystin LR from Calbiochem; purified rabbit IgG from Zymed; thin-layer cellulose plates from Kodak; TPCK-treated trypsin from Worthington Biochemicals; [ϳ-32P]ATP from DuPont NEN; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Life Technologies, Inc.; horse and newborn calf serum from Hazleton; digitonin from Gallard-Schlesinger Inc. (Carle Place, NY). The catalytic subunit of cA-PK was purified according to Kaczmarek et al.(36Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F. Nairn A.C. Walter U. Wilson F.D. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7487-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Calcium channels were purified from skeletal muscle microsomes as previously described(5Curtis B.M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2113-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 6Takahashi M. Seagar M. Jones J. Reber B.F.X. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against synthetic calcium channel α1 subunit peptides (CP) were prepared as previously described(32De Jongh K.S. Merrick D.K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8585-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Peptide CP1 corresponds to residues 1856-1873 of the α1 subunit plus NH2-terminal lysine and tyrosine, peptide CP10 corresponds to residues 1738-1752 plus NH2-terminal lysine and tyrosine, peptide CP15 corresponds to residues 1382-1399 plus NH2-terminal lysine and tyrosine, and peptide CP20 corresponds to residues 1692-1707 plus NH2-terminal lysine and tyrosine. Synthetic calcium channel peptides were synthesized using the solid phase method of Merrifield(37Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). The identity of the synthetic peptides was confirmed by amino acid analysis or mass spectrometry. The synthetic peptide (CP38) used to identify tryptic phosphopeptide 6 corresponds to residues 1752-1769 of the calcium channel α1 subunit. Phosphopeptide maps were generated by a modification of the method of Huttner and Greengard (38Huttner W.B. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as previously described(35Rotman E.I. De Jongh K.S. Florio V. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16100-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For identification of tryptic phosphopeptide 6 using CP38, the method reported by Murphy et al.(39Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, purified CP38 (50 nmol) was phosphorylated by incubation at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM ATP, 0.25 μM [ϳ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 16 h in the presence of 2-10 nM purified catalytic subunit of cA-PK. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by addition of 0.05 ml of 30% acetic acid and rotated for 1 h in the presence of 0.05 ml of settled Dowex 1-X8 in 30% acetic acid to remove excess [ϳ-32P]ATP. Dowex was removed by brief microcentrifugation. Phosphorylated peptide was then purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on an 8 × 100-mm Waters Delta-Pak C-18 column (15 μM, 300 Å). Peptide was eluted with a 0-60% B gradient (1%/min) where A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified phosphorylated CP38 (10,000-20,000 cpm) was digested for 16 h at 37°C in 0.5 ml of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.9) in the presence of 10-20 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin. Supernatants were lyophilized, resuspended 1 ml of H2O, and relyophilized. Digested peptide was then resuspended in 10 μl of 1% pyridine, 10% acetic acid (pH 3.5) containing a trace amount of phenol red and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis as described above. Rabbit myotube cultures were prepared by a modification of the method of Schaffner and Daniels(40Schaffner A.E. Daniels M.P. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 623-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Flucher B.E. Morton M.E. Froehner S.C. Daniels M.P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 339-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Minced muscle from the forelimbs of day 29 New Zealand White rabbit (R& Rabbitry, Stanwood, WA) fetuses was dissociated for 20 min at 37°C in 0.2% trypsin and 0.1% DNase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Non-dissociated tissue was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 s; the supernatant was decanted, adjusted to 10% newborn calf serum to inhibit trypsin, and saved; the pelleted tissue was then subjected to two additional 20-min incubations with enzyme. The cell suspensions were pooled and passed through a Nitex filter (pore size, 70 μm2) to remove large pieces of tissue. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1200 rpm and plated in 100-mm gelatin-coated plastic tissue culture dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml in 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% horse serum (heated at 56°C for 45 min prior to use), 5% newborn calf serum, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30 μg/ml penicillin G. After cells reached confluence (4-5 days), fresh medium was added including 10 μM cytosine arabinoside to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Cytosine arabinoside was removed after 2-3 days, and the fused myotube cultures were fed once more prior to use at 10-12 days. All buffers and solutions contained protease inhibitors as above (without calpain inhibitors). Standard phosphorylation and immunoprecipitation of purified calcium channels was performed as previously described(35Rotman E.I. De Jongh K.S. Florio V. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16100-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of calcium channels from myotube cultures, individual dishes were washed on ice two times with 1 ml of bRIA (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). 300 μl of bRIA including 1% Triton X-100 were added to each dish, the myotubes were scraped, pooled, lysed, and homogenized with 50 strokes in a Dounce tissue homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 15 min in a SS-34 rotor. Supernatants were rotated on ice for 3-4 h with a 1:30 dilution of the appropriate antibody and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose (PAS) beads for 1 h. The antigen/antibody/PAS conjugates were then pelleted, washed once with bRIA including 1% Triton X-100, washed twice with phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA) including 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 10 min at 37°C in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer including 0.25 μM [ϳ-32P]ATP and 10 nM catalytic subunit of cA-PK. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by addition of 20 mM EDTA. The PAS pellets were washed twice with bRIA (1% Triton X-100), and 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% SDS buffer were added. After boiling for 2 min, the samples were centrifuged, and 400 μl of bRIA including 2% Triton X-100 (6-fold Triton/SDS ratio) were added to the supernatants. Once again, appropriate antibody was added to samples at a 1:30 dilution for a second immunoprecipitation at 4°C for 16 h. After a second PAS precipitation step, samples were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 bRIA and once with H2O; the PAS pellets were then released into 50 μl of Laemmli SDS sample buffer. The fusion protein CaFSkα1-wt was generated from pSkmCaChα1.8 (18Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) using the polymerase chain reaction. A 336-base pair fragment containing amino acid residues 1722-1834 of the cardiac α1 subunit was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to obtain in-frame recombinant proteins containing glutathione S-transferase. EcoRI and BamHI sites were included at the ends of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal oligonucleotides, respectively, to facilitate cloning. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into a protease-deficient strain BL26 of Escherichia coli (Novagen). Overnight cultures grown in 20 ml of YT media supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin (YT-Amp) were used to innoculate 500 ml of YT-Amp containing 0.4% glucose and incubated at 37°C for 3 h with shaking. Fusion protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were cultured for an additional 2.5 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mM 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μM pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 μM leupeptin, 0.2 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA, and the bacteria were lysed by mild sonication. The mixture was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, incubated 15 min on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were stored at −80°C. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). The fusion proteins CaFSkα1-S1771/2A, and CaFSkα1-S1757A are identical to CaFSkα1-wt, except that the serine residues corresponding to amino acids 1771, 1772, and 1757 of the skeletal α1 subunit were mutated to alanine residues using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis(42Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Purified fusion proteins were phosphorylated as described above in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 with 0.15 μM [ϳ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction, initiated by the addition of 1 μg of catalytic subunit of cA-PK, was carried out at 20°C for 1 min and stopped by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 65°C for 5 min. 32P-Labeled fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8.5% porous polyacrylamide gels (43Doucet J.P. Murphy B.J. Tuana B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or on 10-20% Tricine gradient gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and located by autoradiography. PAS-bound immunoprecipitates were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using 6.5% acrylamide, 0.17% bisacrylamide. Autoradiography was performed on wet gels. To quantify 32P incorporation, gel slices corresponding to proteins of interest were excised and counted by Cerenkov spectrometry. To detect endoproteinase Lys-C calcium channel fragments, the modification of the Laemmli method reported by Schagger and von Jagow (45Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) was used. This Tricine/SDS-PAGE method is useful for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa. Solubilization and immunoprecipitation of calcium channels from primary cultures of rabbit skeletal muscle myotubes, followed by cA-PK phosphorylation, a second immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures” revealed a single band at approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2), while immunoprecipitation with non-immune IgG did not reveal any immunoreactive protein bands (Fig. 1A, lane 1). A less prominent band was detected just above the 200-kDa protein that represents nonspecific immunoprecipitation as determined by prolonged exposure of the non-immune IgG lane. To identify the 200-kDa protein band, we compared its mobility on SDS-PAGE with the 212-kDa form of the purified skeletal muscle α1 subunit recognized by anti-CP20 (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and the mixture of 190- and 212-kDa forms recognized by anti-CP15 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Anti-CP20 and anti-CP1, which are directed to the COOH segment of the α1 subunit that is present only in the 212-kDa form, both immunoprecipitated α1 subunits from muscle cells with an apparent molecular mass comparable to α1212 from purified channel in the double immunoprecipitation protocol (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5). Non-immune IgG again was ineffective in immunoprecipitating α1 subunits (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Anti-CP15, which recognizes both full-length and truncated forms of the α1 subunit, also primarily immunoprecipitated the 212-kDa form (lane 4). The apparent molecular masses of the α1 subunits immunoprecipitated from primary cultures of skeletal muscle myotubes by these three different antibodies (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-5) are greater than that of the 190-kDa form (lane 2) but comparable to that of the 212-kDa form (lane 1). These results show that the full-length α1 subunit (α1212) is the major form expressed in these fetal rabbit muscle cell cultures. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the single α1 band immunoprecipitated from the muscle cell cultures confirmed the identity of this form as α1212. Pho"

Site-directed mutagenesis of the prosegment has led to the following conclusions. 1) Maintenance of the enzymatically inactive state of prorenin requires a short peptide sequence between positions 10P and 20P (where P denotes prosegment and numbering is relative to amino terminus) of the prosegment; and 2) there is an inverse relationship between the ability of prosegment mutations to activate and their effect on the secretion of the various prorenins, suggesting that this same region of the prosegment plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of human prorenin. Since these results demonstrated that single amino acid mutations could activate human prorenin to varying degrees, mutations in this region of the renin gene could be clinically important in humans. To test this hypothesis, genomic screening was carried out on the corresponding region of the human renin gene (exon 2) in a cohort of patients selected for a likely familial component to their hypertension. While this study identified a novel polymorphism in exon 2 of the human renin gene, evidence was not obtained for either the presence of prosegment mutations or the association of the novel polymorphism with hypertension in the patient population studied. In conclusion, both structure-function studies and genetic screening suggest that mutation of the prorenin prosegment is an unlikely factor in activation of the renin-angiotensin system in humans.

In conclusion, both structure-function studies and genetic screening suggest that mutation of the prorenin prosegment is an unlikely factor in activation of the renin-angiotensin system in humans. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS)1( 1The abbreviations used are: RASrenin-angiotensin systemCHOChinese hamster ovary.) plays a critical role in the maintenance of blood pressure, and its activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and vascular pathologies associated with diabetes and renal disease (1Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Cardiology. 1991; 79 (Suppl. 1): 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 2Griendling K.K. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W.

Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 98-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the RAS is the cleavage of angiotensinogen by the circulating aspartyl protease renin to release the decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme subsequently cleaves two amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of angiotensin I to release angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and regulator of aldosterone release. renin-angiotensin system Chinese hamster ovary. Active renin in the circulation is derived almost exclusively from the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney(5Sealey J.E. Rubattu S. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Within these cells, renin is first synthesized as a precursor, prorenin, in which a 43-amino acid amino-terminal prosegment maintains the enzyme in an inactive state, presumably by blocking access to the active site by steric hindrance (6Baxter J.D. Duncan K. Chu W. James M.N. Russell R.B. Haidar M.A. DeNoto F.M. Hsueh W. Reudelhuber T.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1991; 47: 211-257PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of the prorenin made by juxtaglomerular cells is irreversibly activated by the proteolytic cleavage of the prosegment before secretion. Nevertheless, both the kidney and numerous other tissues secrete prorenin into the circulation, where it is present at 3-5 times the level of active renin(7Hsueh W.A. Baxter J.D. Hypertension (Dallas). 1991; 17: 469-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Speculation abounds regarding the function of prorenin both in the circulation and in tissues for several reasons. First, the distribution of extrarenal tissues secreting prorenin in mammals is largely conserved, including the pituitary, ovaries, testes, adrenal gland, uterus, and placenta. Prorenin expression in the tissues is also modulated; during pregnancy, prorenin accumulates in the amniotic fluid at concentrations approaching 100 times that seen in the circulation(7Hsueh W.A. Baxter J.D. Hypertension (Dallas). 1991; 17: 469-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, prorenin-secreting tissues also express other components of the RAS including angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II receptors, leading to the suggestion that local or “tissue” RAS may exist and be physiologically important(8Frohlich E.D. Iwata T. Sasaki O. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87 (Suppl. 6B)Google Scholar). Third, prorenin can be transiently activated in vitro by either acidic conditions or extended storage in the cold(9Derkx F.H. Schalekamp M.P. Schalekamp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2472-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pitarresi T.M. Rubattu S. Heinrikson R. Sealey J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that such activation might occur under certain conditions in vivo. Hypertension is a multifactorial disease whose etiology stems from both environmental and genetic factors. Studies have suggested that multiple genetic loci contribute to inheritable forms of hypertension in inbred strains of laboratory animals (11Creager M.A. Roddy M.A. Holland K.M. Hirsch A.T. Dzau V.J. Hypertension (Dallas). 1991; 17: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dahl L.K. Heine M. Tassinari L. Nature. 1962; 194: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 13Williams R.R. Hypertension (Dallas). 1989; 14: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that as much as 20-40% of blood pressure variation in humans may be due to genetic factors(14Ward R. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 81-100Google Scholar). Inappropriate activity of the RAS is both a major contributor to the pathophysiology of hypertension and an important target for pharmacologic intervention in its treatment(15Schalekamp M.A. Derkx F.H. van den Meiracker A.H. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: S157-S164Crossref Google Scholar). Gene mutations could presumably lead to either increased expression or altered activity of RAS components. Indeed, prior studies have suggested a linkage between a polymorphism in the gene encoding angiotensinogen, circulating angiotensinogen levels, and hypertension in humans(16Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.M. Corval P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). While a similar association has been reported for the renin gene locus in genetically hypertensive strains of laboratory rats(17Rapp J.P. Wang S.M. Dene H. Science. 1989; 243: 542-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), no such linkage has been established to date for the human renin gene. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that some forms of inheritable hypertension might be due to mutations that cause prorenin to be partially active. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the region of the human prorenin prosegment crucial for maintenance of the protease in its inactive state. This same region of the prosegment was found to play a critical role in the biosynthesis of prorenin. Genome sequencing of the portion of the human renin gene encoding the prosegment was subsequently carried out on a group of hypertensive patients with a likely familial inheritance of hypertension to test whether mutations in this region of the prosegment might lead to spurious activation of the renin-angiotensin system in humans. The mammalian expression vector pRhR1100, which expresses the human prorenin cDNA under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter/enhancer, has been described elsewhere(18Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the prosegment of human prorenin was carried out by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction(19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Amplified regions of the prorenin cDNA were verified by direct DNA sequencing(20Sanger F. Coulson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml proline and 10% fetal calf serum. For expression studies, 5 × 105 cells were plated in a 35-mm dish, and transfection was carried out 24 h later by the calcium phosphate method (21Chu W.N. Mercure C. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Hypertension (Dallas). 1992; 20: 782-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 6 μg of the appropriate prorenin expression vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was removed, and fresh medium was added. Sixteen hours later, the medium was collected and used immediately to determine renin and prorenin. Prorenin and renin content in tissue culture supernatants was determined by the angiotensin I generation assay as described previously(21Chu W.N. Mercure C. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Hypertension (Dallas). 1992; 20: 782-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 16-h culture supernatants were incubated in the presence of excess semipurified sheep angiotensinogen either directly (active renin content) or after incubation with trypsin (total renin content (prorenin + renin)). Percent renin activity was calculated as (active renin content/total renin content) × 100. Relative percent activity of the various mutant prorenins was compared with that of native human prorenin (see Table I). Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Dunnet multiple comparison test. Table II describes total renin content obtained by transfection of CHO cells with the various prosegment mutant prorenins as a percentage of the total renin content obtained with native prorenin (relative expression), representing the mean of three or more individual transfection experiments. To minimize for variation in transfection efficiency, total renin levels obtained with the various mutant prorenins were normalized to the levels exhibited by non-mutant (native) human prorenin obtained within the same experiment.TABLE I Open table in a new tab TABLE IIRelationship between activity and expression in prorenin prosegment mutations Open table in a new tab Forty-eight hours after transfection of CHO cells as described above, cells were washed twice in prewarmed methionine-free Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated in 500 μl of the same medium for 2 h at 37°C. [35S]Methionine (300 μC; >1000 μCi mmol; DuPont NEN) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 1 h, followed by the addition of 500 μl of complete medium. After a further 5 h of incubation, the culture supernatants were collected, and prorenin/renin was immunoprecipitated and displayed by gel fluorography as described previously(18Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hypertensive patients were recruited from the Hypertension Clinic at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal after provision of an informed consent to participate in the study and in adherence to a protocol approved by the institutional human ethics committee. In answer to a questionnaire, all participants reported having at least one hypertensive parent or sibling and either were receiving antihypertensive medication or had a diastolic blood pressure of >90 mm Hg or a systolic pressure of >140 mm Hg on at least two occasions. Blood was collected on EDTA and frozen at −20°C until assayed. A control patient population was obtained from healthy, predominantly French Canadian volunteers at Hydro-Quebec (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) who had participated in a previously reported study(22Xhignesse M. Lussier-Cacan S. Sing C.F. Kessling A.M. Davignon J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1100-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Criteria for participation were normal blood pressure at interview and age of >40 years. Genomic DNA was purified from 100 μl of whole blood using the DNA microextraction kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A 312-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to exon 2 of the human renin gene was selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotides: forward primer, CGGG-ATCCACGTTAAAGGTGGTTGTACTA; and reverse primer, CGGAAT-TCGCCTAGGTCCATGAGGGAAA. The amplified DNA fragment was subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI (underlined in the forward and reverse primer sequences, respectively) and cloned into the Bluescript II plasmid vector (Stratagene). Direct DNA sequencing was carried out on plasmids prepared by the alkaline lysis method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from random pools of bacterial colonies using the method of Sanger and Coulson (20Sanger F. Coulson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar) and the sequencing primer GGCTGAGCCAAGCACTC, which corresponds to a reverse primer in exon 2 of the human renin cDNA. All polymorphisms identified by this method were confirmed by a second round of genome amplification and sequencing. As previously reported, expression of recombinant human prorenin in CHO cells leads to secretion of mostly active prorenin (Table I, native). Recombinant human prorenin expressed in CHO cells migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at the expected molecular weight for full-length prorenin (see Fig. 3)(24Fritz L.C. Haidar M.A. Arfsten A.E. Schilling J.W. Carilli C. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12409-12412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, expression of a human prorenin mutant in which the prosegment is deleted results in the secretion of constitutively active renin (Table I)(18Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transfection of CHO cells with expression vectors encoding human prorenin in which individual amino acids in the prosegment (Fig. 1) have been mutated results in the secretion of prorenins with varying amounts of renin activity (Table I). The prosegment mutations tested can be subdivided into two categories. The first category of mutations involves charge reversals: Lys and Arg residues were converted to Asp, and Glu and Asp residues were converted to Arg. These results indicate that the effect of charge reversal on prorenin activation was not uniform over the prosegment, but rather clustered in the amino-terminal region from Arg-10P (where P denotes prosegment and numbering is relative to amino terminus) to Arg-20P. Within this region, the effect of charge reversal was most pronounced with Arg-10P (59% activation), Lys-14P (45% activation), and Arg-15P (53% activation) and least effective with reversal of Arg-20P (29% activation). The critical region for charge interaction is well defined since the reversal of Lys-9P and Glu-21P had no significant effect on prorenin activity. As well, charge reversals outside this region, at Lys-24P, Arg-26P, and Asp-29P, did not activate prorenin. Thus, it appears that charged amino acids in region 10P-20P in the prosegment contribute to the maintenance of the inactive state of human prorenin.Figure 1:Schematic diagram representing the prosegment of human prorenin. The amino acid sequence is depicted using the one-letter code. Solid arrows denote those amino acids that, when mutated, led to a significant increase in prorenin activity (see Table I for details). Also denoted is the region of the protein encoded by exon 2 of the human renin gene (drawing not to scale).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The second category of mutations tested involved alanine substitution. Only substitution of alanine for either Leu-13P or Arg-15P resulted in a significant activation of prorenin (Table I). These residues lie in the same region as identified using charge reversal (see above). In addition, with the exception of the substitution of Arg-15P, which leads to a minor activation of prorenin (21%), alanine substitution of charged amino acids within region 10P-20P resulted in only a slight, but nonsignificant activation of prorenin. By contrast, the rather conservative alanine substitution of Leu-13P led to a major activation of prorenin (91%), whereas alanine substitution on either side of Leu-13P (for Phe-12P and Lys-14P) had only a slight, but nonsignificant activating potential on prorenin. Substitution of a charged amino acid (Asp) for Leu-31P did not lead to further activation of prorenin. Taken together, these results suggest that prorenin inactivation involves charged amino acids between positions 10P and 20P on the prosegment and is critically dependent on a leucine residue at position 13P. Several groups have reported the expression of recombinant active renin in tissue culture cells transfected with a prorenin-encoding expression vector in which the prosegment is selectively deleted(18Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Harrison T.M. Chidgey M.A. Brammar W.J. Adams G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Nagahama M. Nakayama K. Hori H. Murakami K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting that the prosegment is not absolutely required for biosynthesis of the active enzyme. Nevertheless, in AtT-20 cells transfected with a similar construction, we have previously reported that expression of the resulting active renin was severely suppressed(18Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Comparison of the overall production of total renin (prorenin + renin) from native and prosegment-deleted prorenins in transfected CHO cells confirms this observation: removal of the prosegment results in an apparent 20-fold decrease in biosynthetic capacity (Table II). One possible explanation of this finding is that the prosegment, while not essential, nevertheless plays a role in the biosynthesis or stability of the renin molecule as has been suggested with other proteases(27Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Plotting total renin production achieved by transfection of the various mutant prorenin expression vectors (Table II) against their corresponding percent activities (Table I) reveals an inverse relationship (Fig. 2), i.e. the more a prorenin molecule is activated by a given mutation, the lower are its levels of secretion in the culture supernatant of transfected cells. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of selected mutant prorenins demonstrated a protein with the expected molecular weight for intact prorenin (Mr~49,000)(24Fritz L.C. Haidar M.A. Arfsten A.E. Schilling J.W. Carilli C. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12409-12412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the quantity of immunoprecipitable prorenin secreted into the supernatant of transfected cells correlated well with the total renin production as determined by the enzymatic assay (Fig. 3). Thus, while these data should only be considered semiquantitative due to the inherent variation in efficiencies of transfection assays, they identify an inverse relationship between prosegment inactivation and prorenin secreted. The short region of the prorenin prosegment responsible for the maintenance of the inactive state of human renin is located within exon 2 of the human renin gene (Fig. 1)(28Hardman J.A. Hort Y.J. Catanzaro D.F. Tellam J.T. Baxter J.D. Morris B.J. Shine J. DNA (N. Y.). 1984; 3: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To test whether mutations of this region might account for some forms of hypertension due to partial activation of prorenin, a method was developed to allow the direct sequencing of this portion of the genome. Specific oligonucleotides designed to flank exon 2 were used to amplify and clone this region of the genome into bacterial plasmids. Subsequent DNA sequencing of the cloned insert DNA allowed the determination of the complete sequence of exon 2 in the patients tested. Sixty-five patients were selected according to the following criteria: hypertension as defined by either a diastolic pressure of >90 mm Hg or a systolic pressure of >140 mm Hg or a history of hypertension requiring at least two medications for control and at least one parent or sibling with hypertension. In the 65 patients analyzed, no mutations were detected that would lead to a change in the peptide sequence encoded by exon 2. However, a novel polymorphism (CAA to CAC) resulting in the creation of a StyI restriction site (data not shown) at the position in the exon corresponding to Thr-2 of the active renin protein was detected in 14 of the 65 subjects analyzed (Table III). Preliminary tests to determine whether this polymorphism might serve as a marker for hypertension were negative in a French Canadian normotensive population (Table III). In summary, there is no evidence for mutation of prosegment sequences responsible for maintaining the inactive state of human renin in the hypertensive patient population analyzed in this study.TABLE IIICharacteristics of hypertensive/normotensive patient populations used in this study Open table in a new tab The results of this study suggest that the region of the human prorenin prosegment from positions 10P to 20P plays an important role in the maintenance of the inactive state of the zymogen. As CHO cells do not cleave the prosegment of prorenin(24Fritz L.C. Haidar M.A. Arfsten A.E. Schilling J.W. Carilli C. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12409-12412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the most likely explanation for this activation would be that certain of these mutations result in a disruption of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which are important for the binding of the prosegment to the body of renin. This would presumably have the effect of causing an unfolding of the prosegment, thereby exposing the active site of the enzyme to create enzymatically active prorenin. Analysis of the acid activation kinetics of recombinant prorenin whose prosegment had been subjected to limited proteolysis has likewise led to the suggestion that amino acids 10P-14P contribute to the binding of the prosegment to the body of renin(29Heinrikson R.L. Hui J. Zürcher-Neely H. Poorman R.A. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since the activation of prorenin by prosegment mutation is not an “all or none” phenomenon, but rather follows a continuum (Table II), it is likely that the induced mutations shift the equilibrium of prosegment binding in the active site. That prorenin exists in an equilibrium between a closed and open conformation in vitro has previously been suggested on the basis of its activation kinetics (9Derkx F.H. Schalekamp M.P. Schalekamp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2472-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and active-site “trapping” experiments in which purified prorenin was incubated with active site-directed inhibitors(29Heinrikson R.L. Hui J. Zürcher-Neely H. Poorman R.A. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Derkx F.H. Deinum J. Lipovski M. Verhaar M. Fischli W. Schalekamp M.A. J. Biol.

The degree of mutation-induced prorenin activation also exhibits an inverse relationship with the amount of total renin (prorenin + renin) detected in culture supernatants (Fig. 2). Thus, as has been described in other protease families(27Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the prosegment of prorenin (and perhaps other aspartyl proteases) may play a dual role as both an inhibitor and a folding “catalyst” during biosynthesis of the active enzyme. These results also suggest that even though prorenin can be activated to varying degrees by single amino acid mutations in the prosegment, the effect of these mutations on the overall physiological activity of the RAS might be offset by the decreased secretion of such mutant proteins. Indeed, the combined effect of these two factors in vitro is a normalization of active (pro)renin levels (Table II, corrected activity). In addition to these structure-function studies, our inability to detect coding mutations in a limited survey of patients selected for a likely familial component to their hypertension suggests that prosegment mutations resulting in activated prorenin are an unlikely explanation for inappropriately high renin activity such as has been reported in some hypertensive patients(31Alderman M.H. Madhavan S. Ooi W.L. Cohen H. Sealey J.E. Laragh J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). To date, there has been only one published report of a protein-altering mutation in human prorenin(32Villard E. Lalau J.D. van Hooft I.S. Derkx F.H. Houot A.M. Pinet F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30307-30312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the family identified, affected individuals were heterozygous for a mutation inducing a premature stop codon within the prorenin coding sequence. Interestingly, these individuals had compensated for their prorenin hemizygosity by increasing the expression level from their unaffected allele. In addition, no homozygotes for this or any other protein-altering mutation in prorenin have been reported, and although several variants of angiotensinogen (the renin substrate) have been described(16Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.M. Corval P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), none affect the region of the protein that codes for the angiotensin I peptide released by renin. Taken together, these findings may suggest an additional role for the RAS in development such that mutations that would inactivate renin (or the RAS) in humans would be lethal. This study also defines a previously undescribed polymorphism in exon 2 of the human renin gene. While this sequence alteration leads to the appearance of a novel StyI restriction site in exon 2 (data not shown), there are numerous additional StyI sites in the human renin gene, making the detection of this polymorphism difficult in the context of the whole gene. However, by using direct DNA sequencing, a selective polymerase chain reaction amplification strategy, or StyI digestion of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified exon 2 region (data not shown), it has been possible to catalogue the frequency of this polymorphism in populations of hypertensive and normotensive patients (I). While we have not found any obvious correlation with hypertension within the limitations of this study, two points merit further comment. First, we detected the StyI polymorphism in only 1 of 35 (2.9%) ethnically heterogeneous normotensive volunteers drawn from laboratory workers of our institution (data not shown). It is possible, therefore, that the StyI polymorphism will display some degree of ethnic segregation, being more prevalent in the French Canadian population. Ethnic heterogeneity has been reported for two other restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the human renin 5′-flanking DNA in Afro-Caribbeans(33Barley J. Carter N.D. Cruickshank J.K. Jeffery S. Smith A. Charlett A. Webb D.J. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), reinforcing the importance of selecting an ethnically comparable control population in these studies. Second, the multifactorial nature of hypertension and the implied difficulty in assigning a sufficiently precise clinical subclassification, the contribution of environmental factors, and the potential variation in penetrance of contributing genes will likely require efforts to identify genetic causes in individual families with approaches such as combinations of polymorphisms to increase the power of the statistical analysis. In this effort, the StyI polymorphism described herein may be of greater use in combination with other previously described restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the human renin gene(33Barley J.

Percent active renin values are from Table I.

The protein is characterized by two adjacent palmitoylated cysteine residues, two positively charged residues (one arginine residue and one lysine residue) in the N-terminal region, and a long hydrophobic stretch. SP-C enhances the adsorption of phospholipids into an air-water interface. To determine the importance of the positively charged residues, we carried out experiments with natural porcine SP-C and modified porcine SP-C (SP-Cm) in which the positive charges had been blocked by phenylglyoxal. Circular dichroism experiments showed that SP-Cm had an increased content of α-helix. Natural SP-C, but not SP-Cm, catalyzed insertion of phospholipids into a monolayer at the air-water interface. This reduced insertion was due to a strong reduction of binding of phospholipid vesicles to the monolayer. The insertion catalyzed by the natural porcine SP-C was decreased by an increased pH of the subphase. In contrast to natural SP-C, SP-Cm induced lipid mixing between phospholipid vesicles. The extent of lipid mixing was a function of the SP-C content.

Pulmonary surfactant, essential for breathing, is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins. It is present at the air-liquid interface of the lung, and its main function is to stabilize the lung by reducing the surface tension. Surfactant consists of 90% lipids and of 8-10% specific proteins(1Haagsman H.P. van Golde L.M.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Keough K.M.W.

A recent case report presented clinical evidence that deficiency of this protein is life threatening(4Nogee L.M. deMello D.E. Dehner L.P. Colten H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). If the activity of SP-B was blocked by monoclonal antibodies, an acute inflammatory reaction was seen, together with a decrease in lung-thorax compliance(5Robertson B. Kobayashi T. Ganzuka M.

The exact function of the acylation is not clear yet, but it has been demonstrated that acylation of SP-C alters structure and physical properties of the protein(15Creuwels L.A.J.M.

A dimeric form of SP-C has been demonstrated, which exhibits surface tension-lowering properties differing from those of monomeric SP-C(16Baatz J.E. Smyth K.L. Whitsett J.A. Baxter C. Absolom D.R.

It also altered the thermodynamic properties of membranes(11Shiffer K. Hawgood S. Haagsman H.P. Benson B. Clements J.A. Goerke J.

J. 1992; 63: 197-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).To elucidate the importance of the positively charged amino acids for the function or structure of the SP-C, we used the reaction of phenylglyoxal with arginine residues(22Takahashi K. J. Biol Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When proteins are treated with a large excess of phenylglyoxal for a long period, the ε-amino group of the lysine residue may be modified too, thereby neutralizing all positive charges of SP-C. The reaction is very effective, and the formed derivative is sufficiently stable, especially under mildly acidic conditions(22Takahashi K. J. Biol Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the Wilhelmy plate method and circular dichroism and fluorescence experiments to study the role of the positively charged residues of SP-C. The experiments show that these residues are important to bind vesicles prior to the insertion of phospholipids from the vesicles into the monolayer.RESULTSThe proteins were separated from the lipids by Sephadex LH-60 chromatography after butanol extraction of pulmonary surfactant. The fractions were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions and colored by silver staining. The SP-C fractions were pooled and, after modification, analyzed on a reverse phase C8 column. The modified SP-C exhibited a peak at 45 min, whereas the natural SP-C fraction came off the column at 37 min (Fig. 1). Amino acid analysis showed that 94.7% of the arginine residues and 24.2% of the lysine residues were modified. Circular dichroism measurements showed a difference in secondary structure between the natural porcine SP-C and SP-Cm collected from the interface (Table I). Due to the modification of the natural SP-C, an increase in the α-helix content from 63.5 to 73.6% was observed. The content of random coil decreased from 36.4 to 26.3%. There was no β-structure found in these proteins.TABLE IComparison of the secondary structures of natural and modified SP-C at the air-water interface, as determined by circular dichroism Open table in a new tab We followed the calcium-dependent insertion of phospholipids from SUV (10 nmol/ml) into protein-containing monolayers (lipid to protein ratio, 5:1 (w/w)) as a function of time by monitoring the increase in surface pressure and surface radioactivity. The maximum surface (equilibrium) pressure was 48.0-48.5 mN/m. Natural SP-C catalyzed the insertion of phospholipids into a negatively charged monolayer in a protein-dependent way, which agreed with our earlier studies (8Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis M.A. Haagsman H.P. van Golde L.M.G. Demel R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10965-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 15Creuwels L.A.J.M. Demel R.A. van Golde L.M.G. Benson B.J. Haagsman H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26752-26758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, insertion rate 2.25 mN/m/min). If SP-Cm was used, the insertion rate of phospholipids into the monolayer was strongly reduced (Fig. 2B, insertion rate 0.46 mN/m per min). In the absence of negative charges in the monolayer, the insertion of phospholipids into the monolayer catalyzed by the natural SP-C was faster (Fig. 2, A versus C; insertion rates 5.17 and 0.64 mN/m/min for SP-C and SP-Cm, respectively). In the absence of protein, no insertion of phospholipids into the monolayer was observed (not shown). The increase in surface radioactivity showed the same pattern as the increase in surface pressure (Fig. 2). The subphase was flushed with a buffer containing 10 mM EGTA to remove all vesicles that were not bound to the monolayer. While flushing, there was no visible effect on the surface pressure. The radioactivity in the subphase dropped to nearly background values. The amount of radioactivity at the interface was just slightly diminished after the flushing, indicating that phospholipids had been inserted into the monolayer, or phospholipid vesicles were firmly bound to the monolayer.Figure 2:Effect of modification of SP-C on binding to and insertion of phospholipids into preformed SP-C-containing monolayers. A monolayer of DPPC/PG or DPPC/PC and SP-C was spread on a subphase of 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) to an initial surface pressure of 20 mN/m. The surface pressure (upper curve) and the surface radioactivity (lower curve) were measured simultaneously with time. After 5 min, vesicles (SUV of DPPC/PG, containing trace amounts of [14C]DPPC; final concentration, 10 nmol of lipid/ml) and Ca2+, to a final concentration of 3 mM, were injected into the subphase.

The calcium-dependent insertion rate was reduced if a subphase with a pH higher than 7 was used (Fig. 3A, insertion rates of 10.98, 6.02, and 1.49 mN/m/min at pH 7.0, 9.0, and 11.0, respectively). If no negative charges were present in the monolayer, the insertion of phospholipids proceeded in the absence of calcium. In this case, the insertion was also pH-dependent; if the pH was higher than 7, a lower insertion rate was observed (1.85 and 0.10 mN/m/min at pH 9.0 and 11.0, respectively, compared with 9.00 mN/m/min at pH 7.0). After 15 min, calcium was added to the subphase. This enhanced the insertion rate (to 6.38 and 6.13 mN/m/min at pH 9.0 and 11.0, respectively), although the insertion rate leveled off quickly at pH 11.0. After the injection of calcium into the subphase, a small decrease in surface pressure was observed. The higher the pH of the subphase, the less increase there was in surface pressure (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Effect of pH on phospholipid insertion from SUV into preformed SP-C-containing monolayers. SUV of DPPC/PG (7:3, w/w) were injected into the subphase of 25 mM Tris (pH 7, 9, 11; 20 nmol of lipid/ml) underneath a preformed monolayer of DPPC/PG or DPPC/PC and natural porcine SP-C (20 mN/m).

The minimum surface tension of the pulsating bubble immediately fell to ±5 mN/m with the natural protein.

It has been proposed that the positive charges play a role in the determination of the transmembrane orientation(31Keller A. Eistetter H.R. Voss T. Schäfer K.-P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two positive charges, one lysine residue and one arginine residue, are found on positions 11 and 12, respectively, in a variety of species(14Johansson J. Persson P. Löwenadler B. Robertson B. Jörnvall H. Curstedt T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, the positive charges in the SP-C molecule were neutralized by a modification of the methods described by Takahashi(22Takahashi K. J. Biol Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this method, all arginine is changed (23Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) into a sufficiently stable non-charged derivative of arginine. As phenylglyoxal is somewhat less selective for arginine than is e.g. butanedione, also the lysine residue will be (partly) modified(32Riordan J.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 26: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis and HPLC analysis proved that the majority of the arginine residues and part of the lysine residues were modified. We show by analysis on a reverse phase C8 column that SP-Cm was more hydrophobic than the natural porcine SP-C. Circular dichroism measurements demonstrated that SP-Cm had an increased amount of α-helix. Both experiments are in line with the expected neutralization of the positive charges of SP-C.The insertion rate of phospholipids from DPPC/PG (7:3, w/w) SUV into a monolayer of the same composition containing natural porcine SP-C was calcium and protein dependent. If negatively charged phospholipids were absent in the monolayer, the insertion rate of lipids catalyzed by natural porcine SP-C in the presence of calcium was much higher, due to an increased association of vesicles with the monolayer. This causes smaller distances, and as vesicle monolayer interactions are partially determined by electrostatic forces, Van der Waals and hydration forces will become more important(33Lis L.J. McAlister M. Fuller N. Rand R.P. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 657-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the use of 14C-labeled vesicles, we showed that binding of the negatively charged vesicles to the monolayer by the SP-Cm was decreased, and consequently a reduced insertion was obtained. There was no indication of a reduced insertion of phospholipids into the monolayer.As the pK of the guanido group of arginine is about 12.5 (32Riordan J.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 26: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the positive charge of the porcine SP-C can be altered if the pH of the subphase is changed in Wilhelmy plate experiments. The highest insertion rate of lipids from negatively charged vesicles was found if a subphase was used with a pH of 7.0. With increasing pH, the insertion rate decreased.The reduced insertion had to be the result of a reduced function of the SP-C after changing the positive charges of the protein. Insertion of phospholipids was possible, even at a pH of 11.0. This insertion was induced by SP-C and started after the addition of calcium ions. This indicated that there was no denaturation of SP-C. The expected increase in α-helix can possibly contribute to the insertion. At the moment that Ca2+ was added, a small dip in the surface pressure was visible (Fig. 3), which could be explained by the condensing effect of the Ca2+ ions on the (already inserted) PG in the monolayer(8Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis M.A. Haagsman H.P. van Golde L.M.G. Demel R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10965-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). With the pulsating bubble surfactometer, cyclic adsorption measurements were done, which also showed the reduced function of the neutralized SP-C.It has been shown earlier that SP-C did not catalyze mixing of lipids of negatively charged lipid vesicles(30Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis M.A. van Eijk M. van Golde L.M.G.

If 300 nmol of non-charged vesicles containing SP-C were mixed with pyrene-PC-labeled negatively charged vesicles, SP-C-induced lipid mixing was possible(15Creuwels L.A.J.M.

In the present paper, SP-C was present in negatively charged or neutral vesicles. When 15 nmol of these were mixed with 300 nmol of negatively charged vesicles, the relatively small quantity of SP-C was not able to induce lipid mixing. The modified protein, however, was able to induce lipid mixing, even in the absence of calcium. The mechanism by which this process is possible is not yet understood.In all experiments after the addition of calcium, a decrease in excimer/monomer ratio was observed. This indicates that the positive charge of Ca2+ alone is sufficient to overcome partly the repulsive forces between the vesicles.In conclusion, the positive charges of the pulmonary surfactant protein C are important both for structure and function of SP-C. The positive charges are responsible for binding of the PG-containing small unilamellar vesicles to the monolayer, a process that precedes the insertion of phospholipids into the monolayer.Samples were collected at a surface pressure of 30 mN/m. Average numbers (± S.D.) derived from spectra of two or three different monolayer preparations are given as percentages of total structure. Pulmonary surfactant, essential for breathing, is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins. It is present at the air-liquid interface of the lung, and its main function is to stabilize the lung by reducing the surface tension. Surfactant consists of 90% lipids and of 8-10% specific proteins(1Haagsman H.P. van Golde L.M.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Keough K.M.W.

Evidence has been presented that the activity of SP-B is enhanced by the hydrophilic surfactant protein A(6Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Schilling J. Damm D. Clements J.A. White R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of E9 chick brain mRNA confirmed the existence of this agrin isoform in brain, although the novel splice variant represents a minor fraction of agrin mRNA in brain. However, upon analysis of chick brain astrocyte mRNA, smooth muscle mRNA, and cardiac muscle mRNA by RT-PCR, we show that this novel agrin isoform is the predominant agrin isoform in these non-neuronal cell populations. We extended our analyses to examine the expression of this agrin mRNA isoform during chick development and show that the agrin mRNA lacking this 21-bp exon is up-regulated with brain development, consistent with the increase in glial number during brain development, while the agrin isoform that does not undergo splicing and thus contains the 21-bp exon is down-regulated in brain development. Because the 21-bp exon is inserted in the region of chick agrin which encodes the putative signal sequence of agrin, with the signal peptidase site immediately preceding the putative first amino acid of the mature protein being deleted as a result of splicing, these data raise the interesting possibility that the presence or absence of this alternatively spliced exon may differentially regulate processing of the agrin protein in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, respectively.

Critical to the proper development of the nervous system is a highly regulated pattern of gene expression that defines processes necessary for the interaction of cells with their environment and neighboring cells. Numerous studies have documented the importance of extracellular signals in neural development, with these signals regulating processes as diverse as cell-matrix interactions, cell motility, and cell differentiation. A well-characterized model system for the study of the role of extracellular matrix proteins in nervous system development is agrin and its association with neuromuscular synaptogenesis (for reviews see Refs. 1McMahan U.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Agrin was initially identified as a neuronal basal lamina protein capable of inducing the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR)1( 1The abbreviations used are: AChRacetylcholine receptor(s)RT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)HSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycanNCAMneural cell adhesion moleculeARP-3agrin-related protein-3. )in the developing neuromuscular junction(3Nitkin R.M.

Although it was believed that agrin could not be isolated in its intact form from basal lamina(3Nitkin R.M. Smith M.A. Magill C. Fallon J.R. Yao Y.M. Wallace B.G. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), it was recognized that an agrin proteolytic fragment of about 100 kDa was capable of mediating the AChR clustering effects of agrin(3Nitkin R.M.

Cell Res. 1991; 195: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have demonstrated that the agrin mRNA encodes a 400-kDa heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which contains an approximately 250-kDa core protein(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In light of the wealth of data implicating a role for heparin and/or heparan sulfate proteoglycans in agrin function(9Wallace B.G. J.

Recent studies have focused on a molecular characterization of agrin mechanisms and have shown that agrin has alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms(12Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W.

The demonstration that alternative splice sites, designated A and B, are restricted to the region of the mRNA that codes for the functional COOH-terminal domain of agrin has been of particular interest(12Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), since these data indicate that the function of agrin can be regulated in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. For example, it is clear that the agrinA0B0 isoform, which lacks the alternative exons, is not functional in AChR clustering assays(12Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, single-cell RT-PCR experiments have shown convincingly that the agrinA0B0 isoform is the predominant isoform expressed by non-neuronal cells, with combinations of alternative splicing of exons occurring in neurons(16Smith M.A. O'Dowd D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, these data imply that functional forms of agrin, defined in terms of their ability to aggregate AChR, are restricted to neurons. However, the role of alternative splicing in agrin functions becomes clouded, based on recent studies describing the role of α-dystroglycan as a putative receptor for agrin(17Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 18Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan occurs in a heparin-dependent manner(17Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), consistent with earlier analyses of agrin function, but the agrin-dystroglycan interaction is not isoform-dependent(20Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Likewise, the ability of agrin-dystroglycan interactions to aggregate AChR in muscle is not inhibited by antibodies that perturb agrin-dystroglycan binding (20Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains to be determined by what mechanism(s) alternative splicing of the agrin mRNA regulates the expression of functional forms of the protein. Our recent studies demonstrating that agrin is a HSPG are noteworthy, since we have shown previously that this HSPG is capable of binding to and modulating NCAM function(21Burg M.A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In view of the demonstration that the majority of agrin expression occurs in brain(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but agrin's function in brain has remained elusive, our studies raise the interesting possibility that brain agrin has a role in cell adhesion processes. Accordingly, our studies suggest that the heparan sulfate chains of agrin, which appear to be localized to the NH2-terminal half of the molecule, are critical to cell adhesion to NCAM(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Burg M.A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but are not likely involved in the AChR clustering activity of agrin. In the course of our molecular cloning of agrin, we isolated a cDNA lacking 21 bp in the corresponding 5′ region of the mRNA. In the present study, we show by RT-PCR that splicing of this novel exon occurs in a cell- and tissue-dependent fashion, with splicing occurring predominantly in non-neuronal cells. Thus, in accord with the studies of Smith and O'Dowd(16Smith M.A. O'Dowd D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it appears that the inclusion of alternatively spliced exons in agrin mRNA is preferentially restricted to neurons. We have named this new agrin isoform in non-neuronal cells agrin-related protein-3 (ARP-3), and the alternative splice site C, in keeping with the previous nomenclature for agrin isoforms in chicken(14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding agrin, and lacking 21 bp when compared to the previously published chick agrin cDNA(14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), was isolated by screening a random-primed E9 chick brain cDNA library with a restriction fragment from a previously isolated agrin cDNA(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 711-bp SstI restriction fragment from the 5′ region of agrin clone pPG3 (8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was used to screen 600,000 recombinants from the E9 chick brain cDNA library according to published protocols (8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One resulting agrin clone, named 801, was found to lack 21 bp when compared to the published chick agrin nucleotide sequence(14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Total RNA from various ages of embryonic chick brain and heart, or from cultured chick brain astrocytes, was isolated according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was then isolated using the Straight A's mRNA isolation system (Novagen). First strand cDNA was then synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA using the reverse transcriptase SuperScript (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was then hydrolyzed with NaOH at 65°C for 30 min, and, following neutralization with acetic acid, the cDNA was purified using Geneclean (Bio 101). Following isolation of the cDNA by precipitation with glycogen and ethanol, 10% of the isolated cDNA was used for PCR amplification. For PCR analysis at different developmental ages, the use of equivalent amounts of cDNA was confirmed by RT-PCR of cDNA using chicken β-actin PCR primers. For PCR amplification, 1 μl of the cDNA synthesis mixture described above was used. Primer pairs used for RT-PCR of agrin mRNA were a forward 19-mer: 5′-TGGAGCACTGCGTGGAAGA-3′ and a backward 20 mer: 5′-TGCAGACACAGGAGGCTTGG-3′. cDNA was amplified for 28 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52°C, and PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels, with DNA visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To confirm the authenticity of the PCR products, they were subcloned into the pBluescript vector pCR-Script SK(+) (Stratagene) and subsequently sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The lower Mr PCR product was shown to contain 146 bp and lack the 21 bp insertion, while the larger PCR product was 167 bp in length and contained the 21-bp insertion. During the course of our molecular cloning of an NCAM-binding HSPG, which was subsequently shown to be identical to agrin(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we isolated an agrin cDNA that exhibited sequence differences to the published chick agrin cDNA(22Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This partial cDNA, named clone 801, was isolated by rescreening of a random-primed E9 chick brain cDNA library with a restriction fragment from agrin clone pPG3, which encoded nucleotides 560-1271 of agrin(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Upon sequence analysis, it was determined that clone 801 was identical with the published chick agrin cDNA at its 5′ and 3′ ends, but a 21-bp region from nucleotides 169-189 was absent from clone 801 (Fig. 1). Since these data raised the possibility that this cDNA defines a new splice variant of agrin, we named this cDNA agrin-related protein-3 (ARP-3), and the alternative exon encoding this domain was named C, in accord with the previous nomenclature for alternative splice sites in chicken agrin(14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In order to confirm whether the ARP-3 cDNA was present in chick brain as an mRNA, we designed PCR primers flanking this region. The forward primer sequence is indicated in Fig. 1, and the reverse primer was from nucleotides 319-300 of chick agrin. As shown in Fig. 2, by PCR of the clone 801 plasmid, a 146-bp product is obtained as predicted by the cDNA sequence. Upon PCR amplification of E9 chick brain mRNA that had been reverse-transcribed to yield single strand cDNA, the predominant product obtained was a 167-bp fragment, with the 146-bp product representing a minor mRNA species in E9 chick brain (Fig. 2). The authenticity of these PCR products was confirmed by subcloning of the products into PCR pBluescript, followed by dideoxy sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of each PCR product confirmed that the 167-bp fragment is identical with the published chick agrin cDNA, and that the 146-bp fragment is identical with the ARP-3 cDNA.2( 2G. Tsen and G. J. Cole, unpublished data. )Thus, these data show that a novel agrin mRNA species is expressed in chick brain, albeit at extremely low levels. Since previous analyses of agrin mRNA expression have suggested that non-neuronal cell agrin mRNA is subjected to alternative splicing, usually resulting in splicing out of all identified alternatively spliced exons, with only various combinations of splicing occurring in neurons(16Smith M.A. O'Dowd D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we were interested in ascertaining whether the alternatively spliced ARP-3 mRNA is also restricted to non-neuronal cells. To address this question, mRNA was isolated from chick brain astrocyte cultures, E10 gut (smooth muscle), and E10 heart (cardiac muscle). Following reverse transcription, these cDNAs were amplified using the PCR primers that flank the 21-bp region absent from ARP-3. These data show that the major PCR product in glia is 146 bp, indicating that the primary transcript in chick glia is the ARP-3 mRNA, lacking the 21-bp insertion (Fig. 3). In addition, both muscle tissues show an enrichment for the ARP-3 mRNA, as exhibited by the abundant signal for the 146-bp PCR product (Fig. 3). Although it is also evident that the 167-bp PCR product is obtained using muscle and glia mRNA, it remains to be determined what cellular source is responsible for expression of the unspliced form of agrin (i.e. containing the 21-bp insertion). To extend our understanding of the expression pattern of the ARP-3 agrin mRNA, we analyzed by RT-PCR the expression of this mRNA during chick brain and heart development. Based on our demonstration that glia exhibit an enrichment for the ARP-3 mRNA, we predicted that its expression should become augmented during brain development, consistent with gliogenesis during late development. As shown in Fig. 4A, during chick brain development the ARP-3 mRNA does display an increase in abundance, while the major agrin mRNA species, containing the 21-bp insertion, is diminished. In parallel analyses, we employed β-actin primers for RT-PCR, and these data indicate that different cDNA levels did not account for the observed alteration in agrin expression by RT-PCR, as similar levels of actin could be detected at each developmental age (Fig. 4). We also examined by RT-PCR the expression of agrin mRNA isoforms during chick heart development, and these data indicate that both agrin isoforms are reduced during heart development (Fig. 4B). The pattern of expression of these isoforms is similar in chick heart, with both species displaying a decrease in abundance subsequent to E10 of heart development. Thus, it appears that distinct non-neuronal cell populations display differences in expression of the ARP-3 agrin isoform, with glial expression in brain resulting in a developmental up-regulation, while in heart this isoform is down-regulated during development. We demonstrate in the present study that an additional spliced isoform of agrin is expressed in brain and non-neuronal tissues. However, unlike the previous identification of alternatively spliced isoforms of agrin (12Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) where the splice sites were restricted to the region of the agrin mRNA encoding the COOH-terminal domain of the protein, our studies indicate a novel splice site in the 5′-region of the agrin mRNA (Fig. 5). It is therefore interesting to note that in previous studies on the agrin gene in rat the 5′-region of the gene was not mapped, and thus the presence of this alternatively spliced exon had gone undetected(26Rupp F. Ozcelik T. Linial M. Peterson K. Francke U. Scheller R. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3535-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggest that in brain this 21 bp insertion into chick agrin appears to be localized to neuronal cells, since analysis of chick astrocyte mRNA by RT-PCR indicates the presence of agrin mRNA lacking the 21-bp domain. Upon analysis of non-neuronal chick tissues, in particular smooth and cardiac muscle, we have also observed an abundance of the agrin isoform lacking the alternatively spliced 21-bp insert. It is presently unclear why the agrin isoform containing the 21-bp insert is detected in chick glia and muscle, although it is likely that slight neuronal contamination of the astrocyte cultures can account for the minor levels of agrin mRNA containing the 21-bp exon in these cultures(25Kelly M.M. Phanhthourath C. Brees D.K. McCabe C.F. Cole G.J. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 85: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether non-neuronal cell populations in gut and heart are expressing the spliced form of agrin, or if neuronal components such as cardiac neural crest account for this expression. However, it has been shown previously that the low levels of the mRNA encoding the agrinA4B0 isoform can be expressed in muscle and non-neuronal tissues(14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Smith M.A. O'Dowd D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Ma E. Morgan R. Godfrey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2943-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that not all alternative exons are spliced out in non-neuronal agrin. Thus, it remains possible that the splicing at site C is regulated in non-neuronal cells. Although this remains to be confirmed, our data do suggest that in non-neuronal cells the majority of agrin isoforms lack the C exon, and thus it appears that the prevalent agrin isoform in non-neuronal cells is agrinA0B0C0. Based on our observation that in chick brain the predominant agrin form in glia lacks the 21-bp insert at splice site C, we reasoned that with development we should see an augmentation in expression of this isoform, concomitant with gliogenesis. Since previous studies have shown a pronounced diminution in agrin during chick brain development (8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), this would raise the possibility that glial agrin could be mediating distinct functions as neuronal agrin is down-regulated. Our present studies demonstrate a significant increase in the expression of ARP-3 mRNA, coincident with a marked decrease in the unspliced form of agrin. Thus, these data indicate distinctive patterns of regulation of agrin during brain development in neurons and glia. In light of our recent demonstration that agrin is capable of modulating NCAM function (21Burg M.A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), one can speculate that up-regulated glial expression of agrin during brain development may selectively modulate glial and/or glial-neuronal cell interactions, by contributing to localized increases in agrin expression during development. It is presently unclear what function the alternative splicing of the 21-bp exon may impart on agrin, especially in light of previous studies which have shown that the splicing out of alternative exons in non-neuronal agrin results in an inability to induce AChR aggregation (12Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.K. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is of interest that the alternatively spliced exon we have identified is localized to a region of agrin which has been suggested to contain the signal sequence for this protein. Thus, splicing out of the 21-bp exon at splice site C would affect the putative signal sequence, conceivably regulating the processing of this protein in non-neuronal and neuronal cells. For example, the splicing out of the 21-bp exon removes 7 amino acids from the putative signal sequence of agrin, including the consensus signal peptidase site immediately preceding the putative first amino acid of the mature protein (Fig. 1). Thus, with this signal peptidase site deleted, two possibilities exist in terms of processing of this splice variant of agrin: 1) the next available signal peptidase site would be utilized, resulting in non-neuronal cells lacking 24 amino acids at their NH2 terminus (see Fig. 1); 2) the character of the signal sequence would be altered, possibly precluding its removal and thus resulting in an agrin protein that would remain associated with the plasma membrane, rather than being secreted directly. However, this latter possibility would seem unlikely since agrin has been shown to be a secreted protein in both neurons (29Magill-Solc C. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Reist N.E. Werle M.J. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and glia(21Burg M.A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although our analyses in glia used long-term metabolic labeling of cultures which may have masked cleavage of a membrane-associated protein, with its subsequent release into the conditioned medium(21Burg M.A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet been able to elucidate the functional significance of the splicing at site C, an alternative possibility that must be considered is that the putative first amino acid in the mature agrin protein (Asp39) is in fact not the NH2 terminus of the mature protein, and thus the putative signal sequence upstream of this amino acid is not agrin's signal peptide. This possibility warrants consideration, since the absence of splicing would then result in the insertion of 7 amino acids in the mature protein which could possibly modulate the structure of the protein. For example, the 7-amino acid insertion contains a cluster of basic amino acids, which could regulate the ability of agrin to interact with anionic molecules. Likewise, the 7-amino-acid insert could introduce a putative protease cleavage site that could then alter the structure of the protein containing the insert. Moreover, in view of recent studies which have shown that agrin encoded by the full-length agrin cDNA is not secreted, and that the signal peptide of hemagglutinin had to be employed to facilitate secretion of the full-length agrin protein(28Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it remains possible that the signal sequence of agrin has not been identified. Since in previous studies it was also thought that agrin could not be isolated in its intact form(3Nitkin R.M. Smith M.A. Magill C. Fallon J.R. Yao Y.M. Wallace B.G. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), the NH2-terminal amino acid of the mature protein has never been conclusively identified. We therefore undertook protein sequencing experiments using immunopurified agrin from chick brain, which we have shown can be isolated intact as a HSPG(8Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Burg M.A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The heparan sulfate chains were removed from this agrin using heparitinase, and the protein was then separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Unfortunately, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence could not be obtained from this preparation, or from soluble purified agrin, suggesting that the NH2 terminus is blocked.2 It therefore remains to be determined if splicing of this 21-bp exon alters the properties of the mature protein versus the signal peptide. Thus, our goal in future studies will be to elucidate the possible function of this splicing event in agrin, with a focus on whether the processing of agrin is affected by splicing at site C and whether this splicing may modulate the ability of agrin to interact with adhesion proteins, such as NCAM, or its ability to regulate AChR aggregation in muscle. We thank Drs. Jeff Masters, John Oberdick, and Pappachan Kolattukudy for their helpful discussion during the course of this work."

The Man-6-P modification on N-linked oligosaccharides of multiple newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes allows them to bind to intracellular IGF-II/MPRs. The complexes then exit the Golgi and travel to an acidic prelysosomal compartment (endosome) where the low pH promotes dissociation of ligand from receptor. Free receptors recycle back to the Golgi to repeat the process or to the cell surface where they mediate the endocytosis and lysosomal targeting of extracellular phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes. The function of the receptor in binding IGF-II is controversial. Mature IGF-II is a nonphosphorylated, nonglycosylated 67-amino acid protein related to insulin that is present at high levels during fetal development. It has been reported that the receptor functions in signal transduction upon IGF-II binding (for review, see 36Nishimoto I. Murayama Y. Okamoto T. Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1991: 517-528Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies indicate that the IGF-II/MPR functions in clearance rather than signal transduction and that IGF-II exerts its effects through the IGF-I receptor and another uncharacterized receptor (14Filson A.J. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.C. Development. 1993; 118: 731-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 32Liu J.-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A.

Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Regardless, the IGF-II/MPR clearly mediates endocytosis of IGF-II, resulting in its delivery to the lysosome and subsequent degradation (37Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

The extracytoplasmic ligand-binding region of the receptor contains 15 repeating units that have an average length of 147 amino acids and are 16-38% identical (33Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor contains one IGF-II and two Man-6-P binding sites (42Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that each binding site is formed by a different repeating unit (8Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dahms N.M. Wick D.A. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. J. Biol.

One fascinating question is why the receptor contains 15 repeating domains. While it is possible that three units bind ligands and the other 12 are structural components, another possibility is that the receptor functions in lysosomal targeting of other ligands not yet identified. One of the purposes of this study was to search for endogenous non-Man-6-P-containing ligands of the receptor. A soluble form of the IGF-II/MPR has been detected in serum and urine (24Kiess W.

This protein retains IGF-II and Man-6-P binding activities and, based on its size, contains nearly the entire extracytoplasmic domain. Both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the receptor are present at high levels during fetal development. In this study, we isolated and characterized the soluble receptor and its bound ligands from fetal bovine serum. While we did not detect any new classes of ligands, we found that in addition to mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II, the receptor binds at least 12 different high molecular weight forms of IGF-II. These proteins have apparent molecular weights of 12,000-20,000 and contain a common peptide backbone modified with different amounts of O-linked sugars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the soluble receptor carries a significant fraction of IGF-II in fetal bovine serum. The following buffers were used: physiological binding buffer (PBB), 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 4 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 0.6 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM MgSO4, 0.12 mM citric acid, 17 μM CuSO4, 10 μM NaF, 6 μM AlCl3, 22 nM NaI, 5 nM CoCl2, 45 nM MnCl2, 18 μM ZnSO4, 5.7 mM NaOH, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4°C; acid buffer, 150 mM ammonium acetate, 250 mM acetic acid, pH 4.5; immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3; modification buffer, 6 M guanidine-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1; Lys-C buffer, 1 mM EDTA, 5% acetonitrile, 25 mM Tris, pH 8.5; glycosidase buffer, 10 mM CaCl2, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5; PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2; PBST, PBS with 0.05% Tween 20; PBSB, PBS with 0.25% bovine serum albumin. When indicated, a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC) was included at a final concentration of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Sigma, Hyclone, and Inovar. Bovine amniotic fluid, allantoic fluid, and urine were generously provided by Drs. Darryl Byerley and Calvin Ferrell (U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Clay City, NE). Yeast phosphomannan was very kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Slodki (USDA, Peoria, IL). Phosphomannan affinity resin was prepared by coupling cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to phosphomannan core as described previously (39Sahagian G.G. Distler J.J. Jourdian G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IGF-II was generously provided by Dr. Yitzhak Stabinsky (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Nitrocellulose was from Schleicher and Schuell. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Either low quality or expired lots of tissue culture grade fetal bovine serum were used for purification of sIGF-II/MPR (see). Typically, we used lots that contained ~4 μg of receptor/ml, but similar elution profiles were obtained using lots that ranged from 2 to 6 μg of receptor/ml. Serum (5 liters) was diluted with an equal volume of PBB/PIC, filtered through 0.2-μm cellulose acetate membranes (Millipore), and loaded onto a phosphomannan-Sepharose CL-6B affinity column (5 × 10 cm) at 500 ml/h. After loading, the column was disassembled, the resin batch was washed with 2 column volumes of PBB (5 times), the column was reassembled, and the column was washed at 500 ml/h until A280 reached base line. In early preparations, the column was mock eluted at 30 ml/h with 2.5 mM glucose 6-phosphate in PBB/PIC to release nonspecifically bound substances; this step was subsequently omitted as negligible amounts of protein were released. The column was then eluted at 30 ml/h with 2.5 mM Man-6-P in PBB/PIC. Recovered proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM-100 membrane (Amicon Inc.). Gel filtration chromatography at neutral pH was performed on affinity-purified protein using two columns connected in series (Superose 12, Pharmacia; 1.6 × 85 cm; Superdex 75, Pharmacia; 1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 mM Man-6-P/PBB and run at 1.0 ml/min. Selected fractions (e.g. eluting between 96-150 ml; Fig. 1) from the neutral gel filtration chromatography step were concentrated as above, acidified to pH 4.5 by the addition of 0.1 volumes of 10 × acid buffer, and incubated overnight. Acidified protein was rechromatographed at 0.25 ml/min on the gel filtration columns equilibrated with 1 × acid buffer. All steps were performed at 4°C. Samples were taken from a single fraction of the A2 and A3 peaks (equivalent to the 200- and 235-ml elution volumes, respectively, of the acidic gel filtration chromatogram in Fig. 1A) and radiolabeled using Na125I (DuPont NEN NEZ-033A) and IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described previously (43Valenzano K.J. Kallay L.M. Lobel P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Approximately 150,000 cpm each of labeled peak A2 and A3 proteins were incubated with either 40 ng of anti-IGF-II monoclonal antibody (Amano) or 10 μl of sIGF-II/MPR-Sepharose (0.9 mg of sIGF-II/MPR per ml of resin) in a final volume of 400 μl of IP buffer. Samples precipitated with immobilized receptor had 10 mM Man-6-P included in the IP buffer. All samples were mixed overnight at 4°C in the absence or presence of 60 ng of recombinant human IGF-II (rhIGF-II). Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was added to the samples containing anti-IGF-II and mixed at room temperature for an additional 30 min. After washing 5 times with IP buffer, pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples in 1 × acid buffer were dried and resuspended to ~0.1-0.3 μg/μl protein in modification buffer. Samples were reduced with 20 mM DTT and alkylated in the dark with either 40 mM iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide. Incubations were performed for 3 h at 50°C under a N2 atmosphere with continuous stirring. For radiolabeling, samples were initially reduced with 2 mM DTT and alkylated with 4 mM iodo[2-14C]acetic acid (50 μCi; Amersham Corp.) as above followed by 20 mM DTT and 40 mM iodoacetic acid to ensure complete alkylation. Reactions were quenched with 150 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at room temperature. Reaction mixtures were diluted with an equal volume of water and applied to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid-equilibrated Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters). After washing with 10 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, protein was eluted with 70% acetonitrile, 20% 1-propanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Specific activities for radiolabeled high Mr and 7.5-kDa IGF-II were ~250 Ci/mol assuming complete recovery of protein. Mature bovine IGF-II from peak A3 was iodinated using lactoperoxidase as described previously (Daughaday, 1987). Radiolabeled protein was purified on a Sephadex G50 fine column (Pharmacia, 0.7 × 28 cm) using PBSB as the mobile phase. Three radioactive peaks were detected, and fractions comprising the second peak (IGF-II monomer) were pooled. The specific activity was ~10 Ci/mmol assuming 50% recovery of IGF-II in the monomer peak. Radiolabeled IGF-II (10 ng) was incubated with fetal bovine serum (1 ml) for 24 h at room temperature. The serum was applied to a Superose 12 column (1.6 × 85 cm) and eluted at 1 ml/min with PBST at 4°C. Fractions (2 ml) were counted for 1 min in a Packard Cobra auto-γ-counter. sIGF-II/MPR concentrations in both purified and crude samples were determined by a two-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (6Chen H.J. Remmler J. Delaney J.C. Messner D.J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22338-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin standards using the dye-binding assay (Bradford, 1976) adapted to microtiter plates. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (Laemmli, 1970). Gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) and/or silver (45Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar; 35Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar) as indicated. Dried radioactive gels were either imaged on Kodak X-Omat RP film or exposed to a phosphor storage screen, scanned, and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 400 and ImageQuant 3.15 software. Sequencing was performed using automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 475A gas phase sequencer with a 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer and a 900A data control analysis module. The chromatograms were recorded and the results analyzed using an Applied Biosystems 475A report generator. This study was initiated to identify non-Man-6-P-containing ligands that are associated with the receptor in vivo. A suitable source of sIGF-II/MPR was identified by screening different bovine body fluids including serum, allantoic fluid, amniotic fluid, and urine. The results are summarized in Table I. The richest source was fetal serum, with receptor levels in 23 different lots ranging from 1.8 to 7.9 μg/ml. Interestingly, serum classified as unacceptable for tissue culture by different suppliers (“low quality”) had lower receptor concentrations than tissue culture grade serum (Table I).Table:sIGF-II/MPR content of bovine body fluids Open table in a new tab Receptor and non-Man-6-P-containing ligands were isolated using a three-step scheme (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, purification on a Man-6-P affinity resin (phosphomannan-agarose) was used to isolate receptor and to remove endogenous Man-6-P-containing ligands. Second, gel filtration chromatography at neutral pH was used to separate receptor and bound ligands from low molecular weight contaminants. As the receptor contains two Man-6-P binding sites (Tong et al., 1989), Man-6-P was included in this step to guard against the unlikely possibility that some Man-6-P-containing ligands remained associated with the receptor during affinity purification. Third, gel filtration chromatography was performed at mildly acidic pH to separate receptor from ligands. The final step capitalizes on the functional properties of this recycling receptor, which binds ligands at the near neutral pH of the Golgi or extracellular compartment and releases ligands into the acidic endosome. Initial affinity purification of receptor was quite efficient: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on the starting material and run through of the phosphomannan column demonstrated that in a typical preparation, >95% of the receptor adsorbed to the resin. The material eluted with Man-6-P was concentrated by ultrafiltration and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography at neutral pH (Fig. 1A, upper part). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining showed that both the 250-kDa receptor and a 6-kDa protein eluted near the void volume (Fig. 1A, peak N1; Fig. 1B, Coomassie, pH 7.4), while silver staining revealed that several additional proteins were present in the peak (Fig. 1B, silver, pH 7.4, 108 and 120 ml). The lower molecular weight proteins were tightly associated with the receptor, since an identical staining pattern was observed for the material eluted from the phosphomannan column, the retentate from the ultrafiltration step, and the fractions in peak N1. In contrast, no protein was detected in the ultrafiltrate or later eluting fractions from the neutral gel filtration columns (data not shown). A specific subset of the lower molecular weight species represents ligands that copurify with the sIGF-II/MPR. After acidification, gel filtration chromatography resolved peak N1 into three fractions (Fig. 1A, lower part). The major peak eluted near the void volume (peak A1), while two minor peaks eluted in the included volume (peaks A2 and A3). The centers of peaks A2 and A3 eluted as 18- and 7-kDa globular proteins, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining showed that peak A1 contained the 250-kDa receptor, while peak A3 contained the 6-kDa protein (Fig. 1B, Coomassie, pH 4.5, 120 and 228 ml, respectively). In addition, silver staining revealed that peak A2 contained some of the 6-kDa protein and a series of other proteins with apparent molecular weights in the range of 12,000-20,000 (Fig. 1B, silver, pH 4.5, 168-216 ml). Note that compared with peak N1, peak A1 exhibits increased staining of multiple bands (25-200 kDa). However, this smear probably represents nicked fragments of the sIGF-II/MPR generated by prolonged acidification. The important finding is that compared with peak N1, peak A1 exhibits decreased staining of the 6- and 12-20-kDa bands that are now present in peaks A3 and A2, respectively. This suggests that these proteins represent true ligands of the receptor. In contrast, sequence analysis demonstrated that the 66-kDa band seen in peaks N1, A1, and some of A2 represents contaminating bovine serum albumin. Protein blotting experiments using an 125I-labeled sIGF-II/MPR probe demonstrated that the 6- and 12-20-kDa bands are specifically recognized by the receptor (Fig. 2). Furthermore, addition of Man-6-P does not abolish binding, while IGF-II does. In contrast to their Coomassie and silver staining intensities, there is a greater signal seen for the 12-20-kDa bands than for the 6-kDa band. This is misleading, since control experiments using iodinated tracers demonstrate that significant amounts of all species are washed off the membrane during the assay, with the 6-kDa band being lost preferentially. In addition, the 6-kDa band has precisely the same mobility as the 7.5-kDa rhIGF-II standard (Fig. 2). In a complementary experiment using radiolabeled protein, the bands present in peaks A2 and A3 were all precipitated by immobilized sIGF-II/MPR, and this was inhibited by rhIGF-II (Fig. 3). In addition, all of these radiolabeled bands were specifically recognized by an anti-IGF-II monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3). Finally, sequence analysis showed that >90% and >99% of the material present in representative fractions of peaks A2 and A3, respectively, had the amino terminus AYRPS. This is identical to that reported for mature bovine IGF-II (21Honegger A. Humbel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 569-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the 12-20-kDa bands represent high molecular weight forms of IGF-II and that the 6-kDa band represents mature 7.5-kDa bovine IGF-II.Figure 3:Precipitation of high Mr and 7.5-kDa IGF-II. Iodinated samples of peaks A2 and A3 were incubated with either anti-IGF-II monoclonal antibody/protein A-Sepharose or sIGF-II/MPR-coupled Sepharose CL-6B in the absence or presence of rhIGF-II as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). Pellets were resuspended in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 5-20% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography after a 24-h exposure. The positions of high Mr and 7.5-kDa IGF-II are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the course of characterizing these IGF-II species, we noticed that their migration during SDS-PAGE was dramatically influenced by different reduction and alkylation treatments. We systematically investigated this using rhIGF-II (Fig. 4A). Both nonreduced and DTT-treated rhIGF-II migrated with the 6-kDa standard (lanes 1 and 4, respectively), while carboxyamidation with iodoacetamide slightly retarded migration (lane 3). In contrast, carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid greatly decreased migration, with the modified protein now running just behind the 14-kDa standard (lane 2). The major band in peak A3 also exhibited this shift, precisely comigrating with rhIGF-II under all conditions (Fig. 4B, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5, and data not shown). These observations further confirm that peak A3 contains 7.5-kDa bovine IGF-II. The bands in peak A2 also show this characteristic mobility shift upon iodoacetic acid modification (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 6, and data not shown). This supports our conclusion that these bands represent different IGF-II species. The markedly decreased migration of the carboxymethylated proteins may be a consequence of reduced SDS binding or altered conformation due to introduction of the negatively charged functional groups. Similar behavior has been reported previously for other chemically modified or phosphorylated proteins (3Banker G.A. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5856-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 34McCumber L.J. Clem L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar; 12Deibler G.E. Martenson R.E. Kramer A.J. Kies M.W. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7931-7938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, iodoacetic acid treatment is useful in increasing resolution of the bands by SDS-PAGE: analysis on 12.5-17.5% acrylamide gels revealed that there were at least 12 distinct high Mr IGF-II proteins (Fig. 4C). This complexity was also evident using ion exchange chromatography on the native proteins.2( 2K. J. Valenzano and P. Lobel, unpublished data.) To investigate factors that contribute to the increased molecular weight and size heterogeneity of the high Mr IGF-II proteins, we adapted the strategy of protease and glycosidase treatments used by Hudgins and colleagues (22Hudgins W.R. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pooled fractions of high Mr IGF-II and rhIGF-II standard were radiolabeled at Cys-9, −21, −46, −47, −51, and −60 by reduction and alkylation with iodo[2-14C]acetic acid. The proteins were digested with Lys-C which is predicted to cleave pro-IGF-II after Lys-65, −88, −96, −120, −129, and −151 (see Fig. 5). The rhIGF-II standard, which terminates at Glu-67, showed a slight shift in mobility by SDS-PAGE, consistent with the loss of its two COOH-terminal amino acids (Fig. 6). Incubation with the protease converted all the high Mr IGF-II species into a single band that had the same mobility as digested rhIGF-II. This demonstrates that the increased molecular weight and size heterogeneity seen among the high Mr IGF-II proteins is due to variations beyond Lys-65.Figure 6:Lys-C digestion of high Mr and 7.5-kDa IGF-II. Duplicate samples (1 μg) of reduced and 14C-alkylated high Mr and 7.5-kDa rhIGF-II were dried and resuspended in 26 μl of Lys-C buffer. Endoproteinase Lys-C (0.4 μg; Boehringer Mannheim) was added to each sample and incubated at 37°C for 20 h. Digested samples were resolved on a 12.5-17.5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography after a 2-week exposure. Positions of molecular mass standards are indicated. High Mr IGF-II was separated from 7.5-kDa IGF-II as described in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pro-IGF-II has no consensus N-linked glycosylation sites; however, numerous potential sites for O-linked glycosylation are present (Fig. 5). To determine if variability among the high Mr IGF-II species arises from this modification, the mixture was digested with neuraminidase and O-glycanase to remove terminal sialic acids and O-linked core disaccharides, respectively (Fig. 7). Treatment with both enzymes led to a collapse of nearly all high Mr IGF-II species into a single band that had the same mobility as the smallest high Mr IGF-II and likely represents extended, nonglycosylated IGF-II (arrow). These data, together with the Lys-C data above, indicate that most of the high Mr forms of IGF-II contain an identical COOH-terminal extension with variable O-linked glycosylation. In addition, the high Mr forms of IGF-II were also digested with the two glycosidases separately. Treatment with neuraminidase alone converts many of the upper bands into lower molecular weight species, demonstrating that these proteins contain sialic acid. In contrast, treatment with O-glycanase alone has little effect on the higher molecular weight forms, while the band running just above the deglycosylated form displays an increased intensity. As O-glycanase only removes the unmodified disaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAc from threonine or serine residues, this suggests that at least some of the high Mr IGF-II species contain both O-glycanase-sensitive and resistant linkages, indicating glycosylation at two or more sites. A large proportion of the affinity-purified receptor contains bound IGF-II. In a typical preparation from 5 liters of serum, we recover 18, 0.19, and 0.27 mg of protein in peaks A1, A2, and A3, respectively. (These values were obtained using the dye-binding assay, but similar results were found using quantitative amino acid analysis). Based on our recoveries from peaks A1 and A3, at least 50% of the receptor contained bound IGF-II, assuming that the protein molecular weights of sIGF-II/MPR and mature IGF-II are ~250,000 and 7,500, respectively, and that the binding stoichiometry of IGF-II and receptor is 1:1 (41Tong P.Y. Tollefsen S.E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2585-2588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is a conservative estimate, since it ignores the contribution of mature IGF-II and high Mr IGF-II present in peak A2. In addition to soluble receptor, there are at least six other IGF binding proteins that have molecular weights ranging from 25 to 150 kDa (for review, see 29Lamson G. Giudice L.C. Rosenfel"
https://openalex.org/W2013024656,"A novel 85-kDa protein secreted by the mouse stro-mal osteogenic cell line MN7 was identified using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mathieu, E., Meheus, L., Raymackers, J., and Merregaert, J.(1994) J.

The process of embryonic bone formation involves the creation of an extracellular matrix that mineralizes during the course of tissue maturation. This matrix is subject to constant remodeling during the lifetime of an individual, through the combined actions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. A careful balance of matrix formation and resorption must be maintained because perturbations can result in various bone disorders (reviewed in Ref. 1). The extracellular matrix of bone consists of two phases, an organic phase and a mineral one. The organic phase consists primarily of the collagen type I fibrils that are associated with a number of noncollagenous matrix proteins. Interest in the noncollagenous proteins of the bone was greatly stimulated when Urist first demonstrated that demineralized bone extracts could induce ectopic bone formation(2Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4502) Google Scholar). Non-collagenous proteins of bone are now believed to be involved in mineralization as well as the local regulation of bone cell function (3Heinegard D. Oldberg A. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 211-236Google Scholar). In the past few years, a number of noncollagenous proteins of bone have been isolated and characterized; among these are osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and bone sialoprotein(4von der Mark K. Goodman S. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 211-236Google Scholar, 5Heinegard D. Oldberg A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In order to study the properties of bone-forming cells, our laboratory has established a clonal osteogenic cell line (MN7) from bone marrow stroma of the adult mouse(6Mathieu E. Schoeters G. Vander Plaetse F. Merregaert J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These cells, under appropriate conditions, undergo typical osteoblastic differentiation in vitro and are able to form a mineralized extracellular matrix(7Mathieu E. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner.

To characterize the proteins secreted by MN7 cells during in vitro proliferation and differentiation, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (2D SDS-PAGE)( 1The abbreviations used are: 2D SDS-PAGEtwo-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)RACErapid amplification of cDNA endsORFopen reading frameChrchromosome.) 1 patterns of proteins present in MN7 culture supernatants at different time points were compared to those of non-osteogenic stromal cell cultures(9Mathieu E. Meheus L. Raymackers J. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fifteen different protein spots were found to be specific for MN7. Five of these polypeptides were isolated and partially microsequenced. Four of them were identified as osteopontin, collagen α 2 (I), cathepsin L, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2, all of which are known to be involved in bone formation or resorption processes(10Dickson I.R.

Three partial peptide sequences of the fifth protein did not have any counterparts in public data banks(9Mathieu E. Meheus L. Raymackers J. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner.

In the present study we report the isolation of the p85 cDNA clone. The full-length cDNA contains an ORF of 1677 bp encoding a protein of 559 amino acids. Computer analysis of the deduced primary amino acid sequence revealed a hydrophobic signal peptide characteristic of a secreted protein. Motif analyses did not identify features typical for known protein families. The message of 1.9 kb is expressed in various tissues such as liver, heart, lungs, etc., whereas a splice variant was present in embryonic cartilage and skin. The corresponding gene for p85 (called Ecm1 for extracellular matrix protein 1), maps on chromosome (Chr) 3 of mouse in a region containing several loci involved in skin developmental disorders. All cell culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Ghent, Belgium). RNA for making the cDNA library was isolated from MN7 cells that were grown as described before(9Mathieu E. Meheus L. Raymackers J. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in BGJ-B medium (Biggers-Gwatkin-Jones Bone medium, Fitton-Jackson modification) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mML-glutamine. After reaching confluence, the cells were grown in serum-free medium (BGJ-B with ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium premix, purchased from Sigma)) for 48 h before harvesting. MC3T3-E1 cells(12Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), were grown in α-MEM (α-minimal essential medium) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mML-glutamine. BALB/c 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. MC615 chondrocytes (13Mallein-Gerin F. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3289-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mML-glutamine. For time course expression, MN7 cells were grown under conditions optimized for inducing mineralization(8Mathieu E. Establishment and Cellular Biochemical Characterization of the Osteogenic Stromal Cell Line MN. Ph.D. thesis, University of Antwerp, Belgium. 1993; Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well culture plates, in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid. The cultures were refreshed every 2 days and harvested by trypsinization at different time points. The cells were cultured in the presence of serum throughout the experiment. This was performed as described in Ref. 14. Briefly, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40, cell lysates extracted with phenol and chloroform, and then precipitated with isopropanol at −20°C overnight. The RNA was pelleted, washed in 70% ethanol, and then dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. This was performed as described in Ref. 14. Tissues were dissected out of embryonic BALB/c mice (16 days post-coitum) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissues were homogenized in 4 M guanidine thiocyanate and then centrifuged over a cesium chloride cushion at 32,000 rpm for 24 h at 21°C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). The pellet containing the RNA was washed in 70% ethanol and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Poly(A) containing RNA was isolated from total RNA using magnetic oligo(dT) beads (Dynabeads™) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Standard blotting and hybridization procedures were used(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10-μg quantities of total RNAs were electrophoresed in formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Corp.), UV cross-linked, and then hybridized (Amersham hybridization protocols). Quantitive comparisons of RNAs present on the blots were made using the murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe(15Sabath D.E. Broome H.E. Prystowsky M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Mouse genomic DNA was digested with different enzymes and separated on 0.8% agarose gels. The DNAs were blotted onto Hybond N membranes, UV cross-linked, and hybridized. A directional cDNA library in the pSPORT1 vector was made using MN7 poly(A)+-enriched RNA and the Superscript™ cDNA cloning system of Life Technologies, Inc. The library contained approximately 2 × 106 independent clones, with an average insert size of 1.7 kb. The library was screened by colony hybridization using selected (see “Results”), end-labeled oligonucleotides as a probe. Labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [β-32P]dATP (Amersham). Hybridizations were done at room temperature according to standard procedures. The hybridization was followed by washes at increasing stringency. Positive clones were subjected to secondary and tertiary screening. Microsequencing of the p85 protein was done on spots isolated from dried two-dimensional gels as described earlier(9Mathieu E. Meheus L. Raymackers J. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One N-terminal and two internal peptide sequences were obtained. Among these, a 6-amino acid N-terminal sequence, DQREMT, had minimum codon degeneracy and was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers with the help of the PGEN computer program (16Nash J.H.E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 469-471PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were synthesized commercially (British Bio-technology Products Ltd.) as 17-mers, in three sets of 16 degeneracies each. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were: 1) 5′-CTRGTYGCRCTYTACTG-3′, 2) 5′-CTRGTYGCYCTYTACTG-3′, and 3) 5′-CTRGTYTCYCTYTACTG-3′, where (R = A or G and Y = C or T). The cDNA clone of p85 was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (17Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar) using [35S]dATP (Amersham Corp.) and Sequenase (a modified T7 DNA polymerase; Amersham). Vector-specific as well as insert-specific primers were used. For computer analysis of the sequence data, various software packages were used in the course of this study. They are mentioned under “Results” where appropriate. The 5′ sequence of the message was obtained using the 5′-RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) amplification system of Life Technologies, Inc. The three gene-specific primers used are listed below. NotI and SalI linkers designed for cloning are indicated in parentheses; numbers indicate positions on the cDNA (see Fig. 1): GSP1(antisense, 313-289), 5′-CAGAGTGGTCAACTCGGAGTCTCCG-3′; GSP2 (antisense, 222-198), 5′-{TCGCGAACTAGTGCGGCCGC}CGTCATCTCTCGCTGGTCTGAAGC-3′; GSP3 (antisense, 178-154), 5′-{TCGCGAACTAGTGCGGCCGC}CAGCAGAAGCAAGAGCCAAGCAGGC-3′. Briefly, first strand cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using GSP1 as the first primer. This was followed by tailing at the 5′ end using dCTP and terminal transferase. The tailed cDNA product was amplified using an anchor primer (supplied with the kit) and GSP2. The amplified product was then cloned in the NotI and SalI sites of pSPORT1 and sequenced. Sequences obtained were verified on several independent PCR clones. The 5′ sequence obtained was independently confirmed by repeating PCR-RACE using the primer GSP3. Reverse transcription PCR was used to clone the differentially spliced p85 transcript. 1 μg of total RNA from mouse embryonic front paw and tail were reverse transcribed using the preamplification kit of Life Technologies, Inc. This was followed by two rounds of PCR amplification using cDNA-specific primers. The primers used are listed below. NotI and SalI linkers designed for cloning are indicated in parentheses. Numbers indicate positions on the cDNA (Fig. 1): N1 (upper, 29-53), 5′-CAGGCTTGCAGCAAGTGGCCCAACC-3′; N2 (upper, 61-86), 5′-{TCGCGAGTCGAC}GTCTAGATCTGCCTGTGACAACCAGC-3′;C1 (lower, 1870-1847), 5′-GTAATGAGTGTTCGAGGAGGGTGG-3′; C2 (lower, 1806-1784), 5′-{TCGCGAGCGGCCGC}GGTGACTCATTCTTCCTTGGACC-3′. PCR conditions used during the experiment were denaturation at: 95°C for 5 min; 36 cycles of 95°C, 3 s; 55°C, 30 s; 72°C, 2.30 min; and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Products of the first amplification (using N1 and C1 primers) were purified by phenol extraction and then subjected to a second amplification using N2 and C1 primers. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels, purified, and subsequently cloned in the NotI and SalI sites of pSPORT1. The region involved in differential splicing was identified on the basis of restriction mapping and sequence analysis of several independent clones originating from separate reactions. A 462-bp EcoRI- PstI fragment of the p85 cDNA clone was used as a hybridization probe on Southern blots to type DNAs from two genetic crosses: (NFS/N or C58/J × Mus m. musculus) × M. m. musculus(18Kozak C.A. Peyser M. Krall M. Mariano T.M. Kumar C.S. Pestka S. Mock B.A. Genomics. 1990; 8: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and (NFS/N × Mus spretus) × M. spretus or C58/J(19Adamson M.C. Silver J. Kozak C.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 778Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). DNAs from these crosses have been typed for over 700 markers including the Chr 3 markers Gba (glucocerebrosidase), Fcgr1 (Fcβ receptor), Cd1a (cluster designation 1a), Amy1 (amylase 1), Ngfb (nerve growth factor β) and Egf (epidermal growth factor). Probes for these markers and RFLPs used to type these crosses for Gba, Fcgr1, Cd1a, and Ngfb have been described previously(20Osman N. Kozak C.A. Mckenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1570-1575PubMed Google Scholar). Amy1 was typed following HindIII digestion in the M. spretus cross using a 530-bp probe kindly provided by Dr. M. Meisler (U. Mich.)(21Darlington G.J. Tsai C.C. Samuelson L.C. Gumucio D.L. Meisler M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Egf was typed following BamHI digestion in the spretus cross and HindIII digestion in the musculus cross using a 1200-bp fragment of the pre-pro-epidermal growth factor cDNA obtained from Dr. G. Bell (University of Chicago)(22Zabel B.U. Eddy R.L. Lalley P.A. Scott J. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The p85 polypeptide isolated from 2D SDS-PAGE gels was microsequenced as described(9Mathieu E. Meheus L. Raymackers J. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An N-terminal and two internal peptide sequences were obtained (see Fig. 1). Three sets of degenerate oligonucleotide probes were made against the N-terminal sequence DQREMT (see “Materials and Methods”). These oligonucleotides were tested by hybridization to MN7 poly(A)+ RNA on three separate Northern blots. Although all three sets hybridized specifically to a single message of 1.9 kb, set number 2 hybridized at highest stringency and was used to screen the MN7 cDNA library. Screening of approximately 750,000 clones yielded a single positive clone with an insert size of 1.9 kb. This clone was sequenced at the 5′ end to confirm the presence of the N-terminal peptide sequence DQREMT. Subsequently, the insert was cut into five separate fragments using EcoRI and PstI and subcloned into the pSPORT1 vector. Sequencing of the subclones was performed on both strands using T7 and SP6 primers of pSPORT1. In cases where these primers could not be used (compressions or too long insert), specifically designed primers were employed. The complete sequence of the p85 cDNA is shown in Fig. 1. In order to identify the 5′-end of the message, a 5′-RACE reaction was carried out and 18 additional nucleotides were obtained. The complete cDNA sequence contains an ORF of 1677 bp, which extends between positions 121-1797 and codes for a protein of 559 amino acids. All three peptide sequences obtained by microsequencing are present in the deduced protein sequence (see Fig. 1). The first AUG, at position 121, is in a favorable codon context for an eukaryotic translation start site (A at −3 and G at +4; Ref. 23). It is preceded by three in-frame stop codons, while the ORFs in the two alternative reading frames are not more than 100 bp long. The coding region is terminated by a single UGA codon and is followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 95 bp, which includes an AAUAAA polyadenylation signal(24Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a poly(A) tail. The protein sequence contains a putative signal peptide at the N terminus, which is the only hydrophobic portion of the protein (see Fig. 2b). The cleavage site for the signal peptide is most probably between Ala-Ala after residue 19. This is based on N-terminal protein sequencing data, where the first residue is alanine (at position 20), and the application of von Heijne's(−3, −1) rule(25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The cleaved extracellular protein would therefore contain 540 amino acids with a calculated mass of 61 kDa and a pI of 6.26. On 2D SDS-PAGE gels, the p85 protein migrates as a diffuse spot with an average mass of 85 kDa and a pI of 5.7(9Mathieu E. Meheus L. Raymackers J. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The differences in apparent and predicted values are most probably the result of post-translational modifications. Indeed, the analysis of the sequence reveals the presence of three potential N-glycosylation sites and several possible phosphorylation sites (see Fig. 1). N-Linked glycosylations can contribute significantly to the molecular weight of proteins(26Jokinen M. Ulmanen I. Andersson L.D. Kaariainen L. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and phosphorylations have been shown to affect the mobility of proteins on SDS gels(27Gates R.E. King Jr., L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the protein does not contain potential sites for glycosaminoglycan addition, indicating that it is unlikely to be a proteoglycan(28Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Considering the differences in apparent and predicted molecular weights, the total carbohydrate content of the molecule could be up to 28%. Analysis of the amino acid composition reveals that protein is rich in Arg, Pro, and Leu residues (Table I). The basic and acidic amino acid contents are balanced (14.6. and 13.4% of the mass, respectively) and the distribution of charged residues is fairly uniform over the sequence (data not shown). The protein is not rich in Ser or Thr, which is generally observed for phosphoproteins, and it does not contain a high number of aspartic acid or glutamic acid which are common to some bone glycoproteins(10Dickson I.R. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 249-285Google Scholar). The protein is rich in cysteines (a total of 29 residues or 4.8% mass), that are unevenly distributed in the sequence. There is one residue in the signal peptide, followed by a cysteine-free region of 150 residues, while the remaining 28 residues are distributed over the rest of the molecule in a typical pattern characteristic of the serum albumin family of proteins (see “Arrangement of Cysteines in the p85 Proteins”). There are 63 prolines and 34 glycines in the protein, which suggests rigidity in the unfolded polypeptide chain, since prolines permit less rotational freedom(29Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1991: 259Google Scholar).TABLE IAmino acid composition of the p85 coding region Open table in a new tab Analysis of the deduced protein sequence of p85 using the WinDot (30Nakisa R.C. a program for graphical comparison of nucleic acid and protein sequences for Microsoft Windows.

Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar) programs revealed the presence of a tandemly duplicated domain within the protein; region 170-298 is homologous to region 302-424 (Fig. 2a). These two domains immediately follow the N-terminal cysteine-free domain of 150 amino acids. The first repeat contains 10 cysteines and the second 9. There is a remarkable conservation of the cysteines, including the positions of two cysteine doublets, within these domains. Similarity searches (performed using BLASTP (32Altschul S.F. Gish W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar), and D-FLASH(34Rigoutsos I. Califano A. IEEE Comput. Sci. Eng. 1994; 1: 60-75Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar)) indicated that although the p85 sequence was not closely related to any other known protein, a limited similarity to a recently characterized calcium-binding protein of sea urchin called Endo16 (35Soltysik-Espanola M. Klinzing D.C. Pfarr K. Burke R.D. Ernst S.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) could be observed. Following alignment, three regions in the p85 sequence (235-264, 265-289, and 400-418) showed 33%, 48%, and 47% similarity to regions 273-301, 412-436, and 664-682 of Endo16, respectively. Coinciding with this, we find that residues 253-290 of p85 are similar (55%) to residues 654-690 of calpain, a calcium-activated neutral protease(36Aoki K. Imajoh S. Ohno S. Emori Y. Koike M. Kosaki G. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This region in calpain, contains a calcium-binding loop of an EF hand structure (residues 663-674 of calpain) and both p85 and calpain contain 6 acidic residues in this region. Regions 264-278 and 361-376 of p85 are also similar (66% and 62%) to serum albumin family repeats(37Dugaiczyk A. Law S.W. Dennison O.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The similarities to Endo16 and serum albumin family of proteins, involves characteristic cysteine doublets that typify these proteins and is discussed under “Arrangement of Cysteines in the p85 Proteins.” Domain and motif searches using the mail servers SBASE(38Pongor S. Skerl V. Cserzo M. Hatsagi Z. Simon G. Bevilacqua V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 21: 3111-3115Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 39Hegyi H. Pongor S Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 371-372PubMed Google Scholar), and PRODOM (40Sonnhammer E.L.L. Kahn D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) primarily yielded similarities of the first 19 residues of p85 to signal peptides of various secreted proteins. Apart from this, typical signatures for domains or motifs of other known proteins were not identifiable. Cell attachment motifs such as RGD and LDV were absent(41Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Alignments of protein sequences on the basis of similarities in amino acid compositions (using the ExPASy server; Ref. 42) did not identify any homologues to p85. The deduced protein sequence of the p85 was analyzed using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (hydrophobicity) as well as the Chou and Fasman algorithm (secondary structure), which are included in the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software package GCG. Predictions indicate that the protein is highly hydrophilic with no intervening transmembrane domains (Fig. 2b). The molecule is predicted to contain 39.75% helices, 24.38% sheets, and 35.87% coils. Structurally, the p85 molecule can be divided into four regions. These are, a 19-residue signal peptide, followed by a cysteine-free domain of 150 residues, two tandem repeats of 129 and 123 residues, and a C-terminal region of 135 residues. This is schematically represented in Fig. 2c. To study the tissue specificity of p85 gene (Ecm1) transcription, we performed Northern blot analysis on RNAs isolated from tissues of embryonic mice and different cell lines. In addition, the steady state levels of the p85 message in MN7 cultures at different time points were examined. Weak expression of a 1.9-kb p85 gene transcript was detected in liver, heart, and lungs (Fig. 3a). Calvaria, which are essentially membranous bones produced directly by osteoblasts without a cartilage intermediate, showed almost negligible expression. On the other hand, skin- and cartilage-containing tissues, such as tail and front paw, showed a very strong expression of p85. Moreover, these tissues uniquely contained a smaller message of 1.5 kb in addition to the longer transcript of 1.9 kb. In skin, only the smaller transcript was present. No p85 gene message was detected in brain. We examined whether bone and cartilage derived cell lines other than MN7, expressed p85. Strong expression was detected in MC3T3-E1, which is a mouse calvarial preosteoblastic cell line(12Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Expression was also seen in MC615, a mouse chondroblastic cell line(13Mallein-Gerin F. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3289-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all the above cell lines expressed only the longer transcript. Negligible expression of p85 was detected in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3b). Since MN7 cells are able to proliferate and differentiate in vitro forming a mineralized matrix(7Mathieu E. Merregaert J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Mathieu E. Establishment and Cellular Biochemical Characterization of the Osteogenic Stromal Cell Line MN. Ph.D. thesis, University of Antwerp, Belgium. 1993; Google Scholar), we studied the steady state levels of the p85 gene transcript at different periods of culture in an attempt to identify to which stage of MN7 culture (proliferation or maturation), its expression could be correlated. It was seen that the level of p85 mRNA p"

To identify and characterize cis-acting MCAD gene promoter regulatory elements and corresponding transcription factors, DNA-protein binding studies and mammalian cell transfection analyses were performed with human MCAD gene promoter fragments. DNA:protein binding studies with nuclear protein extracts prepared from hepatoma G2 cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, or Y-1 adrenal tumor cells identified three sequences (nuclear receptor response element 1 or NRRE-1, NRRE-2, and NRRE-3) that bind orphan members of the steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily including chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor and steroidogenic factor 1. Sp1 binding sites (A-C) were identified in close proximity to each of the NRREs. NRRE-3 conferred cell line-specific transcriptional repression by interacting with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor or activation via steroidogenic factor 1. In contrast, the Sp1 binding site A behaved as a transcriptional activator in all cell lines examined. We propose that multiple nuclear receptor transcription factors interact with MCAD gene promoter elements to differentially regulate transcription among a variety of cell types.

Boyer P.D. Lardy H.J. Myrback K. The Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1963: 447-476Google Scholar). The pivotal role of MCAD in cellular energy metabolism is underscored by the serious and often fatal clinical consequences of inherited MCAD deficiency including hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and sudden death (2, 3). MCAD expression is highly regulated in parallel with cellular FAO rates during development, among tissues, and by dietary factors and hormones(4Kelly D.P. Gordon J.I. Alpers R. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18921-18925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nagao M. Parimoo B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24114-24124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To delineate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial FAO enzymes, we have focused on the MCAD gene. As an initial step in the identification of MCAD gene transcriptional regulatory elements, genomic clones encoding the human MCAD gene and 5′-flanking region were isolated and characterized(6Zhang Z. Kelly D.P. Kim J.J. Zhou Y. Ogden M.L. Whelan A.J. Strauss A.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transfection of plasmids containing varying lengths of the MCAD gene 5′-flanking region fused to a reporter gene into human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells localized the functional promoter to a region between 362 base pairs upstream and 189 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site. Recently, we identified a novel nuclear hormone receptor response element (NRRE-1) within this promoter region located 343 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site(7Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to delineate the cis-acting regulatory elements within the human MCAD gene promoter and to identify transcription factors that interact with these sequences. To this end, DNA-protein binding studies and mammalian cell gene transfer studies were performed. The results of these studies revealed that the MCAD gene promoter contains a series of cis-acting regulatory modules composed of Sp1 binding sites juxtaposed to nuclear receptor response elements. The transcriptional regulatory properties of the elements suggest a mechanism for modulation of MCAD gene expression among distinct cell types in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNase I Protection AnalysisUsing internal restriction sites, three overlapping MCAD gene promoter DNA fragments were gel-isolated for the DNase I protection assay (all numbers are relative to the transcription start site = +1(6Zhang Z.

In brief, 5-25 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with 3-5 pmol of labeled DNA fragment and digested with DNase I. Samples were separated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. The location of the footprinted sequences was determined by a Maxam-Gilbert sequence reaction of the identical labeled fragment.

Construction of MCADCAT(−362/+189), MCADCAT(−312/+189), pTKCAT, and pTKCAT(NRRE-1) have been described(7Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter fragments for MCADCAT(−170/+189) and MCADCAT (−102/+189) were generated by PCR. The PCR products were ligated into the pCAT-Basic plasmid via HindIII (incorporated into the 5′-PCR primer) and the internal SphI site. DNA sequence analysis was performed to confirm that the PCR product contained no mutations. The pCATSV40 plasmid was obtained from Promega (pCAT-Control). pTKCAT(A) and pTKCAT(NRRE-3) were constructed by ligating double-stranded site A or NRRE-3 oligonucleotides into the BamHI site present upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter.Mammalian Cell Transient TransfectionsHuman HepG2 cells, Y-1 mouse adrenal cells, and NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% Nu-serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products) (HepG2), F-10 supplemented with 15% heat inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (Y-1), and minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (3T3). Cell transfection protocol and CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described(6Zhang Z. Kelly D.P. Kim J.J. Zhou Y. Ogden M.L. Whelan A.J. Strauss A.W.

In brief, 10 μg of MCADCAT plasmid were transfected by the calcium-phosphate technique along with 1-3 μg of a murine sarcoma virus promoter-β-galactosidase chimeric gene plasmid (pMSV-βgal) to control for transfection efficiency. In experiments shown in Fig. 2A, in addition to normalizing to pMSV-βgal activity, the transcriptional activity of pCATSV40 was determined in parallel transfections to allow normalization for differences in background CAT activity among different cell lines. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe MCAD Promoter Contains Multiple Nuclear Protein Binding SitesAs an initial step in the identification of cis-acting regulatory elements within the MCAD gene promoter region, DNase I protection experiments were performed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from cell lines derived from liver (human hepatoma G2) and adrenal cortex (mouse Y-1 adrenal tumor cells), two tissues with a high capacity for FAO and relatively abundant MCAD expression, and a third cell line with low MCAD expression (mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts)(4Kelly D.P.

Overlapping end-labeled DNA fragments spanning from −362 to +189 (relative to the transcription start site = +1) of the MCAD gene promoter region were employed in these studies. Compared to the published human MCAD promoter sequence(6Zhang Z. Kelly D.P. Kim J.J. Zhou Y. Ogden M.L. Whelan A.J. Strauss A.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we identified two additional guanine nucleotides (at −281 and −298) by Maxam-Gilbert sequencing. Repeat dideoxy sequence reactions revealed that compression artifacts in the dideoxy sequence accounted for this disparity. Accordingly, the numbering system used here to describe the MCAD promoter constructs and regulatory elements was revised to correspond to this corrected sequence. Six distinct DNase I protected sites were identified between −343 and +160 (Fig. 1, A-F). The footprinted regions include three similar GC-rich sequences (designated A-C) and three sites (NRRE-1, NRRE-2, and NRRE-3) containing hexamer sequences that conform to the consensus (RG(G/T)TNA) for binding members of the steroid/thyroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors (Fig. 1F). We have shown previously that one of the latter sites, NRRE-1, is a functional nuclear receptor response element(7Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

A-E, DNase I protection analysis was performed with each of three overlapping radiolabeled MCAD promoter DNA fragments and nuclear protein extracts prepared from HepG2, Y-1, or 3T3 cells. The lane labels at the top indicate the Maxam-Gilbert sequence reaction (M), control without protein added (-), and the addition of 5 and 25 μg of nuclear protein, respectively. The brackets denote the DNase I protected regions (numbers are relative to the MCAD gene transcription start site = +1). F, schematic of the DNase I protected sites of the MCAD gene promoter. The DNA fragments employed in the DNase I protection experiments are shown at the top. The location of each of the footprinted regions is indicated by the symbols. The DNA sequences of the footprinted regions are shown at the bottom. The underlined sequences indicate the homologous GC-rich motifs shared by sites A-C. The arrows indicate the location and relative orientation of the putative nuclear receptor binding half-sites in NRRE-1, −2, and −3 (based on the consensus RG(G/T)NA).

In contrast, the DNase I protection patterns at NRRE-2 and NRRE-3 were cell specific. At NRRE-2, DNase I protection was strong with 3T3 nuclear extracts, weak with HepG2 extracts, and absent with Y-1 nuclear proteins (Fig. 1C). In contrast, both Y-1 and 3T3 nuclear proteins conferred a prominent footprint at NRRE-3, whereas HepG2 nuclear extracts did not interact with this site (Fig. 1E).MCAD Gene Promoter Protein Binding Sites Function as Transcriptional Regulatory ElementsTo determine if the MCAD gene promoter regions delineated by the DNase I protection studies function as transcriptional regulatory elements, the full-length MCAD promoter and a series of mutant promoter fragments with various deletions fused to a CAT gene were transiently transfected into HepG2, Y-1, and 3T3 cells. The initial transfection experiments evaluated the activity of the full-length MCAD gene promoter construct (MCADCAT(−362/+189)) among the three cell lines. The transcriptional activity of MCADCAT(−362/+189) was normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting pMSV-βgal. MCADCAT(−362/+189) activity was compared to that of an SV40 promoter in the identical CAT reporter plasmid backbone (pCATSV40) to control for cell line-specific differences in background CAT activity. MCADCAT(−362/+189) activity was high in HepG2 cells (44% pCATSV40 activity) and Y-1 cells (38% pCATSV40 activity) but more than 10-fold lower in 3T3 fibroblasts (3.4% pCATSV40 activity, Fig. 2A). The steady-state MCAD mRNA levels in each of the cell lines, as determined by Northern blot analysis (data not shown), paralleled the CAT activities. A similar cell line-specific pattern of MCADCAT(−362/+189) transcription was observed when the data were compared to the activity of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter-CAT plasmid standard (data not shown). These data indicate that elements involved in cell-specific control of MCAD gene transcription are contained within the MCAD(−362/+189) promoter fragment.An MCAD promoter deletion series was employed in transfection experiments to examine the transcriptional regulatory properties of the DNase I protected regions in the MCAD gene promoter. Deletion of the 50-base pair region from −362 to −312, which contains NRRE-1, resulted in a modest but statistically significant increase in transcriptional activity in 3T3 cells (1.4-fold, p = 0.006 based on four independent experiments) but no significant changes in HepG2 or Y-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Removal of the 5′-promoter region containing site A (from −312 to −170) resulted in a significant decrease in transcriptional activity in HepG2 (81%), Y-1 (49%), and 3T3 cells (64%). As predicted by the DNase I protection studies, further deletion of the region from −170 to −102, which lacks footprinted regions, had no significant effect on transcriptional activity in any cell line. These data confirm that promoter module A functions as a cis-acting transcriptional activator and suggests that NRRE-1 confers transcriptional repression in 3T3 cells.The transfection experiments indicated that MCAD promoter module A is a positive regulatory element in all three cell lines. To evaluate the transcriptional regulatory properties of the site A element in the absence of the NRREs and in the context of a heterologous promoter, a single copy of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing site A was placed upstream of the TK promoter in a CAT reporter plasmid (pTKCAT(A)) and transfected into the three cell lines. The transcriptional activity of pTKCAT(A) was 2.3-, 3.3-, and 2.5-fold higher than that of pTKCAT lacking the site A element (pTKCAT(-)) in HepG2, Y-1, and 3T3 cells, respectively (Fig. 2C). A DNA fragment containing site A conferred orientation-independent transcriptional activation (8.6 ± 1.3-fold induction) when inserted at a remote distance upstream of the SV40 promoter (data not shown). Thus, site A is a transcriptional activator with enhancer-like properties.Sp1 or a Related Protein Binds Sites A-C in the MCAD Gene PromoterEMSAs were performed to identify the protein(s) that bind MCAD promoter elements A-C. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the site A element was employed as a probe in EMSA performed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from Y-1, HepG2, and 3T3 cells. Two DNA:protein complexes were observed with each nuclear extract (Fig. 3A, lanes 2-4, I and II). Complex I was the most prominent in each case. Competition with 100-fold molar excess unlabeled site A oligonucleotide or a size-matched, unrelated DNA fragment confirmed that complexes I and II represented a specific protein-DNA interaction (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Parallel experiments revealed that an identical mobility shift pattern was observed with oligonucleotide probes containing site B or C sequences and that a molar excess of unlabeled site B diminished or site C abolished the formation of complexes I and II (data not shown). These data suggest that identical or similar transcription factors bind MCAD promoter sites A-C in all three cell lines.Figure 3:Electrophoretic mobility shift assays designate Sp1 or a highly related protein as binding to sites A-C in the MCAD promoter region. A, autoradiogram of the EMSA performed with a 32P-labeled site A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe.

Lanes 2-7 contained 100-fold molar excess unlabeled DNA competitor as denoted at the top: nonspecific (N), site A (S), Sp1, AP-2, nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), and myocyte nuclear factor (MNF) (see “Materials and Methods” for sequences). C, antibody gel mobility supershift with site A (A) or Sp1 consensus site (Sp1) oligonucleotide probes and Y-1 nuclear extract or purified recombinant Sp1 protein (one footprint unit).

Competition experiments were performed with unlabeled oligonucleotides containing consensus binding sites for factors known to bind GC-rich sequences including Sp1(11Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4596-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in an attempt to identify the transcription factor that binds sites A-C. Competition was observed only with the oligonucleotide containing an Sp1 binding consensus sequence (Fig. 3B and data not shown).To confirm that Sp1 or a related protein was contained in complexes I and II, antibody “supershift” experiments were performed with anti-Sp1 antibody and the Y-1 cell nuclear protein extract. Addition of anti-Sp1 antibody, but not pre-immune serum, resulted in a mobility supershift of complex I, confirming that Sp1 was present in this DNA:protein complex (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-3). Identical results were obtained with an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide probe and the Y-1 cell extract (Fig. 3C, lanes 4-6). Incubation of the site A probe with purified recombinant Sp1 formed a single complex that comigrated with complex I. In contrast to the partial supershift observed with the Y-1 nuclear extract, all of the DNA:recombinant Sp1 complex was supershifted by the anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 3C, lane 8). These data suggest either that the anti-Sp1 antibody does not recognize all forms of Sp1 present in complexes I and II or that other proteins participate in this DNA-protein interaction. Similar EMSA results were obtained using HepG2 and 3T3 cell-derived nuclear protein extracts with site A, B, and C probes (data not shown). Taken together, the transfection and DNA-protein binding studies indicate that Sp1 or a highly related transcription factor plays a major role in MCAD gene promoter function.Analysis of the DNA sequences of sites A-C reveals the presence of both typical and atypical Sp1 binding sites. Site C contains three sequences that match the known core Sp1 binding consensus (CCCGCCC, Fig. 1F). In contrast, sites A and B lack the Sp1 binding consensus but do contain several related sequences (CCCAGCC, CGCAGCG, and CCCTCCC) (Fig. 1F). Atypical Sp1 binding sites have been identified in promoters upstream of a variety of other genes, including those encoding the mouse secretory protease inhibitor P12(22Robidoux S. Gosselin P.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The wide variance in Sp1 binding site sequences may define diverse binding affinities necessary for competitive or synergistic interactions of Sp1 with other transcription factors. Alternatively, sequence-specific binding by related but distinct members of the Sp1 family may occur at sites A-C in vivo. In support of the latter possibility, several new Sp1 isoforms have recently been identified(23Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell.

These studies also demonstrated that additional unidentified COUP-TF-responsive element(s) are present in the MCAD gene promoter region downstream of NRRE-1.The DNase I protection studies shown here (Fig. 1) identified two additional MCAD promoter sites (NRRE-2 and NRRE-3) that contain hexamer sequences conforming to the known consensus (RG(G/T)TGNA) for binding to members of the thyroid/retinoid subgroup of the nuclear receptor superfamily (Fig. 1F). The DNA footprinting patterns suggested that these NRREs interact with multiple nuclear receptors in a cell line-specific and element-specific manner. We have shown previously that the orphan receptor HNF-4 present in nuclear extracts derived from HepG2 cells binds NRRE-1(15Carter M.E. Gulick T. Raisher B.D. Caira T. Ladias J.A. Moore D.D.

However, high NADPH oxidase activity was seen upon reconstitution of the cytochrome with either native FAD or 8-mercapto-FAD in the presence of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, 4:2:1:3:3 (w/w)). Their cell-free superoxide-generating activities were 40.5 and 35.5 mol/s/mol of heme, respectively, which corresponded to 70 and 61% of the original activity of the plasma membranes. Both flavins co-eluted with heme and protein on gel exclusion chromatography. The respective specific flavin content was 6.45 and 7.93 nmol/mg of protein and corresponded to a flavin:heme molar ratio of 0.41 and 0.51 consistent with a 2:1 ratio of heme to flavin. Mixing of 8-mercapto-FAD with flavin-depleted cytochrome b558 caused a red-shift of the flavin absorption maximum from 520 nm to around 560 nm, as has been seen when a variety of other apoflavoprotein dehydrogenases bind this analog. The 8-mercapto-FAD reconstituted into the cytochrome reacted readily with either iodoacetamide (k = 38.8 M−1·min−1) or iodoacetic acid (k = 12.1 M−1·min−1) to give a fluorescence spectrum characteristic of a 8-mercaptoflavin derivative, 8-SCH2CONH2 FAD or 8-SCH2COOH FAD.

Upon ingestion of microbes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (e.g. neutrophils) undergo a marked increase in oxygen consumption, a process referred to as the respiratory burst(1Segal A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 326: 88-91Google Scholar). Respiration is accompanied by oxidation of NADPH and generation of superoxide anion, a precursor of other antimicrobicidal oxidants. Activation of the burst is thought to require the assembly of cytosolic regulatory proteins with the plasma membrane-associated cytochrome, cytochrome b558. The membrane-bound cytochrome b558 consists of α- and β-subunits, with respective molecular masses of 22 and 91 kDa(2Nakamura M. Sendo S. van Zweiten R. Koga T. Roos D. Kanegasaki S.

It has long been assumed that the electron flow from NADPH through cytochrome and finally to oxygen must utilize a flavin moiety. This was based not only on chemical precedent, but also on early studies that showed that FAD could partially stabilize oxidase activity in detergent extracts from membranes of activated neutrophils(12Light D.R.

Supporting the idea of a separate FAD-component, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase purified from neutrophil membranes (25Nisimoto Y. Murakami-Otsuka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was able to form superoxide anion when combined with purified cytochrome b558 in the presence of phospholipids. However, the rate of O2-1 generation was low, undermining this interpretation. In addition, none of the other candidate flavoproteins have held up as good candidates for an exogenous oxidase-linked component. Recent evidence has suggested that the NADPH-interacting, FAD-binding moiety is cytochrome b558 itself.

Homology was also detected in the region of the FAD-isoalloxazine-binding site approximately 90 amino acids upstream of the NADPH-ribose-interacting site of the large subunit(27Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), but the homology was rather weak. Although the flavin is completely lost from the protein as the purification proceeds, it is possible to restore activity to either native or recombinant preparations of cytochrome b558 by incubating in the presence of phospholipids and FAD(26Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 27Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C.

Following such an incubation, FAD fluorescence comigrates with oxidase activity and heme absorption in gel exclusion chromatography(26Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytochrome b558 has been proposed to bind FAD and to contain all obligate electron transporting groups of the oxidase(30Tanaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kanegasaki S. Takagi Y. Makino R. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18717-18720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several chemically modified forms of flavins including 8-mercaptoflavin have been developed in recent years and have proven useful as active site probes of flavoproteins(32Massey V. Ghisla S. Moore E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9640-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7329-7337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While binding of FAD to apoflavoproteins typically produces small changes in the visible spectrum of the native flavin, binding generates a large red shift in the spectrum of 8-mercaptoflavin. In addition, this analog can be used to investigate the solvent accessibility of the protein-bound flavin (32Massey V. Ghisla S. Moore E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9640-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7329-7337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach exploits the chemical reactivity of the 8-SH group on the flavin and the large fluorescence change that occurs upon modification. In the present study, we have used 8-mercapto-FAD to probe the flavin binding site of cytochrome b558 as well as the solvent accessibility of the bound flavin. Cytochrome c (type VI), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis standards, NADPH, n-octyl glucoside, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone were from Sigma. GTPγS was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. HESSOL (6% hetastarch in 0.9% NaCl) was from Green Cross Co., and lymphocyte separation medium (LSM, 6.2% Ficoll plus 9.4% sodium diatrizoate) was obtained from American Critical Care Division of American Hospital Supply (McGaw Park, IL) and Biotics (Kensington, MD), respectively. Superoxide dismutase and dithiothreitol were from Wako Pure Chemical Co., and prestained molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were obtained from Bio-Rad. Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, and ω-aminooctyl-agarose were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. L-α-Phosphatidylcholine (bovine brain), L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (bovine brain), L-α-phosphatidylserine (bovine brain), L-α-phosphatidylinositol (bovine brain), and sphingomyelin (bovine erythrocyte) were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Human neutrophils were obtained from peripheral blood of normal healthy donors after obtaining informed consent. Erythrocytes were sedimented with HESSOL, and the mononuclear cells were removed from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation through lymphocyte separation medium(34Pember S.O. Barnes K.C. Brabdt S.J. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Blood. 1983; 61: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cells were greater than 95% neutrophilic granulocytes. Neutrophils were resuspended in buffer A (6 mM PIPES, pH 7.35, containing 60 mM KCl, 18 mM NaCl, 2.3 mM MgCl2, 1 μM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml TLCK, and 6% (w/w) sucrose). Membranes were prepared as described previously(25Nisimoto Y. Murakami-Otsuka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells (6 × 109) in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer A were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation after being pressurized at 500 p.s.i. for 25 min at 3°C(35Burnham D.N. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17550-17559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cavitate was centrifuged (800 × g, 5 min) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was loaded onto discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 50 and 30% sucrose in buffer A and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Plasma membrane and specific granule fractions were collected, and 5 volumes of relaxation buffer (10 mM PIPES, pH 7.35, containing 100 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, and 3.5 mM MgCl2) were added. The membrane suspension was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 1.5 h, and the pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer B (0.1 M Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml TLCK, 40 mMn-octyl glucoside, and 0.5% sodium cholate). The material was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for purification of cytochrome b558. Detergent-solubilized cytochrome b558 was purified by the method of Segal et al. (27Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The solubilized membrane fraction was passed through a mixed bed of DEAE-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, and ω-aminooctyl-agarose (1.6 ml bed volume of each), followed by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (2.36 ml bed volume). The columns were equilibrated and washed well with buffer B, and cytochrome b558 was adsorbed to the heparin-Sepharose. The latter was washed stepwise with 50 ml of buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl and then with 25 ml of buffer B containing 0.5 M NaCl, which eluted the cytochrome. These cytochrome b-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a desalting column (Excellulose GF-5, Pierce) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 μg/ml TLCK) to remove NaCl. Samples with specific heme contents greater than 14.3 nmol heme/mg protein were pooled and applied to a HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia) and the eluting heme-containing fractions were collected. The concentration of cytochrome b558 was determined by reduced-minus-oxidized absorbance difference spectroscopy or by directly measuring the oxidized absorbance spectrum (350 nm to 600 nm) on a Hitachi 156 dual beam scanning spectrophotometer, assuming a reduced-minus-oxidized Soret band (427-440 nm) extinction coefficient of 161 mM−1·cm−1 or an oxidized Soret band (414 nm) extinction coefficient of 131 mM−1·cm−1(36Lutter R. van Schaik M.L.J. van Zwieten R. Wever R. Roos D. Hamers M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2237-2244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled fractions had a heme content of 16.2 nmol/mg protein. Flavin was analyzed according to Nisimoto et al.(37Nisimoto Y. Murakami-Otsuka H. Iwata S. Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), using reverse phase HPLC with a fluorescence detector. FMN and FAD obtained from Sigma were purified by HPLC and used as the authentic standards. Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al.(38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA)(39Towbin J.H. Staehelin T. Cordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated at 25°C for 2 h in 4% skim milk in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.14 M NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl. Antibodies used were those to two synthetic peptides corresponding to the COOH termini of residues 175-195 of the small cytochrome subunit and 558-570 of the large cytochrome subunit, prepared as described in the previous paper(40Nisimoto Y. Murakami-Otsuka H. Iwata S. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After washing, the membrane was reacted with the antibodies (3.0 μg/ml) and then with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody (IgG, 1:5000 dilution) raised in goat. Antibodies were diluted with 20 mM phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% Tween 20, and each incubation was carried out for 1 h at 25°C. The Immobilon-P membrane was washed extensively 3 times with 20 mM phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (20 min each). The Western blots were stained for 15 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in 20 mM phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, containing 0.03% H2O2. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method by Rudolph and Krueger(41Rudolph S.A. Krueger B.K. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1979; 10: 107-133Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis for 2 h, the gels were stained with two-dimensional-silver stain II reagent (Daiichi Pure Chemical Co. Ltd.). Cell-free NADPH oxidase activity was assayed by measuring superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction. The assay was carried out in the absence and presence of exogeneous native or 8 mercapto-FAD in the final assay medium. The cell-free system consisted of cytochrome b558 (without or with added FAD or FAD analog) or plasma membrane, cytosol, phospholipids (PC/PE/PI/SM/cholesterol, 4:2:1:3:3 (w/w)), 10 μM GTPγS, and 0.25 mM arachidonate in 0.2 ml of medium A (10 mM PIPES, pH 7.45, containing 4 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaCl, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mM PMSF). This mixture was preincubated for 10 min at 25°C. At the end of the preincubation period, an aliquot (95 μl) of the preincubation mixture was employed for the assay of superoxide generation. Superoxide dismutase (80 μg) was added to the reference cuvette. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.2 mM NADPH (final) to 1 ml of assay medium containing 0.1 mM cytochrome c and 0.5 mg of phospholipids (PC/PE/PI/SM/cholesterol, 4:2:1:3:3 (w/w)). When plasma membrane (8.5 pmol as heme) was used, phospholipids were omitted from the assay mixture. An extinction coefficient of 18.5 mM−1·cm−1 at 550 nm was used to calculate the quantity of cytochrome c reduced (42Tauber A.J. Goetzl E.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5576-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Culture of B. ammoniagenes and enzyme purification were performed as in starting with 160 g of frozen cell paste(43Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16169-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The starting material, 8-chlororiboflavin(44Haley E.E. Lambooy J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 5093-5096Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was generously provided by Dr. Dale E. Edmondson, Emory University. This was converted to 8-chloro-FAD using partially purified FAD synthetase from B. ammoniagenes. 8-Chlororiboflavin (76.8 μM) was incubated in a final volume of 8.5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM ATP and 20 mM MgCl2, and the reaction was started by the addition of 2 ml of partially purified FAD synthetase. After reaction at 36°C for 12 h in the dark, an aliquot (15 μl) was removed and applied to thin-layer chromatography (Eastman Kodak Co., Chromagram, 13255 cellulose). The 8-chloro-FAD and unreacted 8-chlororiboflavin were identified on the thin-layer chromatography cellulose sheet by fluorescence detector. The total reaction mixture (10.5 ml) was then loaded onto a Bio-Gel P-2 column (5 × 60 cm). The first yellow band eluted was identified as 8-chloro-FAD by thin-layer chromatography using native FAD (RF value, 0.07) as a standard. The thin-layer chromatography was developed using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:2:2). The appropriate 8-mercapto-FAD was prepared just before use by reaction of 8-chloro-FAD, buffered at pH 8.0, with 5 mM Na2S. Excess unreacted sodium sulfide was removed by P-2 column (2 × 65 cm) chromatography. The course of the reaction was monitored at 520 nm and is accompanied by a color change from yellow to bright red. The resulting 8-mercapto-FAD was reasonably stable at pH 7.5 and was used immediately for the spectral and kinetic studies. Purified FAD-depleted cytochrome b558 (194 pmol heme/12 μg of protein) was incubated in 0.3 ml of 0.05 M Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.45, containing 0.05 M KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml TLCK (Buffer I) and 0.64 mg of phospholipids (PC/PE/PI/SM/cholesterol, 4:2:1:3:3 (w/w)) at 3°C for 3 h and then it was mixed with a 7.4-fold excess of either FAD or 8-mercapto-FAD. After keeping the mixture at 3°C for 12 h, it was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (12 × 200 mm) equilibrated with the Buffer I to separate FAD-reconstituted cytochrome b558 from excess free flavin. Cytochrome fractions showing high flavin fluorescence were pooled, and FAD was quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding of 8-mercapto-FAD to cytochrome b558 is also evidenced and determined by the measurement of absorption spectrum using the extinction coefficient of 30 mM−1·cm−1 for the FAD analog(32Massey V. Ghisla S. Moore E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9640-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pooled fractions were used for the assay of superoxide production by complementation with cytosol in the cell-free activation system. 8-SH FAD-reconstituted cytochrome b558 was used to investigate the chemical reactivity of position 8 of the flavin. The reconstituted cytochrome b558 contained 15.5 nmol of protoheme and 7.93 nmol of 8-SH FAD/mg of protein. If it is assumed that the heme and flavin-binding sites are 1 mol each/mol of protein (α plus β-subunits), the reflavination is 51% effective. If two or more hemes per FAD is assumed, as has been proposed(26Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 45Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), then reflavination is complete. Reaction with either iodoacetamide or iodoacetic acid was initiated by adding an aliquot of the reagent (0.1 M stock solution) to 0.2 ml of the 8-SH FAD-reconstituted cytochrome. In a control experiment, the thiol reagent was reacted with free 8-mercapto-FAD. The resulting fluorescence increase at 519 nm was monitored as the generation of 8-SCH2CONH2 FAD or 8-SCH2COOH FAD when excited at 473 nm. Since it appears that the reactions show a single second-order dependence of the observed rate (kobs) on reagent concentration, a one-step reaction between reagent and flavinated cytochrome b558 is considered. The reaction is expressed as follows. 8−SH FAD-cytochrome b558 →[CH2ICONH2]k8−SCH2CONH2 FAD-cytochrome b558 REACTION 1 In this reaction, the appearance of product (8-SCH2CONH2FAD-cytochrome b558) could be measured, and the second-order rate constant (k) was determined. Likewise, the cytochrome b558-bound FAD analog could react directly with iodoacetic acid, which has a negatively charged group, and simple second-order kinetics were also found. Upon analysis by silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 2) the purified cytochrome b558 showed a major band at 22 kDa and a diffuse major band at 90-95 kDa. The latter represents the glycosylated large subunit, which is known to behave in this manner. Two minor bands were also present at around 75 and 24 kDa, respectively. The two main protein bands were identified as the small and large subunits of cytochrome b558 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The antibody raised to the synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of the small subunit detected the 22 kDa band of cytochrome b558, whereas that raised to the synthetic COOH-terminal peptide of the large subunit gave diffuse staining around 92-kDa region and also appeared to stain the minor 75 kDa band, suggesting that the latter is a degradation (proteolysis or partial loss of carbohydrates) product of the large subunit. The reduced minus oxidized difference absorption spectrum of the purified preparation had absorption maxima at 427, 530, and 558 nm, which are characteristic of cytochrome b558 (data not shown). The final preparation eluted from an ion-exchange column (HiTrap Q) contained 16.2 nmol heme/mg of protein, but less than 0.01 nmol FAD/mg of protein. The superoxide-generating activity of the purified cytochrome b558 was initially measured in a cell-free assay system consisting of cytosol, arachidonate, and GTPγS with or without FAD in the assay mixture. In the presence of 5 μM FAD, the purified FAD-depleted cytochrome b558 showed low superoxide-generating activity (1.34 mol O2-/s/mol of cytochrome b558)(40Nisimoto Y. Murakami-Otsuka H. Iwata S. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but superoxide production was negligible in the absence of FAD (0.05 mol O2-/s/mol of cytochrome). These results confirm previous reports (26Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 27Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) that added flavin is required for superoxide generation. Flavin-depleted cytochrome b558 was also incubated with FAD or 8-SH FAD in the presence of phosphatidylcholine, and an aliquot was used for the assay for superoxide generation. In the presence of phospholipids and either FAD or 8-thio-FAD added to the cell-free assay, somewhat higher superoxide generation was seen. The highest value (11.7 mol/s/mol of cytochrome b558 seen with heme) was only 20% of that seen when native plasma membranes were used as the source of the intact cytochrome. 8-Mercapto-FAD exhibited almost the same ability to reconstitute superoxide-generating activity using this protocol. The low activity is incomplete probably due to in the reflavination of cytochrome b558 under these conditions or possibly due to dissociation of flavin upon dilution of the flavocytochrome in the assay mixture. However, high activity was observed when the reconstitution was carried out in the presence of PC/PE/PI/SM/cholesterol (4:2:1:3:3 (w/w)). Koshkin and Pick (45Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 46Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that purified cytochrome b558 exhibits varying levels of O2--producing activity depending upon the nature of phospholipids serving for lipidation and flavination. Our present studies confirm that binding of flavin to cytochrome b558 is affected by the composition of phospholipids. Flavin-depleted cytochrome b558 was incubated with phospholipids (PC/PE/PI/SM/cholesterol, 4:2:1:3:3 (w/w)) and either native FAD or 8-mercapto-FAD as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and then subjected to gel filtration to separate flavin-bound cytochrome from free flavin (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). An initial peak of flavin fluorescence coeluted with the purified cytochrome b558, which migrated identically in the absence of added flavin (Fig. 2C). In the absence of the cytochrome, but with all other components present (Fig. 2D), the early eluting peak of flavin fluorescence was not detected. The weak fluorescence seen in the first peak of Figs. 2, C and D, was not due to flavin but to scat"
https://openalex.org/W2078582432,"Modification of aspartic acid 369 in the sheep α1 Na+,K+-ATPase to asparagine results in a membrane-associated form of Na+,K+-ATPase that can bind [3H]ouabain with high affinity in the presence of Mg2+ alone (KD = 20.4 ± 2.6 nM). Ouabain binding to the D369N mutant is not stimulated by inorganic phosphate, confirming that Asp369 is both the catalytic phosphorylation site and the only Pi interaction site which stimulates ouabain binding. Cation inhibition of Mg2+-stimulated ouabain binding to the D369N mutant demonstrated that three Na+ and two K+ ions inhibit [3H]ouabain binding and suggests that this inhibition must occur via a cation-sensitive conformational change which does not directly involve dephosphorylation of the enzyme. In the presence of 10 mM Mg2+, ATP stimulates ouabain binding to the wild type protein, (AC50 = 21.4 ± 2.7 μM) but inhibits the binding to the D369N mutant (IC50 = 2.52 ± 0.17 μM) indicating that the mutation does not destroy the high affinity site for MgATP but does change the nature of the protein conformation normally induced by a nucleotide-Na+,K+-ATPase interaction. Increasing the Mg2+ from 1 to 10 mM did not alter the AC50 or IC50 values for ATP and reveals that the Mg2+ interaction which stimulates ouabain binding in the absence of nucleotide involves a distinct divalent cation site not associated with the binding of the magnesium-nucleotide complex. Thus, altering the catalytic phosphorylation site of Na+,K+-ATPase does not affect the expression of the ouabain-sensitive protein in the membrane fraction of NIH 3T3 cells and does not disrupt the binding of Na+, K+, Mg2+, ouabain, or ATP to the enzyme. However, the D369N substitution does inhibit the formation of a nucleotide-protein complex with high affinity for ouabain.

The Na+,K+-ATPase is a member of a class of active cation transporters which form a characteristic β-aspartyl phosphate intermediate during the ATP hydrolysis/ion translocation cycle. Amino acid replacement of this conserved aspartic acid residue in the Na+,K+-ATPase and in related active cation transporters results in complete loss of cation transport (1-3). This loss of cation transport was attributed to either loss of ATPase activity (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22223-22227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to loss of ATPase activity, this amino acid replacement in the Na+,K+-ATPase expressed in oocytes was reported to abolish cardiac glycoside binding to the exterior surface of these cells(2Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 157-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cardiac glycosides (such as ouabain) specifically inhibit the Na+,K+-ATPase through a mechanism which is not completely understood. The affinity of the Na+,K+-ATPase for ouabain is closely linked to enzyme cycling as demonstrated by the effects of enzyme substrates on the protein-drug interaction. For example, Mg2+ and inorganic phosphate (Pi) stimulate ouabain binding in the absence of monovalent cations (4Hansen O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1984; 36: 143-163PubMed Google Scholar, 5Erdmann E. Schoner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Mg2+ and ATP stimulate ouabain binding in the presence of Na+(6Askari A. Kakar S.S. Huang W. J.

Mg2+ alone increases the affinity of the ATPase for ouabain ≥300-fold over Tris buffer alone(8Wallick E.T. Pitts B.J.R. Lane L.K. Schwartz A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on this substrate-dependent affinity of the enzyme for ouabain, it has been established that the interaction site for Pi and ATP which stimulates ouabain binding is the conserved catalytic phosphorylation site(9Post R.L. Kume S. Tobin T. Orcutt B. Sen A.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 306s-326sCrossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 10Post R.L. Toda G. Rogers F.N. J. Biol.

Moreover, although ATP and Pi increase the enzyme's affinity for ouabain an additional 10- and 20-fold, respectively, over magnesium alone, Mg2+ appears to be the essential element for high affinity ouabain binding. In this work the conserved aspartic acid residue (Asp369) was replaced with an uncharged amino acid, asparagine, in the ouabain-sensitive sheep α1 isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase. The mutant protein was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells which contain a relatively ouabain-insensitive endogenous isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase. In this system, [3H]ouabain binding can be utilized as a highly specific probe for the exogenous protein, even though the mutant D369N is inactive(14Johnson C.L. Kuntzweiler T.A. Lingrel J.B.

The purpose of this study was to determine if D369N is expressed in NIH 3T3 cells in a form which can bind ouabain and to decipher whether the amino acid substitution alters the mechanism by which ligands (Na+, K+, Mg2+, ATP, and ADP) regulate the binding of ouabain. Companies from which reagents were purchased were previously reported(15Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B J. Biol.

The specific radioactivity of [3H]ouabain was determined by the method of Wallick and Schwartz(1988)(18Wallick E.T. Schwartz A.

Acta. 1982; 719: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were all performed using methods previously described. All ouabain binding studies were conducted under the following conditions unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends or text: 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The amount of protein used was typically 50 μg of total protein/assay tube, depending on the specific activity of the individual membrane preparation. The affinities for ouabain of both the D369N and the wild type proteins under phosphate-free conditions were determined using unlabeled ouabain in a self-competition assay with [3H]ouabain (See Equation 1, Ref. 16Johnson C.L. Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Johnson C.G. Wallick E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The apparent KD for wild type sheep α1 was calculated to be ≈50 nM while the D369N protein had a KD for ouabain of ≈20 nM. For the competition curves with unlabeled ouabain, eight concentrations of unlabeled ouabain (including zero) were examined in triplicate (Fig. 3). Ligand stimulation or inhibition of [3H]ouabain binding was characterized using at least 11 concentrations (including zero) of each ligand in duplicate. To optimize the determinations of the different ATPase-ligand interactions, the concentration of [3H]ouabain utilized was approximately equal to the ouabain KD values calculated for each protein. Aliquots of each reaction mixture (50 μl) were taken with each experiment to determine the exact concentration of [3H]ouabain utilized. The samples were filtered, and radioactivity analyzed as described previously(16Johnson C.L. Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Johnson C.G. Wallick E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Data describing the competition of [3H]ouabain with unlabeled ouabain was fit to the self-competition model as described previously(16Johnson C.L. Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Johnson C.G. Wallick E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Pi, Mg2+, Na+, K+, ATP, and ADP data were fit to a four parameter logistic function for either stimulation of binding: {[(Bmax - Bmin)/(1 + (AC50/x)n)] + Bmin} or inhibition of binding: {[(Bmax - Bmin)/(1 + (x/IC50)n)] + Bmin}. Bmax and Bmin represent the maximum and minimum amounts of bound [3H]ouabain, respectively. n represents the approximate number of ligands responsible for the inhibition or activation of [3H]ouabain binding, a factor which is similar to a Hill coefficient. The AC50 or IC50 value is the concentration of ligand which produces 50% of the activation or inhibition, respectively. x is the concentration of inhibiting or stimulating ligand (i.e. Pi, Mg2+, Na+, K+, or nucleotide). All data analysis was done using the KaleidaGraph program by Abelbeck Software. Initially, these experiments were designed to directly address whether a mutant form of Na+,K+-ATPase in which the catalytic phosphorylation site was altered could be stably expressed and could bind ouabain with high affinity. To this end, the sequence encoding the amino acid replacement D369N was introduced into two cDNAs: one which encodes a ouabain-resistant form of Na+,K+-ATPase (sheep α1(RD))1( 1The abbreviations used are: sheep α1(RD)sheep α1 isoform modified to a ouabain-resistant protein with the following amino acid substitutions: Q111R and N122D (37Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)Na+,K+-ATPasesodium and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphataseG418geneticin, a neomycin analog. )and a second which encodes a ouabain-sensitive form of Na+,K+-ATPase (sheep α1). The mutant sheep α1(RD) cDNA was transfected into HeLa cells and grown in the presence of 1 μM ouabain. In this expression system, only the exogenous ouabain-resistant Na+,K+-ATPase can support cell viability. Thus, if a mutation impairs the functional activity of the exogenous Na+,K+-ATPase, no transfected HeLa cells will survive the ouabain selection. No ouabain resistant colonies were observed for the D369N mutant (data not shown) and thus confirmed that this amino acid replacement disrupts ATPase activity presumably by inhibiting the formation of the β-aspartyl-phosphorylated intermediate as previously suggested by Ohtsubo et al.(2Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 157-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). sheep α1 isoform modified to a ouabain-resistant protein with the following amino acid substitutions: Q111R and N122D (37Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sodium and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase geneticin, a neomycin analog. The mutated sheep α1 cDNA which encodes the D369N amino acid substitution in a ouabain-sensitive form of Na+,K+-ATPase was cotransfected into 3T3 cells with a plasmid encoding a neomycin resistance protein. The transfected 3T3 cells were grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (a neomycin analog), and G418-resistant colonies were isolated. This expression system does not require that the exogenous Na+,K+-ATPase be functionally capable of supporting cell viability. Immunological detection was utilized to screen the isolated cell lines for expression of sheep α1 protein. Three clonal cell lines which expressed the sheep α1 proteins were expanded, and crude membranes were prepared using NaI treatment. Twenty μg of total protein from these membrane preparations (as determined by a Lowry assay) were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The M7-PB-E8 monoclonal antibody grown against sheep kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (23Ball Jr., W.J. Kirley T.L. Lane L.K. MethodsEnzymol. 1988; 156: 87-101Google Scholar) was used to probe the exogenously expressed sheep α1 protein without cross-reacting with the endogenous mouse protein from 3T3 cells (Fig. 1). A single band of protein migrating at a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa was detected by the monoclonal antibody in the stable transfectants but not in untransfected 3T3 cells. Several membrane preparations of two clonal cell lines transfected with either the D369N cDNA or the wild type cDNA showed relatively high expression levels of sheep α1 protein and were utilized in the ouabain binding experiments. To test for additional phosphate interaction sites which might stimulate ouabain binding, [3H]ouabain binding to both the expressed wild type sheep α1 and the D369N mutant protein was measured at 23 concentrations of inorganic phosphate ranging from 0 to 30 mM. A portion of the curve defining this Pi effect is displayed in Fig. 2. No stimulation of [3H]ouabain binding was observed for the mutant D369N for Pi concentrations up to 30 mM. Pi stimulation of the wild type sheep α1 displayed a half-maximum stimulation (AC50) of 0.12 ± 0.02 mM Pi, which is identical to the value previously reported(15Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2993-3000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with this aspartic acid at position 369 in the sheep α1 isoform being the only interaction site for inorganic phosphate which stimulates ouabain binding as well as being the site of β-aspartyl phosphorylation during the enzymatic cycle(24Walderhaug M.O. Post R.L. Saccomani G. Leonard R.T. Briskin D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3852-3859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+ alone, both the wild type sheep α1 protein and the D369N mutant protein were able to bind [3H]ouabain present in nanomolar concentrations. This is demonstrated clearly at 0 mM Pi in Fig. 2, keeping in mind that nonspecific binding (NS) represents a value which is less than 10% of the total amount bound (wild type, NS = 0.0126 ± 0.0006 nM and D369N, NS = 0.0049 ± 0.0002 nM as determined from unlabeled ouabain self-competition data). This observation suggested that the affinity of both proteins for ouabain is relatively high in the presence of Mg2+ alone and that [3H]ouabain binding could be utilized as a probe for these expressed proteins. In order to determine the KD values characterizing these protein-drug interactions, competition curves were carried out in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris-Cl using [3H]ouabain and unlabeled ouabain. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the competition curves for one membrane preparation of D369N and of the wild type protein. The mean KD values obtained for three different preparations of each protein are presented in Table I. In the presence of 5 mM Mg2+, the affinity of the wild type sheep α1 protein for ouabain is 34-fold lower than the affinity in the presence of Pi and Mg2+ (KD = 1.53 ± 0.08 nM, 5 mM Pi, and 5 mM Mg2+(15Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2993-3000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). This increase in apparent KD for ouabain caused by the absence of Pi is similar to the 23-fold increase previously calculated from rate constants observed for purified sheep Na+,K+-ATPase(8Wallick E.T. Pitts B.J.R. Lane L.K. Schwartz A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+ alone, the mutant D369N displayed a 2.5-fold higher affinity for ouabain compared to the wild type protein. The high affinity of D369N for ouabain is evidence that the ouabain interaction site on the mutant (presumably involving the extracellular surface of the protein) has not been markedly altered compared to the wild type protein.TABLE IApparent binding constants for protein-ligand interactions Open table in a new tab To maximize the accuracy of the calculated KD values for all ligands, all competition curves characterizing the wild type protein were done in the presence of approximately 60 nM [3H]ouabain, and those describing the D369N mutant were done in the presence of approximately 20 nM [3H]ouabain. The observed nonspecific binding is primarily due to [3H]ouabain binding to the glass fiber filters and is essentially independent of the enzyme concentration employed. The maximum level of [3H]ouabain bound to the membranes is dependent on the expression levels of the exogenous proteins and differs slightly between membrane preparations. To ensure that the Mg2+ site(s) on these proteins were saturated at 5 mM Mg2+, activation of [3H]ouabain binding to the Na+,K+-ATPase was examined with respect to Mg2+ concentrations (data not shown). In previous studies, an apparent AC50 value for Mg2+ stimulation of ouabain binding to the wild type protein was determined to be 0.20 ± 0.03 mM in the presence of 5 mM Pi and 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4)(15Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2993-3000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the absence of Pi, the apparent AC50 value for Mg2+ stimulation of ouabain binding to the wild type Na+,K+-ATPase is increased 3.6-fold to 0.71 mM (Table I). The AC50 value for Mg2+ stimulation of ouabain binding in the absence of Pi to the D369N mutant (0.12 mM) is 5.9-fold lower than that of the wild type. The Mg2+ AC50 values and n values shown in are averages of three experiments done in duplicate on three separate membrane preparations of two clones for each protein. Although the cause for the alterations in the Mg2+ AC50 values are not completely understood, it appears that 5 mM Mg2+ provides an excess of divalent cation such that all detectable Mg2+ activation sites are occupied in the absence of additional ligands. Therefore, the changes in the amount of [3H]ouabain bound at various inhibitor concentrations (i.e. unlabeled ouabain, Na+ or K+, in the upcoming experiments) reflect protein inhibitor (ligand) interactions and are not a direct result of unoccupied Mg2+ sites on the protein. It is interesting to note that the number of Mg2+ interactions (n) which stimulate ouabain binding to the two proteins were calculated to be greater than one and may be an indication that at least two Mg2+ activation sites are located on the Na+,K+-ATPase. Ouabain binding stimulated by either Mg2+ and Pi or by Mg2+, Na+, and ATP is antagonized by the addition of K+ to the equilibrium medium (4, 6). Presumably, K+ induces a conformational change in the Na+,K+-ATPase such that the resulting form of the protein has a lower affinity for ouabain. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, K+ also inhibits ouabain binding in the presence of Mg2+ alone. The average apparent IC50 and the pseudo-Hill coefficient (n) for K+ determined from four separate membrane preparations of each cell line are presented in. The D369N mutant demonstrates a 3-fold lower AC50 value for K+ compared to the wild type protein under Pi-free conditions. Thus, it appears that the two K+ inhibition sites previously observed in the presence of Mg2+ and Pi(14Johnson C.L. Kuntzweiler T.A. Lingrel J.B. Johnson C.G. Wallick E.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 308PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2993-3000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Johnson C.L. Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Johnson C.G. Wallick E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) can be probed on the wild type sheep α1 protein in the presence of Mg2+ alone, and these K+ sites remain intact in the D369N mutant form of the sheep α1 protein. Unlike K+, Na+ stimulates ouabain binding in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP and antagonizes ouabain binding in the presence of Mg2+ and Pi (4-7). In the presence of Mg2+ alone, Na+ induces a conformational change in the wild type Na+,K+-ATPase and the D369N mutant protein which reduces the affinities of the proteins for ouabain. In Fig. 5, examples of the inhibitory effects of Na+ on Mg2+-stimulated [3H]ouabain binding are displayed. These inhibition data were fit to a four parameter logistic function (see “Experimental Procedures”). The average IC50 and n values for Na+ of at least three trials on two clones are presented in. In the absence of Na+, MgATP was shown to stimulate ouabain binding to purified Na+,K+-ATPase by increasing the on-rate for ouabain and in turn decreasing the KD for the drug (8Wallick E.T. Pitts B.J.R. Lane L.K. Schwartz A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have utilized this stimulatory effect to determine if the MgATP site has remained intact in the D369N mutant. To avoid the inhibitory effects of Na+ on Mg2+-stimulated [3H]ouabain binding and to limit the amount of ATP hydrolysis due to ATPase turnover in the wild type protein, no Na+ was added to these equilibrium studies. As shown in Fig. 6A, addition of MgATP stimulated ouabain binding in the wild type protein both at 1 mM Mg2+ and 10 mM Mg2+. Average AC50 values for three preparations at both concentrations of Mg2+ are shown in. As shown in Fig. 6B, MgATP inhibits the Mg2+-stimulated ouabain binding to the D369N mutant in the presence of either 1 or 10 mM Mg2+. Average IC50 values are summarized in for three membrane preparations of the mutant D369N. This MgATP induced effect demonstrates that a high affinity ATP-binding site exists on the D369N mutant protein and suggests that the cytoplasmic loop in which the amino acid replacement is located resembles the wild type protein and specifically binds ATP with high affinity. To determine if the MgATP-induced stimulation of ouabain binding in the wild type protein is a result of nucleotide binding or a result of enzyme phosphorylation, MgADP was used to mimic simple nucleotide binding in the absence of Na+. As shown in Fig. 6C, like MgATP, MgADP stimulates ouabain binding in the wild type protein and inhibits ouabain binding in the D369N mutant. Average AC50 and IC50 values for three experiments using two clonal cell lines for each protein are shown in. It is apparent that the nucleotide-induced conformational change normally observed as an increase in the affinity of the Na+,K+-ATPase for ouabain cannot occur if the aspartic acid residue at position 369 is altered to an asparagine. Previous mutagenesis studies involving this conserved aspartic acid residue in other P-type ATPases have demonstrated the loss of cation transport and phosphorylation upon amino acid replacement(2Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 157-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, this mutant protein (D351N) was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and was characterized as impaired with respect to Ca2+ transport and ATP-stimulated formation of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate(25Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). When a similar amino acid substitution was introduced in the yeast H+-ATPase, the protein processing of the mutant was thought to be interrupted such that no protein was detected in the secretory vesicles of the yeast expression system(3Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the yeast H+-ATPase, but similar to the SR Ca2+-ATPase, Na+,K+-ATPase in which the essential aspartyl residue has been replaced can be expressed in 3T3 cells as shown here and in oocytes as demonstrated by Ohtsubo et al.(2Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 157-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both the immunological analysis and the presence of a ouabain-sensitive protein in the isolated membrane fraction of transfected 3T3 cells is direct evidence for the expression of the mutant protein. The interaction between the D369N mutant and ouabain suggests that the extracellular surface of the mutant resembles the wild type protein while the MgATP-D369N interaction shows the structural integrity of the cytoplasmic domain of the mutant. These data are consistent with the D369N mutant being expressed in a membrane of the 3T3 cells with an overall protein structure which is similar to the wild type sheep α1 Na+,K+-ATPase. In order to unequivocally determine if the D369N protein is assembled into the plasma membrane of the 3T3 cells, one must probe the extracellular surface of the intact transfected cells either with a monoclonal antibody or with a specific extracellular probe (i.e. ouabain). Due to the lack of an available monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular surface of the sheep α1 protein, whole cell ouabain binding was utilized to examine if the mutant was located in the plasma membrane. No [3H]ouabain binding was detected when intact 3T3 cells expressing the D369N mutant were incubated with the radioligand (data not presented). Ouabain binding to intact 3T3 cells is regulated by the presence of intracellular MgATP and subsequent intracellular Na+ binding. Both of these substrates, MgATP and Na+, when added independently (Figure 5:, Figure 6:B) or together (data not presented) were shown to inhibit Mg2+-stimulated ouabain binding in the studies employing membrane fragments from 3T3 cells expressing the D369N mutant. Thus, due to the presence of these intracellular components in the intact 3T3 cells, it was not surprising that ouabain did not bind to the extracellular surface of whole cells expressing the D369N mutant. Whether or not the D369N mutant is present in the plasma membrane of 3T3 cells or oocytes(2Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 157-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), our ouabain binding data on isolated membrane preparations does explain why ouabain interactions with whole cells expressing the D369N mutant may not have been observed. This work suggests that phosphate interaction at the catalytic phosphorylation site, aspartic acid 369 in the sheep α1 isoform, induces a conformational change in the Na+,K+-ATPase which increases the affinity of the enzyme for ouabain. Thus, catalytic ATPase activity and ouabain binding are linked through this phosphorylation site which supports the use of [3H]ouabain binding as a method for probing the functional sites of Na+,K+-ATPase. In addition, this double role for aspartic acid 369 contradicts the theory that phosphate interactions at a second site on Na+,K+-ATPase increase the affinity of the enzyme for ouabain(26Tobin T. Sen A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Skou J.C. Butler K.W. Hansen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 241: 443-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Models for the mechanism of Na+,K+-ATPase have been proposed in which the chemical moieties associated with position 369 (i.e. aspartyl group or covalently bound phosphate) act as binding sites for the transported Na+ and K+ ions, directly linking the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate with cation transport(28Grisham C.M. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3187-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cavieres J.D. Ellory J.C. Lew V.L. Membrane Transport in Red Cells. Academic Press, New York1977: 1-37Google Scholar). From the data presented here, three Na+ and two K+ ions interact with the Na+,K+-ATPase when both of these moieties are removed either by site-directed mutagenesis or simply by eliminating Pi from the equilibrium medium. Thus, assuming that the cation sites which inhibit ouabain binding are also the cation transport sites, it does not appear that either of these chemical groups are directly associated with the binding of the monovalent cations being transported. Many investigators have questioned whether a phosphorylated intermediate form of the Na+,K+-ATPase is necessary for ouabain binding(30Plesner I.W. Plesner L. Norby J.G. Klodos I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 643: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Schwartz A. Matsui H. Laughter A.H. Science. 1968; 160: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Matsui H. Schwartz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Albers R.W. Koval G.C. Siegel G.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1968; 4: 324-336PubMed Google Scholar). Conclusions from these investigations have been met with some skepticism due to the possibility that contaminating inorganic phosphate promotes phosphoenzyme formation. No phosphoenzyme was present in the D369N studies presented here due not only to the absence of added inorganic phosphate but also due to the alteration of the catalytic phosphorylation site. Thus, our data unequivocally demonstrate that a phosphorylated Asp369 site is not required for ouabain binding to the Na+,K+-ATPase. Proposed models for the inhibitory effects of Na+ and K+ on the ouabain binding properties of Na+,K+-ATPase often postulate cation stabilization and destabilization of the phosphorylated intermediate (10, 13). Although our results do not discount these effects of monovalent cations on phosphoenzyme formation, our studies suggest that this is not the only mechanism by which Na+ and K+ affect the ouabain binding properties of the ATPase. The cation inhibition experiments involving the D369N mutant (Fig. 4 and 5) had no phosphoenzyme present due to the absence of added Pi and substitution of the catalytic phosphorylation site. Thus, the Na+ inhibition and K+ inhibition of ouabain binding to the D369N protein are due to cation-induced conformational changes in the protein and cannot directly reflect the cation effects on the phosphoenzyme intermediate. The importance of Mg2+ in active cation transport by Na+,K+-ATPase was recognized in the original characterization of this protein by Skou(34Skou J.C. Biochim. Biohpys. Acta. 1960; 255: 9852-9859Google Scholar). Subsequent to these studies, both kinetic analysis and physical chemical studies have suggested that Mg2+ interacts with the Na+,K+-ATPase at two distinct sites. The first site is observed in the presence of nucleotide and is thought to be a site related to the binding of MgATP. This site demonstrates a Km for Mg2+ of 5 μM as measured by ATP-ADP exchange in the presence of 125 mM Na+, 5 mM ATP, and 1.25 mM [14C]ADP(35Swann A.C. Albers R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 523: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The second Mg2+ site is a separate divalent cation site. This site displays a Km for Mg2+ of 1-3 mM and is observed in the absence of nucleotide and Na+ in para-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis, Mn2+ competition, and Rb+ release experiments (28, 35, 36). Mg2+ binding to the distinct divalent cation site is thought to induce a conformation in Na+,K+-ATPase characterized by a high affinity for Pi and K+ and a lower affinity for Na+(36Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11116-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the affinity of this distinct divalent cation site for Mg2+ is increased 10-fold in the presence of Pi(36Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11116-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Mg2+ interaction with the low affinity site on the wild type Na+,K+-ATPase induces a protein conformation with a high affinity for ouabain. This hypothesis is based on three characteristics of the Mg2+-wild type interaction. First, the AC50 value calculated for Mg2+ stimulation of ouabain binding was 0.71 mM, similar to the Km value which characterizes this low affinity site(28Grisham C.M. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3187-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Swann A.C. Albers R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 523: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11116-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, this AC50 value was decreased approximately 3.5-fold in the presence of Pi, consistent with the effect of Pi on this low affinity site observed with a 86Rb-release technique(36Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11116-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, ouabain binding to the wild type protein was stimulated further upon formation of a E-MgATP complex (Fig. 6A). The absence of a Mg2+-induced shift in this MgATP stimulation of ouabain binding demonstrates that the two Mg2+ interactions are not directly competitive on the wild type Na+,K+-ATPase. These data support the theory that the stimulation of ouabain binding observed in the presence of Mg2+ alone is promoted by Mg2+ interacting at a divalent cation site distinct from the MgATP site. MgATP inhibited Mg2+-induced ouabain binding in the D369N mutant suggesting that the D369N●MgATP complex has a reduced affinity for ouabain. The IC50 value for MgATP was approximately 2 μM indicative of a high affinity ATP site in this mutant form of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Thus, although Mg2+ can interact with the D369N mutant to form an enzyme complex with a high affinity for ouabain, neither MgATP nor Pi can induce a conformation in the D369N mutant which displays a higher affinity for ouabain. Similar to the wild type protein, the absence of a Mg2+-induced shift in the MgATP inhibition curve implies that the Mg2+ site which stimulates ouabain binding and the MgATP site are kinetically distinct. In addition, the dramatically different effects of Mg2+ and MgATP association with the D369N protein suggest that the binding sites for Mg2+ and MgATP are mechanistically distinct. Similar to the effects of MgATP, MgADP stimulated ouabain binding in the wild type protein and inhibited binding to D369N (Fig. 6C). The similarity between the effects of MgATP and MgADP suggests that the difference in nucleotide-induced conformational changes between the two enzymes is not a direct result of the inability of D369N to form a phosphorylated intermediate but may be a direct result of magnesium-nucleotide binding to the protein. The different characteristics induced by MgATP interactions with the wild type●Mg2+ complex and the D369N●Mg2+ complex suggest that the charged character of this aspartic acid is required to induce an enzyme complex with high affinity for ouabain in the presence of nucleotide. Therefore, we suggest that D369N is inhibited both by its inability to form a β-aspartyl-phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and by its inability to undergo the normal conformational change induced by the binding of a magnesium-nucleotide complex. However, the tight association of MgATP to D369N demonstrates that the nucleotide-binding site of Na+,K+-ATPase is not destroyed by the amino acid substitution. In future structural investigations, the mutant D369N may serve as a stable model of the Na+,K+-ATPase in which the ligand-binding sites can be probed without the effects of varying turnover numbers altering calculated affinity constants."

These coefficients characterize the traceability of specific hydrogens in the products (ethanol and water) to their parent hydrogens in the starting materials (glucose and water). In conditions of complete transformation, they also enable intermolecular exchanges with the water medium to be estimated. Thus it is directly confirmed that hydrogens 1, 2, 6, and 6′ of glucose are strongly connected to the methyl site I of ethanol obtained by fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, whereas hydrogens 6 and 6′ are transferred to a great extent, transfer is only partial for hydrogen 2, and it is even less for hydrogen 1. Because the two moieties of glucose corresponding to carbons 1-2-3 and 4-5-6 are scrambled by the aldolase and triose-phosphate isomerase reactions, additional exchange of hydrogens at positions 1 and 2 must have occurred before these steps. The value of the coefficient that relates site 2 of glucose to site I of ethanol in particular can be used to quantify the contribution of intermolecular exchange occurring in the course of the transfer from site 2 of glucose 6-phosphate to site 1 of fructose 6-phosphate mediated by phosphoglucoisomerase. The average hydrogen isotope effects associated with the transfer of hydrogen from the water pool to the methyl or methylene site of ethanol are estimated. In contrast to conventional experiments carried out in strongly deuterium-enriched media where metabolic switching may occur, the NMR investigation of site-specific natural isotope fractionation, which operates at tracer isotopic abundance, faithfully describes the unperturbed metabolic pathways.

Bollum F.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). β-Pol enzymatic activity and mRNA are expressed at a relatively low level and are independent of cell growth and cell cycle stage (Chang and Bollum, 1972Chang L.M.S.

The promoters of the human, bovine, and rodent β-pol genes have been cloned and characterized. The promoters are G + C-rich and have binding cis-elements for initiation site-binding protein(s) and two well known transcriptional activators, Sp1 and ATF/CREB, within a core promoter of ~100 base pairs 5′ of the mRNA start site (Widen et al., 1988Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Widen and Wilson, 1991Widen S.G. Wilson S.H.

These promoters lack typical TATA or CCAAT elements. In the human promoter, the palindromic sequence GTGACGTCAC at −40 to −49 upstream of the transcription start site is a typical activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element (ATF/CRE). This element, which was found to be essential for human β-pol promoter activity in transient expression experiments (Widen and Wilson, 1991Widen S.G. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6296-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), mediates protein kinase A-dependent stimulation of the cloned promoter in CHO cells (Englander and Wilson, 1992aEnglander E.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The element also mediates stimulation of the cloned promoter after treatment of CHO cells with MNNG (Kedar et al., 1991Kedar P.S. Widen S.G. Englander E.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. Wilson S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3729-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this up-regulation was not seen in genetically altered CHO cells deficient in protein kinase A activity, indicating that this particular signal transduction pathway is required for the response to MNNG (Englander and Wilson, 1992aEnglander E.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Englander and Wilson, 1992bEnglander E.W. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5527-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The β-pol core promoter is up-regulated by expression of the activated Harvey p21ras protein (Kedar et al., 1990Kedar P.S. Lowy D.R. Widen S.G. Wilson S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3852-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that activation of the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway may also be important in β-pol gene expression. However, the cloned β-pol promoter does not have functional binding sites for the transcriptional activator AP-1, a principal protein kinase C pathway target for transcriptional regulation (Widen et al., 1988Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the proposed mechanism of up-regulation of the so-called DNA damage-inducible and oxidative stress-responsive genes by protein kinase C stimulation with TPA (Macfarlane and Manzel, 1994Macfarlane D.E. Manzel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4327-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Stevenson et al., 1994Stevenson M.A. Polock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of AP-1. In this case, treatment of cells with TPA stimulates the DNA binding activity of AP-1 by dephosphorylation of the c-Jun subunit; thus, protein kinase C activation appears to lead to elevation of a protein phosphatase activity and dephosphorylation of c-Jun's phosphorylation sites at residues 227 and 252 (Boyle et al., 1991Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). It also has been found that TPA treatment can directly stimulate members of the ATF/CREB superfamily of transcriptional activator; for example, ATF-2 (Zu et al., 1993Zu Y-L. Maekawa T. Nomura N. Nakata T. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2749-2758PubMed Google Scholar) is stimulated due to phosphorylation by protein kinase C at Ser-340 and Ser-367, within the DNA-binding domain (Sakurai et al., 1991Sakurai A. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Ishii S. Kishimoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present investigation was undertaken to examine the idea that the response of a mammalian DNA repair gene (β-pol) to DNA alkylation damage may be regulated by the growth factor/protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Several growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor BB (Graves et al., 1993Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (Arteaga et al., 1994Arteaga C.L. Winnier A.R. Poirier M.C. Lopez-Larraza D.M. Shawver L.K. Hurd S.D. Stewart S.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3758-3765PubMed Google Scholar), are known to activate protein kinase C and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in their signal transduction process. The growth factor/protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade has recently been found to be antagonistic against the protein kinase A signal transduction system in CHO cells, rat adipocytes (Sevetson et al., 1993Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and in human aortic smooth muscle cells (Graves et al., 1993Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, protein kinase C involvement in regulating β-pol transcription could have implications for the DNA damage-induced response in β-pol level. We found an induction of β-pol level in CHO cells after treatment with either MNNG or TPA alone. These two agents, however, when used in combination were mutually antagonistic. These interesting results are discussed in the context of DNA damage-induced regulation of a DNA repair gene and the potential for modulation of this regulation by the protein kinase C signal transduction system. Recombinant rat β-pol was purified from Escherichia coli RR1 (pRK 248clts, pRC-Rβ1) as described by Kumar et al.(1990). The molecular mass of the β-pol protein was ~39 kDa, as expected from the open reading frame in the cDNA from mammalian sources (SenGupta et al., 1986SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B.Z. Kumar P. Cobianchi F. Skowronski J. Wilson S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; Zmudzka et al., 1986Zmudzka B.Z. SenGupta D. Matsukage A. Cobianchi F. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The concentrations of stock solutions of β-pol were calculated from ultraviolet absorbance values using the molar absorption coefficient ϵ280 = 2.12 × 104M-1 cm-1. Large-scale digestion of β-pol with trypsin was carried out in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by the procedure of Kumar et al.(1990). This digestion generated 31-, 27-, and 8-kDa fragments of β-pol. By changing the concentration of trypsin to a substrate:enzyme ratio of 10:1 (w/w), two more fragments of 10- and 12-kDa were produced from the 27-kDa domain.2( 2D. K. Srivastava and S. H. Wilson, unpublished observations.) These fragments, along with overexpressed 16/18-kDa peptides of β-pol, were used to determine the epitope for several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised to the whole protein. Eight-week old BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with purified bacterial recombinant β-pol (75 μg) in a 0.5-ml emulsion with complete Freund's adjuvant. Two weeks later, the animals were boosted with a 0.5-ml subcutaneous inoculation of purified β-pol (75 μg) with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The following week, serum from the mice was tested by ELISA against a highly purified antigen preparation to determine the level of specific anti-β-pol activity. Two weeks following the second injection, the most reactive mice were given an intravenous injection of 0.1 ml containing 100 μg of highly purified β-pol, and their spleens were harvested for fusion 4 days later. The general procedures used for cell fusion, selection, cloning, and propagation have been previously described (KöKöhler et al., 1976Köhler G. Howe S.C. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1976; 6: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar; Showalter et al., 1981Showalter S.D. Zweig M. Hampar B. Infect. Immunol. 1981; 43: 684-692Crossref Google Scholar). Beginning about day 10, fluids from actively growing cells were tested by ELISA for anti-β-pol activity. By controlled washing of antigen-antibody complexes on the plate, this test was designed to select for antibodies that would also give strong immunoblot signals. Cells from positive wells were expanded into 24-well plates and cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates on a feeder layer of compatible thymocytes. Cloned cells were passaged in ascites tumors by intraperitoneal injection of 3 × 106 cells into adult BALB/c mice primed 2 weeks previously with 0.5 ml of pistrane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane; Aldrich) injected intraperitoneally. The ascitic fluids resulting 7-10 days later were harvested, clarified, and the immunoglobulin purified to homogeneity for further use. Cell lines were designated as 4S, 6S, 9S, 10S, 14S, 15S, 16S, 17S, 18S, 22S, 23S, 30S, 35S, 38S, 40S, and 41S, respectively. Antibody subclasses of all monoclonals obtained were determined using a commercially available isotyping kit (Amersham). The kit is essentially a sandwich immunoblot using specific anti-subtype reagents. Supernatant fluid from cultures of each line as tested for immunoglobulin class by ELISA and immunoblot assays using secondary antibodies specific for IgG (γ-chain) and IgM (μ-chain). Six cell lines (10S, 14S, 18S, 22S, 35S, and 38S) were found to produce IgG antibodies with the subclass of IgG1, IgG2b, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2a, and IgG1, respectively. The remaining 10 cell lines (4S, 6S, 9S, 15S, 16S, 17S, 23S, 30S, 40S, and 41S) produced IgM. Large-scale isolation of some of the mAbs (10S, 17S, 18S, 22S, 35S, and 38S) was accomplished; these were tested by ELISA and immunoblot assays against various domain peptides of rat β-pol. In a subsequent experiment, we compared the specificity of each mAb for rat and human β-pols. mAbs 6S, 18S, 22S, 35S, 40S, and 41S gave stronger reaction against rat β-pol than human β-pol, while mAbs 10S, 17S, 23S, and 38S were stronger against human β-pol than rat β-pol. The mAbs 4S, 14S, and 30S shared almost equal avidity for human and rat β-pol; mAb 9S, 15S, and 16S show relatively less reactivity with β-pol, as compared to the other mAbs. The epitopes for mAbs 14S and 30S were in the 31-kDa domain(87-335), as they gave cross-reactivity with all domains tested except the 8-kDa domain(Arteaga et al., 1994Arteaga C.L. Winnier A.R.

The epitopes for mAbs 17S and 4S were in the region between residues 75 and 154, as these mAbs reacted with β-pol, 31-, 27-, 18-, and 10-kDa fragments. Epitopes for the other mAbs were found between amino acids 140 and 335. In the cases of 23S, 40S, and 41S, we detected no reaction with the 8-kDa domain, 16- or 18-kDa fragments. The epitopes of these mAbs may be contributed by different regions of β-pol, resulting in the cross-reactivity to the 31-, 27-, 12-, and 10-kDa domains. The mAbs 6S and 38S have epitopes in the 12-kDa domain (230-335). CHO-K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). These cells were grown per ATCC recommendations. GC-1 cells (gift from Dr. S. Mitra, Sealy Center for Molecular Science, Galveston) were maintained as described (Dunn et al., 1991Dunn W.C. Tano K. Horesovsky G.J. Preston R.J. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Actively dividing CHO cells were exposed to different effectors, e.g. MNNG (10 and 30 μM) for 4 h or the indicated time periods; TPA (500 nM), dibutyryl cAMP (100 μM), and forskolin (1 μM) for 4 h. Different concentrations of TPA (10, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 nM), dibutyryl cAMP (1, 10, 100, and 500 μM), and forskolin (1, 5, 50, and 100 μM) were used to study the optimum concentration of these effectors. The effect of TPA (500 nM) was also studied from 1 to 12 h. Actively growing cells in the presence or absence of effectors were used for β-pol detection. For rapid cell lysis, exponentially growing tissue culture cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.7 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and the protease inhibitors mixture as described above. The lysate was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant fraction (20 μg of protein unless otherwise specified) was electrophoresed in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane. Equal loading of samples in different lanes and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane was verified in all cases by staining the membrane with Ponceau S. β-Pol was measured by incubating the membrane with mouse anti-β-pol monoclonal antibody 18S, and then with antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immobilized horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Different amounts of pure recombinant rat β-pol (2 to 20 ng) were also electrophoresed along with various unknown samples on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane; β-pol was detected as described. The amount of β-pol was determined from the linear portion of a dose-response curve (Fig. 1) obtained by plotting concentration versus integrated optical density. The integrated densitometry signals of β-pol bands from autoradiograms (proportional to chemiluminescence) were measured using Millipore BioImage Visage Software on a Sun Sparc Station II Workstation (BioImage Products, Ann Arbor, MI). We found that densitometric signals of recombinant β-pol were ~7-fold higher when added to whole cell extract than for the same amount of β-pol run alone (without extract). The magnitude of this effect was reminiscent of that observed with crude cell extract in the activity gel assay for β-pol enzymatic activity (Swack et al., 1985Swack J. Karawya E. Albert W. Fedorko J. Minna J.D. Wilson S.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hence, the values for β-pol level reported for different cell lines and tissues were calculated on the basis of standard curves derived after addition of purified recombinant β-pol to each whole cell extract. Purified rat β-pol was used as antigen to produce a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Sixteen hybridoma cell lines producing antibody were isolated, and the antibodies were purified; hybridomas were selected for their ability to produce probes for immunoblotting. For epitope mapping of the mAbs, controlled proteolysis of β-pol was used to prepare 5 domain peptides, as summarized in Fig. 2. We also overexpressed and purified an 18-kDa N-terminal segment of β-pol corresponding to residues 1-154. The final preparation of the 18-kDa peptide also contained a smaller peptide, designated as 16 kDa, sharing the same N-terminal sequence. These 7 peptides were transferred to membrane, which then was probed separately with each mAb for epitope localization (Fig. 2). Epitopes for 12 of the mAbs were not localized to a smaller region, whereas epitopes for 10S, 16S, 18S, or 22S were localized to a respective 10-20 amino acid segment (Fig. 2). The epitope for 35S is in the 140-220 segment of β-pol (Fig. 2), and the epitope for 18S is between residues 140 and 154 (Fig. 3A). The immunoblotting signal produced by 18S could be veri"

Despite intensive research it remains unknown whether the humoral or the environmental component is more important in the development of renal microvessels. The prolonged serum-free culture of embryonic kidney cortex expiants was achieved by means of a newly developed perfusion culture system. This system made the investigation of renal vascular development under defined organotypic conditions possible. Thus, growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and hormones (aldosterone, vitamin D3) coidd be applied without the interference with se ruin components. Medium supplementation with VEGF or aldosterone in combination with vitamin D3 resulted in the coordinated proliferation of endothelial cells in the explant. A w ell-developed collecting duct epithelium and numerous tubular structures were always observed. In contrast, only a uniform cell layer was found between fibrous organ capsule and the collecting duct epithe-lium after bFGF application, but neither tubular structures nor endothelial cells. Thus, the experiments indicate that bFGF alone has no stimulating effect on the growth of the renal micro vasculature under perfusion culture conditions.—Klotli, S., Ebenbeck, C., Kubitza, M., Schmidbauer, A., Röckl, W., Minuth, W.

Ethanolamine may play a pivotal role in the survival of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei brucei in the bloodstream of the mammalian host. Ethanolamine is taken up by T. b. brucei by a specific transport system and is utilized directly in the synthesis of the glycolipid anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)1( 1The abbreviations used are: VSGvariant surface glycoproteinEtnethanolamineP-EtnphosphoethanolamineCDP-EtnCDP-ethanolamineMEMminimum Eagle's mediumdCDP-EtndCDP-ethanolaminePCAperchloric acidTLCthin layer chromatographyPEphosphatidylethanolamineCMchloroform-methanolGPEglycerophos-phoethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholineDMPEdimethylphosphatidylethanolamineLPElysophosphatidylethanolamine. )of this parasite(1Rifkin M.R.

The surface glycoprotein is important in protecting the parasite from immune lysis, mediated by antibodies to plasma membrane antigens. Thus, a trypanosome which can no longer synthesize or replace its surface glycoprotein coat would be destroyed.

Ethanolamine is also a major component of trypanosome membrane phospholipids. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) constitutes 25-30% of the total phospholipid of T. b. brucei(2Dixon H. Williamson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 33: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To satisfy their biosynthetic requirements for ethanolamine, trypanosomes must either efficiently scavenge ethanolamine from the external milieu or derive it via unusual metabolic pathways from other metabolites. We have previously described a specific ethanolamine transport system with a Km that corresponds to the plasma concentration of ethanolamine(1Rifkin M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Uptake of ethanolamine via this transporter can satisfy the ethanolamine requirements of the cell for phospholipid and VSG biosynthesis; however, there is little knowledge of any of the biosynthetic pathways involved in the further metabolism of ethanolamine. Because of the major role PE plays not only in maintaining membrane homeostasis but also in serving as the donor for phosphoethanolamine in the biosynthesis of VSG(3Menon A.K. Eppinger M. Mayor S. Schwarz R.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it was of interest to study the pathway for PE biosynthesis in trypanosomes. In mammalian cells, if exogenous ethanolamine is readily available, the majority of PE is formed via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (“Kennedy pathway”)(4Weiss S.B. Smith S.W. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, in tissue culture medium lacking ethanolamine, the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) becomes the major pathway for biosynthesis of PE(5Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In bacteria and yeast, decarboxylation of PS is the major biosynthetic pathway, although the Kennedy pathway enzymes exist in these cells(6Pieringer R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 255-306Google Scholar). A third pathway for the direct incorporation of ethanolamine into phospholipids is by the base exchange pathway(7Kanfer J.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In trypanosomes, the contributions of these various pathways for PE biosynthesis have not been studied. In this paper we describe the structural properties of ethanolamine that are important for uptake by the ethanolamine transporter. Inhibition by ethanolamine analogs of both the transport system and ethanolamine kinase, the first enzyme in the ethanolamine metabolic pathway, is described and may provide the basis for further development of effective inhibitors for these pathways. Metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments provide evidence that trypanosomes utilize the Kennedy pathway for most of their PE biosynthesis. In addition to the phospholipid biosynthetic intermediates of the Kennedy pathway, phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) and CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn), two minor metabolites, dCDP-ethanolamine (dCDP-Etn) and glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE), were found which may be important in other biosynthetic pathways. Bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei variant 117 (MITat 1.4) or strain EATRO 110 were isolated from the blood of 3-day infected BALB/c mice or Sprague-Dawley rats by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously(1Rifkin M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These strains were used interchangeably. In experiments where “slender” and “stumpy” trypanosomes were compared, T. b. brucei strain TREU 667 (8Jennings F.W. Whitelaw D.D. Holmes P.H. Chizyuka H.G.B. Urquhart G.M. Int. J.

In this case, C3H/HeJ mice received 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Mead Johnson) intraperitoneally 24 h prior to trypanosome injection(9Levine R.F. Mansfield J.M. Infect.

Trypanosomes were isolated either 3-4 days after infection (log phase growth, 67-84% slender and dividing trypanosomes) or 7-8 days after infection (4-7% slender and dividing trypanosomes, 93-97% intermediate and stumpy trypanosomes). Transport of [3H]ethanolamine was measured as described(1Rifkin M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In experiments with ethanolamine analogs, the final concentrations in the incubation medium were 1 μC/ml of [3H]ethanolamine (New England Nuclear, specific activity 8.8 Ci/mmol), 1.11 μM ethanolamine, and 500 μM analog. Ethanolamine metabolites were extracted from trypanosomes incubated for 60 min at 37°C in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing the following final concentrations: 10 mg/ml of fatty acid-free albumin (Sigma), 1 μM ethanolamine, 5 μC/ml of [3H]ethanolamine, and 2.5 × 107 trypanosomes/ml. Cells were washed twice by centrifugation and resuspension in large volumes of MEM, and finally resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold MEM containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Contamination by free [3H]ethanolamine carried over from the initial incubation medium to the final washed, resuspended cells was negligible. In some cases trypanosomes were diluted with unlabeled trypanosomes after labeling but before washing. For extraction of acid-soluble metabolites, 4 volumes of cold 0.6 N perchloric acid (PCA) was added to the washed trypanosome suspension(10Potter R.L. Schlesinger S. Buettner-Janusch V. Thompson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 381-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min on ice, PCA-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant neutralized with 2.5 N KHCO3, and kept on ice for another 30 min. The resulting KHClO4 precipitate was removed by centrifugation. It was important to use KHCO3 rather than KOH for neutralizing the PCA as neutralization with KOH sometimes led to significant losses of CDP-Etn. The supernatant was lyophilized and subsequently reconstituted in a small volume of water, usually 0.1 ml, and stored at −20°C. This PCA-soluble extract was analyzed on cellulose Chromagram sheets (Kodak) using two solvent systems: system A (butanol/glacial acetic acid/H2O, 5:2:3) or system B (100% ethanol/concentrated ammonia/H2O, 80:4:16). Authentic ethanolamine, P-Etn, and CDP-ethanolamine (all from Sigma) were used as standards. Metabolites were identified by ninhydrin spray (1% in acetone) or by fluorography at −70°C following impregnation of the Chromagram sheet with En3Hance (DuPont New England Nuclear). Because dCDP-Etn is not commercially available but was needed as a standard in analysis of acid-soluble metabolites by thin layer chromatography (TLC), dCDP-Etn was synthesized by a modification of the procedure of Schneider et al.(11Schneider W.C. Fiscus W.G. Lawler J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 121-134Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A 20% (w/v) rat liver homogenate in 0.145 M NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.1 mMp-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone (Sigma) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C and the supernatant used as a source of phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase. The reaction mix contained 10 mg protein/ml and 3 mM ATP, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM 3-phosphoglycerate, 5 mM phosphoethanolamine, 20 mM Tris-succinate, pH 6.0, and either 2 mM CTP or 2 mM dCTP and was incubated at 30°C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 100°C for 4 min and then centrifuged in a microfuge for 6 min. Aliquots (100 μl) of the supernatant were passed through activated charcoal columns, prepared in disposable pipette tips, to remove excess phosphoethanolamine and to facilitate subsequent TLC analysis of the products formed. After loading, charcoal columns were washed three times with distilled water, and then nucleotide-linked metabolites were eluted with 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide in 60% ethanol. The extracted material was taken to dryness in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 100 μl of water for chromatography. CDP-Etn and dCDP-Etn were identified by ninhydrin staining and UV absorption spectra and their Rf values on Chromagram sheets were determined in different solvent systems. For identification of chloroform/methanol (CM)-soluble metabolites, [3H]ethanolamine-labeled trypanosomes were extracted by the method of Folch et al.(12Folch J. Lees M. Sloane G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were stored in chloroform/methanol (2:1) under N2 at −20°C. One-dimensional TLC analysis was performed on Silica Gel G plates (Analtech) using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/H2O (25:15:4:2). Two-dimensional analysis was done on Redi-Coat 2D plates (Supelco), prewashed in acetone/petroleum ether (1:3), using the solvent systems of Turner and Rouser(13Turner J.D. Rouser G. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 38: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Metabolites were located by fluorography (see above for PCA-soluble material). Phosphate content of lipid extracts or of individual radioactive spots was quantitated by the Bartlett method(14Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity of extracts was determined by counting small aliquots in Liquiscint (National Diagnostics) and of TLC spots by scraping the spot into a scintillation vial, adding 0.4 ml of H2O, and incubating with shaking at 37°C for 1 h before adding Liquiscint. Ethanolamine kinase was assayed by a modification of the method of Weinhold and Rethy(15Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This method separates the ethanolamine substrate from the P-Etn product by Dowex AG-50X8 [H+] (Bio-Rad) chromatography. [14C]Ethanolamine (New England Nuclear, specific activity 49 mCi/mmol) or [3H]ethanolamine (New England Nuclear, specific activity 30 Ci/mmol) was repurified before use(15Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Trypanosome homogenates, made by lysing purified trypanosomes in 9 volumes of water or a high speed supernatant prepared from the homogenate (100,000 × g, 60 min), were assayed for kinase activity. Incubation mixtures contained 3 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl, 60 mM glycylglycine buffer, pH 8.5, 0.5 mM ethanolamine ([14C]ethanolamine, 2 μCi/μmol), 3 mM ATP, and either homogenate (1.84 mg protein/ml) or 100,000 × g supernatant (0.64 mg/ml). In some experiments, mixtures were supplemented with an ATP regenerating system consisting of 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30°C. Protein was determined by the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Inhibition of ethanolamine transport might constitute a novel approach to the chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis. This would require a knowledge of the structural constraints on the ethanolamine substrate that might interfere with recognition by the ethanolamine transporter. Ethanolamine analogs, which differed from ethanolamine at either the amino or hydroxyl end or had different carbon backbones, were tested for their ability to inhibit ethanolamine transport by trypanosomes (Table I). The results indicate that compounds with substitutions at the hydroxyl end do not inhibit ethanolamine transport as well as compounds with substitutions at the amino end. Thus, substitution of the hydroxyl group with a sulfhydryl group(2-aminoethanethiol), sulfonic acid moiety (taurine), hydrogen (ethylamine), or phosphate group (phosphoethanolamine) or substitution of the hydroxymethyl group by a carboxyl moiety (glycine) or by an aldehyde group (aminoacetaldehyde) had little or no effect on ethanolamine transport indicating that these compounds were not effectively recognized by the transport system. Increasing the length of the carbon backbone by a single methylene group (3-amino-1-propanol) dramatically decreased the ability of the analog to compete with ethanolamine. However, compounds in which one of the methylene hydrogens was replaced with a methyl group (2-amino-1-propanol) or an ethyl group (2-amino-1-butanol) were good inhibitors of ethanolamine transport. Analogs with either one or two methyl or ethyl substituted amino groups also effectively competed with ethanolamine in this assay. Other compounds which had little (less than 27% inhibition) or no inhibitory activity under the same experimental conditions are not listed in; these were betaine, methylamine, dimethylamine, 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol, N-(3-aminopropyl)diethanolamine, N,N-dimethylglycine,N,N-di-methylglycine ethyl ester, lysine, methylaminoacetaldehyde dimethylacetal, and dimethylaminoacetaldehyde diethylacetal. The acetals were converted to the free aldehydes by incubation in 0.1 N HCl for 30 min immediately before starting the assay. In summary, the trypanosome ethanolamine transporter seems to have a strong requirement for a hydroxymethyl group at one end of the substrate, a methylene group that can accommodate substitution of one of the hydrogens, but not both, by a small alkyl group (e.g. methyl, ethyl), and a preference for a primary amine at the other end of the substrate.TABLE I Open table in a new tab To characterize further the nature of the inhibition of ethanolamine transport, the inhibitor constant (Ki) was determined for several of the most effective inhibitors in Table I. Fig. 1A shows the competitive nature of N,N-dimethylethanolamine inhibition of ethanolamine transport (Ki = 90 μM). Similar results were obtained for N-methylethanolamine (Ki = 50 μM), L-2-aminopropanol (Ki = 58 μM), and both D- and L-2-amino-1-butanol (Ki = 11 μM). For comparison, the Km for ethanolamine is 3.7 μM(1Rifkin M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the transport system shows no stereospecificity at the methylene carbon of ethanolamine since both D- and L-2-amino-1-butanol give the same Ki. Chromatography of a [3H]ethanolamine-labeled PCA extract on cellulose in an acid solvent system revealed one major and three minor spots (Fig. 2). These spots were identified as ethanolamine, P-Etn, dCDP-Etn, and CDP-Etn based on a comparison of their Rf values with authentic standards (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, A and B). Radioactive material comigrating with P-Etn constituted 65-90% of the total radioactivity applied to the plate, while 3-30% corresponded to ethanolamine, and 4-10% to CDP-Etn and dCDP-Etn. In rat liver, the rate-limiting step in PE biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway is the conversion of P-Etn to CDP-Etn, resulting in very low steady-state levels of CDP-Etn. The distribution of [3H]ethanolamine radioactivity among the trypanosome acid-soluble metabolites (Fig. 2) is similar to that found in rat liver (17Sundler R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the conclusion that also in trypanosomes the formation of CDP-Etn is rate-limiting. To ascertain that the major soluble radioactive metabolite was indeed P-Etn, material having an Rf = 0.43 in solvent system A (Fig. 3A) was eluted from the chromatogram and rerun in solvent system B (Fig. 3B). 83% of the counts had the same Rf as authentic P-Etn run in an adjacent lane. Similarly, material comigrating with P-Etn in solvent system B, eluted and rerun in solvent system A, again comigrated with P-Etn (data not shown). Identity of the major radioactive metabolite in Fig. 3A as P-Etn was confirmed by alkaline phosphatase digestion. After alkaline phosphatase digestion, 72% of the radioactivity in the digest migrated with an Rf = 0.68, equivalent to that of ethanolamine (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3B reveals another minor metabolite (labeled with an asterisk) which comigrates with P-Etn under acid conditions but which can be separated from it under basic conditions. The Rf of this material in these two solvent systems suggest that it is GPE. GPE would be insensitive to alkaline phosphatase digestion and thus may also account for the apparent “undigested” P-Etn in Fig. 3C. GPE could be an intermediate in a lipid biosynthetic pathway, similar to the postulated involvement of glycerophosphorylcholine in the synthesis of lung phosphatidylcholine(18Infante J.P. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GPE could be a degradation product resulting from the deacylation of lysoPE by phospholipase A (19Mellors A. Samad A. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 239-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In either case, it does not contribute significantly to the radioactivity in the P-Etn fraction and should not affect the interpretation of the data of pulse-chase experiments to be described below. While P-Etn was always the major ethanolamine metabolite, variability was found in the relative amounts of the other ethanolamine metabolites. To test whether this variability in Etn content may be due to the stage of the growth cycle at which the parasites are isolated, the acid-soluble metabolites of slender and stumpy trypanosomes were compared. Using the pleomorphic T. brucei strain 667, parasites isolated from the logarithmic, rapidly dividing phase had relatively less ethanolamine and dCDP-Etn (Fig. 2, lane 2), while these same metabolites were more abundant in cell populations containing large numbers of stumpy (non-dividing) trypanosomes (Fig. 2, lane 3). Thus, the intracellular pools of ethanolamine metabolites seems to vary according to the morphological subtypes of trypanosomes in the population and may reflect different biosynthetic needs of these different trypanosome populations. The formation of P-Etn is likely due to an ethanolamine kinase, which serves to trap the newly transported ethanolamine in the cell. Consequently, the properties of this enzyme in trypanosomes were characterized, using the assay developed by Weinhold and Rethy(15Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Trypanosome ethanolamine kinase is likely to be a cytosolic enzyme since enhanced kinase specific activity was found in the high speed supernatant of a trypanosome homogenate. The mean specific activity in four experiments was 228 ± 27 pmol/min/mg protein for freshly prepared homogenates and 526 ± 48 pmol/min/mg protein for a high speed supernatant. In the absence of ATP, kinase activity was only 3-4% of that found in reaction mixtures containing ATP. Kinase activity was further enhanced over 2-fold when an ATP-generating system was present in addition to ATP, suggesting that ATP serves as a phosphate donor. The activity was somewhat unstable since freezing led to an approximately 50% loss of activity. The trypanosome ethanolamine kinase had a broad pH optimum of 8-8.5 (data not shown). The kinetic properties of this enzyme were determined and the Km for ethanolamine and the Vmax were found to be 2.75 μM and 32.4 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 4). Choline, which does not inhibit ethanolamine transport in trypanosomes, had very little effect on trypanosome ethanolamine kinase (Ki > 600 μM for choline) (Fig. 5). This is in contrast to the rat liver ethanolamine kinase which is effectively inhibited by choline(20Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, another rat liver ethanolamine kinase inhibitor (20Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and an inhibitor of ethanolamine transport in trypanosomes, inhibited the trypanosome kinase with a Ki of 22.5 μM (Fig. 5). Thus, trypanosomes seem to have evolved an ethanolamine uptake system which is uniquely designed to both transport and trap ethanolamine, even in the presence of the much more abundant metabolite choline.Figure 5:Dixon plot analysis of inhibition of ethanolamine kinase activity by N,N-dimethylethanolamine and choline. The incubation tubes contained 2.3 μM [3H]ethanolamine (5.55 μCi/nmol) and increasing concentrations of inhibitor. A high speed supernatant fraction of a trypanosome lysate was used as a source of the enzyme. Vmax (32.4 pmol/min/mg protein) was derived from Fig. 4B. Data was analyzed by linear regression analysis (correlation = 0.988). The K for N,N-dimethylethanolamine derived from this plot is 22.5 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thin layer chromatography of a Folch extract of [3H]ethanolamine-labeled trypanosomes is shown in Fig. 6. By one-dimensional analysis (Fig. 6A) 64% of the total counts migrated as PE, 6% as dimethyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), and 30% in the region where phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) overlap. Two-dimensional TLC confirmed the identity of these radioactive lipids as PE, DMPE, and LPE (Fig. 6B). No radioactivity was seen in PC or any other lipids with labeling periods up to 2 h. If, instead, the Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42828) Google Scholar) method was used to extract labeled trypanosomes, some additional radioactive spots of unknown identity, constituting less than 2.5% of the total radioactivity, appeared which migrated ahead of PE in a one-dimensional analysis (data not shown). A comparison of the relative lipid labeling pattern of slender and stumpy trypanosomes (T. brucei strain 667) showed no difference, although the specific activity (dpm/μg phosphate) of the stumpy extract as well as of individual lipids (PE and LPE) was 64-69% of that of slender trypanosomes. Incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine incorporation into total PCA-soluble and PCA-insoluble, chloroform/methanol-soluble material occurs with no appreciable lag (Fig. 7A). A more detailed analysis of the incorporation at shorter times is seen in Fig. 7B for PCA-soluble metabolites and Fig. 7C for lipid metabolites. A very short lag may be seen for PE (1 min) and LPE (2 min), while the lag for DMPE is difficult to ascertain due to the low amounts of radioactivity incorporated into this metabolite. Essentially no lag was seen for P-Etn, CDP-Etn, or Etn. The P-Etn pool appeared to saturate by 10 min and so in pulse-chase experiments to be described below, the chase period was started at 10 min. The leveling off of incorporation into P-Etn was not due to exhaustion of radioactive ethanolamine in the incubation medium as the amount of ethanolamine (1.1 μM) is sufficient for several hours of uptake at a rate of 132 pmol/min/mg protein(1Rifkin M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using the concentration (1.1 μM) and the specific radioactivity (4.2 μC/nmol) of [3H]ethanolamine in the incubation medium, we can calculate from the data in Fig. 7, B and C, that during the initial 10 min of incubation the rate of uptake of ethanolamine into the acid-soluble pool is 49 pmol/min/mg protein while the rate of uptake into lipid is 64.5 pmol/min/mg protein. The rate-limiting step of ethanolamine incorporation into phospholipid is therefore unlikely to be due to the enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis but rather due to the rate of transport of ethanolamine into the cell. Pulse-chase experiments revealed a very rapid turnover of the PCA-soluble metabolites (Fig. 8A). Immediately upon adding cold ethanolamine, the radioactivity in the PCA-soluble pool decreased with a half-time of 5 min (Fig. 8B), while the radioactivity in the chloroform/methanol extract continued to increase for 2 min after the start of the chase period. The immediate decrease in the PCA-soluble pool is the result of an immediate decrease in the radioactive P-Etn and other PCA-soluble metabolites (Fig. 8C). Closer analysis of the radioactive chloroform/methanol-soluble metabolites (Fig. 8D) suggests that the continued incorporation of radioactivity into the CM-soluble metabolites for 2 min after the start of the chase period as well as the subsequent decrease was reflected in the radioactive PE fraction. In contrast, no decrease in radioactivity during the chase period was found in LPE or DMPE, suggesting that these metabolites continue to be synthesized at the expense of PE. It is interesting to note that while trypanosomes are able to methylate PE to form DMPE (Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:), further methylation to PC does not occur to any appreciable extent. This is surprising since i"
https://openalex.org/W1989022086,"To isolate a mutant liver cell defective in the endocytic pathway, a selection strategy using toxic ligands for two distinct membrane receptors was devised. Ovalbumin-gelonin and asialoorosomucoid (ASOR)-gelonin were incubated with mutagenized HuH-7 cells, and a rare survivor termed trafficking mutant 1 (Trf1) was isolated. Trf1 cells were stably 3-fold more resistant than the parental HuH-7 to both toxic conjugates. The anterograde steps of intracellular endocytic processing of ASOR, including internalization, endosomal acidification, and ligand degradation, were unaltered in Trf1 cells. In contrast, retrograde diacytosis of asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR)●ASOR complex back to the cell surface was enhanced by about 250%. Selective labeling revealed an approximately 46% reduction in cell surface-associated ASGR in Trf1 cells, although their total cellular ASGR content was essentially equivalent to that in HuH-7. Similar results were obtained with the transferrin receptor. Binding of 125I-ASOR and 125I-transferrin was reduced in Trf1 cells to 49 ± 2.5% and 30 ± 2%, respectively, of HuH-7 cells. The methionine transporter was also reduced in Trf1 cells, as revealed by a 2-fold reduction in Vmax with no change in apparent Km. Pretreatment with monensin, sodium azide, or colchicine reduced surface binding of 125I-ASOR in HuH-7 cells by 50% but had no effect on binding to Trf1 cells. This result is predicted for a cell that expresses only State 1 ASGRs, which are resistant to modulation by metabolic and cytoskeletal inhibitors in contrast to State 2, which are responsive to these agents (Weigel, P. H., and Oka, J. A.(1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1150-1154). The Trf1 mutant, having lost the ability to express State 2 receptors, provides genetic evidence for the existence of these two receptor subpopulations and an approach to identifying the biochemical mechanism by which they are generated.

RME is initiated by the binding of ligand to specific cell surface receptors followed by internalization of the receptor-ligand complex. Intracellular trafficking of the resulting endosomal vesicles and their ultimate destination varies with the particular receptor (for review see Ref. 1). Mutations that result in the inhibition or alteration of RME fall into two general classes. One class, exemplified by the low density lipoprotein receptor mutants(2Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Lehrman M.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Cell. 1985; 41: 735-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), involves mutations of the receptor structural gene per se, limiting the effect to a single RME system. The second major class of RME mutations gives pleiotropic phenotypes arising from effects on multiple RME systems (for review see Ref. 4). The vast majority of pleiotropic endocytic mutants have been isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell populations. These isolates have been classified into either endocytosis (End) mutants belonging to complementation groups End 1-End 6 (4Colbaugh P.A. Draper R.K. Adv. Cell. Mol. Biol. Membr. 1993; 1: 169-198Google Scholar, 5Bucci M. Moyer T.W. Brown C.M. Wilson R.B. Murphy R.F. Somatic Cell Mol.

In addition, there are mutants that have not been integrated into either the End or ldl complementation groups, which also exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype(4Colbaugh P.A. Draper R.K. Adv. Cell. Mol.

To obtain mutants affecting general steps in RME, dual selection schemes have been devised which apply selection pressure to the RME pathway(7Krieger M. Martin J. Segal M. Kingsley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5607-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8McGraw T.E. Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have used a related strategy to isolate a defective mutant in RME from hepatocyte-derived HuH-7 cells. These cells were used partly to obtain a phenotype relevant to liver and partly to avoid reisolating the endocytosis mutants obtained with high frequency from CHO cells. In our protocol, the surface expression of two different carbohydrate-specific receptors of HuH-7 were selected against. The galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) and the mannose receptor, both responsible for the vesicular transport of their respective ligands to lysosomes, were utilized to deliver simultaneously to mutagenized HuH-7 cells, galactose- and mannose-terminating glycoprotein conjugates of gelonin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis(9Lambert J.M. Senter P.D. Yau-Young A. Blattler W.A. Goldmacher V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12035-12041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance to these targeted toxin conjugates would be expected to result from altered trafficking that reduces the intracellular concentration of the toxin or prevents its escape into cytosol. In this paper we describe a mutant HuH-7 cell line termed trafficking mutant 1 (Trf1), which was isolated by the dual selection protocol. It is more resistant than parental HuH-7 cells to both of the glycoprotein conjugates, and it exhibits a defect in RME. The pleiotropic phenotype of the mutant is distinct from that of other endocytosis mutants isolated previously from CHO cell populations(4Colbaugh P.A. Draper R.K. Adv. Cell. Mol. Biol. Membr. 1993; 1: 169-198Google Scholar, 5Bucci M. Moyer T.W. Brown C.M. Wilson R.B. Murphy R.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 6Malmstrom K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24025-24030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation expressed by Trf1 cells reduces the surface expression of several unrelated molecules and provides genetic evidence for the existence of different subpopulations of surface receptors, in particular, the two subpopulations of ASGRs, designated State 1 and 2 by Weigel and Oka (10Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1150-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human asialoorosomucid receptor (ASOR) was prepared by acid hydrolysis as described previously(11Weiss P. Ashwell G. Morell A.G. Stockert R.J. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ASOR, protein A (Sigma), and ovalbumin (Sigma) were iodinated by a chloramine-T method (12Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Gover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6739) Google Scholar) or by a coupled lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase method following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The specificity of the polyclonal antibody to ASGR has been described previously(13Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody to the transferrin receptor was kindly provided by Dr. C. Enns, Oregon Health Science University. Gelonin and N-succinimidyl-3-(2 pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) were obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. Methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) was obtained from Sigma. The following toxins were also obtained: ricin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA); wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma); abrin (Vector, Burlingame, CA); Pseudomonas toxin and modeccin (kindly provided by Dr. April Robbins, NIH); and diphtheria toxin (Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA). ASOR or ovalbumin (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mM EDTA. Gelonin (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in PBS, pH 8.0. A 10-fold molar excess of SPDP, dissolved just prior to use at a concentration of 20 mM in absolute ethanol, was added to each protein solution. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature and was terminated by gel filtration through a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with the protein dissolution buffer. The number of covalently linked dithiopyridyl groups was determined by the increase in absorbance measured at 314 nm following reduction with increasing amounts of dithiothreitol(14Carlsson J. Drevin H. Axen R. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The SPDP-activated glycoproteins were dialyzed against PBS, pH 6.0, for 4 h at 4°C. After dialysis, the modified glycoproteins were incubated for 15 min at 22°C with dithiothreitol in a 50-fold molar excess to the number of linked dithiopyridyl groups. The reaction was terminated by filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. The protein-containing fractions were immediately added to an equal quantity of SPDP-activated gelonin, and the coupling reaction was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 4°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 20 mM and incubation for 30 min at 22°C. Following centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) to remove the small amount of insoluble material, the reaction mixture was concentrated in an Amicon P-30 and the conjugate was purified by filtration on Sephadex G-200 equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. Aliquots of protein-containing fractions were resolved by reducing and nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. The presence of the desired conjugate was confirmed by the detection of hetero-oligomers and dimers which, upon reduction, were resolved into the appropriately sized monomers. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the glycoprotein-conjugates resolved the conjugates into major bands of approximately 70 and 100 kDa for ASOR-gelonin and 70 kDa for ovalbumin-gelonin, respectively. The addition of dithiothreitol to the sample buffer resulted in the reduction of each conjugate into its constituent proteins. Densitometric analysis of the resolved proteins suggested that the recovered conjugate of ASOR-gelonin varied between a 1:1 and 2:1 molar ratio of gelonin to glycoprotein, whereas ovalbumin-gelonin was mainly a 1:1 molar conjugate. HuH-7 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated in 60-mm plastic dishes (Falcon) and were grown near or at confluence before each experiment unless otherwise indicated. The number of viable cells was estimated by an MTT assay(15Ealey P.A. Yateman M.E. Holt S.J. Marshall N.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated for 1 h in serum-free MEM made 2.5 mM in CaCl2 (MEM-CA) at 37°C. To assay surface binding, cells were chilled to 4°C and incubated for 1 h with 125I-ASOR (2 μg) or 125I-transferrin (1 μg) added to 1 ml of MEM-CA. Nonspecific ligand binding was estimated from culture dishes that also contained 100 μg of unlabeled ligand. Unbound 125I-ASOR or 125I-transferrin was removed by two washes with 1.5 ml of MEM-CA. In the case of 125I-ASOR, a final wash with MEM-CA made 5 mM in N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) was performed(16Harford J. Wolkoff A.W. Ashwell G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1824-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surface-bound 125I-ASOR was released with 50 mM GalNAc(15Ealey P.A. Yateman M.E. Holt S.J. Marshall N.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Harford J. Wolkoff A.W. Ashwell G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1824-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In a typical binding assay, 5-7 ng of 125I-ASOR (≈5 × 103 cpm/ng) was specifically bound to 1 × 106 HuH-7 cells. Surface-bound 125I-transferrin was determined from the radioactivity associated with cells harvested at 4°C(10Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1150-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a typical transferrin assay, 1 × 106 HuH-7 cells bound 4 ng of 125I-transferrin (≈4 × 103 cpm/ng). Internalization and degradation of 125I-ASOR were quantitated after uptake at 37°C. At various times, cells were cooled to 4°C, and an aliquot of medium was added to an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, 4% phosphotungstic acid to assess ligand degradation(16Harford J. Wolkoff A.W. Ashwell G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1824-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed twice and incubated in 50 mM GalNAc or 20 mM EGTA for 10 min at 4°C to remove residual surface radioactivity. Cells were washed again and harvested in 1 ml of PBS, and the amount of residual, cell-associated 125I-ASOR was quantified. Cells were incubated with 125I-ASOR (2 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37°C to allow ligand internalization. Cells were then washed at 4°C, and residual surface ligand was removed by a 10-min incubation in 50 mM GalNAc. Pregassed and warmed MEM containing 50 mM GalNAc was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C. Over time, aliquots of medium were withdrawn, and radioactivity was determined. Degradation products were quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described above. The cells were then washed with MEM and harvested. Intact, 125I-ASOR released into the medium (diacytosed) was measured as acid-precipitable radioactivity. There was no cellular contamination of the medium as centrifugation (5 min in Eppendorf centrifuge 5412) to remove intact cells before acid precipitation did not alter the results. [35S]Cysteine/methionine metabolically labeled (13Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 125I-surface labeled (11Weiss P. Ashwell G. Morell A.G. Stockert R.J. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) cells were lysed in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 100 units of aprotinin, 1 μg of leupeptin, 1 μg of pepstatin). Aliquots of cell lysates containing an equal amount of protein were precleaned by the addition of 20 μl of Gammabond G (50% suspension) prebound with 10 μl of preimmune serum and were incubated at 4°C with constant mixing for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged, and 10 μl of polyclonal antiserum and 50 μl of Gammabond G were added to the supernatant. Following 4-6 h of incubation at 4°C with constant mixing, the lysates were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with a solution containing 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4, and a final wash with 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. An equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the pellets were heated at 90°C for 10 min prior to electrophoresis on a 10% gel. The fixed gel was prepared for either fluorography with En3hance (DuPont NEN) for 35S or autoradiographic analysis for 125I. To estimate the amount of 35S-amino-acid incorporated into protein, a 50-μl aliquot of the lysate was added to 0.5 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl containing 0.1% BSA to which an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added. The precipitated protein was collected on a Whatman GF/A glass fiber filter under reduced pressure and was washed with 10 ml of methanol. The air-dried filter was dispersed in 10 ml of Hydrofluor (National Diagnostics), and the amount of 35S was determined. The conversion of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) to the acid conformation was utilized as an indicator of endosomal acidification as described by Phalen and Kielian (18Phalen T. Kielian M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Metabolically radiolabeled SFV (kindly provided by Dr. M. Kielian, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) was prebound to cells on ice with continuous shaking for 2 h. Following removal of unbound SFV, cells were warmed to 37°C to initiate endocytosis. At timed intervals, cells were shifted to 4°C and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed, and duplicate aliquots were processed for immunoprecipitation (see “Immunoprecipitation of ASGR”). The recovered precipitates were analyzed by nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. Acid-converted E1 protein was selectively bound by the monoclonal antibody E1a-1, which is specific for the acid conformation, and surface-bound SFV was precipitated with polyclonal antibody (provided by M. Kielian)(19Kielian M. Jungerwirth S. Sagad U. DeCandido S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acid-converted E1 immune complexes were precipitated with rabbit anti-mouse antibody prebound to fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Zysorbin; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco) and were analyzed by fluorography following SDS-PAGE. The sensitivity of cells to lectins and various toxins was determined essentially as described(20Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were removed from nearly confluent T-75 flasks by treatment with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in α-MEM + 10% FBS and counted. Each cell line was then diluted in the same medium to 2 × 104 cells/ml. A range of toxin concentrations was prepared in α-MEM + 10% FBS, and 0.1 ml of each toxin was loaded into a well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Cells (2 × 103) were then added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37°C until the control wells (without toxin) reached confluence. The concentration of each toxin required to kill 90% of the cells (D10 value) was determined by microscopic examination of surviving cells and after the plates were stained and fixed using a solution of 0.2% methylene blue in 50% methanol. Aliquots of cell lysate in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were heated at 90°C for 10 min before resolution of the proteins on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with antibody and iodinated protein A as described previously (21Stockert R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by chemiluminescence as per the manufacturer's instructions (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). Cells (1 × 106/dish) were preincubated in methionine minus RPMI supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS for 1 h at 37°C. Medium was replaced with prewarmed (37°C) methionine minus RPMI supplemented with dialyzed FBS containing increasing concentrations of methionine and a constant amount of [35S]methionine (≈1 × 106 cpm). Following the incubation period, uptake was terminated by the addition of 1.0 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA(22Novak D.A. Kilberg M.S. Beverridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the cells were transferred immediately to an ice bath. Cells were washed three times with ice- cold PBS/BSA and harvested for counting. The extent of nonspecifically associated [35S]methionine was estimated by an incubation at 4°C, and this value was subtracted as an uptake blank. Prior to mutant selection, the toxicity of the glycoprotein-gelonin conjugates for HuH-7 cells was determined. Cells were exposed to various concentrations of gelonin conjugates for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2.5 mM Ca+2. The medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and cell viability was determined at 18 h by an MTT assay (Fig. 1). Neither unconjugated glycoproteins nor gelonin alone had any significant effect on cell viability at concentrations up to 20 μg/ml. However, the addition of ASOR-gelonin or ovalbumin-gelonin reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent fashion, resulting in 80-90% cell death at 20 μg/ml of either conjugate. Although 5 μg of either conjugate reduced cell viability by only 20%, when cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml of both conjugates, cell death was increased to 80%± 5%, similar to results upon incubation with 10 μg/ml of either conjugate alone (Fig. 1). With the expectation that any profound alteration in the endocytic pathway might result in cell death, the selection protocol was designed to obtain conditional mutants. Cells (about 2 × 107 previously mutagenized with 0.04 μg/ml N-methyl N-nitrosoguanidine for 2 h and allowed to grow at 34°C for 12 days), were incubated at 39°C overnight before exposure to a combination of 8 μg/ml of each gelonin conjugate for 18-22 h. Cells were then incubated at 34°C in fresh medium without toxin. At the end of 14 days at 34°C, two colonies were recovered. The isolate Trf1 did not express a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, and therefore all subsequent experiments were performed at 37°C. In the course of assessing the selection protocol, it was found that ASOR binding activity in control HuH-7 cells, as well as Trf1, was reduced by ≈50% as a result of the 39°C preincubation. This may have contributed to the survival of Trf1. A comparison of the toxicity of the conjugates to parental HuH-7 and mutant cells indicated a pleiotropic effect of the mutation (Table I). Trf1 cells were approximately 3-fold more resistant than HuH-7 cells to both of the conjugates (10 μg/ml). Specificity of the conjugates was indicated by inhibition of their uptake in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unconjugated glycoprotein (Table II). The toxicity of 10 μg/ml conjugate was reduced from 72 ± 5% for ASOR-gelonin and from 70 ± 3% for ovalbumin-gelonin to 8 ± 5% and 14 ± 2%, respectively. In contrast, the addition of 100 μg/ml ovalbumin to 10 μg/ml ASOR-gelonin or 100 μg/ml ASOR to 10 μg/ml ovalbumin-gelonin did not inhibit the toxic effect of the gelonin conjugates. That there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of parental and mutant cells in the presence of a 10-fold excess of the relevant unconjugated glycoprotein indicated that conjugate toxicity was exerted following binding to ASGRs and mannose receptors, respectively. These results were consistent with the notion that a common element affecting both ASGR and mannose receptor endocytosis was altered in Trf1.Table I:Toxicity and specificity of glycoprotein-toxin conjugates Open table in a new tab Table II:Toxin and lectin toxicity Open table in a new tab Binding of 125I-ASOR was used to estimate the number of bioactive ASGRs and showed that cell surface binding activity was reduced by 49 ± 2.5% in Trf1 cells (Fig. 2). Consistent with this finding, the total amount of 125I-ASOR internalized by mutant cells was reduced by ≈50% when compared with internalization by HuH-7 cells (Fig. 2). Once internalized, ASOR enters a number of functionally distinct intracellular compartments(22Novak D.A. Kilberg M.S. Beverridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Wall D.A. Wilson G. Hubbard A.L. Cell. 1980; 21: 79-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Stockert R.J. Haimes H.B. Morell A.G. Novikoff P.M. Novikoff A.B. Quintana N. Sternlieb I. Lab. Invest. 1980; 43: 556-563PubMed Google Scholar). A large proportion of internalized ASOR has been shown to recycle intact to the cell surface in association with the ASGR(23Wall D.A. Wilson G. Hubbard A.L. Cell. 1980; 21: 79-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Stockert R.J. Haimes H.B. Morell A.G. Novikoff P.M. Novikoff A.B. Quintana N. Sternlieb I. Lab.

Cell. 1983; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), a phenomenon termed diacytosis. When the extent of diacytosis by Trf1 and HuH-7 cells was determined after normalizing to the amount of internalized ASOR, the return of ligand-receptor complex to the cell surface was found to be increased by approximately 2.5-fold in the mutant (Fig. 2). The final destination of internalized ASOR is the lysosome, the commonly accepted site of ligand degradation(23Wall D.A. Wilson G. Hubbard A.L. Cell. 1980; 21: 79-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Stockert R.J. Haimes H.B. Morell A.G. Novikoff P.M. Novikoff A.B. Quintana N. Sternlieb I. Lab.

Endosomal trafficking to this subcellular compartment appears unaffected by the trf1 mutation, since the levels of acid-soluble 125I detected in the medium 1 h after internalization were ≈50% of the 125I-ASOR internalized for both HuH-7 and Trf1 cells (Fig. 2). The unaltered rate of ASOR degradation by Trf1 cells suggested that acidification within the lysosomes was not significantly affected by the mutation. However, it was important to test endosome acidification directly, since a failure to acidify this organelle appears to be the underlying defect in a number of endocytic mutants(4Colbaugh P.A. Draper R.K. Adv. Cell. Mol. Biol. Membr. 1993; 1: 169-198Google Scholar). To assess endosomal pH, we took advantage of the acid-dependent, irreversible conformational change in the E1 spike protein of SFV(18Phalen T. Kielian M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody Ela-1, specific for the acid form of E1, gave rise to immunoprecipitates with the same kinetics in infected Trf1 and HuH-7 cells, providing evidence that endosomal acidification was unaltered by the trf1 mutation (Fig. 3). Additional evidence that the endosomal compartment in Trf1 was acidic was obtained from the sensitivity of the cells to a panel of toxins requiring endosomal acidification for their action (Table I). Trf1 cells were not resistant to any of several toxins. In fact, Trf1 cells were significantly more sensitive to each toxin and to the lectin WGA. This contrasts with the CHO endocytosis mutants End 1-End 5, which are all resistant to diphtheria toxin (4Colbaugh P.A. Draper R.K. Adv. Cell. Mol. Biol. Membr. 1993; 1: 169-198Google Scholar) and to two ricin internalization mutants that are resistant to ricin and to Pseudomonas toxin(26Ray B. Wu H. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2027904715,"The 5′-upstream sequence of the phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) gene contains several transcriptional regulatory regions. We have studied one of the regions (−551 to −480, named GPE1) which exhibits a strong positive regulatory activity. GPE1 stimulated the transcription when fused to heterologous TATA element in an orientation-dependent manner. The region between −536 and −470 was identified as the protein binding site in GPE1 by the DNase I footprinting method. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with several competitors revealed three protein binding sites in this region, designated as GES1, GES2, and GES3. The binding sites were −535 GGAGGGGGCG −524, −512 TGTCACTCA −504, and −491 CAATCCA −485, respectively. Mutational analyses suggested that GPE1 binding proteins cooperate with each other to activate the transcription of the PLC-γ1 gene. Additionally, immunoblot analyses revealed that the level of PLC-γ1 expression was considerably higher in 9 of 11 colorectal carcinomas than in adjacent normal colorectal tissues. In 7 of 9 cases of colorectal carcinomas which express higher level of PLC-γ1, the DNA binding activities to GES1, GES2, and GES3 sites also increased when compared with normal tissues. These results suggest that the GPE1 binding proteins might be attributed to the elevated expression of PLC-γ1 in colorectal carcinomas and may play important roles in proliferation of colorectal carcinoma cells.

Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Especially, src homology domains, SH2 and SH3, and split pleckstrin homology domains reside between X and Y regions of the PLC-γ type(4Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl.

As expected from their sequence differences, the various PLC isozymes appear to be activated by distinct groups of receptors through different mechanisms(3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLC-β is known to be activated by Gαq class (8Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C.

PLC-γ, on the other hand, is activated through a direct interaction with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor(3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 was also suggested to be involved in the process of cellular transformation: (a) microinjection of PLC-γ1 into NIH 3T3 cells caused a dose-dependent transformation, but injection of anti-PLC-γ1 antibody blocked the serum- or ras-induced transformation(12Smith M.R.

Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 233-239PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, immunohistochemical studies suggested that expression of PLC-γ1 was regulated during development and differentiation(18Yamada M. Mizuguchi M. Rhee S.G. Kim S.U. Dev. Brain Res. 1991; 59: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The expression of PLC-γ1 changed during the differentiation of F9(19Lee Y.-H. Lee H.-Y. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Kim K.-W. Cancer Lett. 1993; 68: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), C2C12(20Lee S.-J. Lee Y.H. Kim Y.S. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and U937 cells(21Lee Y.H. Lee H.J. Lee S.-J. Min D.S. Baek S.H. Kim Y.S. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although the expression of PLC-γ1 was shown to be linked to various physiologic events such as cell growth and differentiation, little is known about the mechanisms controlling PLC-γ1 expression. The transcriptional rate of each gene is largely controlled by the interactions of various regulatory factors to the transcriptional control regions or by the modification of regulatory factors(22Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 245: 371-378Crossref Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification and characterization of these cis- and trans-acting factors are needed to understand how transcription of a gene is regulated. We have previously reported the cloning of the promoter of PLC-γ1 gene(23Lee S.-J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis identified several regions which affect transcriptional activity of the promoter: positive regulatory regions from −551 to −480 (GPE1) and from −90 to −52 (GPE2), a negative regulatory region from −371 to −305 (GNE1) relative to the transcriptional initiation site. In this study, the GPE1 region, which might be important for the transcriptional regulation of the PLC-γ1 gene during the physiologic events such as proliferation, has been further characterized. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed three protein binding sites (GES1, GES2, and GES3) in this region. Mutational analyses of the protein binding sites revealed that GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding proteins cooperate each other to activate the transcription through the GPE1 region. GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding proteins seemed to be overexpressed in colorectal carcinomas, suggesting that these proteins might be attributed to the elevated level of PLC-γ1 in cancer tissues. C2C12 cells (mouse skeletal myoblast line) were maintained at low density to prevent fusion in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies Inc.). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2. The XhoI-ApaI fragment which contains the GPE1 region was isolated from pPLCγ551CAT plasmid (23Lee S.-J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). It was then inserted into the upstream E1b-TATA box of E1bCAT (24Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) in both orientations and named pGPE1F and pGPE1R. The construction of pPLCγ551CAT and pPLCγ497CAT was described by Lee et al. (23Lee S.-J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides, F1, F2, F2M, were inserted into the upstream E1b-TATA box of E1bCAT. F1 was inserted into the XhoI site. F2 and F2M were inserted into the HindIII site. The resulting plasmids were named pF1, pF2, pF2M, respectively. F1 oligonucleotide was inserted into the XhoI site of pF2 to construct pF1F2. Reporter CAT plasmids were transfected into C2C12 cells (approximately 30-50% confluent) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method(25Kim S.-J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten μg of plasmid DNA was cotransfected with 3 μg of pCH110 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Uppsala, Sweden), a β-galactosidase expression vector which was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. After exposure to the DNA precipitate for 12-16 h, cells were washed and fresh media was then added. The cells were harvested 48 h later, and CAT activities were measured in the cell lysates(26Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). One-tenth of cell lysate was used to determine β-galactosidase activity. For each CAT reaction, cell extract was combined with 4 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, 55 mCi/mmol, 25 μCi/ml), 10 μl of 20 mg/ml acetyl-coenzyme A, and 250 mM Tris, pH 7.8, to a final volume of 150 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 2 h, and the reactions were stopped by extraction with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. Acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol were separated by thin-layer chromatography. Nuclear proteins were extracted according to the procedure described by Dignam et al.(27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM DTT) and lysed using Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged to collect nuclei, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM DTT), incubated at 4°C for 30 min with gentle stirring, and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was dialyzed several hours against 200 volumes of buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM DTT), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. From the sequence around the footprinted region, double-stranded DNA fragments were prepared by annealing of complement oligonucleotides. The sequences of sense strands of the double stranded oligonucleotides used in this study are: F1: 5′-CTGTGGGGAGGGGGCGTGGCGGCGTGCTGTCACTCACT-GCCC (−539/-498); F1M: 5′-CTGTGGTTCATATCACTGGCGGCGTGCTGTCACTCACTGCCC; F1a: 5′-CTGTGGGGAGGGGGCGTGGC (−539/-520); F1b: 5′-TGGCGGCGTGCTGTCACTCACTGCCC (−523/-498); M1: 5′-TTTATGCGTGCTGTCACTCACTGCCC; M2: 5′-TGGCGGATGTCTGTCACTCACTGCCC; M3: 5′-TGGCGGCGTGCGTGAACTCACTGCCC; M4: 5′-TGGCGGCGTGCTGTCAAGACCTGCCC; M5: 5′-TGGCGGCGTGCTGTCACTCACGTAAC; F2: 5′-TGCCCGCTAGCCAA-TCCACGGGTGCGCCCCTCCCCGGAGAGGG (−502/-460); F2M: 5′-TG-CCCGCTAGCGTCCGTTCGGGTGCGCCCCTCCCCGGAGAGGG; GES1: 5′-TGGGGAGGGGGCGTGG (−536/-521); GES2: 5′-TGCTGTCACTC-ACT (−515/-502); GES3: 5′-TAGCCAATCCACG (−495/-483); Sp1: 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; AP2: 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT; AP1: 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA; NF1/CTF: 5′-CCTTTGGCATGCTGCCAATATG. Mutated sequences are underlined and the locations of the sequences in the PLC-γ1 gene are indicated at the end of each sequence. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by filling in reaction using Klenow fragment. F1a and F1b were 5′-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reactions for gel shift assay were preincubated for 5 min on ice in a total volume of 13 μl containing 12% glycerol, 12 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) · poly(dI-dc) as nonspecific competitor, and 1-2 μg of nuclear extract with or without specific competitor indicated. After addition of 32P-labeled probe (2 × 104 cpm), the mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min at 15°C, then loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels and subjected to electrophoresis for 2 h at 150 V in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 510-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to the positions from −644 to −135 in the PLC-γ1 gene was 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment on the antisense strand. In the binding reaction, 20-50 μg of C2C12 nuclear extract and 5 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled probe were used in the same condition as EMSA in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were chilled on ice and treated with 1-2 units of DNase I (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) in 100 μl of 2 × assay buffer containing 80 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 12 mM MgCl2, 4 mM CaCl2, and 100 mM KCl for 2 min on ice. DNase I reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of stop solution (1 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.5% SDS, 125 mM EDTA, and 0.25 mg/ml tRNA) and incubated at 55°C for 1 h, and then extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v). Resulting DNA fragments were analyzed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels with M13 sequencing ladder as size marker. For the footprinting with Sp1 protein, we used vaccinia-expressed and purified human Sp1 protein (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). To prepare the templates in a phagemid form, the XhoI/HpaI fragment of pPLCγ551CAT which contains the −551/+75 region of the PLC-γ1 gene and CAT gene were inserted into pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) digested by XhoI and EcoRV. The plasmid was named pKS551 and used for preparing single stranded template. pKS479 was constructed with the fragment from pPLCγ479CAT by the same strategy. To generate the mutations at protein binding sites in GPE1, the oligonucleotides, F1M, M3, and F2M, were used as mutagenic oligonucleotides for mutations at GES1, GES2, and GES3 sites, respectively. Uracil-containing DNA templates were prepared by the method of Kunkel(29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were phosphorylated at 5′-ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and annealed with templates. In vitro primer extension was performed using 1 unit of T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and 3 units of T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Corp.) for 5 min on ice, for 5 min at room temperature, and 90 min at 37°C. After the incubation, Escherichia coli strain DH5α was transformed by 1/20 of the reaction mixture. Double and triple mutations were generated using single and double mutated templates, respectively. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Surgical total colorectomy specimens were obtained from the Department of Surgery at the Seoul National University Hospital and the Korea Cancer Center Hospital. Fresh specimens of normal and neoplastic tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for further study. For preparation of whole cell extract, tissue specimens were minced with a razor blade and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.35 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice. After centrifugation, supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. For immunoblot analysis, the whole cell extract was separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and were probed with the anti-PLC-γ1 monoclonal antibody (B-16-5, 1 μg/ml) (30Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Choi W.C. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL system (Amersham Corp.) using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgA + IgM antibody. We have previously reported the 5′-region of the rat PLC-γ1 gene and demonstrated that it contains promoter activity. The promoter regions important for gene expression were found to be located at −551 to −480, −371 to −305, and −90 to −52 base pairs from the transcriptional initiation site, designated as GPE1, GNE1, and GPE2, respectively(23Lee S.-J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The ability of GPE1 to activate a basic heterologous promoter was investigated by inserting it upstream of the E1b-TATA box which is a basic promoter of the adenovirus E1b gene. When the activity was measured in C2C12 cells, GPE1 was observed to stimulate the transcription directed by the E1b-TATA box (Fig. 1). This activity of GPE1 is orientation-dependent, since the activation disappeared when it was reversely oriented. Nuclear extracts from C2C12 cells conferred a pattern of DNase I-protection encompassing the region from −536 to −470 base pairs (Fig. 2A) which roughly matches with GPE1 region. Two double-stranded oligonucleotides, F1 and F2 which correspond to the sequences, [-539 to −498 and −502 to −460, respectively, were used for the competition assays. F1 and F2 competed for binding of nuclear proteins to the corresponding regions (Fig. 2B). To analyze the interactions of GPE1 with nuclear factors in more detail, several oligonucleotides were designed and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3). F1 covers the 5′-part of the DNase I-protected region and F1M contains a mutation around the GC-rich sequence which is related to AP-2 and Sp1-binding sites(23Lee S.-J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). F2 covers the 3′-part of the protected region and F2M contains a mutation in the CCAAT box-like sequence. In the presence of C2C12 nuclear extracts, F1 forms four different DNA-protein complexes, A, B, C, and D from the most slowly-migrating complex as shown in Fig. 3A. Addition of excess unlabeled F1 competitor abolished formation of the complexes with labeled probe. To determine which regions of F1 are responsible for the formation of the protein-DNA complexes, F1M, F1a, and F1b were used as competitors. F1a and F1b correspond to the 5′- and the 3′-part of F1, respectively. In the presence of F1M, only complex B was formed with labeled F1 probe, which suggests that the sequence, −533 GGAGGGGGCG −524, is responsible for the formation of complex B. Consistently, unlabeled F1a which contains the sequence, −533 GGAGGGGGCG −524, but not the 3′-part of F1 abolished the complex B. On the other hand, F1b containing the 3′-part of F1 but not the 5′-part, sequestered the factors forming complexes C and D with the F1 probe. To further localize the site responsible for formation of complexes C and D, 32P-labeled F1b probe and M1-M5 competitors were used in competition assay. Whereas F1b, M1, M2, and M5 worked as effective competitors for the F1b probe, M3 and M4 (especially M3) did not (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the factor(s) forming the complexes C and D bind to the sequence, −512 TGTCACTCA −504. Only a single shifted band, complex E, was detected in the assay with F2 probe (Fig. 3A). Complex E persisted in the presence of excess unlabeled F2M, whereas cold F2 itself effectively competed for the formation of complex E. Therefore, as summarized in Fig. 4, the protein binding sites in the GPE1 region appear to be −533 GGAGGGGGCG −524, −512 TGTCACTCA −504, and −491 CAATCCA −485 which were designated as GES1, GES2, and GES3, respectively.Figure 4:Summary of protein binding sites in GPE1 region. The sequence of the protected region in DNase I footprinting is displayed. The protein binding sites identified by EMSA are shown in boxes and the names of the binding sequences are shown above the boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GES1 site is homologous to Sp1- and AP2-binding sites(23Lee S.-J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 32Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether GES1 binding protein was able to bind to Sp1- or AP2-binding sites by adding the oligonucleotide competitors containing Sp1- or AP2-binding sequences to EMSA. Sp1 competitor abolished formation of complex on the GES1 site (Fig. 5A), whereas GES2 and GES3 binding proteins did not bind to the Sp1 site (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction between GES1 binding protein and Sp1 sequence appeared to be high, since 50 × molar excess of competitors was enough for complete competition. In contrast, the AP2 sequence could not compete with the GES1 site (Fig. 5A). It was also examined whether the Sp1 protein was capable of binding to the GES1 site. As revealed by DNase I footprinting, purified Sp1 protein bound to the GES1 site in proportion to the amount of the protein added (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that GES1 binding protein specifically binds to the Sp1 site and also that Sp1 protein binds to the GES1 site. GES2 site has weak homology to AP1 site(33Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). However, in the competitive EMSA, GES2 binding protein was not able to bind to AP1 site, indicating that GES2 binding protein may not be related to a family of AP1 transcription factor (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the GES3 site is homologous to CCAAT box. From the EMSA using the binding site for NF1/CTF, one of the CCAAT box binding protein(34Santoro C. Mermod N. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), as a cold competitor, it was proved that GES3 binding protein did not bind to the NF1/CTF site (Fig. 5A). In order to understand the function of each protein binding in the GPE1 region, the effects of mutations at the protein binding sites were assessed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 6). For site-directed mutagenesis, pKS551 plasmid was used as a template (see “Materials and Methods”). Transcriptional activities were denoted as percentage of that of pKS551. The activity of pGES123 which has mutations at all protein binding sites in GPE1 was 20.2% relative to that of pKS551. This is consistent with the fact that the relative activity of pKS479 to pKS551 is 25.2%, implying that GES1, GES2, and GES3 sites can represent the whole GPE1 region. Mutation at the GES1 (pGES1) or GES2 (pGES2) sites did not reduce the transcriptional activity, whereas GES3 mutation (pGES3) resulted in a apparent reduction in CAT expression. In the case of the double mutation in which the GES3 site was mutated together with GES1 (pGES13) or GES2 (pGES23) sites, the transcriptional activity of the GPE1 region was completely abolished even though GES2 or GES1 sites still remained intact in each case. On the contrary, pGES12 which has mutations at GES1 and GES2 sites showed twice as high activity as pGES13 or pGES23. From these results, it seems that the GES3 site and at least one of the GES1 and GES2 sites are required for ultimate activity of the GPE1 region. Therefore, transcriptional activation function of the GPE1 region might arise from functional cooperation of the GPE1 binding proteins identified in this study. The functions of GPE1 binding proteins were further analyzed by oligonucleotide reconstitution in the upstream basic promoter, E1b-TATA box (Fig. 7). F2, which contains GES3 site, showed stimulated transcription from E1b-TATA box about 17-fold as compared to E1bCAT, whereas F1 which possesses GES1 and GES2 sites showed no effect. The stimulation by F2 was eliminated by the mutation at the GES3 site, which confirmed the involvement of GES3 binding protein in transcriptional activation. Moreover, pF1F2 was even more active than pF2, indicating that the activating function of F2 was further potentiated by F1 oligonucleotide. These results imply the functional interactions among GPE1 binding proteins. In recent studies, it was reported that human carcinomas contained higher levels of PLC-γ1 than normal cells (14Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Noh D.-Y. Lee Y.H. Kim S.S. Kim Y.I. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Park J.-G. Cancer. 1994; 73: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since the GPE1 region is a strong positive transcriptional regulatory element, we examined the amount of proteins bound to GES1, GES2, and GES3 sites in colorectal cancer and normal tissue extracts to demonstrate whether PLC-γ1 expression may be related to GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding proteins. As observed in previous studies by Noh et al.(15Noh D.-Y. Lee Y.H. Kim S.S. Kim Y.I. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Park J.-G. Cancer. 1994; 73: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the content of PLC-γ1 was higher in 9 out of 11 cases of colorectal cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 8). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the amounts of GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding proteins increased in 7 of 9 cases where PLC-γ1 was overexpressed, when compared with normal tissues. On the contrary, there was no significant increase in PLC-γ1 content in 2 out of 11 cases and these cases consistently showed no difference in the GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding proteins compared with normal tissues (data not shown). These results indicate that the increase of PLC-γ1 content seems to be well associated with the increase of GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding activities in colorectal cancer tissues. The expression of the PLC-γ1 gene is regulated during various physiologic events such as carcinogenesis and differentiation(14Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of PLC-γ1 expression is still obscure. In this study, we have characterized the GPE1 region which is one of the transcriptional regulatory regions upstream of the PLC-γ1 gene along with the nuclear factors that bind to this region. By DNase I footprinting and EMSA, the proteins bound to GPE1 were identified and their binding sites were determined. Formation of four different complexes with F1 probe was observed and named complexes A, B, C, and D. Complex B appeared to be formed by interaction of the protein to the sequence, −533 GGAGGGGGCG −524, designated as GES1. Complexes C and D seem to be generated with the same DNA sequence, −512 TGTCACTCA −504, designated as GES2. The two GES2 binding proteins might be two different proteins derived from different genes or two different forms of a protein from a single gene. The two GES2 binding proteins shared several physical properties, including optimal temperature and optimal salt concentration for DNA binding, and thermostability (data not shown). It is, therefore, more likely that GES2 binding proteins are the products of a single gene, which could be generated by an alternative splicing or protein modification. The complex A is considered to be a multicomplex, which includes GES1 and GES2 binding proteins, by the following reasons: 1) complex A was detected only under the conditions that both GES1 and GES2 sites are occupied. Complex A disappeared when binding of either GES1 or GES2 was hindered (Fig. 3A). 2) When the amount of nuclear protein increased gradually in EMSA, more complex A was formed. However, the formation of complex B, C, and D reached the peak at 5 μg and then decreased with additional nuclear proteins (data not shown). 3) Inhibition of the protein binding to GES1 site by competition with F1a increased complexes C and D, compared with the reaction without competitors (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of the binding on GES2 site, on the other hand, increased formation of complex B. GES1 site is similar to AP2 and Sp1 sites. Purified Sp1 proteins recognized the GES1 site, and GES1 binding protein also bound to the oligonucleotide containing the Sp1-binding site. An oligonucleotide containing the AP2-binding site, on the contrary, was not recognized by GES1 binding protein. These data suggested that C2C12 nuclear protein factor binding to the GES1 site shared sequence specificity with Sp1 protein. Sp1 enhances the transcription of epidermal growth factor receptor(35Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6329-6336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in cases with the overexpression of Sp1, the mRNA of epidermal growth factor receptor was expressed in high levels in human gastric carcinomas(36Kitadai Y. Yasui W. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Haruma K. Kajiyama G. Tahara E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that PLC-γ1 was overexpressed and colocalized with epidermal growth factor receptor in human breast cancer(14Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and the fact that Sp1 can bind to the GPE1 region of the PLC-γ1 gene, it can be suggested that Sp1 may be a transcriptional regulator of PLC-γ1 gene as well as epidermal growth factor receptor gene. However, several transcription factors which belong to the Sp1 family have been cloned, and some of them share the binding specificity with Sp1 protein (37Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 38Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 39Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that GES1 binding protein might be a member of the Sp1 family rather than Sp1 itself. On the other hand, although the GES2 site is weakly homologous to the AP1 site, the GES2 binding protein did not bind to the AP1 site. This result suggests that GES2 binding protein might be a novel DNA-binding protein. The identity of GES3 binding protein is also obscure. As the GES3 site is similar to the CCAAT box, it could be one of the CCAAT box binding proteins or could be a novel kind of transcription factor. Among CCAAT box binding proteins, NF1/CTF does not seem to be the GES3 binding protein, since the GES3 binding protein was not able to bind to the NF1/CTF site. GPE1 region could stimulate the transcription from the heterologous promoter, E1b-TATA box (Fig. 1), even though the promoter of PLC-γ1 gene is TATA-less. Therefore, we propose that GPE1 is a general transcriptional activating element. Moreover, activating function of GPE1 is nearly abolished by orienting it reversely. This suggests elaborate interactions among GPE1 binding proteins and basic transcriptional machinery. The function of each protein binding site at the GPE1 region was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis. GES3 alone can activate the transcription from the PLC-γ1 gene, whereas GES1 or GES2 alone were not able to activate transcription by itself. However, GES3 needs to cooperate with GES1 or GES2 for full activity, implying that GES3 functionally cooperates with the other GPE1 binding proteins. Therefore, it is likely that the minimum requirement for GPE1 activity may be GES3 and at least one of GES1 and GES2. In other words, GES1 and GES2 might be redundant for the transcriptional activity of GPE1 since only one of them can make up ultimate activity of GPE1 region by functional cooperation with GES3. In contrast, GES3 seems to be necessary for full activity of GPE1 since mutation at the GES3 site caused reduction of transcriptional activity, whereas mutations at GES1 or GES2 did not. The specific roles of these GPE1 binding proteins are still obscure. One possible explanation is that the GES3 binding protein may influence the transcription by direct interaction with basic transcription machinery, whereas GES1 and GES2 binding proteins may modulate the activity of GES3 binding protein. This explanation is partly supported by the oligonucleotide reconstitution experiment (Fig. 7). F2 oligonucleotide containing GES3 site could stimulate E1b-TATA box, whereas F1 oligonucleotide which possesses GES1 and GES2 sites did not augment the transcription by itself. However, F1 oligonucleotide was able to potentiate the transcriptional activation function of F2 oligonucleotide. Recent studies showed that human primary breast carcinomas and colorectal carcinomas contained considerably higher levels of PLC-γ1 than normal tissues(14Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Noh D.-Y. Lee Y.H. Kim S.S. Kim Y.I. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Park J.-G. Cancer. 1994; 73: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the factors that cause the overexpression of PLC-γ1 in cancer cells remained uncovered. In this study, we have identified the DNA binding proteins to GPE1, one of the transcriptional regulatory regions of the PLC-γ1 gene, and examined the PLC-γ1 expression and the amount of GPE1 binding proteins in colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Immunoblot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed the correlation between PLC-γ1 expression and the content of GPE1 binding proteins in 9 out of 11 cases; GPE1 binding proteins increased in 7 of 9 cases where PLC-γ1 increased, and in the other 2 cases where PLC-γ1 did not increase, the amount of GPE1 binding proteins was not changed either. These results suggest that the increase of GPE1 binding activities might be important for the overexpression of PLC-γ1 in cancer cells. The cooperation of GPE1 binding proteins (GES1, GES2, and GES3 binding proteins) was suggested by mutational analyses. Since all the binding proteins to GES1, GES2, and GES3 sites were elevated in cancer tissues, the cooperation of GPE1 binding proteins might occur in carcinomas to overproduce PLC-γ1, which may result in the amplification of the proliferation signal. The isolation of each GPE1 binding protein might be an essential step to understand the process of tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we have identified and analyzed at least three sites (GES1, GES2, and GES3), to which several transcription factors bind, in the GPE1 region of PLC-γ1 promoter. GPE1 binding proteins might cooperate with each other to confer trans-regulation to PLC-γ1 expression. The contents of these GPE1 binding proteins were higher in colorectal cancer tissues than in normal tissues as was that of PLC-γ1. Therefore, we propose that the increase of GPE1 binding proteins and their cooperation might be attributed to the overexpression of PLC-γ1 in carcinomas. We thank Drs. C. B. Chae and S. K.

Franki H. Ding G. Kidney Int. 1987; 31: 530-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Pioneering studies by Orloff and Handler (2Orloff J. Handler J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1962; 41: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) suggested that cAMP acts as a second messenger for both of these effects. Subsequent studies confirmed that activation of adenylate cyclase, and thus the generation of cAMP, mediates AVP stimulation of water transport, because inhibition of the enzyme with 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) abolishes the response(3Dillingham M.A. Anderson R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 88: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the role of cAMP in AVP stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport remains in question, for there are as yet no studies demonstrating a direct dependence of Na+ transport on cAMP generation.AVP can bind and activate two types of cell surface receptors: V2 receptors, present in renal epithelial cells and some amphibian epithelia, are coupled to adenylate cyclase via a cholera toxin-sensitive G protein, whereas V1 receptors, present mainly in smooth muscle, mesangial cells, hepatocytes, and central nervous system neurons, are linked to a calcium-dependent transduction system(4Ando Y. Jacobson H.R. Breyer M.D. News Physiol. Sci. 1988; 3: 235-240Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, have demonstrated V1 receptors in rabbit cortical collecting tubule cells (5Burnatowska-Hiedin M.A. Spielman W.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, we have reported that a calcium-dependent mechanism mediates aldosterone(6Petzel D. Ganz M.B. Nestler E.J. Lewis J.J. Goldenring J. Akcicek F. Hayslett J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) -, adenosine(7Hayslett J.P. Macala L.J. Smallwood J.I. Kalghatgi L. Gassala-Herraiz J. Isales C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1576-1584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) -, and insulin-stimulated (8Rodriguez-Commes J. Isales C. Kalghatgi L. Gassala-Herraiz J. Hayslett J.P. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 666-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) electrogenic sodium transport in amphibian renal epithelial (A6) cells. We have therefore investigated whether AVP stimulation of Na+ transport is similarly linked to a Ca2+-dependent messenger system via activation of a V1 or V1-like receptor.MATERIALS AND METHODSNa+ TransportExperiments were performed on a clone of A6 cells derived from the kidney of Xenopus laevis. These cells, provided by Gregory Grillo, Walter Reed Research Institute, were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection and cloned by limiting dilution (clone A6-S2). The methods employed for cell culture, measurement of net sodium transport, and study of inhibitory agents have been reported recently(7Hayslett J.P. Macala L.J. Smallwood J.I. Kalghatgi L. Gassala-Herraiz J. Isales C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1576-1584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown to confluence on porous membranes (Millicell-HA cups, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and studied when fully differentiated 10-14 days after subculture. Net Na+ transport was determined from the equivalent short circuit (Ieq), calculated from the open circuit measurements of VT and RT using Ohm's law, which represents the net current associated with active ion transport when VT = O mV. Data are expressed as the change in Ieq above the initial level observed in control and experimental monolayers at 30 min after addition of agonist or control vehicle. The agonist or vehicle was added to media on the basal surface of monolayers in a volume that was 1% of the media volume. Although basal Ieq varied between different passages, agonist-induced changes were proportional to basal values.The transepithelial potential difference (VT) was used to estimate the time of onset of agonist-induced changes in Na+ transport, because this parameter is more sensitive to rapid changes than measurement of Ieq. VT changes in parallel with Ieq. Continuous recordings were made with a strip recorder before and after addition of AVP. To avoid transient disturbances in culture media, culture cups were maintained in an incubator at 27°C.Intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i)Ca2i+ was measured in suspended cells which had been grown to confluence on porous Falcon membranes with an active surface of 4.5 cm2. These larger membranes were used to obtain a yield appropriate for the assay. Previous studies demonstrated that basal and hormone-stimulated changes in Ieq were comparable when cells were grown on Millipore HA culture cups or on Falcon membranes (data not shown). Porous membranes were employed, because cells grown on a nonporous surface, such as glass or culture plastic, did not generate cAMP in response to AVP, suggesting that such growth conditions altered receptor expression and/or availability. However, the transparent porous membranes were found to be unsuitable for measurement of Ca2+i, because autofluorescence prohibited adequate signal to noise ratios. Therefore, suspended cells were used, recovered by gentle scraping in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mM EGTA (no trypsin).The method used to measure Ca2+i with Fura-2/AM was recently reported(7Hayslett J.P. Macala L.J. Smallwood J.I. Kalghatgi L. Gassala-Herraiz J. Isales C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1576-1584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The use of suspended cells prohibited rapid removal of Fura-2 leaked to the external bathing solution which was detectable after about 5 min. Continuous recordings of Ca2+i, therefore, did not exceed approximately 5 min.Inositol Trisphosphate (IP3)The methods used to measure total cellular IP3 were previously reported(7Hayslett J.P. Macala L.J. Smallwood J.I. Kalghatgi L. Gassala-Herraiz J. Isales C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1576-1584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence on Falcon membranes. In brief, total IP3 was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography from cells labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (50 μCi/ml) for 48 h in inositol free amphibian Ringer's solution. Preliminary studies demonstrated that under this condition basal and hormone-stimulated Ieq values were comparable with those in normal culture media (data not shown). LiCl was not added to the external bathing solution.Cyclic AMPTotal cellular cAMP was measured as described (7Hayslett J.P. Macala L.J. Smallwood J.I. Kalghatgi L. Gassala-Herraiz J. Isales C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1576-1584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with a radioimmunoassay kit obtained from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). Confluent cells grown on Falcon membranes were exposed to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO-201724 (100 μM) for 15 min before addition of agonist. Following a 10-min treatment with agonist, the reactions were terminated by addition of cold 6% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation to remove precipitated material, trichloroacetic acid was extracted by the Freon/tri-N-octylamine technique(9Riss T.L. Zorich N.L. Williams N.L. Richardson A. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1980; . 3: 133-158Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as total cAMP accumulated at 10 min/mg of protein.cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA) MeasurementsThe activity of PKA was determined with a commercial kit (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) that measures the phosphorylation of a fluorescently labeled substrate peptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide)(10Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent electrophoresis in an 0.8% agarose gel provides clear separation of the substrate species: the phosphorylated species migrates toward the anode, whereas the unphosphorylated remainder migrates toward the cathode. The measured fluorescence of the phosphorylated band, visualized under UV light, is directly proportional to the amount of peptide phosphorylated by active kinase.Monolayers of A6 cells, grown to confluence on Falcon membranes, were treated for 30 min with AVP and were then immediately placed on ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The phosphate-buffered saline was aspirated from the apical side and replaced with 250 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), containing 10 μM leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM disodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EGTA. Cells were scraped from the membrane with a rubber policeman and homogenized by probe sonication for 15 s (Kontes, model KT-50 Micro Ultrasonic Cell Disrupter). Samples were aliquoted and stored at −70°C until assayed.The PKA assay reaction was run with 6-9 μg of homogenate protein, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 60 μM fluorescently tagged Kemptide (PepTag A1 peptide) in a final volume of 25 μl. Samples were incubated at 30°C for 15 min. Each cell extract was assayed in duplicate in both the absence and presence of 1 μM cAMP to determine the fraction of total enzyme (+cAMP) that was endogenously activated (-cAMP). In parallel samples, the inclusion of the PKA-specific inhibitor IP20 (5 μM) (11Cheng H.C. Kemp B. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enabled calculation of true PKA activity: non-inhibitable (non-PKA) phosphorylation was subtracted from total measured phosphorylation.After agarose electrophoresis of all samples, the relevant gel pieces were excised, brought to a volume of 0.5 ml with deionized water, and heated in boiling water until the gel was liquified. Fluorescence was then determined (Perkin-Elmer LS-5 spectrofluorometer), using an excitation wavelength of 568 nm and an emission wavelength of 592 nm. Calculated PKA-specific enzyme activities are expressed in fluorescence units generated per 10 μg of cellular protein/15 min.In Situ Inhibition of PKAExperiments were also performed to directly inhibit PKA in intact A6 cells with the highly selective antagonist IP20. To increase cell membrane permeability, and thus increase cellular uptake of the applied polypeptide, monolayers of A6 cells were exposed to 5 μM IP20 while chilled, but not frozen, at −20°C for 10 min (suggested by Dr. Adrian Katz). Subsequently, cells were allowed to recover in the same bathing solution for 90 min in a 27°C incubator before experiments were performed. The effects of chilling on the basal properties of the monolayers and on hormone responsiveness were determined by comparison with cells from the same seeding that were not subject to the chilling procedure.ReagentsAVP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP), trifluoperazine, Freon, and tri-N-octylamine were obtained from Sigma. Additional chemicals were obtained from the following vendors: chelerythrine, Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel); forskolin and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, Calbiochem; DDA, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; RO-201724, Biomol Research Laboratory, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA); Fura-2/AM and 5,5′-dimethyl BAPTA/AM, Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); amiloride was a gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme; and 7,8-dihydroxychloropromazine was provided by Research Biochemical, Inc., as part of the Chemical Synthesis Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, Contract 278-90-007(BS).Statistical AnalysisStatistical comparisons were made using the unpaired Student's t test. The Dunnett test was used when multiple experimental groups were compared with a single control group. A p < 0.05 was regarded as denoting statistical significance.RESULTSEffect of AVP on Electrogenic Sodium TransportAddition of AVP to medium bathing the basal surface of A6 monolayers stimulated Ieq at a minimal concentration of 1 nM (Fig. 1A). Higher concentrations progressively increased Ieq up to 10-fold at 1 μM. AVP was found to increase VT within 6 s (Fig. 1B). The response persisted for about 3.5 h, but decayed progressively after the first hour. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an AVP-induced increase in Ieq in less than 1 min. The stimulation of Ieq was abolished by 100 μM amiloride in the apical solution, indicating that Ieq reflected electrogenic sodium transport: control, 1.6 ± 0.1 μA.cm-2; AVP, 3.1 ± 0.1; AVP + amiloride, 0.4 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.E.).Role of Intracellular Calcium in the Action of AVPAddition of AVP to A6 cells also resulted in an immediate dose-dependent rise in Ca2+i, as indicated by Fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 2). The time and dose dependencies of the Ca2+i response were similar to those of the Ieq response (Fig. 1, A and B). AVP appeared not to stimulate Ca2+ influx during the period of observation, because addition of 100 μM MnCl2 did not quench intracellular Fura-2 fluorescence during stimulation; Mn2+ enters cells via activated Ca2+ channels and displaces Ca2+ from Fura-2(12Sage S.O.

AVP induced a dose-dependent increase in Ca2+i, reflected by an increase in the fluorescence ratio (expressed in arbitrary units) of Fura-2 at an emission of 510 nm, during dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm (A-C). These data obtained in a single experiment are representative of 10 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether AVP-stimulated sodium transport was dependent on this increase in Ca2+i monolayers were preloaded (2.5 h) with the calcium chelator 5,5′-dimethyl BAPTA. Fig. 3 shows that BAPTA dose-dependently inhibited subsequent stimulation of Ieq by 1 μM AVP, with an apparent Kiof approximately 10 μM. These results therefore imply that AVP stimulation of Ieq is mediated by an increase in Ca2+i.Figure 3:Effect of Ca2+i chelation by BAPTA on AVP-induced Ieq.

Initially, total IP3 was measured before and after addition of 1 μM AVP. As shown in Fig. 4A, an increase in IP3 was observed at 10 s, reached a maximum at 30 s, and persisted for at least 300 s. Subsequently, a dose-response analysis was performed by measuring IP3 levels at 30 s after addition of various AVP concentrations. Fig. 4B shows that AVP increased IP3 in the range of 10 nM to 1 μM. The lack of a progressive rise in IP3 with high concentrations of AVP may have resulted from increased rates of degradation (uninhibited because LiCl was not used).Figure 4:AVP stimulation of total inositol trisphosphate (IP3).

Values are mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These studies together provide strong evidence that the action of AVP to stimulate electrogenic Na+ transport depends on an increase in Ca2+i via turnover of membrane bound phospholipids and IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial intracellular stores.The role of Calcium-dependent Effectors in AVP-stimulated IeqThe demonstration that AVP causes a rise in IP3 implies that diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of protein kinase C (PKC), is also produced. Studies were performed to determine whether PKC appears to play a role in Na+ transport stimulation by AVP. In these experiments the effect of three PKC antagonists on AVP-stimulated Ieq were examined.Dihydroxychloropromazine, highly specific for PKC with a Ki of 8 μM for PKC (Ki values for other kinases > 50 μM)(13Aftab D.T. Ballas L.M. Loomis C.R. Hait W.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 798-805PubMed Google Scholar), dose-dependently inhibited AVP stimulation of Ieq (Fig. 5A), with an apparent Kiof approximately 12 μM. The second selective antagonist, chelerythrine, is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid that exhibits an apparent Ki for PKC of 0.7 μM in rat brain tissue under in vitro conditions (Ki values for other kinases > 100 μM)(14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Chelerythrine half-maximally inhibited AVP-stimulated Ieq in intact cells at approximately 3 μM (Fig. 5B). In addition, trifluoperazine, which inhibits calmodulin kinase as well as PKC, reduced the action of AVP by 50% at a Ki of approximately 25 μM (Fig. 5C), a value that corresponds to the Ki for PKC inhibition in reports for other types of intact cells(15Smolen J.E. Korchak H.M. Weissmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 677: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Hidaka H. Sasaki Y. Tahaka T. Endo T. Ohno S. Fujii Y. Nagata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4354-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the onset of AVP stimulation of Ieq is dependent on PKC activation.Figure 5:Effects of specific kinase inhibitors on AVP-stimulated Ieq.

The cAMP level, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO-201724, increased 8-fold from the control value of 19 ± 1.6 pmol/mg protein to 138 ± 12 at 1 μM AVP. However, after preloading cells with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor DDA, which binds to the “P” site on the catalytic subunit of the enzyme(17Wolff J. Londos C. Cooper D.M.F. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 199-213PubMed Google Scholar), AVP failed to induce cAMP generation at any concentration that was previously shown to stimulate Ieq (1 nM to 1 μM, Fig. 1A).Figure 6:The effect of DDA on the AVP-induced accumulation of cAMP and Ieq.

Values are mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The corresponding effect of DDA on AVP stimulation of Ieq is shown in Fig. 6B. Despite its abolition of cAMP generation, DDA did not significantly reduce the ability of AVP to stimulate Ieq, indicating that AVP stimulation of Na+ transport was independent of cAMP generation.Role of Protein Kinase APKA is the major intracellular target for cAMP. Activation of this enzyme is therefore expected to occur as a result of AVP-induced cAMP generation. However, one would predict that DDA would abolish such PKA activation if it were completely effective in inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Further experiments were, therefore, performed to test these predictions.The percent of PKA activation (-cAMP/+cAMP) in control monolayers was 44 ± 7%, as shown in Fig. 7. Addition of 1 μM AVP increased the percent activation of PKA to 62 ± 4% (p < 0.05) an increase of 41% above control. This change is consistent with other reports regarding PKA stimulation by high concentrations of other cAMP-elevating agonists; isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2, for example, increased fractional activation of true PKA by 50% in tracheal smooth muscle(18Torphy T.J. Freese W.B. Rinard G.A. Brunton L.L. Mayer S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11609-11616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, preloading A6 cells with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor DDA abolished AVP stimulation of PKA; the fractional PKA activation was then only 46 ± 5% (p = not significant, compared with control).Figure 7:The effect of AVP on PKA activity in the absence or presence of DDA (100 μM).

Nevertheless, an additional study was performed to rule out PKA in mediating the action of AVP. To directly suppress the enzyme in situ intact cells were loaded with the specific PKA inhibitor IP20, added to the external bathing solution at a concentration of 5 μM. This experiment was prompted by reports that sufficient cellular loading of the polypeptide could be achieved in renal proximal tubules to inhibit dopamine-induced, cAMP-mediated inhibition of Na-K-ATPase (19Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or the apically located Na:H antiporter(20Felder C.C. Campbell T. Albrecht F. Jose P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F297-F303PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers were chilled briefly at −20°C for 10 min to enhance the cellular uptake of the polypeptide by increasing cell membrane permeability. After recovery at a normal temperature, cells were exposed to either control vehicle or 1 μM AVP for 30 min and, then, allocated either for assay for PKA activity or measurement of electrogenic sodium transport.In control cells (vehicle alone) the percent of PKA activation was 16 ± 0.5%, whereas in the AVP-treated group the activated fraction was 24 ± 2%, an increase of 50% (since data are the mean of two separate experiments, the variance is shown as error bars). In cells preloaded with IP20 before treatment with AVP the percent activation was 18 ± 0.1%, indicating that intracellular IP20 completely blocked the action of AVP to stimulate PKA. Transport studies verified that cold exposure did not result in injury to the cell monolayer. Ninety minutes after the chilling process, neither basal resistance nor basal Ieq of monolayers were reduced compared with control values, shown in Table I. In addition, Table I indicates that abolition of PKA activation by IP20 did not inhibit AVP-stimulated Ieq, compared with control.Table I:Demonstration of the effects of cold exposure and IP20 loading on transepithelial resistance (RT) and AVP-stimulated Ieq Open table in a new tab Mechanism of Forskolin- and 8-CPT-cAMP-mediated Na+TransportThe observation that forskolin and/or analogues of cAMP induce a biological response is often used as evidence that the effect in question is mediated by cAMP. Since these reagents have recently been shown to stimulate various transport processes by cAMP-independent mechanisms, studies were performed to determine their action mechanisms in stimulating electrogenic Na+ transport. Forskolin is a naturally occurring diterpene that activates adenylate cyclase after binding to the catalytic subunit, or Gs-catalytic subunit complex (21Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1986; 20: 1-150Google Scholar). Application of forskolin to A6 cells caused an increase in cAMP accumulation at 100 nM and above (Fig. 8A). Preloading cells with DDA abolished cAMP generation at 100 nM forskolin and reduced it by approximately 60% at 1 μM. Despite complete or partial inhibition of cAMP production, DDA did not significantly reduce forskolin stimulation of Ieq (Fig. 8B).Figure 8:The effect of DDA on forskolin-induced cAMP generation and Ieq.

These cells were still capable of exocytosis. Their contents in catecholamine and chromogranin A, components of the granule matrix, and cytochrome b561, a major protein of the granule membrane, were decreased to 35, 30, and 50% of control cells, respectively. However, in the same cells, the number of [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding sites, a specific ligand of the vesicular monoamine transporter, was increased to 180% of controls. In situ uptake of noradrenaline in permeabilized cells indicated that [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding sites were associated with a functional vesicular monoamine transporter. When analyzed by isopycnic centrifugation, these sites cosedimented with catecholamine, chromogranin A, and cytochrome b561, in a peak with a density lighter than that from controls. The composition of this peak suggests that it contains incompletely matured secretory granules, with a 3-5-fold increase in the vesicular monoamine transporter content of this membrane. This increase might indicate that an adaptative process occurs which allows a faster filling of the granules in continuously secreting cells.

This increase might indicate that an adaptative process occurs which allows a faster filling of the granules in continuously secreting cells. Trans-synaptic induction (stimulation-secretion-synthesis coupling) is an important regulatory process, allowing the neuron to adapt to a strong stimulation by increasing the rate of synthesis of proteins required for secretion(1Thoenen H. Life Sci. 1974; 14: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Trans-synaptic induction was initially observed for the biosynthetic enzymes of adrenal medulla, tyrosine hydroxylase(2Thoenen H. Mueller R.A. Axelrod J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1969; 160: 249-253Google Scholar), and dopamine β-hydroxylase(3Patrick R.L. Kirshner N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1971; 7: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar), but it has been extended to proteins of the chromaffin granule matrix, such as proenkephalin(4Kanamatzu T. Unsworth C.D. Diliberto E.J. Viveros O.H. Hong J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9245-9249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Strong stimulation may therefore change the composition of the “secretory mixture”(5Sietzen M. Schober M. Fischer-Colbrie R. Scherman D. Sperk G. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), presumably for physiological purposes. These adaptative changes can be reproduced in vitro by stimulation with nicotinic agonists or by depolarization of bovine chromaffin cells in culture(6Eiden L.E. Giraud P. Dave J.R. Hotchkiss A.J. Affolter H.U. Nature. 1984; 312: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Kley N. Loeffler J.P. Pittius C.W. Höllt V.

In adrenal medulla, the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway involves the translocation of dopamine from the cytosol to the chromaffin granule matrix. The uptake is catalyzed by the vesicular monoamine transporter, a H+/monoamine antiporter utilizing the H+-electrochemical gradient generated by an ATP-dependent proton pump of the V-type(9Johnson R.G. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 232-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The same transporter also operates in monoaminergic neurons, although two genes, VMAT1 and VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporter 1 and 2)1( 1The abbreviations used are: VMATvesicular monoamine transporter cytochromeTBZtetrabenazineTBZOHdihydrotetrabenazine (2-hydroxy-3-isobutyl-9,10-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7-hexahydro-11bH-benzo-[α]quinolizine)[3H]TBZOH[2-3H]dihydrotetrabenazinePBSphosphate buffered salineBSAbovine serum albumin. )encoding this activity have been recently described(10Liu Y.

Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In rats, VMAT1 is expressed in adrenal medulla, whereas VMAT2 is present in the brain. On the other hand, both genes are expressed in bovine adrenal medulla (12Krejci E. Gasnier B. Botton D. Isambert M.F. Sagné C. Gagnon J. Massoulié J. Henry J.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Howell M. Shirvan A. Stern-Bach Y. Steiner-Mordoch S. Strasser J.E. Dean G.E. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and from analysis of the N-terminal extremity of the chromaffin granule protein VMAT2 is the major gene(14Gasnier B. Krejci E. Botton D. Massoulié J. Henry J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Several ligands are specific for the vesicular monoamine transporter, such as reserpine or dihydrotetrabenazine ([3H]TBZOH)(15Henry J.P. Scherman D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2395-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These ligands are useful tools not only for biochemical experiments, but also for physiological studies, including study of the regulation of the expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter. After an insulin shock, the number of [3H]TBZOH binding sites of rat adrenal medulla increased for several days and was maximal after 4-6 days(5Sietzen M. Schober M. Fischer-Colbrie R. Scherman D. Sperk G. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A similar increase was observed in vitro in bovine chromaffin cells in culture(16Desnos C. Laran M.P. Scherman D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The [3H]TBZOH binding site increase was maximal after several days of culture in the presence of carbamylcholine or depolarizing concentrations of potassium ions. The response involved Ca2+ channels, and it was mimicked by forskolin and by phorbol esters. Increase in the number of binding sites seemed likely to involve transcriptional activation, since it was blocked by actinomycin and cycloheximide. The hypothesis of a regulated expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter was strongly supported by the finding that K+ depolarization of bovine chromaffin cells increased the transcription of the VMAT2 gene, encoding the tetrabenazine-sensitive vesicular monoamine transporter(12Krejci E. Gasnier B. Botton D. Isambert M.F. Sagné C. Gagnon J. Massoulié J. Henry J.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This was clearly seen on Northern blots, and competitive polymerase chain reaction indicated a 3-fold increase in VMAT2 expression after a 6-h depolarization in 55 mM KCl. The concept of trans-synaptic induction might therefore be extended to the vesicular monoamine transporter. vesicular monoamine transporter cytochrome tetrabenazine dihydrotetrabenazine (2-hydroxy-3-isobutyl-9,10-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7-hexahydro-11bH-benzo-[α]quinolizine) [2-3H]dihydrotetrabenazine phosphate buffered saline bovine serum albumin. What are the consequences of an increased expression of the gene at the cellular level? Does an increase of the monoamine transporter result in a differential change in the composition of the secretory granule membrane? To answer these questions, we analyzed cells cultured for 5 days in high K+ medium, which doubled their [3H]TBZOH binding site content, and characterized their secretory granules. We determined the subcellular distribution of [3H]TBZOH binding sites in these cells, and we investigated the functional meaning of this increase. For ultrastructural analysis, cell cultures grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2). Cells were post-fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ascending ethanol solutions, and flat-embedded in Spurr epoxy resin (17Moro M.A. Garcia A.G. Langley O.K. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For morphometric analysis, sections of randomly chosen areas were cut at uniform thickness (silver interference color) from control and KCl-treated chromaffin cell cultures. To eliminate variations due to differences in distributions between the various cell compartments, entire sections were photographed at a constant microscope magnification (× 3900), and negatives were subsequently enlarged to give a final magnification of × 8900. The number of secretory granules was counted and recorded for each cell profile in each micrograph. Granules were classified as either noradrenergic or adrenergic on the basis of their ultrastructural appearance. Adrenergic granules were taken as those with a larger diameter and lower uniform density of granule matrix, whereas granules with very dense contents separated from the granule membrane by an electron-lucent space were classified as noradrenergic(18Hopwood D. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1971; 3: 1-66Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Each cell profile was then cut out on a photocopy the same size as the micrograph and weighed, to provide a relative estimate of the area. The actual surface area was determined by comparison with the weight of a known area of photocopy paper, which enabled granule density/100 μm2 to be calculated. Chromaffin cells plated on collagen-coated 35-mm coverslips at about 106 cells/coverslip were fixed for 30 min in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from p-formaldehyde), washed in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in “blocking solution” (5% BSA in PBS). Double immunofluorescence was performed by incubating cultures simultaneously for 2 h at room temperature with the two primary antisera: mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (Euromedex, Strasbourg, France) and a previously characterized (19Anouar Y. de Monti M. Galindo E. Bénié T. Aunis D. Duval J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1991; 3: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide named CAP14, residues 316-329 in the sequence of bovine chromogranin A. These were diluted 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively, in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. After PBS washes, bound antibody was detected with affinity-purified rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Euromedex, Strasbourg, France), diluted 1:200 in PBS/BSA. Coverslips were examined with a Zeiss Microscope II equipped with Neofluor objectives and the appropriate fluorescent barrier filters, and selected fields were photographed on Ilford HP5 film. Bovine chromaffin cells were isolated and purified as described (16Desnos C. Laran M.P. Scherman D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They were suspended at 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 μM cytosine arabinoside, 10 μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 50 units/ml of penicillin and plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 2-cm diameter wells or 5 × 106 cells in 5-cm diameter Petri dishes or 20-30 × 106 cells in 75-cm2 flasks. They were incubated for 2 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2-saturated atmosphere. The culture medium was then changed, and salts or drugs were added. Cells were harvested by scraping in Locke medium or in 0.2% Triton X-100. The vesicular monoamine transporter was assayed by measuring [3H]TBZOH binding(20Scherman D. Jaudon P. Henry J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Samples from cell homogenates or fractions of centrifugation gradients were incubated for 1 h with 3 nM [3H]TBZOH in 1 ml of Locke medium containing 25 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) at 25°C, and filtered on HAWP filters (Millipore). Nonspecific binding was obtained by adding 3 μM TBZ to the incubation. Previous analyses (16Desnos C. Laran M.P. Scherman D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) indicated a homogenous class of binding sites in control and K+-depolarized cells with a Kd of 16 nM and a Bmax value of 1 pmol/mg of protein for control cells homogenates. Catecholamines were measured by the trihydroxyindole technique(21Von Euler U.S. Lishajko F. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1961; 51: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). To estimate the cellular catecholamine content, cells were scraped with 200 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100, the extract was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (6% final concentration), and the supernatant was assayed for catecholamines. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were estimated by fluorometry after differential oxidation(22Peyrin L. Cottet-Emard J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b561 in cellular or subcellular fractions was estimated by semiquantitative immunoblotting(16Desnos C. Laran M.P. Scherman D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), using an anti-cytochrome b561 antiserum (generous gift from Dr. D. Apps), at 1:1500 dilution, and radioiodinated protein A. The same approach was used to assay intracellular or released chromogranin A, with an anti-chromogranin A antiserum at 1:500 dilution detected by radioiodinated protein A or by anti-rabbit immunoglobulin alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Alternatively, subcellular fractions from the centrifugation gradients were assayed for chromogranin A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(23Bader M.F. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Anhert-Hilger G. Gratzl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay was linear up to 20 ng of chromogranin A. Chromaffin cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in Locke medium containing 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, and 1 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and then for 45 min in 500 μl of the same medium to which 10 μM [3H]noradrenaline (0.3 μCi/ml) was added. When the effects of TBZ and desipramine were tested, these drugs were added during the uptake period at 3 and 4 μM concentration, respectively. Cells were washed four times for 10 min with Locke solution containing 2.5 mM CaCl2 and twice for 5 min with calcium-free Locke solution. Under the conditions used, K+-depolarized and control cells contained the same radioactivity. Cells were stimulated by suspension in 250 μl of Locke solution, with or without 2.5 mM CaCl2, containing 55 mM KCl or 20 μM nicotine. The radioactivity in the cells and in the centrifuged extracellular fluids was measured by liquid scintillation. Release of [3H]noradrenaline was expressed as the percentage of total radioactivity present in the cells prior to stimulation in calcium containing media. Secretion after permeabilization by streptolysin O was tested as described previously (24Sarafian T. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After 5 days in control or in K+-containing medium, cells were rapidly washed with 1 ml of Locke solution containing 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, and 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. They were either immediately stimulated or preincubated for 45 min at 37°C in 500 μl of calcium containing Locke solution, before stimulation. Cells were stimulated by resuspension in the wash medium containing either 55 mM KCl or 20 μM nicotine, in the presence or absence of 2.5 mM CaCl2. Catecholamines were assayed fluorometrically, in the external medium and in the cell pellet. Release of catecholamines was expressed as the percentage of the total catecholamine cell content. Chromaffin cells were washed with 1 ml of Locke solution containing 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. They were permeabilized by incubation with streptolysin O (4 units/well) in 200 μl of 150 mM potassium glutamate, 0.2% BSA, 4 mM ATP, 3 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM nitrilotriacetic acid, pH 7.2, for 3 min and washed twice with 500 μl of medium without streptolysin O. [3H]Noradrenaline uptake was measured in 500 μl of the same medium containing 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM pargyline, 10 μM [3H]noradrenaline (0.15-0.6 μCi/ml), at 25°C. To avoid interference from endogenous monoamines, the [3H]noradrenaline concentration was adjusted with unlabeled noradrenaline to 10 μM, a concentration which is saturating for the vesicular monoamine transporter. Moreover, the concentration of endogenous catecholamines in the external medium after permeabilization was the same in K+-treated and control cells. Nonspecific uptake was measured by addition of 3 μM TBZ to the incubation medium. The uptake was stopped by washing three times with 1 ml of the permeabilization medium. Cells were scraped in 200 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100 and the radioactivity of aliquots measured by liquid scintillation. Cells (20-30 × 106 cells) were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks or 5-cm Petri dishes. They were harvested by scraping in 5 ml of 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10.5% sucrose and 2 units/ml leupeptin (buffer A). This homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer, homogenized manually in a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and again centrifuged under the same conditions. The pooled supernatants (postnuclear supernatant) were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 80 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer A, and 0.5 ml of the suspension was layered onto 4.5 ml of a linear sucrose gradient (23-55%) in the same EDTA/leupeptin/Hepes buffer. The tubes were centrifuged for 3 h at 4°C at 240,000 × g in a SW-65 Beckman rotor. Fractions (400 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tubes. As described by Unsicker et al.(25Unsicker K. Hofman H.D. Höhne I. Müller T.H. Schmidt R. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 9: 369-379Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), long term depolarization of bovine chromaffin cells induces flattening of the cells and the extension of neurite-like processes. The difference between control and depolarized cells was clearly seen after 5 days of culture on both plastic dishes or collagen-coated coverslips. At the ultrastructural level (Fig. 1), dense secretory vesicles (chromaffin granules) were observed in both depolarized and control cells. Two types of granules were present in both cultures, small dense noradrenaline-containing granules in noradrenergic cells and larger lighter adrenaline-containing granules(18Hopwood D. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1971; 3: 1-66Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the K+-depolarized cultures, 37% of the cells were estimated to be of the noradrenergic type, whereas control cultures contained only 16% of noradrenergic cells (Table I). Because the number of cells was the same in the two types of culture, this change was attributed to phenotype plasticity and not to differential survival(25Unsicker K. Hofman H.D. Höhne I. Müller T.H. Schmidt R. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 9: 369-379Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). K+-cultured cells were more vacuolar and clearly contained less secretory granules than control ones. The granules of the K+-cultured cells often appeared to have an electron-dense core within a larger vesicle. The number of granules per unit surface area was determined under both culture conditions. K+ depolarization resulted in a decrease in the number of granules to about 30% of the controls, in both cell types. Long term stimulation by K+ depolarization therefore decreases the number of chromaffin granules, presumably as a result of continuous exocytosis, but without completely depleting the cell of its secretory granules.Table I:Morphological and biochemical characterization of K+-depolarized cells Open table in a new tab An immunofluorescence study using antibodies against chromogranin A, a component of chromaffin granule matrix, confirmed the decrease in the number of mature secretory granules (Fig. 2). Almost all cells in treated cultures showed a dramatic reduction in labeling for chromogranin A (compare Fig. 2, b and d), although a faint punctate labeling could still be detected. Less than 5% of the cells, which also had undergone less obvious morphological changes, appeared to be much less affected. The two cell cultures were also labeled for cytosolic tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 2, a and c), used as a marker of trans-synaptic induction(2Thoenen H. Mueller R.A. Axelrod J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1969; 160: 249-253Google Scholar, 8Stachowiak M.K. Hong J.S. Viveros O.H. Brain Res. 1990; 510: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Compared with control cultures (Fig. 2a), the intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase labeling in treated cultures (Fig. 2c) was increased in all cells, except those which were still labeled fairly strongly for chromogranin A, and this diffuse cytoplasmic labeling filled both perikarya and cell extensions. Thus, the intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase labeling in treated cultures was negatively correlated with that for chromogranin A. In parallel to the morphometric study, a biochemical analysis of the catecholamine content of the two types of culture was performed. The designation of the two cell types as adrenergic and noradrenergic cells was confirmed by the ratio of the two catecholamines (Table I). K+ depolarization decreased the catecholamine content to 35% of the controls. In addition, immunological assays were used to estimate the cellular contents of chromogranin A and cytochrome b561, which are major components of the matrix and of the membrane of chromaffin granules, respectively(26Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). K+ depolarization induced a marked decrease of the content not only of chromogranin A, but also of cytochrome b561 (Table I). In contrast, the number of [3H]TBZOH binding sites specifically associated with the vesicular monoamine transporter in the same cultures was shown to increase to 180% of controls after long term depolarization (Table I). To characterize the functional aspects of the granules, the secretory capacity of these cells was analyzed in various ways. First, K+-depolarized and control cells were charged with [3H]noradrenaline in a nondepolarizing Na+-containing medium and challenged with 20 μM nicotine in the presence of Ca2+ ions. [3H]Noradrenaline uptake was desipramine-sensitive, indicating that it occurred through the cell membrane transporters. It was also tetrabenazine-sensitive, since 3 μM TBZ decreased the cellular [3H]noradrenaline content by 30-50% in control cells and by 60% in K+-depolarized ones, thus showing that the tritiated catecholamine accumulated in the vesicular compartment, through the vesicular transporter. The conditions of uptake (substrate concentration, uptake incubation time) were adjusted so that the same radioactivity accumulated in both cultures. Under these conditions, the secretory capacity of K+-cultured cells, defined as the percentage of tritiated noradrenaline released, was similar to that of controls (Fig. 3A). Secretion in these cells was Ca2+-dependent and it occurred through the vesicular compartment, since it was inhibited when [3H]noradrenaline was taken up in the presence of 3 μM TBZ. The release of [3H]noradrenaline was also tested after permeabilization of the charged cells by the bacterial toxin streptolysin O(27Ahnert-Hilger G. Stecher B. Beyer C. Gratzl M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When such cells were challenged with 20 μM Ca2+, [3H]noradrenaline release was identical in K+-cultured and in control cells (data not shown), confirming that release occurred from the vesicular pool (and not the cytoplasm), by an unaffected process. In the above approach, [3H]noradrenaline uptake required repolarization of cells, since the plasma membrane transporter utilizes the Na+ electrochemical gradient as a driving force. The secretory capacity of long term K+-treated cells was also analyzed by following the release of endogenous catecholamines by spectrofluorometry. After rapid transfer to Ca2+-containing Locke medium and stimulation by 20 μM nicotine, K+-cultured and control cells were found to release 2.6 ± 0.2 and 14 ± 1.4 of nmol catecholamine/well, respectively, in a Ca2+-dependent nicotine-stimulated manner. Expressed as percentages of cellular catecholamines, the corresponding figures are 9 ± 0.2 and 17 ± 1.0%, taking into account the lower amine content of the depolarized cells (Fig. 3B). This result suggests some desensitization of the secretory pathway, which could account for the presence of a stock of secretory granules in continuously stimulated cells. The effect of a repolarizing period was also tested. Cells were incubated in normal Locke medium for 45 min at 37°C before being challenged as above. This repolarization period is equivalent to that used for the uptake of [3H]noradrenaline. Under these conditions, 3 ± 0.1 and 9 ± 1.5 nmol of catecholamine/well were specifically released by K+-cultured and control cells; however, the percentages were similar, corresponding to 14.5 ± 0.8 and 16 ± 1.4%, respectively (Fig. 3C). This might be because desensitization is rapidly reversible, and all secretory granules are functional, secretion being proportional to the number of granules. [3H]TBZOH binding to the vesicular monoamine transporter occurs even when the transporter has been uncoupled from the H+ electrochemical gradient(15Henry J.P. Scherman D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2395-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Binding of this ligand has been observed using detergent-solubilized transporter(28Scherman D. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The increase of binding in K+-depolarized cells might have been due to proteins present on non vesicular structures, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, which are unable to generate a H+-electrochemical gradient, or to inactive proteins present in the endosomal network. To test the functionality of the transporter, cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O(27Ahnert-Hilger G. Stecher B. Beyer C. Gratzl M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and vesicular ATP-dependent [3H]noradrenaline uptake was measured in situ (Fig. 4). The accumulation of [3H]noradrenaline was insensitive to 1 μM desipramine, showing that the plasma membrane transporter was by-passed, but was blocked by 3 μM TBZ, indicating a vesicular uptake. The experiment was performed at a saturating noradrenaline concentration, 10 μM, to measure the transporter concentration and to avoid any interference with residual endogenous monoamines. In three experiments similar to that of Fig. 4, the initial rate of uptake was increased in the K+-depolarized cells by a factor of 1.7 ± 0.3, which was similar to the increase of [3H]TBZOH binding sites. It should be noted that in K+-treated cells the uptake leveled more rapidly than in control ones, indicating a lower plateau value consistent with a lower number of granules in the treated cells. To determine the localization of [3H]TBZOH binding sites, the cellular extracts were fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on linear sucrose gradients (23-55%), and the profiles of [3H]TBZOH binding sites were determined for K+-depolarized and control cells. Three representative experiments are shown in Fig. 5. In both types of culture, a main peak of [3H]TBZOH binding sites was observed. In control cells, the peak was centered in the dense part of the gradient at 45% (1.6 M) sucrose. In more than 15 experiments, K+-depolarized cells were characterized by a larger peak, the ratio of peak areas reflecting the cellular increase in [3H]TBZOH binding. The peak from depolarized cells also had a lighter equilibration density, and it was often asymmetrical, being broader on the lighter side. In nine different experiments, the fraction of sites equilibrating at a density lighter than 43% sucrose in control and in depolarized cells was 33 ± 10 and 62 ± 13%, respectively. The asymmetry of the broad peak of K+-cultured cells was not due to size heterogeneity, since this peak was not resolved when the force and the duration of the centrifugation were decreased.

https://openalex.org/W2088747499,"Due to 3′ end modifications, mammalian U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is heterogeneous in size. The major form terminates with five U residues and a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, but multiple RNAs containing up to 12 U residues have a 3′-OH end. They are labeled in the presence of [α-32P]UTP by the terminal uridylyl transferase activity present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. That these forms all enter the U6 snRNA-containing particles, U4·U6, U4·U5·U6, and the spliceosome, has been demonstrated previously. Here, we report an interaction between the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C protein, an abundant nuclear pre-mRNA binding protein, and the U6 snRNAs that have the longest uridylate stretches. This U6 snRNA subset is free of any one of the other snRNPs, since anti-Sm antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate hnRNP C protein. Furthermore, isolated U4·U6 snRNPs containing U6 snRNAs with long oligouridylate stretches are disrupted upon binding of hnRNP C protein either purified from HeLa cells or produced as recombinant protein from Escherichia coli. In view of these data and our previous proposal that the U6 snRNA active in splicing has 3′-OH end, we discuss a model where the hnRNP C protein has a decisive function in the catalytic activation of the spliceosome by allowing the release of U4 snRNP.

Splicing of mRNA precursors occurs in a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. The reaction requires five U snRNAs1( 1The abbreviations used are: snsmall nuclearhnheterogeneous nuclearRNPribonucleoproteinCSconsensus sequence.) packaged into four individual snRNPs (U1, U2, U4·U6, and U5) and an as yet undetermined number of non-snRNP proteins. Spliceosome assembly involves the ordered interaction of U1 and U2 snRNPs through RNA base pairing with the 5′-splice site and the sequence around the branch point, respectively, and then the entry of the other snRNAs in the form of U4·U6·U5 tri-snRNP (for a recent review, see Ref. 1). It is known that U4 and U6 snRNAs are base-paired through two intermolecular helices (stem I and stem II) forming an evolutionary conserved secondary structure, the so-called Y structure(2Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Nature. 1988; 334: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This structure is thought to occur in both U4·U6 and U4·U6·U5 complexes but to be disrupted once the U4·U6·U5 tri-snRNP has entered the spliceosome. Indeed, compelling results in both yeast and mammalian systems have led to the conclusion that U6 snRNA forms new base-pairing interactions with U2 snRNA and the pre-mRNA in the spliceosome (3Wassarman D.A. Steitz J.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 4Madhani H.D. Guthrie C.

Science. 1993; 262: 1978-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Extensive base pairing between U4 and U6 is an obstacle to the formation of this tripartite structure, and the U4·U6 snRNP is disrupted in the spliceosome before the splicing intermediates and products appear(9Konarska M.M.

The step(s) leading to the release of U4 snRNP is (are) not understood. small nuclear heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence. As a result of post-transcriptional 3′ end modifications, metazoan U6 snRNA is heterogeneous(10Reddy R. Henning D. Das G. Harless M. Wright D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 75-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hirai H. Lee D.I. Natori S. Sekimizu K. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to a major form terminating with five Us and a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate(12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), multiple minor RNAs exhibit, at their 3′ end, an oligouridylate stretch of variable length. All are part of the known U6 snRNA-containing particles, U4·U6, U4·U5·U6, and the spliceosome. The finding that U6 snRNA with a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate end is generated within the spliceosome as a consequence of pre-mRNA splicing (13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) led us to propose that U6 snRNAs with elongatable ends are the active forms in splicing. As a first step toward the elucidation of the function of U6 snRNA elongation in splicing, we have obtained evidence that the hnRNP C protein, a potential partner of the splicing reaction(14Choi Y.D. Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1986; 231: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), is bound exclusively to the U6 snRNAs having the longest oligouridylate tails, and we have demonstrated that hnRNP C induces disruption of base-paired U4·U6 snRNAs in isolated U4·U6 snRNPs. Micrococcal nuclease, RNase A-and protein A-Sepharose 4B were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. RNase H was from Life Technologies, Inc. The anti-C hnRNP (4F4), the anti-A1 hnRNP (4B10), and the anti-U hnRNP (3G6) antibodies and the recombinant hnRNP C1 protein and K94 mutant were generous gifts from Dr. G. Dreyfuss (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Philadelphia, PA). The other antibodies used were the monoclonal anti-Sm Y12, and a patient serum of SSb specificity (anti-La antibodies). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al.(15Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) except that triethanolamine buffer was used instead of HEPES. The DEAE-Sepharose-cleared extract was according to Hinterberger et al.(16Hinterberger M. Pettersson I. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2604-2613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A U4·U6-enriched preparation was obtained from this extract by centrifugation in a glycerol gradient as described previously(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The hnRNP C protein was prepared according to Pinol-Roma and Dreyfuss(17Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotide cleavage of snRNAs was as described previously(18Khellil S. Daugeron M.C. Alibert C. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were complementary to U4 (nucleotides 65-85), U5 (nucleotides 69-87) and U6 (nucleotides 77-95). Endogeneous U6 snRNAs were 3′ end-labeled by incubating 15 μl of nuclear extract with 30 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in a final volume of 25 μl containing 3.2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 20 mM creatine phosphate for 30 min at 30°C(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For UV cross-linking experiments(18Khellil S. Daugeron M.C. Alibert C. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the reactions were kept on ice for 10 min and then irradiated for 10 min with an UV transilluminator at 254 nm (7 milliwatts/cm2 on the surface of the filter). The distance between the samples and the filter was 9 cm. The samples were finally digested with RNase A (0.6 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37°C before being precipitated by 5 volumes of acetone and electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography on Kodak XAR films. RNase A digestion of immunoprecipitated samples was carried out directly on protein A-Sepharose beads after they were washed with NET 2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). Elution of the beads was in 50 μl of Laemli buffer. 200-μl reactions containing 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs were loaded onto 4 ml of 10-30% glycerol gradients made in 50 mM Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.8). Centrifugation was in a SW 60 Beckman rotor at 41,000 rpm for 3 h at 4°C. A total of 18 fractions of 220 μl were recovered from the top. The RNAs present in each fraction were extracted with phenol after proteinase K (4 mg/ml) digestion and separated in a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. Labeled RNAs were first detected by autoradiography, and then the gel was electroblotted to Hybond membranes under the same conditions as described by Blencowe et al.(19Blencowe B.J. Sproat B.S. Ryder U. Barabino S. Lamond A.I. Cell. 1989; 59: 531-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The membranes were UV-treated for 30 s, baked 1 h at 80°C, and then prehybridized for 2 h before hybridization at 42°C according to Church and Gilbert(20Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). DNA probes complementary to U4, U6, and U5 snRNAs were the same as those used in the oligodeoxynucleotide-directed cleavage experiments. Those complementary to U1 and U2 corresponded to nucleotides 1-15. All were 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridizations were in the same buffer at 42°C. One wash of 5 min in 2 × SSC and then three washes of 15 min each in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS were performed at room temperature before autoradiography. Assays to detect immunoprecipitated protein adducts after UV cross-linking (see above) and to identify those of the 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs that are immunoprecipitated were performed directly with 30 μl of a 3′ end-labeling reaction or from 100 μl after fractionation of this same reaction in glycerol gradients. In all cases, antibodies were pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose in NET 2 buffer as described previously(21Daugeron M.C. Tazi J. Jeanteur P. Brunel C. Cathala G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 14: 3625-3630Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The samples were added to 50 μl of antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose, adjusted to 200 μl, and incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4°C. After four washes with 1 ml of NET 2 buffer, bound material either was analyzed for protein adducts if UV cross-linked or digested with proteinase K for RNA detection. Released RNAs were extracted with phenol, separated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide-urea gels in Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer, and finally detected by autoradiography. Due to an endogenous terminal uridylyl transferase, incubation of HeLa cell nuclear extracts under splicing conditions in the presence of [α-32P]UTP leads to preferential 3′ end-labeling of U6 snRNA as well as other RNAs of smaller size (Ref. 13 and see “Experimental Procedures”). Such an assay reveals the presence of multiple U6 snRNAs, which differ by the length of their oligo(U) tail. All are assembled into U6, U4·U6, and U4·U6·U5 snRNPs(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking experiments were done to determine whether spliceosomal proteins interact with the oligouridylate stretch of the U6 snRNAs exhibiting a 3′ (U)n-OH end. Nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and irradiated at 254 nm. After digestion by RNase A, the presence of protein adducts was examined by electrophoresis in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Two proteins, one of about 50 kDa and a second one forming a doublet in the range of 42 kDa, were detected (Fig. 1, lane 2). On the basis of previously published data(22Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2617-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we suspected that the 50-kDa protein adduct represented the La antigen. In agreement with this prediction, this protein adduct was immunoprecipitated with anti-La antibodies (lane 4). Two criteria led us to suggest that the second protein adduct might be the hnRNP C protein: its apparent size and the fact that the hnRNP C protein is known to bind avidly to poly(U) stretches(23Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3519-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This was verified by the finding that anti-C antibodies precipitate the protein adduct (lane 6). Since some other RNAs are labeled under the conditions used(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it was necessary to identify the small RNAs that transferred their label to the La and C proteins. The extracts incubated with [α-32P]UTP were immunoprecipitated as described above. Fig. 2A shows that anti-La, anti-Sm, and anti-C antibodies (lanes 4-6, respectively) immunoprecipitated labeled RNAs of a size compatible with U6 snRNA. Although we demonstrated previously by sequencing that the RNAs indicated U6 in lanes 1and 2 (controls) are authentic(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we carried out a complementary assay based on oligodeoxynucleotide directed cleavage by RNase H to be sure. As shown in Fig. 2B, among the three oligos used, only the antisense U6 oligo was efficient in directing cleavage of the RNAs precipitated by anti-C antibodies, thus confirming that they are U6 snRNAs. In Fig. 2A, one can see that anti-La, in contrast to anti-Sm and anti-C antibodies, precipitated many other RNAs of smaller size than U6. They most likely represent La-bound RNA polymerase III transcripts(25Stephano J.E. Cell. 1984; 36: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which no doubt contributed to labeling the La protein in the cross-linking assay (Fig. 1). A comparison of the U6 snRNAs precipitated by each class of antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6) shows that they are not identical in length. It is known that they uniquely differ by the length of the added oligo(U) tail(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Those recovered by anti-La antibodies have a short oligo(U) tail and are probably newly synthesized U6 snRNAs(26Terns M.P. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3032-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Those recovered by anti-Sm antibodies are much more heterogeneous, comprising U6 snRNAs having oligo(U) tails containing up to 12 U residues. Finally, those recovered by anti-C antibodies appear to correspond to those with the longest oligo(U) tail among all the anti-Sm-precipitated U6 snRNAs, indicating that a minimum size (at least 8 residues) is required for the oligo(U) tail-hnRNP C protein interaction. Moreover, the possibility that the interaction between the hnRNP C protein and this subset of U6 snRNAs might be indirect, through some association with another hnRNP component, is unlikely because antibodies directed against hnRNP A1 and U proteins fail to precipitate U6 snRNAs from total nuclear extracts (lanes 7 and 8).Figure 2:Identification of a subset of U6 snRNAs immunoprecipitated by the anti-hnRNP C protein antibody. A, standard reactions containing 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNA as described in Fig. 1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-La (lane 4), anti-Sm (Y12) (lane 5), anti-C (4F4) (lane 6), anti-A1 (4B10) (lane 7), and anti-U (3G6) (lane 8) antibodies. Lane 3, a control immunoprecipitation assay without antibodies. Total labeled RNAs are shown in lanes 1 and 2. Conditions of labeling were either in the presence (lane 2) or in the absence (lane 1) of ATP and creatine phosphate. The RNAs were extracted and separated in a 10% polyacrylamide urea gel. B, reactions as in A were immunoprecipitated by anti-C antibodies (4F4), and then the resulting samples were subjected to oligodeoxynucleotide-directed cleavage by RNase H. The oligonucleotides were complementary to U4 (lane 3), U6 (lane 4), and U5 (lane 5). Controls were direct analysis of nonimmunoprecipitated (lane 1), and immunoprecipitated but not cleaved (lane 2) samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A striking result seen in Fig. 1(lane 5) is that anti-Sm antibodies failed to precipitate any protein adduct, suggesting that the U6 snRNAs interacting with either the La or the hnRNP C protein are free of U4 and U5 snRNAs. Concerning the U6-La interaction, the result agrees with previously published data, i.e. those U6 snRNAs in U4·U6 complexes are not bound to the La protein despite having a La-binding site at their 3′ ends(26Terns M.P. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3032-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To verify that U6 snRNAs with long oligo(U) tails are free of U4 and U5 snRNAs when interacting with the hnRNP C protein, we subjected a nuclear extract containing 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs to glycerol gradient centrifugation under conditions allowing for separation of free U6 from U4·U6 and U4·U6·U5 snRNPs (see “Experimental Procedures”) and looked for immunoprecipitated snRNAs in the resulting fractions using anti-Sm and anti-hnRNP C protein antibodies. As expected, the result (Fig. 3, A and B) was that those labeled U6 snRNAs present in anti-C precipitates exclusively migrate as free U6 snRNPs, while those in anti-Sm precipitates are associated with U4 (U4·U6 snRNPs) and U4·U5 (U4·U6·U5 snRNPs). The Northern blot shown in Fig. 3C reveals how the major U2 to U6 snRNAs distribute through the gradient. From these results, we conclude that the hnRNP C protein present in nuclear extracts interacts directly with those of the U6 snRNAs terminating with the longest oligouridylate tail. Moreover, such an U6 snRNA-hnRNP C protein interaction does not exist when these U6 snRNAs are engaged with U4 and U5 snRNAs to form U4·U6 and U4·U6·U5 snRNPs. The above results raised the question of whether the association of the hnRNP C protein with free U6 snRNPs is a cause or a consequence of U4·U6 snRNP disruption. We performed a complementation assay using purified hnRNP C protein and U4·U6 snRNPs whose U6 snRNAs were elongated and labeled at their 3′ end. To do this, a prerequisite was to prepare an extract sufficiently enriched with U4·U6 snRNPs compared with free U6 and U4·U5·U6 snRNPs. This was possible starting with a nuclear extract that has been cleared by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography as described previously(16Hinterberger M. Pettersson I. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2604-2613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, most of its U4 and U6 snRNAs are in U4·U6 snRNPs(27Lelay-Taha M.N. Reveillaud I. Sri-Widada J. Brunel C. Jeanteur P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has TUTase activity and contains the same elongatable forms of U6 snRNA as an extract active in splicing. It also contains U6 snRNA with 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate end (13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, this extract turned out to be virtually free of hnRNP C protein on the basis of immunoblots assays (results not shown), thus allowing the effect of exogeneously added hnRNP C protein to be monitored. This cleared nuclear extract was first incubated in the presence of [α-32P]UTP to label U6 snRNAs with 3′-OH end, and then the U4·U6 snRNPs were purified by centrifugation through a 10-30% glycerol gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”). These purified particles contained all of the forms of U4·U6 snRNPs, i.e. those with 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs as well as those containing U6 snRNAs ending with 2′,3′ cyclic phosphate. The assay was carried out as follows. First, the amount of hnRNP C protein added was calculated to reconstitute approximately the U6 snRNA/hnRNP C ratio that exists in a splicing extract. Second, the reactions with or without hnRNP C protein added were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-C and anti-Sm antibodies. Third, immunoprecipitated materials were analyzed for U6 snRNA content by polyacrylamide-urea gels (Fig. 4, A and B). Addition of hnRNP C protein led to precipitation of labeled U6 snRNAs by anti-C antibodies (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 and 6), while the precipitation of these same U6 snRNAs by anti-Sm antibodies was largely decreased (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, as shown by Northern blots, hnRNP C protein has no effect on the major form of U4·U6 snRNPs containing U6 snRNAs terminating with a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (Fig. 4B). It seems clear, therefore, that binding of hnRNP C protein only occurs in U4·U6 snRNPs whose U6 snRNAs have an elongated 3′ end and that base pairing of U4 to U6 snRNAs is not an obstacle for hnRNP C binding. Finally, disruption of base-paired U4 and U6 snRNAs in these U4·U6 snRNPs provides the better explanation for the low immunoprecipitation of labeled U6 snRNAs by anti-Sm antibodies. To verify this, the following experiment was performed. The above reactions with or without hnRNP C protein were centrifuged through glycerol gradients to separate free U6 from U4·U6 snRNPs (Fig. 5). Probing for U4 and U6 snRNAs throughout the gradient shows that these snRNAs still comigrate if hnRNP C was added to U4·U6 snRNPs before centrifugation (Fig. 5A, compare upper and lower panels). This was expected since in the immunoprecipitation assay shown in Fig. 4B, all U6 snRNAs detected with the probe remained precipitable by anti-Sm antibodies. The 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs, due to their low abundance, were not detected by the probe. They had a slower sedimentation when the U4·U6 snRNPs were incubated with the purified hnRNP C than without (Fig. 5B, compare the two first panels).Figure 5:Analysis of disrupted U4·U6 snRNPs by centrifugation in glycerol gradients. Identical reactions to those described in Fig. 3 (200 μl) were loaded onto a 10-30% glycerol gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”). After fractionation from the top, the RNAs were extracted from each fraction and separated in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel. A shows the distribution of U4 and U6 snRNAs detected with the oligodeoxynucleotide probes. The autoradiographies were scanned by densitometry (left panels). For each snRNA, the values express a percentage of the sum of absorbancies throughout the gradient. B shows the distribution of 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs from reactions with or without hnRNP C protein (upper panel). Lower panel shows the distribution of 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs when the reactions were carried out in the presence of either recombinant C1 or K94 mutant in place of purified hnRNP C protein. The concentrations of protein used are indicated. Densitometry scanning of the autoradiographies was as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the above experiment did not rule out the possibility that the dissociating activity could be contributed by some contaminant of the hnRNP C protein preparation, the same assay was carried out using a recombinant hnRNP C1 protein. This protein again dissociated U4·U6 snRNPs containing 3′ end-labeled and elongated U6 snRNAs despite being 50-fold less active than the purified hnRNP C protein (Fig. 5B, third panel). It is possible that post-translational modifications (i.e. phosphorylations) and/or the presence of C2 isoform in the preparation from HeLa cells could account for this difference. It is true to say that U4·U6 snRNPs containing elongated U6 snRNAs are a weak part of the total U4·U6 particles. Besides, the hnRNP C protein is a very abundant nuclear protein and is one of the most avid pre-mRNA binding proteins in HeLa cell extracts. It is known to bind to oligo(U) stretches in natural RNAs(23Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3519-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Wilusz J. Feig D.I. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4477-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6397-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was therefore crucial to discover whether binding of hnRNP C protein to elongated U6 snRNAs followed by U4·U6 snRNP disruption is specific. We first determined the stoechiometry of the reaction of dissociation. To do this, different concentrations of purified hnRNP C protein were added to labeled U4·U6 snRNPs, and the dissociation was monitored by centrifugation in glycerol gradients (not shown). This led us to consider that dissociation is effective when four molecules of purified protein are added to one snRNA. It was assumed that 5% of the U6 snRNAs have a 3′-OH elongatable end. We have also tested the dissociating activity of the so-called K94 deletion mutant of hnRNP C protein. It has the same RNP binding domain as the hnRNP C protein and it binds to poly(U), but it lacks a large part of the hnRNP C1 protein sequence in the side of the carboxyl terminus(30Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Used at the same concentration as the hnRNP C1 protein in our complementation assay, it failed to induce dissociation of U4·U6 snRNPs (Fig. 5B, last panel). However this mutant protein binds to U4·U6 snRNPs containing 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs since, upon UV cross-linking of a reaction, it became labeled as did the hnRNP C protein (results not shown). It appears, therefore, that something in the sequence other than the canonical RBD of hnRNP C1 is required to induce dissociation. Other experiments using mutated proteins will be required to more precisely define the domain of the hnRNP C protein, which is implied in dissociation of U4·U6 snRNPs. Finally, other recombinant proteins with RNP-CS domains, namely U2AF, known to bind tenaciously to poly(U) (31Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and SF2·ASF were tested in our complementation assay. As expected, they failed to disrupt U4·U6 snRNPs (results not shown). We report here that the hnRNP C protein, belonging to the family of proteins exhibiting a RNP consensus sequence (RNP-CS), interacts with a subset of U6 snRNAs characterized by their relatively long 3′-oligouridylate tail. Binding occurs at this tail since the protein becomes cross-linked upon irradiation with UV light of nuclear extracts containing 3′ end-labeled U6 snRNAs. Significantly, the hnRNP C protein, either purified from HeLa cells or produced as recombinant protein from Escherichia coli, induces the release of elongated U6 snRNAs from U4·U6 snRNPs. Two points must be underlined. First, the fact that the hnRNP C protein might bind to an oligouridylate tail comprising from 8 to 12 residues agrees with previously published data that the shortest uridine oligoribonucleotide that binds efficiently to the hnRNP C protein is r(U)8 (32Görlach M. Wittekind M. Beckman R.A. Mueller L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Second, the disruption of U4·U6 snRNPs seems to be specific of the hnRNP C protein since a mutated protein containing the RNP-CS domain alone, as well as other factors with RNP-CS (U2AF, SF2·ASF) failed to disrupt U4·U6 snRNPs. Since U4 and U6 snRNAs become separated within the spliceosome before the first step of splicing takes place(33Lamond A.I. Konarska M.M. Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and since the hnRNP C protein is supposed to be involved in splicing(14Choi Y.D. Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1986; 231: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that U4·U6 snRNP disruption induced by the hnRNP C protein is what happens during splicing. Obviously, such a scenario implies that U6 snRNA functions in splicing with an elongatable 3′-OH end. Although most of the U6 snRNAs in mammalian cells have a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate end(12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the presence of U6 snRNAs with 3′-OH end within the spliceosome is indubitable. Indeed, the five snRNAs involved in splicing are 3′ end-labeled by cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate when extracted from mammalian affinity-selected spliceosomes(34Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Science. 1986; 223: 1294-1299Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Also, we have previously obtained evidence that elongated U6 snRNAs are present within the spliceosome and that a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at the end of U6 snRNA is a consequence of splicing instead of being a requirement for it(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, it is known that in organisms U6 snRNAs consist of forms with different 3′ end groups(12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For example, all U6 snRNAs have 3′-OH end in T. brucei, while in man and other mammals the >p, -OH ratio is 9:1. A U6 snRNA-hnRNP C protein interaction functional in splicing raises the question of how elongated U6 snRNAs are generated. They appear from shorter forms upon incubation of the extracts with an excess of UTP, as well as with ATP under splicing conditions and are present in all of the U6 snRNA-containing complexes(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In fact, we can now add that preexisting elongated U6 snRNAs exist as well and are assembled into multi-snRNP complexes. This was ascertained by the finding that some labeled U6 snRNAs with long uridylate tail have left their label when subjected to β-elimination (results not shown). We have discussed already the possibility that elongatable U6 snRNAs might be generated from molecules terminating by a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate also present in U4·U6 and U4·U5·U6 complexes(13Tazi J. Forné T. Jeanteur Ph. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It remains to be understood why most of U6 snRNAs terminate by a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate end in mammals and several other species(12Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It could impair U6 snRNA to be bound to the hnRNP C protein before the interaction is required. Similarly, once the splicing reaction is accomplished, it could preserve U6 snRNA from untimely association with the hnRNP C protein, which would lead to the lack of U4-U6 snRNA interaction, therefore leaving U6 snRNA unavailable for a new round of splicing. The hypothesis of a U6 snRNA-hnRNP C protein interaction related to the splicing mechanism is also compatible with the recent proposal that the hnRNP C protein, as well as other hnRNP proteins, have RNA chaperonine activity (Ref. 35 and, for a review, see Ref. 36). It is thought that these proteins promote association or dissociation of trans-acting factors in modulating the pre-mRNA conformation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the hnRNP C protein acts similarly on the U6 snRNA conformation to disrupt U4·U6 snRNP and promote U6-U2 base pairing. At this stage, it is interesting to compare the annealing and the disruption of U4·U6 snRNAs in the yeast system and our proposal of a spliceosomal U6 snRNA-hnRNP C protein interaction occurring in mammals. In yeast, it has been proposed that PRP24, a U6-specific binding protein with RNP-CS, directs stabilization of U6 snRNP in a free form and promotes reannealing of U6 with U4 through the formation of a transient intermediate PRP24·U4·U6(37Shannon K.W. Guthrie C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At first glance, this is more compatible with hnRNP C protein having an annealing activity than inducing U4·U6 snRNP disruption. However, it has been proposed that PRP24 could have another role in the U4·U6 cycle in concert with PRP28, a protein of the DEAD box family(38Linder P. Lasko P. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Shnier J. Slonimski P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 39Wassarman D.A. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1991; 249: 463-464Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Once disruption of base-paired U4·U6 has occurred, PRP24 could serve to stabilize the unwound form of U6 snRNA(40Strauss E.J. Guthrie C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This seems to be very similar to what we propose for the function of the U6 snRNA-bound hnRNP C protein. If the hnRNP C protein bound to U6 snRNA has in mammals the same stabilizing function as the PRP24 in yeast, what could be the mammalian equivalent of PRP28? Keeping in mind that ATP is not required to obtain hnRNP C protein-induced disruption of U4·U6 snRNPs, one can envisage at least two possibilities. Oligomerization of hnRNP C isoforms could lead to a complex having both PRP24 and PRP28-like activities. As a matter of fact, it is known that the hnRNP C protein is part of a tetrameric structure containing three C1 and one C2 isoforms(41Huang M. Rech J.E. Northing G.S. Flicker P.F. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 518-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Alternatively, one of the specific U4·U6 snRNP proteins (42Behrens S.E. Lührman R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1439-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) could have PRP28-like activity, becoming functional only when the hnRNP C protein has bound to the oligouridylate tail. We thank D. Portman and G. Dreyfuss for providing recombinant hnRNP C protein and K94 mutant and helpful comments on the manuscript."

Efforts have been made to elucidate information about the active site residues that participate in catalysis or substrate binding using strategies including chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, and limited proteolysis. Two cysteine residues, 1 arginine residue, one carboxyl group, and 1 histidine residue were indicated to be essential for enzyme activity of the rat liver AdoHcy hydrolase by chemical modification studies(15Gomi T.

More recently, a limited proteolysis study demonstrated that Glu197-Ser198 is located in or near the active site of the enzyme(22Gupta R.A. Yuan C.S. Ault-Riche D.B. Borchardt R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Another potential approach to elucidating crucial amino acids at the active site of an enzyme is photoaffinity labeling. Photoaffinity probes have been used very effectively for studying nucleotide/nucleoside-binding proteins(23Potter R.L. Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 613-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Olcott M.C. Bradley M.L. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11935-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, Aiyar and Hershfield (25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) showed that 8-N3-Ado, a potential photoaffinity labeling reagent, was a substrate for the 3′-oxidative activity of AdoHcy hydrolase. In this report, we have determined the equilibrium binding properties of 8-N3-Ado with AdoHcy hydrolase (NAD+ form) and identified the specific amino acid residues that are covalently modified after irradiation of the substrate-enzyme complex. 8-N3-Ado, NAD+, NADH, and L1-tosyl-amido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Type XIII) were purchased from Sigma. [2-3H]8-N3-Ado (17.7 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA). Boronate affinity resin Affi-Gel 601 was from Bio-Rad. Expression of the human placental AdoHcy hydrolase cDNA in Escherichia coli and purification of the enzyme were carried out as described previously(26Yuan C.S. Wnuk S.F. Liu S. Robins M.J. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12305-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified, homogeneous enzyme is a tetramer consisting of four identical subunits of Mr 47,000. In this study, the subunit Mr was used to calculate the molarity of enzyme solutions. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Apo AdoHcy hydrolase was obtained by treatment of AdoHcy hydrolase (NAD+ form) with acidic (NH4)2SO4 to remove the NAD+ as described previously(28Yuan C.S. Yeh J. Liu S. Borchardt R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17030-17037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gomi T. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The AdoHcy hydrolase activity was determined in the synthetic direction as described earlier (26Yuan C.S. Wnuk S.F. Liu S. Robins M.J. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12305-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This assay measures the rate of formation of AdoHcy from Ado and Hcy using HPLC. AdoHcy hydrolase (100 μg) was incubated with or without the photoaffinity probe 8-N3-Ado (50 μM) in 200 μl of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, (buffer A) for 1 h at 37°C. To the reaction mixture was added 3 volumes of 97% ethanol to denature the enzyme. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was lyophilized. The residue was then dissolved in 100 μl of water for HPLC analysis using a reverse phase column (Econosphere, C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Alltech, Deerfield, IL). NAD+ and NADH were eluted from the column isocratically with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2.5% of methanol at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Standard curves of NAD+ and NADH were constructed by using known concentrations of freshly prepared authentic NAD+ and NADH. The peaks were monitored at 260 nm. AdoHcy hydrolase (23.5 μg) was incubated with [2-3H]8-N3-Ado (50 μM, 50 μCi/μmol) in the presence or absence of Ado in 50 μl of buffer A at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was chilled to 0°C and loaded onto a piece of glass plate, which was placed on an ice bath. The photolysis was performed by irradiating the sample with a minelight hand lamp (UVGL-25, 1400 μW/cm2) at 254 nm from a height of 7.6 cm for 2 min. Total binding was determined by a gel filtration method using a Sephadex G-50 spin column. The column (3 ml) equilibrated with buffer A was prespun at 400 × g for 5 min using a swing rotor. The photolyzed protein sample was diluted to 300 μl with buffer A and loaded onto the prespun column. The column was then spun for another 5 min at the same speed. The eluate was collected in a test tube which holds the spin column during centrifugation. The protein concentration of the eluate was determined by the Bradford method and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of covalent binding was determined by denaturing the protein before gel filtration. The photolyzed sample was mixed with 250 μl of 10 M urea containing 10 mM dithiothreitol, and heated at 100°C for 3 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was loaded into a prespun Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 1 M urea in buffer A. The column was then spun for 5 min at the same speed as that for the prespin. The protein concentration and radioactivity in the eluate were determined as described above. Control experiments were performed under the denatured conditions with the probe alone or with a non-irradiated enzyme-probe mixture. In both cases, there was no detectable radioactivity in the eluate. AdoHcy hydrolase (2 mg) was incubated with [2-3H]8-N3-Ado (50 μCi/μmol) in a protein-to-probe molar ratio of 1:5 at 37°C for 1.5 h. After photolysis at 0°C for 2 min, the photolabeled protein was filtered through a Sephadex G-50 spin column equilibrated with 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, (buffer B) (a 3-ml column for each 300 μl of protein sample) as described above. The eluted protein was denatured by adding solid urea to a final concentration of 8 M. The denatured protein was dialyzed against buffer B containing 2 M urea for 16 h with 2 buffer changes followed by another 6 h of dialysis against buffer B without urea. The dialyzed protein was digested with trypsin in an enzyme-to-substrate ratio (w/w) of 1:20 at 37°C for 14 h. This was followed by addition of another 5% of trypsin for further digestion for 4 h. The boronate affinity chromatography was performed essentially as described by Haley et al.(30Chavan A.J. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. Kozaki S. Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14866-14870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digested protein was diluted with 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.9 (buffer C), and loaded onto an Affi-Gel 601 column (3 ml) equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer C, 10 ml of buffer C containing 0.5 M NaCl, 10 ml of buffer C containing 4 M urea, 20 ml of buffer C containing 100 mM sorbitol, and finally 10 ml of 0.1 M acetic acid. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Radioactivity in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and peptide concentration was monitored at 220 nm with appropriate elution solutions as references. The non-absorbed radioactive fractions were loaded onto another Affi-Gel 601 column to ensure that the radioactive peptides in these fractions were not due to overloading of the column. The pooled, non-absorbed radioactive fractions were then concentrated by lyophilization. The photolabeled peptides collected from the non-absorbed radioactive fractions from the boronate affinity column were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 Protein and Peptide column (Vydac 218 TP54, C18, 5 μ, 250 × 4.6 mm). The solvent system consisted of mobile phase I (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and mobile phase II (80% CH3CN/20% H2O/0.07% trifluoroacetic acid). The elution was carried out with 2% of mobile phase II in mobile phase I with a linear gradient to 70% mobile phase II over 120 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The UV absorbance of the eluted peptides was monitored at 220 nm. The radioactivity in the fractions collected (0.5 ml) was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Peptide peaks containing major radioactivity were collected, concentrated by speed vacuum, and rechromatographed on the same column using elution conditions of 20% of mobile phase II with a linear gradient to 60% mobile phase II over 60 min. Peaks were collected manually and radioactivity was determined. Radioactive peaks were rechromatographed again with the same elution conditions as described above. The manually collected peptide peaks containing radioactivity significantly above background were sequenced by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystem 473A Protein Sequencer at the Kansas State University Biotechnology Laboratory, Manhattan, KS. At each sequencing cycle, the washing from the conversion flask and eluate from the HPLC were collected for determination of radioactivity. The photoaffinity probe 8-N3-Ado was used previously to study the relationship between the Ado and cyclic AMP-binding sites on AdoHcy hydrolase purified from human placenta(25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It was shown that 8-N3-Ado was a substrate for the the first step (oxidation of the 3′-hydroxyl group) in the catalytic mechanism of AdoHcy hydrolase, resulting in conversion of E·NAD+ to E·NADH and formation of 3′-keto-8-N3-Ado bound to the active site of the enzyme. Based on this information, we felt that advantage could be taken of the substrate activity of 8-N3-Ado to differentiate specifically photolabeled peptides from nonspecifically photolabeled peptides, a problem that often causes difficulties in photoaffinity labeling experiments. Since the earlier work by Hershfield et al. (25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was done using AdoHcy hydrolase isolated from human placenta while our studies were done with the recombinant human placental enzyme, we first conducted experiments to confirm the specificity of photolabeling of AdoHcy hydrolase with 8-N3-Ado. To show the specificity of the photaffinity probe, the photolabeling should be saturable and the photolabeling protected by a natural substrate of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1, when the recombinant human placental AdoHcy hydrolase was photolabeled with increasing concentrations of [2-3H]8-N3-Ado, the extent of labeling approached saturation at approximately 40 μM. When the enzyme was incubated with 50 μM [2-3H]8-N3-Ado in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ado, a natural substrate of the enzyme, but without irradiation, 95% of the total binding of the photolabeling probe was inhibited at 200 μM Ado (Fig. 2). This result indicated that 8-N3-Ado and Ado bind to the same site on AdoHcy hydrolase. An apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 6.8 μM for 8-N3-Ado was calculated using a computer-aided curve fitting with the following equation: PAAdo/PA = (Kd+[A])/[Kd(1+[Ado]/K'd)+[A]]×100(Eq. 1) where PAAdo was the protein-photolabeling probe complex formed in the presence of Ado; PA was the complex formed in the absence of Ado; A was the concentration of 8-N3-Ado; and Kd′ was the dissociation constant (4.5 μM) of Ado determined separately by equilibrium dialysis. However, upon irradiation of the enzyme with [2-3H]8-N3-Ado in the presence of Ado, the protection was only 60% at 200 μM Ado, and further increases of Ado concentration did not afford better protection (Fig. 2). This suggested that not all photolabeling occurred in the Ado-binding site and that some of the 8-N3-Ado must have nonspecifically photolabeled the protein outside of the Ado-binding site, which could not be protected by Ado. summarizes the results of binding, photoincorporation, and inactivation of AdoHcy hydrolase by 8-N3-Ado. Incorporation of [2-3H]8-N3-Ado to the protein was light-dependent. Incubation of the enzyme with the photolabeling probe in the absence of light gave a binding stoichiometery of 0.81 ± 0.05 mol of probe/mol enzyme subunit, but without covalent incorporation. After irradiation, the total binding increased to 0.95 ± 0.06 mol of probe/mol of enzyme subunit, in which 0.29 ± 0.05 mol of the probe was covalently photoinserted into the protein. However, about 40% of the covalent modification could not be protected by high concentrations of Ado, indicating the existence of significant nonspecific photoinsertion. This result was in agreement with the earlier observation that 20-60% of the covalent labeling of AdoHcy hydrolase with 8-N3-Ado could not be blocked by Ado (25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Subtracting the nonspecific labeling from the total photoinsertion resulted in a net amount of specific photoincorporation of 18%, which is comparable to the reported value of 5-14%(25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The photoincorporation and specificity varied with the enzyme probe ratio. An enzyme/probe ratio of 1:4-6 was found to give the highest photoincorporation with the lowest nonspecific labeling under the conditions of 2 min of irradiation. Irradiation caused a time-dependent loss of the enzyme activity. About 15% of the enzyme activity was lost in the 2-min irradiation in the absence of the probe, and 56% was lost in the presence of the probe. This increased loss of the enzyme activity was prevented by inclusion of 200 μM Ado (Table I). 8-N3-Ado in the absence of irradiation was a slow time-dependent inhibitor of AdoHcy hydrolase. Incubation of the enzyme with 50 μM of 8-N3-Ado at 37°C for 1 h in the absence of light resulted in 51% inactivation of the enzyme. This enzyme inactivation could be protected by Ado, supporting the idea that the probe was interacting at the active site of the enzyme.Figure 2:Effect of Ado on binding and photoinsertion of [2-3H]8-N3-Ado into AdoHcy hydrolase. Recombinant human placental AdoHcy hydrolase (23.5 μg) was incubated with 50 μM of [2-3H]8-N3-Ado (50 μCi/μmol) in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of Ado in 50 μl of buffer A at 37°C for 1 h. Non-irradiated samples (○) were used to determine the total binding, and irradiated samples (●) were used to determine the covalent binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ratio of the binding stoichiometry (PA/protein-photolabeling probe complex) in the presence of Ado to that in the absence of Ado was plotted against Ado concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE IBinding, photoincorporation, and inactivation of AdoHcy hydrolase by 8-N3-Ado Open table in a new tab Because of the high percentage of nonspecific photoinsertion, one might, at first glance, question the strategy of identifying specifically photolabeled peptides of AdoHcy hydrolase using 8-N3-Ado as a probe. However, if one takes advantage of 8-N3-Ado being a substrate of the oxidative activity of the enzyme(25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it immediately becomes apparent that it should be possible to separate the peptides specifically labeled with 3′-keto-8-N3-Ado from those nonspecifically labeled by 8-N3-Ado by using boronate affinity chromatography. Boronate resin has a strong affinity for compounds that have adjacent cis-hydroxyl group(s) (cis-diols) and has thus been used to separate deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides effectively(31Schott H. Rudloff E. Schmidt P. Roychoudhury R. Kosscl H. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 8-N3-Ado bound at the enzyme active site will participate in the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation reaction, which reduces E·NAD+ to E·NADH with the concomitant formation of 3′-keto-8-N3-Ado(25Aiyar V.N. Hershfield M.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The NADH form of the enzyme, in turn, tightly binds the 3′-keto product in its active site(32Yuan C.S. Yeh J. Squier T.C. Rawitch A. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10414-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which becomes covalently bound after irradiation. Peptides labeled with 3′-keto probe are thus assumed to be parts of the adenine (Ade)-binding domain. Because the 3′-keto probe lacks adjacent cis-hydroxyl groups, peptides labeled by 3′-keto-8-N3-Ado should have no affinity to the boronate resin and should be eluted from the column directly without retardation (non-absorbed fractions). In contrast, peptides nonspecifically modified by 8-N3-Ado should possess adjacent cis-hydroxyl groups (2′ and 3′- hydroxyl group) and hence have a strong affinity to the boronate resin and remain in the column. In order to utilize this affinity separation technique, we first undertook an experiment to confirm that 8-N3-Ado serves as a substrate for the oxidative activity of the enzyme by monitoring the conversion of E·NAD+ to E·NADH after incubation of the enzyme with the probe. As shown in Fig. 3, the purified AdoHcy hydrolase contains about 0.85 mol of NAD+ and 0.1 mol of NADH/mol of enzyme subunit (Fig. 3a). After incubation with 50 μM of 8-N3-Ado at 37°C for 1 h, about 53% of the NAD+ was converted to NADH (Fig. 3b). Prolonged incubation did not significantly increase the ratio of NAD+/NADH. This result confirmed the earlier observation that 8-N3-Ado participates as a substrate in the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation reaction. After irradiation of the reaction mixture of AdoHcy hydrolase and 8-N3-Ado, the protein was denatured by treatment with 8 M urea and subsequent heating. The free probe was removed by gel filtration and dialysis. The labeled protein was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were subjected to boronate affinity chromatography. Fig. 4a shows a typical elution profile of the photolabeled tryptic peptides on boronate affinity chromatography. Two major radioactive peaks were observed; one eluted with the non-absorbed fractions (fractions 2-7) and accounted for about 40% of the total radioactivity, and the second was eluted by 100 mM sorbitol (fractions 44-56). To confirm that the radioactive peptides in the non-absorbed fractions were not due to overloading the column, those fractions were pooled and applied to another boronate column. From this chromatography, more than 95% of the radioactivity was recovered from the non-absorbed fractions (data not shown). This result indicates that the non-absorbed radioactive peptides contain no adjacent cis-hydroxyl group(s) and were more than likely labeled by 3′-keto-8-N3-Ado. The percent (40%) of specifically photolabeled peptides from the affinity column was lower than that (60%) observed from the Ado protection experiment, indicating that some of the active site peptides were labeled by 8-N3-Ado rather than its 3′-keto derivative. This was expected since incubation of the enzyme with 8-N3-Ado at 37°C for 1 h could convert only 53% of the E·NAD+ to E·NADH, and the rest of the probe bound in the active site still existed in its original non-oxidized form at the time point of irradiation. Nevertheless, this part of the specifically labeled peptides was sacrificed in the separation method. To further confirm the specificity of the photoinsertion by 8-N3-Ado, a parallel photolabeling experiment was carried out using apoAdoHcy hydrolase which lacks NAD+ and thus does not catalyze 3′-oxidation of substrates. However, apoAdoHcy hydrolase still binds Ado and catalyzes the 5′-hydrolytic reaction (28Yuan C.S. Yeh J. Liu S. Borchardt R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17030-17037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4b, approximately 95% of the total radioactivity from the 8-N3-Ado-apoAdoHcy hydrolase experiment was retained on the boronate affinity resin and was eluted specifically by sorbitol. The small amount (5%) of the radioactivity that elutes with the non-absorbed fractions most likely arises from the residual NAD+ form of the enzyme present in the apo enzyme. Comparison of the elution profiles of boronate affinity chromatographies of the NAD+ form and the apo form of the enzyme photolabeled with [3H]8-N3-Ado gives strong evidence that radioactive peptides in the non-absorbed fractions from the affinity column are those specifically photolabeled by enzymatically oxidized 8-N3-Ado, presumably 3′-keto-8-N3-Ado. When the non-absorbed radioactive fractions in Fig. 4a were pooled and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, the chromatograph showed two major radioactive peaks: peak a (fraction number 40-43) and peak b (fraction number 44-46) (Fig. 5). These two peaks account for about 70% of the total radioactivity. These two peaks were pooled separately and rechromatographed by reverse phase HPLC by manually collecting eluted peaks. Peaks associated with significant radioactivity were rechromatographed. As shown in Fig. 6, rechromatography generated a major and several minor components with the radioactivity associated only with the major components, peak a′ and peak b′, which were isolated from peaks a and b, respectively.Figure 6:Rechromatography of photolabeled peptides purified from HPLC. Peak a (fraction 40-43) and peak b (fraction 44-46) in Fig. 5 were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac 218TP54, C18, 5 μ, 250 × 4.6 mm). Peptides were eluted by a gradient of mobile phase II (acetonitrile/H2O, 0.07%trifluoroacetic acid) in mobile phase I (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) from 20 to 60% over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peaks were collected manually, and radioactivity was determined for each peak. The major radioactive peaks were loaded onto the same column again and eluted under the same conditions. Shadowed peaks were radioactive and were manually collected for amino acid sequencing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon amino acid sequence analysis, peak a′ was found to contain peptide Val319-Arg327 (peptide I), and peak b′ contained peptide Val175-Lys186 (peptide II) as seen in Table II. Liquid scintillation counting of the washing from the conversion flask and the eluate from HPLC at each cycle of sequencing showed that Ile321 in peptide I and Ala177 in peptide II were associated with the highest radioactivity in the two peptides. These results indicate that Ile321 and Ala177 are the photoinsertion sites. Since both Ile321 and Ala177 were eluted with normal retention times from the reverse phase HPLC during sequencing, it is likely that the 3H label dissociated from the modified amino acid residue during the sequencing. In a separate experiment, the photolabeled peptides were found to be acid-labile. Upon exposure of the labeled peptides to anhydrous acetic acid, the 3H label completely dissociated from peptides. Therefore, it is probable that during the sequencing, the 3H label dissociated in the conversion flask where anilinothiozolinone amino acids are converted to phenythiohydantoin derivatives at high temperature (~64°C) and low pH (<2.0).TABLE IIAmino acid sequence analysis of the photolabeled peptides Open table in a new tab Comparison of amino acid sequences of AdoHcy hydrolase from different sources has provided useful information about the structure-function relationships of the enzyme and the identity of essential amino acid residues involved in enzyme catalysis or substrate/cofactor binding(5Creedon K.A.

Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4084-4091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AdoHcy hydrolase has been cloned from a range of sources representing billions of years of evolution. The alignment of entire sequences of AdoHcy hydrolase from different sources has been published (5Creedon K.A. Rathod P.K. Wellems T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16364-16370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows only the sequences in the two photolabeled regions. Both of the photolabeled peptides are located in very conserved regions of the entire gene. For example, with the exception of the first residue, Val175, the photolabeled region of peptide II is almost completely conserved in all known AdoHcy hydrolases. The only exceptions are the P. falciparum enzyme, where 3 residues are replaced, and the L. donovani enzyme, where 2 residues are substituted. Nevertheless, the photoinsertion site Ala177 is conserved in all known AdoHcy hydrolases. Interestingly, peptide II is located very close to Cys195, a residue that was identified as being located in the active site of the enzyme by chemical modification.2( 2C. S. Yuan, D. B. Ault-Riche, and R. T. Borchardt, manuscript in preparation. )Moreover, limited proteolysis studies on human AdoHcy hydrolase from our laboratory have recently demonstrated that Glu197-Ser198 is located in or near the active site of the enzyme by showing that cleavage of the peptide bond between Glu197-Ser198 by protease Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 on a mutant form (K426E) of the enzyme was specifically protected by the substrate Ado(22Gupta R.A. Yuan C.S. Ault-Riche D.B. Borchardt R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Information from these two separate studies gives further support to the idea that peptide II could be located in or near the active or substrate-binding site of the enzyme. In fact, Ala177 may be located very close to the C-8 position of Ade in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, at least after conformational changes induced by the probe (32Yuan C.S. Yeh J. Squier T.C. Rawitch A. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10414-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the photolabeled peptide I (Val319-Arg327), a region from the third residue (Ile321) of the peptide to Arg327 is well conserved with only a few substitutions observed in enzymes from lower evolved cells such as parasites and bacteria. In fact, this region was predicted to be involved in Ade ring binding by a computer graphics model developed in our laboratory, which shows that in the Ade portion of substrates and inhibitors, the C-6-NH2 group interacts with the main-chain carbonyl group of Leu329 (Leu330 in human) for recombinant rat liver enzyme(33Yeh J.C. Borchardt R.T. Vedani A. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Design. 1991; 5: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since Leu330 in the human enzyme is only 9 residues away from the photoinsertion site Ile321, it is likely that Ile321 is positioned such that it is close enough to the C-8 of the Ade ring to which (C-8) the azido group is attached in the photoaffinity probe. Therefore, based on results from this and earlier studies, we believe that the two photolabeled peptides Val175-Lys186 and Val319-Arg327 could be parts of the Ade ring-binding domain in the substrate binding site of AdoHcy hydrolase. AdoHcy hydrolase (23.5 μg) was incubated with 50 μM of [2-3H]8-N3-Ado in 50 μl of buffer A at 37°C for 1 h in the presence and absence of Ado followed by irradiation at 0°C for 2 min. The remaining enzyme activity was determined in the synthetic direction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stoichiometries of the total binding were determined by gel filtration under non-denatured conditions, and the covalent binding was determined by treating samples with 8 M urea containing 10 mM dithiothreitol and heating at 100°C for 3 min before gel filtration under denatured conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We acknowledge Dr. Michael Hershfield for providing us with a sample of E. coli transformed with a plasmid encoding for human placental AdoHcy hydrolase."

The M and B creatine kinase genes encode highly homologous M and B subunit proteins that associate in the cytoplasm to form three dimeric cytoplasmic isoenzymes (MM, MB, and BB).

Like other multigene families expressed in muscle the CK genes undergo an isoenzyme switch during development(13Eppenberger H.M. Eppenberger M. Richterich R. Aebi H. Dev. Biol. 1964; 10: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Ingwall J.S. Kramer M.F. Friedman W.F. Jacobus W.E. Ingwall J.S. Developmental Changes in Heart Creatine Kinase.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). B CK is expressed in immature proliferating myogenic cells (myoblasts). Muscle differentiation is characterized by down-regulation of the B gene, which is switched off during myogenesis, and induction of M CK, which becomes the major isoform present in both cardiac and skeletal muscle (17, 18). With the use of M- and B- specific cDNA probes we showed that coordinate up-regulation of M and B mRNA occurs in the early stages of myogenesis in C2C12 cells (19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and in the developing heart (20Trask R.V. Billadello J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) prior to down-regulation of B mRNA during the final stages of differentiation as M mRNA becomes the predominant species. This fetal pattern of expression of the CK genes is recapitulated in heart in response to acute pressure overload(21Fontanet H.L. Trask R.V. Haas R.C. Strauss A.W. Abendschein D.R. Billadello J.J. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the developmental expression of B CK mRNA is very similar to that of cardiac actin mRNA, which is also up-regulated in the early stages of differentiation of C2C12 cells and down-regulated as it is replaced by skeletal actin mRNA in the late stages of myogenesis(22Bains W. Ponte P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the pattern of expression of certain fetal isoforms such as B CK and cardiac actin may represent an evolutionarily conserved developmental program in muscle. This program is different from that of other fetal isoforms such as β and γ actin, which are expressed in myoblasts and are down-regulated during all subsequent stages of myogenesis(23Bergsma D. Hayward L. Grichnik J. Schwartz R. Molecular Biology of Muscle Development. Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1986: 531-546Google Scholar). We showed that the human B CK gene is regulated by an array of positive and negative cis-elements in the 5′-flanking DNA that function in both muscle and nonmuscle cells and that sequences between −92 and +80 confer expression to chimeric plasmids that resembles that of the endogenous B CK gene in C2C12 cells undergoing differentiation(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We now show that sequences within the first exon of the B CK gene are important for the developmental regulation of the gene in C2C12 cells and that these sequences bind a nuclear protein that may play a role in the developmentally regulated expression of the B CK gene. The plasmid BCKCAT92 (Fig. 1A) that contains 92 base pairs of 5′-flanking DNA, the first exon (untranslated), and the first 12 base pairs of the first intron of the human B CK gene inserted in the HindIII site of pSVOCAT was described previously(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine whether sequences within the first exon and first intron are important for expression of BCKCAT92 we prepared BCKCAT92del (+3 to +80), a construct that contains the first 92 base pairs of upstream DNA and the cap site (Fig. 1B). This construct was prepared by synthesizing oligonucleotides representing the sense and antisense strands of the sequence from −92 to +2 designed to reconstitute HindIII-compatible ends after annealing to facilitate subcloning into the HindIII site of pSVOCAT. We also prepared a 3′-deletion series of constructs with identical 5′-ends containing sequences from −92 to +2 and different 3′-ends designed to delete select sequences from the first exon and intron of the B CK gene (Fig. 1, C-F). The constructs were prepared by ligating annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the desired sequences into the HindIII site of pSVOCAT(24Hawker K.J. Billadello J.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 764-765PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were sequenced in both strands to ensure a single copy of the desired insert was present in the correct orientation(25Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Because the neomycin resistance (neo) gene encodes a very stable transcript (26Schuler G.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1988; 55: 1115-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) we prepared BCKneo reporter plasmids to facilitate detection of transcripts in transiently transfected cells. BCKCAT92 and BCKCAT92del(+3 to +80) were digested completely with BamHI and then partially with HindIII to release the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene from the plasmid. The neo gene obtained by digesting pSV2neo with BamHI and HindIII was ligated to BamHI/HindIII-digested BCKCAT92 and BCKCAT92del (+3 to +80) resulting in the constructs BCKneo92 and BCKneo92del (+3 to +80). The murine skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 (ATCC #CRL1772) was maintained in an atmosphere of 8% CO2, 92% air in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 μg/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml)). Differentiation medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and antibiotics. C2C12 cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in 3 ml of growth medium. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Precipitates contained a total of 20 μg of DNA comprised of 15 μg of test plasmid and 5 μg of pMSVβgal as an internal standard to correct for transfection efficiency. After a 4-h incubation with the precipitate, cells were subjected to a 3-min glycerol shock and harvested 24-48 h later. Other dishes of cells were fed with 3 ml of differentiation medium after the transfected cells had become fully confluent and harvested 60 h later as fully differentiated myotubes. Cell extracts were prepared, and assays for β-galactosidase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase were performed as described previously(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The amount of extract used for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays was based on the results of the β-galactosidase assay and contained 25-100 μg of protein. The assays were terminated after 60 min. C2C12 cells plated as described above were transfected with 15 μg of either BCKneo92 or BCKneo92del(+3 to +80) and 5 μg of pCMVCAT as an internal standard to control for transfection efficiency. The cells were harvested 28 h after transfection, and Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified directly from transfected cells with the use of a Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Northern blots were prepared with 7 μg of Poly(A)+ mRNA and Nytran membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) as recommended by the supplier. The probes were a 1321-base pair HindIII/SmaI fragment of the neo gene and a 550-base pair HindIII/NcoI fragment of the CAT gene radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) as described(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms prepared with Kodak XAR film and Cronex intensifying screens were analyzed with an LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer. Extracts were prepared from C2C12 cells and tissues by a modification of the method described by Heberlein et al.(27Heberlein U. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 331: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford(28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment comprising the first exon and first 13 base pairs of the first intron of the B CK gene was used as the template in a polymerase chain reaction with primers designed to include bases +1 to 19, the reverse complement of +64 to +80, and with [32P]dCTP at a final concentration of 0.32 μM(29Sandler M.A. Zhang J.-N. Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21500-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (30Trask R.V. Koster J.C. Ritchie M.E. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with 1.0 × 104 dpm of double-stranded 32P-labeled probe and 10 μg of nuclear protein extract. Nuclear extract was incubated with 19.2 milliunits of potato acid phosphatase (Sigma) or with buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH = 9.3, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and 1.0 mM spermidine) and 2.0 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega) for 30 min at 37°C. After phosphatase treatment 32P-body-labeled probe was added to the extract, and gel mobility shift assays were performed. We showed that sequences within −92 to +80 of the B CK gene confer a regulated pattern of expression to CAT reporter plasmids in C2C12 cells that resembles the time course of expression of B CK mRNA(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The plasmid BCKCAT92 (Fig. 1A) showed peak expression 24-48 h after transfection and was not expressed above background in fully differentiated myotubes. In nonmyogenic cells that express B CK (HeLa cells, Hep G2 cells, and NIH3T3 cells) BCKCAT92 expression was above background 48-108 h after transfection(19Ritchie M.E. Trask R.V. Fontanet H.L. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results show that the decrease in expression of BCKCAT92 in C2C12 cells is due to differentiation and does not simply reflect the time course of expression of a plasmid in a transient transfection experiment. To determine the importance of exonic and intronic sequences for expression of BCKCAT92 in C2C12 cells we prepared a construct in which the exonic and intronic sequences were deleted (BCKCAT92del (+3 to +80), Fig. 1B). When compared to the expression of BCKCAT92, which was approximately 5-fold above background in myoblasts, deletion of exon I and intron I sequences from BCKCAT92 resulted in a plasmid that was not expressed above background in either myoblasts or myotubes (Fig. 1B). These results were unexpected and showed that sequences from +2 to +80 were critical for expression of BCKCAT92. Accordingly, to determine the sequences from +2 to +80 that regulate expression of BCKCAT92 we prepared a 3′-deletion series (Fig. 1, C-F). Deletion of sequences from +26 to +80 had no effect on expression of the resultant plasmid (Fig. 1, C-D). Although expression of the plasmid BCKCAT92del (+26 to +80) was higher than that of BCKCAT92 (Fig. 1, A and D) the difference was not statistically significant (Student's t test). However, deletion of sequences from +18 to +25 resulted in a construct that was not expressed above background in myoblasts or myotubes (Fig. 1, E and F). In contrast, the plasmid MCKCAT2620 that contains the human M CK gene enhancer (30Trask R.V. Koster J.C. Ritchie M.E. Billadello J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was inactive in myoblasts and was expressed 19-fold above background in fully differentiated myotubes (Fig. 1G). These results show that sequences from +18 to +25 are important for expression of BCKCAT chimeric plasmids in C2C12 myoblasts. BCKCAT mRNA transcripts derived from the constructs shown in Fig. 1, A-F are different. This suggests expression may vary with translational efficiency of BCKCAT mRNAs. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether the observed difference in CAT activity in cells transfected with these constructs correlated with CAT mRNA levels. We performed Northern blot analysis of mRNA extracted from C2C12 cells transfected with BCKCAT92 and BCKCAT92del(+3 to +80). Because CAT mRNA was not detectable with this technique we prepared constructs in which the CAT gene was replaced with the neo gene, which encodes a more stable transcript. C2C12 cells were transfected with BCKneo92 and BCKneo92del(+3 to +80), and neo mRNA transcripts were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. The steady-state level of neo mRNA directed by BCKneo92 was 9-fold greater than that of BCKneo92del(+3 to +80) when normalized to CAT mRNA encoded by the internal standard pCMVCAT (Fig. 2). These results show that sequences within B CK exon I modulate expression of chimeric plasmids at the level of mRNA accumulation. Effects at the level of transcription as well as mRNA processing and stability are all formal possibilities. To characterize the trans-acting factors that interact with sequences within the first exon of the B CK gene we prepared nuclear extracts from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes at select developmental stages and performed gel mobility shift assays. We were particularly interested in factors that are expressed in myoblasts and are down-regulated with differentiation that could be important mediators of B CK gene expression. A representative result from two independent preparations of extracts is shown in Fig. 3. Three nuclear protein-DNA complexes are depicted with arrows. Complex 1 exhibited marked down-regulation with differentiation. Complex 2 was not consistently detected in different preparations of extract tested, and complex 3 was not regulated with differentiation. These results identify a nuclear protein complex that is expressed in myoblasts and is down-regulated with differentiation resembling the expression of B CK in myogenic cells in culture. To determine whether the DNA-protein complexes shown in Fig. 3 represented the specific interaction of nuclear proteins with sequences within B CK exon I shown to be important for expression of chimeric plasmids in transfected cells, additional gel mobility shift experiments were performed with competitor DNA (Fig. 4). Unlabeled DNA including sequences from +1 to +25 was added to the gel mobility shift reaction in molar excess to 32P-labeled exon I probe. The cold DNA competed with the probe for binding to nuclear protein present in complex 1 but not complex 3 (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4). In comparison, unlabeled DNA that included sequences from +1 to +17 did not compete with the probe for binding to complex 1 (Fig. 4, lanes 5-7). These results show that sequences from +18 to +25 that are critical for expression of chimeric plasmids in transfected cells also represent the binding site for complex 1. We used gel mobility shift assays to evaluate the expression of protein 1 in select tissues. We prepared nuclear extracts from brain, a tissue in which B CK is expressed, and from heart and skeletal muscle, tissues in which the CK genes undergo developmental regulation(20Trask R.V. Billadello J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Seraydarian M.W. Yamada T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 194: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The results showed that expression of protein 1 was abundant in brain (Fig. 5, lane BR) and expressed at a lower level in heart, a tissue in which the MB isoenzyme of CK is found and in which B CK mRNA is present (Fig. 5, lane H). Mature skeletal muscle, which expresses only trace amounts of B mRNA, did not show detectable amounts of protein 1 (Fig. 5, lane M). These results show that the expression of protein 1 in the tissues evaluated correlated well with that of B CK mRNA. In contrast, band 3 was detected in all tissues. In skeletal muscle and heart, B CK mRNA is down-regulated with development. To determine whether the developmental regulation of protein 1 in heart and skeletal muscle resembled that of B CK mRNA, we prepared nuclear protein extracts from tissues obtained from 1-day-old neonatal mice, a stage at which B CK mRNA expression is abundant relative to that of mature tissue(20Trask R.V. Billadello J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results of gel mobility shift assays showed that protein 1 was abundant in both neonatal tissues and was down-regulated with development, correlating well with the developmental regulation of B CK mRNA in these tissues (Fig. 6). In contrast, band 3 was not developmentally regulated.Figure 6:Developmental expression of band 1 protein in tissues. 32P-labeled B CK probe was incubated with nuclear extract prepared from heart and skeletal muscle from day 1 neonatal (N) and adult (A) mice and evaluated in a standard gel mobility shift assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Developmental down-regulation of band 1 protein could be due to either a decrease in synthesis or a post-translational modification of the protein resulting in lower affinity for the target DNA. Because phosphorylation has been shown to modulate the DNA binding activity of many transcription factors(32Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of treatment of extracts with phosphatases on binding of the probe by band 1 protein. Treatment of extract with either enzyme resulted in marked inhibition of formation of complex 1 (Fig. 7). These results suggest that phosphorylation of band 1 protein may be an important post-transcriptional mechanism that mediates affinity for the target DNA. To determine the molecular weight of protein 1 we performed a gel mobility shift assay with the B CK probe and nuclear protein extract from C2C12 myoblasts. Band 1 was excised from a wet gel after a brief exposure to Kodak XAR film to facilitate localization of the band in the gel. The protein was separated from the gel with the use of electroelution, analyzed by electrophoresis in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected with the silver reagent (Bio-Rad). A single protein of approximate molecular weight 150 kDa (n = 6 gels) was seen consistently (Fig. 8). This band was not seen when free DNA probe was separated from a band shift gel by electroelution, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and stained with silver reagent. Autoradiography of the gel showed that the band represented protein, and not protein complexed to [32P]DNA probe. The creatine kinase gene family represents an interesting model of coordinate regulation of isoproteins that can be studied in convenient cell culture systems. A great deal of attention has been given to elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate the M CK gene. The regulatory elements that are essential for expression of this gene have been characterized by transfection experiments in cell culture (33-35), direct gene injection into heart and skeletal muscle(36Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in transgenic animals(38Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The M CK gene is regulated by a tissue-specific enhancer that contains two MEF-1 motifs or E-boxes (CANNTG) that bind myogenic factors (MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF-4) and an MEF-2 motif that binds a MADS box transcription factor(39Yu Y.-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In contrast, regulatory mechanisms that control genes that are turned off during myogenesis have received less attention. The down-regulation of β-actin mRNA during myogenesis is controlled at the level of transcription by conserved sequences in the 3′-nontranslated region of the gene(40DePonti-Zilli L. Seiler-Tuyns A. Paterson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cardiac α-actin gene is regulated by the interaction of MyoD1, the serum response factor, and Sp1 with promoter elements(41Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The helix-loop-helix protein Id is expressed in C2C12 myoblasts and is down-regulated with differentiation(42Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). Id associates specifically with MyoD and attenuates its ability to trans-activate muscle-specific genes such as the M CK gene. There is no evidence that Id or other helix-loop-helix proteins play a direct or indirect role in the regulation of the B CK gene. The regulation of the B CK gene has been studied in a number of nonmuscle systems. A 61-base pair sequence between −98 and −37 that contains both the CCAAT and TATA sequences is important for efficient in vitro transcription from a minimal B CK promoter (43-46). The results of transfection experiments have identified 5′-upstream sequence elements and sequences within the first (untranslated) exon that are important for expression in HeLa cells (47Hobson G.M. Molloy G.R. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6533-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma cells(48Mariman E. Wieringa B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The B CK gene promoter has strong sequence similarity to the adenovirus E2E gene promoter and like the E2E gene is regulated by the viral activator Ela. This finding may be of significance for the metabolic energy-requiring events that take place after oncogenic activation(49Kaddurah-Daouk R. Lillie J.W. Daouk G.H. Green M.R. Kingston R. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In osteoblastic cells transcriptional up-regulation of the gene during differentiation is associated with the formation of a nuclear protein-DNA complex that binds a cis-element between +1 and +228 of the gene(5Ch'ng J.L.C. Ibrahim B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2336-2341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In U937 cells the highly conserved 3′-NTR of B CK mRNA is important for translational regulation of B CK protein(50Ch'ng J.L.C. Shoemaker D.L. Schimmel P. Holmes E.W. Science. 1990; 248: 1003-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We present evidence that sequences within the first exon are important for regulation of expression of the B CK gene in transfected myogenic cells in culture. This sequence does not contain recognition sites for any previously described transcription factor (Genetics Computer Group (GCG) transcription factor recognition sites release 6.5). The presence of regulatory sequences within the first exon of a gene is an unusual finding but is not unique to the B CK gene. Important regulatory sequences within the first exon have been described in the human tissue-type plasminogen activator gene(51Medcalf R.L. Ruegg M. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14618-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the skeletal troponin I gene(52Nikovits W. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3468-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and a human nonmuscle myosin heavy chain gene(53Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of the exonic regulatory sequences important for expression of other genes in muscle cells share significant identity with the sequence we describe. Protein phosphorylation is an important control mechanism for regulation of the myogenic developmental program. Both MyoD and myogenin are phosphoproteins(54Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 55Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P.-F. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 242: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Phosphatase treatment of MyoD attenuates specific binding of MyoD-E12 heterodimers to the M CK gene enhancer(56Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11670-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor inhibits myogenesis by inactivating myogenic helix-loop-helix proteins by phosphorylating a site in the DNA binding domain of myogenin(54Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid inhibits skeletal muscle cell differentiation and MyoD expression and induces expression of the id gene (57Kim S.-J. Kim K.Y. Tapscott S.J. Winokur T.S. Park K. Fujiki H. Weintraub H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15140-15145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We describe a nuclear protein that binds specifically to sequence elements that are important for expression of B CK chimeric constructs in C2C12 myoblasts. Evidence that the protein we describe is important for regulation of the B CK gene includes specific binding to sequences within the first exon that confer regulated expression to the CAT gene in transfected C2C12 cells, expression in tissues that correlates with that of B CK mRNA and protein, and developmental expression in myogenic cells and in heart and skeletal muscle that resembles that of B CK mRNA. Our results suggest that expression of B CK in cells and tissues may be regulated through a mechanism that alters phosphorylation of this DNA binding protein. Further investigation may provide insight into these mechanisms that mediate the developmental down-regulation of genes during myogenic development.
