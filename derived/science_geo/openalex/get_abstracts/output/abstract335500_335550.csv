https://openalex.org/W2078840395,"A seasonal shift in chromosome number of reproductive cells of Claytonia virginica, which coincided with near-drought conditions, resulted in a chromosome complement new to the population. The number reappeared 2 years later, the minimum time required for plants of that generation to produce flowers. Moreover, the chromosome number of root cells commonly differed from aerial organs of the same plant."
https://openalex.org/W2026832670,"Discovery of coesite in St. Peter sandstone from the central uplift of the Kentland structure, Newton County, Indiana, and in shatter cones of Lilley dolomite of Middle Silurian age from the central uplift of the Serpent Mound structure near Sinking Springs, Ohio, proves that shatter cones are evidence of meteorite impact."
https://openalex.org/W2079169458,The power of a heat engine ignited by tidal energy can account for geologically reasonable rates of average magma production and sea floor spreading. These rates control similarity of heat flux over continents and oceans because of an inverse relationship between respective depth intervals for mass transfer and consequent distributions of radiogenic heat production.
https://openalex.org/W2044461984,"A series of originally submarine volcanoes has been found in the Afar Depression. Some of the volcanic structures are morphologically similar to oceanic guyots. One of them consists of strata of finely fragmented and pulverized basaltic glass. The fragmentation of the lava is probably the result of stream explosions taking place during the submarine eruption. The flat top of this guyot is considered to be a constructional feature; by analogy, it is suggested that not all oceanic guyots are necessarily the result of wave truncation of former volcanic islands."
https://openalex.org/W1983186345,"When gametophytes of Onoclea sensibilis are grown in darkness a filament of a few cells develops which elongates at a constant rate. Low dosages of red light given at the beginning of growth increase the rate of elongation. After about 12 days in darkness, however, gametophytes show a decreased growth rate when given red light."
https://openalex.org/W2071185771,"Two species, A and B, interact when their niches α and β intersect in space and time. The composite element AB may be either more, less, or equally effective in regulation. It is suggested that the first condition exists when the overlap between α and β is small; this leads, on a large scale, to complex biocenotic phenomena in which components of a tremendously diversified biota may coexist. The coupling AB is likely, on the other hand, to be antagonistic to optimization of regulation by the whole community; in this case, it is postulated, one of the components (the less effective regulator acting alone) is purged. This is competitive exclusion, and it develops when α and β intersect greatly. Between these extremes of cooperation and competition lies an area of niche intersection in which AB is not much better or worse than A or B alone. This case gives rise to passive coexistence of A and B. These are the extremes; even a cursory consideration of the permutational possibilities for niche intersection gives an immediate concept of the overwhelming variety of possible interspecific interactions and a glimpse of the dangers inherent in overemphasizing a single aspect. It is therefore advocated that the principle of competitive exclusion be regarded as only a small segment of a broad class of interspecific phenomena."

https://openalex.org/W2039034916,"Electron diffraction patterns have been obtained for coals of different rank by transmission through ultrathin sections 500 to 2000 angstroms thick. Analysis of these patterns for the distribution of atoms in coals by Debye radial distribution functions should furnish information complementary to that derived from x-ray studies, considering the differences in wavelength of the radiation involved and the different mechanisms governing the diffraction."
