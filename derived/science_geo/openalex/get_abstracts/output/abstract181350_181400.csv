https://openalex.org/W2052409758,"Geographic overlap between malaria and the occurrence of mutant hemoglobin and erythrocyte surface proteins has indicated that polymorphisms in human genes have been selected by severe malaria1,2. Deletion of exon 3 in the glycophorin C gene (called GYPCΔex3 here) has been found in Melanesians; this alteration changes the serologic phenotype of the Gerbich (Ge) blood group system, resulting in Ge negativity3,4. The GYPCΔex3 allele reaches a high frequency (46.5%) in coastal areas of Papua New Guinea where malaria is hyperendemic5. The Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (EBA140, also known as BAEBL)6,7,8 binds with high affinity to the surface of human erythrocytes. Here we show that the receptor for EBA140 is glycophorin C (GYPC) and that this interaction mediates a principal P. falciparum invasion pathway into human erythrocytes. EBA140 does not bind to GYPC in Ge-negative erythrocytes, nor can P. falciparum invade such cells using this invasion pathway. This provides compelling evidence that Ge negativity has arisen in Melanesian populations through natural selection by severe malaria."

Here, we identify bacterial cold shock protein (CSP) as a new such PAMP that acts as a highly active elicitor of defense responses in tobacco. Tobacco cells perceive a conserved domain of CSP and synthetic peptides representing 15 amino acids of this domain-induced responses at subnanomolar concentrations. Central to the elicitor-active domain is the RNP-1 motif KGFGFITP, a motif conserved also in many RNA- and DNA-binding proteins of eukaryotes. Csp15-Nsyl, a peptide representing the domain with highest homology to csp15 in a protein of Nicotiana sylvestris exhibited only weak activity in tobacco cells. Crystallographic and genetic data from the literature show that the RNP-1 domain of bacterial CSPs resides on a protruding loop and exposes a series of aromatic and basic side chains to the surface that are essential for the nucleotide-binding activity of CSPs. Similarly, these side chains were also essential for elicitor activity and replacement of single residues in csp15 with Ala strongly reduced or abolished activity. Most strikingly, csp15-Ala10, a peptide with the RNP-1 motif modified to KGAGFITP, lacked elicitor activity but acted as a competitive antagonist for CSP-related elicitors. Bacteria commonly have a small family of CSP-like proteins including both cold-inducible and noninducible members, and Csp-related elicitor activity was detected in extracts from all bacteria tested. Thus, the CSP domain containing the RNP-1 motif provides a structure characteristic for bacteria in general, and tobacco plants have evolved a highly sensitive chemoperception system to detect this bacterial PAMP.

Thus, the CSP domain containing the RNP-1 motif provides a structure characteristic for bacteria in general, and tobacco plants have evolved a highly sensitive chemoperception system to detect this bacterial PAMP. A key aspect of active defense against invading microbial pathogens is the ability to discriminate between self and infectious nonself (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Google Scholar). In plants, recognition-dependent disease resistance has been studied most thoroughly and most successfully in cases that depend on the presence of specific resistance genes that confer immunity to particular races of plant pathogens. Several of these resistance genes were shown to be involved in the chemoperception of factors specifically attributed with particular strains of pathogens (2Yang Y. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1621-1639Google Scholar, 3Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Google Scholar, 4Schneider D.S. Cell. 2002; 109: 537-540Google Scholar). In addition, plants have a broader, more basal, surveillance involving sensitive perception systems for patterns characteristic for entire groups or classes of microorganisms, and they respond to these general elicitors with activation of signaling pathways that initiate defense mechanisms (5Heath M.C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 315-319Google Scholar). This is highly reminiscent of innate immunity in animals and humans. Among the elicitors that represent patterns characteristic for fungi are cell wall components like glucans, chitin and chitosan oligosaccharides, peptides and proteins with fungal-specific N-glycosylation, and the membrane component ergosterol (6Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Google Scholar, 7Hahn M.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1996; 34: 387-412Google Scholar). Similarly, cells of many plant species have a perception system for the common bacterial surface protein flagellin, the building block of the flagella (8Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Google Scholar). Perception of flagellin byArabidopsis thaliana was shown to depend on FLS2, a membrane-bound receptor kinase protein with an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (9Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1003-1011Google Scholar). Bacterial flagellin has recently also been identified as one of the “pathogen-associated molecular patterns” (PAMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; CSP, cold shock protein; CSD, cold shock domain that activate the innate immune system of humans and animals (10Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar) via the Toll-like receptor 5 (11Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Mori N. Oishi K. Nagatake T. Takahashi A. Asakura H. Makino S. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Ohsaki M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30521-30526Google Scholar, 12Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar). Thus, perception of general elicitors in plants resembles perception of PAMPs in the innate immune system of animals with respect to the type of molecules perceived, the characteristics of pattern recognition receptors involved, as well as some of the signaling mechanisms and defense responses induced (13Nurnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Google Scholar). Flagellin was the predominant if not only elicitor present in crude bacterial extracts that activated elicitor responses in the tomato cells used in our previous experiments. Extracts from bacteria without flagella or with flagellins that are strongly divergent in the elicitor-active domain represented by the oligopeptide flg22 proved inactive in the tomato cells (8Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Google Scholar). These observations with one particular cell line, grown in vitro for several years, do not exclude the existence of chemoperception systems for other bacterial PAMPs in tomato or other plant species. Perception of several different PAMPs, indicative for the same class of microbial pathogens, appears characteristic for the innate immune system of animals. Similarly, redundancy of chemoperception systems for a variety of molecular patterns characteristic for fungi has also been observed in plants (6Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to search for additional chemoperception systems of plants sensing molecular patterns characteristic for bacteria. Suspension cultured tobacco cells have long been known to respond with a rapid K+ efflux, a concomitant medium alkalinization and an oxidative burst when treated with bacterial preparations containing either living or heat-killed bacteria (14Atkinson M.M. Huang J.-S. Knopp J.A. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 843Google Scholar) but the bacterial factors eliciting these responses have not been identified. In initial experiments we tested commercial preparations containing peptidoglycan from Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Staphylococcus aureus) for induction of responses in cultured tobacco cells. Peptidoglycan has long been known as a PAMP signaling presence of Gram-positive bacteria in the innate immune systems of animals (10Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan preparation indeed induced significant and rapid responses in tobacco but, surprisingly, a preparation of total lyophilized M. lysodeikticus bacteria proved to be a far more potent source of elicitor activity. We concentrated on the purification and characterization of this latter activity and, in the present work, identified it as a small protein belonging to the family of so-called cold shock proteins. Peptides were synthesized by F. Fischer (Friedrich Miescher-Institute, Basel) or by Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Peptides were dissolved in H2O (stock solutions of 1 to 10 mm) and diluted in a solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 m NaCl.Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58 T), Rhizobium meliloti, and Xanthomonas campestris were obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM GmbH, Braunschweig, BRD) and grown in King's B broth at 26 °C on a rotary shaker. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with H2O, and resuspended in H2O (10% of original volume). Crude bacterial elicitors were prepared by boiling the bacterial suspensions for 5–10 min and removing of bacterial debris by centrifugation. Lyophilized bacteria of M. lysodeikticus(Sigma) and the peptidoglycan fraction from M. lysodeikticus(Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were applied as suspensions in H2O. The bacterial preparation “messenger” was obtained from EDEN Bioscience (Bothell, WA). Elicitor activity was purified from the lyophilized preparation of M. lysodeikticus (Sigma). Ten g of the lyophilisate was suspended in 100 ml of H2O and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. After centrifugation (30 min at 10,000 × g) the supernatant was mixed with 1 volume of acetone and the precipitate formed after overnight incubation at −20 °C was removed by centrifugation. The acetone concentration was brought to 80% (v/v) and the precipitate formed after 4 h at −20 °C was collected by centrifugation. This precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and passed over an anion-exchange column with diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE-cellulose, Whatman) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Activity eluting in the flow-through was concentrated by acetone precipitation (80% acetone) and separated on a Sephacel C8 reversed phase column (AmershamBiosciences AB) at pH 6.5 (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, as solvent A and 80% acetonitrile, 20% phosphate buffer as solvent B). The two fractions containing the highest elicitor activity were pooled, pH adjusted to 3.5, and rerun on a Sephacel C8 reversed phase column at pH 3.5 (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O at pH 3.5 as solvent A and 80% acetonitrile, 20% H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent B). The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cell culture line 275N, originally derived from pith tissue of Havanna 425 plants, was maintained and subcultured as described before (15Felix G. Meins Jr., F. Planta (Heidelberg). 1987; 172: 386-392Google Scholar) in a Murashige-Skoog based medium. Cells were maintained as suspension cultures and used 4 to 10 days after subculture for experiments. Cell cultures of tomato (“line Msk8” (16Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Google Scholar)), potato (17Schweizer P. Felix G. Buchala A. Muller C. Métraux J.P. Plant J. 1996; 10: 331-341Google Scholar), Lycopersicon peruvianum (18Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1995; 7: 381-389Google Scholar), andA. thaliana (19May M.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 621-627Google Scholar) were cultured as described elsewhere. To measure alkalinization of the growth medium (the alkalinization response), 3-ml aliquots of the cell suspensions were placed in open, 20-ml vials on a rotary shaker at 120 to 150 cycles per min. Using small combined glass electrodes (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) extracellular pH values were either recorded continuously with a pen recorder or measured after 15 or 20 min of treatment. Fully expanded leaves of different plant species were cut in 2-mm slices and floated on H2O overnight. For measuring the oxidative burst, active oxygen species released by the leaf tissue were measured by a luminol-dependent assay (20Keppler L.D. Baker C.J. Atkinson M.M. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 974-978Google Scholar). Slices were transferred to assay tubes (2–4 slices corresponding to ∼20 mg of fresh weight) containing 0.1 ml of H2O supplied with 20 μm luminol and 1 μg of horseradish peroxidase (Fluka). Luminescence was measured in a LKB 1250 luminometer (LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland) for 20 min after the addition of the test solution. For assaying ethylene production, leaf slices (∼50 mg of fresh per assay) were transferred to 6-ml glass tubes containing 1 ml of an aqueous solution of the peptide being tested. Vials were closed with rubber septa and ethylene accumulating in the free air space was measured by gas chromatography after 2 to 2.5 h of incubation. The results shown in the figures represent single experiments that are representative for several independent repetitions. Peptidoglycan, an essential cell wall component of all bacteria, acts as one of the PAMPs signaling the presence of Gram-positive bacteria to the innate immune system in animals (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Google Scholar, 10Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar). In initial experiments we tested preparations containing peptidoglycan for induction of extracellular alkalinization in plant cells cultured in liquid medium. Medium alkalinization, occurring as a consequence of altered ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, can serve as a convenient, rapid, sensitive and quantitative bioassay to study elicitor perception by plant cells (16Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Google Scholar). As a source of peptidoglycan we used preparations from M. lysodeikticus(S. aureus) because lyophilized bacteria and a peptidoglycan fraction are commercially available. Also, as deduced from the genomes of the three fully sequenced strains of S. aureus (M. lysodeikticus) that do not encode proteins resembling flagellin, these preparations should be free of elicitor-active flagellin that could interfere in the assays. No alkalinization was observed in the tomato cells of the line Msk8 after treatment with lyophilized M. lysodeikticus bacteria or the peptidoglycan fraction derived from these bacteria (data not shown). Whereas these negative results confirmed the absence of elicitor-active flagellin they did not provide evidence for a chemoperception system responding to peptidoglycan in the tomato cells. When tested on tobacco cells, however, both preparations of M. lysodeikticus caused rapid and strong medium alkalinization (Fig. 1). As shown in the examples in Fig. 1 A, extracellular pH started to increase after a lag of ∼3 to 5 min and reached a maximum after ∼10 to 15 min. Depending on the cell density and the initial pH of different batches of the cell culture the amplitude of the alkalinization response (ΔpHmax) varied from 1.2 to 2 pH units for lyophilized bacteria and from 0.6 to 1.4 pH units for the peptidoglycan fraction, respectively. In aliquots from a given batch of cells, however, ΔpHmax was highly reproducible and consistently showed a bigger response for the preparation of total bacteria than for the peptidoglycan fraction. The responses of the cells to both preparations of M. lysodeikticuswere dose-dependent and lower, nonsaturating doses led to prolonged lag phases, smaller maximal pH increases, and shortened durations of medium alkalinization. The pH change occurring within 15 min (ΔpH15min) of treatment was a steady function of the dose applied and was used as a parameter to compare the relative strength of the two preparations of M. lysodeikticus (Fig.1 B). Half-maximal stimulation was observed with 30 μg/ml of the peptidoglycan (EC50) and <1 μg/ml with the lyophilized bacteria, respectively. Treatment with protease K strongly affected the activity of the bacterial preparation resulting in a 200-fold higher EC50 value (200 μg/ml) but led only to a 3-fold increase for the EC50 value of the peptidoglycan fraction (Fig. 1 B). These results provided preliminary evidence for the presence of two distinct elicitor activities inM. lysodeikticus: a nonproteinaceous elicitor in the peptidoglycan fraction and a second, potent, proteinaceous elicitor predominating in the total bacteria preparation. On a per weight basis the proteinaceous factor was more than 100-fold more active than the peptidoglycan factor and further work focused on the characterization of this new protein elicitor. The elicitor activity, extracted from the crude preparation ofM. lysodeikticus (S. aureus), was heat-stable (5 min, 95 °C), passed ultrafilters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000, and was inactivated by treatment with trypsin (data not shown), indicating that the elicitor activity was attributable to a peptide or small protein. Activity was purified on a Sephacal C8 reversed phase column (Fig.2 A). In the first chromatography at pH 6.5 activity eluted as a single peak (Fig.2 B). The two fractions containing most of the activity were pooled and rerun on the C8 column at pH 3.5. The peak of activity eluting from this second run correlated with a single peak ofA 214. Separation by SDS-PAGE (14% (w/v) acrylamide) showed a band migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 7,000 to 9,000 and elicitor activity, detected in eluates of the sliced gel pieces, was found to co-migrate with this band (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing of the protein and sequence information obtained from some of the peptides after tryptic digestion identified the protein as a cold shock protein (CSP). In Fig.3 the sequence information from the purified protein was aligned with the sequence of the major cold shock protein from M. luteus and a consensus sequence obtained from >150 bacterial cold shock proteins present in the data bank.Figure 3Alignment of bacterial cold shock proteins. Sequence alignment of some CSPs, representative for different bacteria species. Letters indicate positions that differ from the consensus sequence. Consensus sequence and percentage of conservation for the amino acid residues were calculated from >150 bacterial CSP sequences present in the SwissProt data base. Partial sequence for M. lysodeikticus represents information obtained from the purified protein after tryptic digest and Edman degradation of some of the peptides. Csp22 andcsp15 denote peptides synthesized according to the consensus sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In attempts to localize the elicitor activity to a particular domain of the protein the purified CSP was subjected to peptide cleavage. Digestion with trypsin, Lys-C, or Glu-C (V8 protease) abolished the activity and did not result in smaller fragments with elicitor activity (data not shown). As in previous work with bacterial flagellin (8Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Google Scholar) we speculated that plant cells might have a perception system for the most characteristic and most conserved domain of the CSPs. Although these small bacterial proteins show a high overall homology they are particularly conserved in a domain close to the N terminus. Based on the consensus sequence of bacterial CSPs, a 22-amino acid peptide spanning this domain was synthesized (Fig. 3,underlined sequence) and tested for induction of alkalinization in tobacco cells. This peptide, termed csp22, proved even more active than the intact CSP purified from M. lysodeikticus and induced medium alkalinization with an EC50 of ∼0.1 nm (Fig.4). To further delineate the epitope that activates responses in the plant cells, peptides lacking varying numbers of amino acid residues from the N- or C-terminal end were synthesized and assayed for activity in dose-response curves as described above for csp22 and CSP. The amino acid sequences and the EC50 values are summarized in (Fig.5). Omitting 5 amino acid residues from the N terminus of csp22 reduced activity only slightly (EC50 of ∼1.2 nm) but removal of the Lys residue at position 6 showed a much stronger effect (EC50of ∼220 nm) and further trimming by 4 amino acid residues resulted in an inactive peptide. The peptide termed csp15, comprising the 15 amino acid residues central to csp22, was nearly as active as csp22 (EC50 of 0.3 nm) and served as a core peptide for testing structural analogues with replacements of single amino acid residues with alanine. Csp15-Ala3, csp15-Ala4, csp15-Ala8, and csp15-Ala12 all exhibited at least 1000-fold reduced activity compared with csp15. Csp15-Ala10 was inactive even at the highest concentration of 100 μm tested (Fig. 5). In contrast, substitution of Phe at position 10 with a Tyr residue resulted in a peptide with full activity in the tobacco cells (Fig. 5). Among the peptides with single substitutions with Ala only csp15-Ala7 showed no significant decrease in activity. Interestingly, the Glu at this position also shows the least conservation in the different sequences of bacterial CSPs (Fig. 3). The three-dimensional structure has been determined for the major bacterial cold shock proteins CspB from Bacillus subtilis(Molecular Modeling Database number 3622; Protein Data Bank number1CSP) (21Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Google Scholar) and CspA (CS7.4) from E. coli (Molecular Modeling Database number 1677; Protein Data Bank number 1MJC) (22Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Google Scholar). CspB forms a dimer whereas CspA occurs as monomer. Besides this difference of dimerization the structures of both proteins are very similar, forming compact β-barrel structures built up from five antiparallel β-strands with connecting turns and loops. Fig.6 shows models (secondary structure and a three-dimensional ribbon model) of the molecular structure of CspB, highlighting the domain spanned by the csp15 peptide. Clearly, elicitor activity can be attributed to the domain formed by antiparallel strands β1 and β2 and the loop L1. This domain includes a RNA-binding motif known as RNP-1 (also termed RNP-CS) and exposes a cluster of aromatic and basic side chains to the surface of the protein. An analysis using site-directed mutagenesis of CspB from B. subtilis has demonstrated that these conserved residues are essential for the interaction of the protein with nucleic acids (23Schröder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Google Scholar). In TableI, these single amino acid replacements and their effects on nucleic acid binding were compared with the corresponding amino acid changes in csp15 and their effects on elicitor activity in tobacco. All the substitutions in csp15 that correspond to substitutions leading to strong or complete reduction in affinity of CspB for nucleic acids exhibited strongly reduced elicitor activity in tobacco cells (higher EC50 values). The substitution of Phe by Tyr at the position that corresponds to residue 10 in csp15 did not affect affinity of CspB for nucleic acids and also did not alter elicitor activity.Table IComparison of mutations in cspB affecting DNA-binding and single amino acid changes in csp15 on elicitor activitySubstitution in CspBSubstitution in csp15aCsp15 comprises amino acids 5 to 20 in CspB.

Open table in a new tab Csp-related proteins are common to all eubacteria and they usually form a small family of proteins that include both cold-inducible and noninducible members (24Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 49-57Google Scholar). The domain containing the RNP-1 motif is conserved also in many eukaryotic proteins that bind to RNA or DNA. Examples for proteins with this so-called CSD include human and animal transcription factors recognizing the Y-box sequence and glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins occurring in plants (see Supplementary Materials for gene structure and alignment with bacterial CSPs). Peptides corresponding to the homologues of a human Y-box protein and a Gly-rich protein fromNicotiana sylvestris were synthesized and tested for activity. The csp15 homologue from the human Y-box protein was inactive whereas the peptide representing N. sylvestrissequence induced responses with an EC50 of 300 nm and was thus ∼1000-fold less active than the csp15 representing the bacterial sequence (Fig. 5). We examined cell cultures derived from other plant species for alkalinization in response to CSP-related elicitors. Responses with characteristics similar to the ones of the tobacco line 275N were observed also with a second line of tobacco, originating from a plant of the variety SR1, with a cell line derived from potato and a cell culture from L. peruvianum (data not shown). In contrast, no responses could be detected in the cell culture line msk8, originally derived from a cross of Lycopersicon esculentum withL. peruvianum, and in cell lines from A. thalianaand rice (data not shown). Negative results with particular lines of cell cultures do not allow concluding on the absence of a perception system in the corresponding plant species because this perception system might be not expressed or might have been lost during the years of growth in vitro. Induced release of active oxygen species, an oxidative burst, and increased biosynthesis of the stress hormone ethylene are responses characteristic for plants under attack by pathogens or treated by elicitor preparations (6Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Google Scholar, 25Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Google Scholar). We used these responses to monitor responsiveness toward CSP-derived elicitors in leaf tissues from different plant species. As exemplified in Fig.7 for leaf tissue from tomato, a rapid, significant increase in ethylene biosynthesis and in active oxygen species was observed after treatment with csp15 but not after treatment with the same dose of csp15-Nsyl. Similarly, clear CSP-dependent induction of ethylene biosynthesis and oxidative burst was observed in tobacco and several other solanaceous plants including potato (Solanum tuberosum), Solanum dulcamara, Scopolia carniolica, and Mandragora officinarum. In contrast, no response could be detected from leaf tissue and cell cultures of A. thaliana, cucumber, and rice. Also, no signs of a hypersensitivity response could be detected after injection of CSP peptides to leaves of tobacco or tomato (data not shown). In summary, a perception system for CSP-related elicitors is common to solanaceous plants but has not yet been found outside of this plant family. Peptides lacking either 4 amino acids from the C-terminal part (csp11) or 6 amino acids from the N-terminal part spanned by csp15 lacked activity even when applied in micromolar concentrations (data not shown). No response was observed also by application of these two peptides in combination (data not shown). Truncated forms of the biologically active peptides systemin and flg22 were previously found that showed characteristics of competitive antagonists for the respective nontruncated agonistic peptides (26Pearce G. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 212-216Google Scholar, 27Meindl T. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1561-1570Google Scholar, 28Meindl T. Boller T. Felix G.

In contrast, csp15-Ala10, also inactive as agonist (Fig. 5), did exhibit antagonistic activity and suppressed responses induced by csp15 (Fig. 8). When added concomitantly with 3 nm csp15, a concentration of 3 μm strongly inhibited induction of the alkalinization response (Fig. 8 A, “0 min”).

https://openalex.org/W1967125902,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that occurs in 1 of 4000 births and is characterized by benign and malignant tumors. Cardiovascular defects also contribute to NF1, though the pathogenesis is still unclear. Deficiency in neurofibromin (encoded by Nf1) in mice results in mid-embryonic lethality owing to cardiac abnormalities previously thought to be secondary to cardiac neural-crest defects. Using tissue-specific gene inactivation, we show that endothelial-specific inactivation of Nf1 recapitulates key aspects of the complete null phenotype, including multiple cardiovascular abnormalities involving the endocardial cushions and myocardium. This phenotype is associated with an elevated level of ras signaling in Nf1−/− endothelial cells and greater nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nfatc1. Inactivation of Nf1 in the neural crest does not cause cardiac defects but results in tumors of neural-crest origin resembling those seen in humans with NF1. These results establish a new and essential role for Nf1 in endothelial cells and confirm the requirement for neurofibromin in the neural crest."
https://openalex.org/W1983025057,"The interaction of anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) and target cells was assessed, and the importance of the cytosolic domain of tumor endothelium marker 8 (TEM8) in its function as a cellular receptor for PA was evaluated. PA binding and proteolytic processing on the Chinese hamster ovary cell surface occurred rapidly, with both processes nearly reaching steady state in 5 min. Remarkably, the resulting PA63 fragment was present on the cell surface only as an oligomer, and furthermore, the oligomer was the only PA species internalized, suggesting that oligomerization of PA63 triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following internalization, the PA63 oligomer was rapidly and irreversibly transformed to an SDS/heat-resistant form, in a process requiring an acidic compartment. This conformational change was functionally correlated with membrane insertion, channel formation, and translocation of lethal factor into the cytosol. To explore the role of the TEM8 cytosolic tail, a series of truncated TEM8 mutants was transfected into a PA receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Interestingly, all of the cytosolic tail truncated TEM8 mutants functioned as PA receptors, as determined by PA binding, processing, oligomer formation, and translocation of an lethal factor fusion toxin into the cytosol. Moreover, cells transfected with a TEM8 construct truncated before the predicted transmembrane domain failed to bind PA, demonstrating that residues 321-343 are needed for cell surface anchoring. Further evidence that the cytosolic domain plays no essential role in anthrax toxin action was obtained by showing that TEM8 anchored by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail also functioned as a PA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2067414711,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 plays a variety of roles in the “negative” regulation of cell signaling. The molecular basis for the regulation of SHP-1 is incompletely understood. Whereas SHP-1 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated on two tail tyrosine residues (Tyr536and Tyr564) by several protein-tyrosine kinases, the effects of these phosphorylation events have been difficult to address because of the intrinsic instability of the linkages within a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Using expressed protein ligation, we have generated semisynthetic SHP-1 proteins containing phosphotyrosine mimetics at the Tyr536 and Tyr564 sites. Two phosphonate analogues were installed, phosphonomethylenephenylalanine (Pmp) and difluorophosphonomethylenephenylalanine (F2Pmp). Incorporation of Pmp at the 536 site led to 4-fold stimulation of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity whereas incorporation at the 564 site led to no effect. Incorporation of F2Pmp at the 536 site led to 8-fold stimulation of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity and 1.6-fold at the 564 site. A combination of size exclusion chromatography, phosphotyrosine peptide stimulation studies, and site-directed mutagenesis led to the structural model in which tyrosine phosphorylation at the 536 site engages the N-Src homology 2 domain in an intramolecular fashion relieving basal inhibition. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation at the 564 site has the potential to engage the C-Src homology 2 domain intramolecularly, which can modestly and indirectly influence catalytic activity. The finding that phosphonate modification at each of the 536 and 564 sites can promote interaction with the Grb2 adaptor protein indicates that the intramolecular interactions fostered by post-translational modifications of tyrosine are not energetically strong and susceptible to intermolecular competition."
https://openalex.org/W2065687144,"Human axillary odor is known to be formed upon the action of Corynebacteria sp. on odorless axilla secretions. The known axilla odor determinant 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid was identified in hydrolyzed axilla secretions along with a chemically related compound, 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid. The natural precursors of both these acids were purified from non-hydrolyzed axilla secretions. From liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, it appeared that the acids are covalently linked to a glutamine residue in fresh axilla secretions, and the corresponding conjugates were synthesized for confirmation. Bacterial isolates obtained from the human axilla and belonging to the Corynebacteria were found to release the acids from these odorless precursors in vitro. A Zn2+-dependent aminoacylase mediating this cleavage was purified from Corynebacterium striatum Ax20, and the corresponding gene agaA was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is highly specific for the glutamine residue but has a low specificity for the acyl part of the substrate. agaA is closely related to many genes coding for enzymes involved in the cleavage of N-terminal acyl and aryl substituents from amino acids. This is the first report of the structure elucidation of precursors for human body odorants and the isolation of the bacterial enzyme involved in their cleavage.

This is the first report of the structure elucidation of precursors for human body odorants and the isolation of the bacterial enzyme involved in their cleavage. The axilla region of humans contains a dense arrangement of apocrine, eccrine, and sebaceous glands, and it is an everyday experience, that volatile substances emanating from these areas make a key contribution to human body odor. Although this odor is perceived by today's society as mainly unpleasant, several studies indicate that it may contain chemical signals that affect the menstrual cycle (1McClintock M.K. Horm. Behav. 1978; 10: 264-267Google Scholar) or that may be involved in a major histocompatibility complex allele-dependent mate selection (2Wedekind C. Seebeck T. Bettens F. Paepke A.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 260: 245-249Google Scholar). These studies point to an important role of body odors in the evolutionary history of man. Sweat as it is secreted by axillary glands is odorless. Since the pioneering work of Shelley et al. (3Shelley W.B. Hurley H.J. Nichols A.C. Arch. Dermatol. Syphilol. 1953; 68: 430-446Google Scholar), it is known that (a) the typical strong axilla odor can only be released from apocrine secretions, and (b) that the action of skin bacteria is needed to generate the odoriferous compounds from non-smelling molecules present in these secretions. Indeed, the axilla is a skin region supporting a dense bacterial population, which is dominated by the two genera Staphylococcus andCorynebacteria (4Leyden J.J. McGinley K.J. Hoelzle E. Labows J.N. Kligman A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1981; 77: 413-416Google Scholar, 5Shehadeh N. Kligman A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1963; 41: 1-5Google Scholar). Most individuals carry a flora that is dominated by either one of these two genera, and a strong correlation was found between a high population ofCorynebacteria and a strong axillary odor formation (4Leyden J.J. McGinley K.J. Hoelzle E. Labows J.N. Kligman A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1981; 77: 413-416Google Scholar, 6Jackman P.J. Noble W.C. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1983; 8: 259-268Google Scholar). As a practical consequence of these findings, halogenated antibacterials and aluminum preparations for reducing the bacterial population have become the main active ingredient of commercial deodorants for the last 40 years. The scientific conclusion from this early work was that axilla secretions contain non-odoriferous precursors that must be transformed by bacterial enzymes only present in Corynebacteria and not in Staphylococci.Considerable progress has been made since then to identify the odoriferous compounds in human body odor, but the biochemistry of axillary odor formation has received relatively little attention. Indeed, no precursor structure has been isolated from axilla secretions and confirmed by re-synthesis, and no specific bacterial enzyme recognizing such a structure has been isolated and reported in the literature. Notwithstanding, several theories and indirect evidence have been published. The focus of early studies was mainly on odoriferous steroids after the boar pheromone 5α-androst-16-en-3-one (7Claus R. Alsing W. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 68: 483-484Google Scholar, 8Bird S. Gower D.B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1981; 14: 213-219Google Scholar) and a related odoriferous steroid 5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol (9Brooksbank B.W.L. Brown R. Gustafsson J.A. Experientia (Basel). 1974; 30: 864-865Google Scholar) had been detected in human axilla secretions. Nevertheless, androstenone is only perceived by 50% of the human population (10Amoore J.E. Chem. Senses Flavour. 1977; 2: 267-281Google Scholar) and thus cannot be the main odoriferous component. Release of androstenol from secreted sulfates and glucuronides in the axilla was proposed to be mediated by bacterial enzymes (11Froebe C. Simone A. Charig A. Eigen E. J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 1990; 41: 173-185Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the steroid precursors were not isolated, and clear evidence for corynebacterial enzymes cleaving sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of steroids was not presented, although arylsulfatase and aryl glucuronidase activity was found in these bacteria. The involvement of thiols as key odor components and the putative implication of a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent β-lyase (probably related to cystathionine β-lyase) in the release of these thiols has been proposed (12.Lyon, S. B., O'Neal, C., Van der Lee, H., and Rogers, B. (1991) PCT Int. Appl. WO 9105541 A1, May 2, 1997.Google Scholar), but without data on the structure of the secreted precursor or isolation of the bacterial enzyme. A very thorough analysis of the chemical composition of axillary odor was presented by Zeng et al. (13Zeng X.N. Leyden J.J. Lawley H.J. Sawano K. Nohara I. Preti G. J. Chem. Ecol. 1991; 17: 1469-1492Google Scholar). They proposed that short, branched fatty acids make a major contribution with (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid (3M2H) 1The abbreviations used are: 3M2H, (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid; MTBE, methyl-tert-butyl-ether; HMHA, 3-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoic acid; 3M2H-Gln, N α-(E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoyl-glutamine; HMHA-Gln, N α-3-methyl-3-hydroxy-hexanoyl-glutamine; bis-Tris, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-tris-(hydroxymethyl)-methane; LC-MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; Z, carbobenzyloxy being the key odor component. This compound had initially been found in sweat of schizophrenic patients (14Smith K. Thompson G.F. Koster H.D. Science. 1969; 166: 398-399Google Scholar), and whether its presence is a specific marker of schizophrenia was the subject of a longer debate. Zenget al. (13Zeng X.N. Leyden J.J. Lawley H.J. Sawano K. Nohara I. Preti G. J. Chem. Ecol. 1991; 17: 1469-1492Google Scholar) could clearly show its contribution to axillary odor of healthy donors. They could also show (15Zeng C. Spielman A.I. Vowels B.R. Leyden J.J. Biemann K. Preti G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6626-6630Google Scholar) that it is non-covalently associated with apolipoprotein D, the major protein present in axilla secretions. Furthermore, they showed that 3M2H is released upon incubation of the aqueous fraction of apocrine secretions with Corynebacteria or hydrolysis with NaOH, indicating a water-soluble, covalent precursor must be present (16Zeng X.N. Leyden J.J. Brand J.G. Spielman A.I. McGinley K.J. Preti G. J. Chem. Ecol. 1992; 18: 1039-1055Google Scholar). Yet its structure and the bacterial enzyme involved in its cleavage were not described. Here we report the isolation of a new branched fatty acid related to 3M2H and covalent linkage of both acids tol-glutamine in human axilla secretions. Furthermore, a specific zinc-dependent aminoacylase, which triggers the release of these odoriferous components from odorless axilla secretions, was purified from axilla isolates ofCorynebacteria, characterized, and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Z-protected amino acids and peptides as enzyme substrates were from Aldrich and from Senn Chemicals (Dieseldorf, Switzerland). Fresh axilla secretions were sampled from healthy human donors (27 male and 12 female) by placing a stainless steel cylinder (internal diameter 3.6 cm) onto the axilla, adding 4 ml of 10% ethanol and massaging the area with a metal spatula for 1 min. This procedure does not discriminate between apocrine and eccrine secretions. The samples were immediately frozen and concentrated by lyophilization. The samples were redissolved in 400 μl of water and then extracted twice with MTBE and twice with hexane to remove interfering lipids. At this stage the samples were split, and half was saved for analysis of the potential precursor compounds. For analysis of the odoriferous components, 50 μl of NaOH (5m) was added to the remaining half, and the samples were heated for 20 min at 100 °C. They were then re-acidified by adding 50 μl of HCl (5 m) and applied to a solid phase extraction C-18 Bond Elute solid phase extraction cartridge (Varian). The column was washed with H2O and eluted with 50 μl of MTBE. For analysis, the samples of several donors were pooled. For qualitative GC-MS analysis of the solid phase extraction extracts, a combination of a Hewlett-Packard 5890 II gas chromatograph and a Finnigan MAT95 mass spectrometer (low resolution, 70-eV EI mode, ion source temperature 230 °C) was applied. A DB-5 column (J & W Scientific) with a length of 60 m, inner diameter of 0.25 mm, and film thickness of 0.25 μm was used. 1.5 μl of the MTBE solution were injected in the splitless injection mode (230 °C). The temperature of the column oven was initially set to 30 °C for 5 min and subsequently increased to 50 °C (10 °C/min) and then to 250 °C (2 °C/min). The concentrated, pooled, non-hydrolyzed sample was separated on a Superdex Peptide HR10/30 gel filtration column (AmershamBiosciences) using (NH4)2CO3 (100 mm) as elution buffer. Individual fractions of this separation step were tested for the content of an axillary odor precursor by hydrolysis of aliquots in 1 m NaOH. The fractions developing strong odors upon hydrolysis were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer operated in the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode and equipped with a Flux Rheos 2000 high pressure liquid chromatography pump. High pressure liquid chromatography separation was performed on a C18 RP column modified for proteins and peptides (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The mobile phase consisted of H2O (A) and MeOH (B) each containing 1% HOAc (v/v). The solvent flow was 0.25 ml/min and the following gradient was used: 0–1 min, 100% A; 1–6 min from 100% A to 100% B, 6–11 min 100% B, 11–13 min from 100% B to 100% A. MS/MS spectra were recorded with 30% relative collision energy. The precursor structures 3M2H-Gln and HMHA-Gln were prepared by the coupling of the activated sweat acids (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) withl-glutamine. Whereas 3M2H is commercially available (Narchem Corp., Chicago), 3-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoic acid (HMHA) was synthesized in a Zn2+-mediated reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with 2-pentanone, followed by saponification in ethanolic sodium hydroxide solution. Zn2+ powder in cyclohexane was heated to reflux and activated with a little ethyl bromoacetate. Then a mixture of ethyl bromoacetate and 2-pentanone was added dropwise. After 2 h of reflux the mixture was allowed to stand overnight and worked up in the usual manner. The resulting ethyl ester was dissolved in ethanol, treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide (2n), and heated to reflux for several hours to yield the desired 3-methyl-3-hydroxyhexanoic acid, after acidification with aqueous hydrochloric acid and extraction with ether. The acids and N-hydroxysuccinimide were dissolved in dioxane, and a solution of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dioxane was added dropwise under ice-water cooling. The resulting suspension was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for 24 h. 1,3-Dicyclohexylurea was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to give the corresponding N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. This was dissolved in dioxane and added dropwise to a solution ofl-glutamine and triethylamine in water. After stirring for 24 h, work up in the usual way furnished the compounds 3M2H-Gln and HMHA-Gln. For isolation of axilla bacteria, the same method as described above for sampling axilla secretion was applied, with the exception that phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 1% Tween 80 was used as the sampling liquid. The samples of axilla washings were spread plated on tryptic soy agar (Difco) amended with 5 g/liter Tween 80 and 1 g/liter lecithin. Single isolates obtained after 48 h of incubation were subcultured and characterized. Strains that had a coccoid cell morphology were identified with the ID Staph 32 kit (BioMerieux, France) and strains with a typical coryneform morphology (short, irregular rods) with the API coryne kit (BioMerieux, France). Gram reaction was determined with the KOH string technique (17Powers E.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3756-3758Google Scholar), and lipophilicity was determined based on differential growth on media with or without Tween 80 as lipid source. For enzymatic assays and enzyme purification, the strains were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) amended with 0.05% Tween 80. As a reference strainCorynebacterium xerosis (DSMZ 20170; obtained from the German type strain collection) was used. To evaluate enzymatic activity in intact bacteria, an overnight culture was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to a final A 600 of 1.0 in a semisynthetic medium (per liter: 3 g of KH2PO4, 1.9 g of K2HPO4, 0.2 g of yeast extract, 0.2 g of MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 1.4 g of NaCl, 1 g of NH4Cl, 10 mg of MnCl2, 1 mg of FeCl3, 1 mg of CaCl2). Aliquots of this stationary culture were then amended with a final concentration of 2 mm HMHA-Gln, 3M2H-Gln, or alternative substrates (160 mm stock solution dissolved in Me2SO). After 24 h of incubation (with shaking at 300 rpm; 36 °C), the samples were acidified with HCl and extracted with an equal volume of MTBE, and the amount of released acids was determined by GC as described above. No HCl was added if carbamates (e.g. Z-Gln) were used as substrates. To evaluate activity in cellular extracts, cells were washed, resuspended in as small volume of Buffer A (50 mm NaCl; 50 mmNaH2PO4/K2HPO4; pH 7), amended with a 10-fold volume of glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma), and mechanically disrupted by vortexing them at maximal speed for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants saved and diluted, and enzymatic assays were run with these crude extracts. Alternatively, enzyme assays were also done using the pure enzyme in Buffer A, either purified from the wild-type strainCorynebacterium Ax20 or from the recombinant strain (see below). As an alternative to the GC detection of the released acid, a fluorescent test was used. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 volumes of acetonitrile containing 2.5 mm fluorescamine (Fluka, Switzerland) thus derivatizing the free amino group of the released l-glutamine. Fluorescence was then measured with an LS-50 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation wavelength of 381 nm and an emission wavelength of 470 nm. Corynebacterium striatum Ax20 was selected to isolate and purify the enzyme responsible for the cleavage of HMHA-Gln. Cell lysates from 2-liter cultures were prepared as described above, and the proteins were fractionated by precipitation with an increasing concentration of (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate obtained between 50 and 80% saturation of (NH4)2SO4 contained the active enzyme. This enriched fraction was dissolved in Buffer A and desalted by repetitive dilution and concentration by ultrafiltration (Amicon membrane YM10, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The sample was then sequentially passed over four chromatography columns as follows: 1) DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B anion exchange resin (Amersham Biosciences), elution with a linear gradient from 0 to 800 mm KCl in Buffer A; 2) phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction resin (AmershamBiosciences), elution with a linear gradient from 1000 to 0 mm (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A; 3) Mono Q strong anion exchange column on the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences), elution with a gradient from 0 to 800 mm KCl in Buffer A; and finally Mono P weak anion exchange column on the fast protein liquid chromatography, elution with a gradient from 0 to 800 mm KCl in a 50 mm bis-Tris buffer instead of Buffer A. After each column separation the active fractions (determined by the fluorescent assay) were pooled and desalted by dilution/ultrafiltration. The resulting apparently pure enzyme was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the sequence of two internal peptides was determined with LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, and the N terminus was determined by automated Edman degradation. The molecular weight of the isolated enzyme was determined with nano-ESI-MS. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) with 4% stacking gels and 9% separation gels. Protein bands were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Chromosomal DNA of Ax20 was obtained from cell lysates by proteinase K digestion and subsequent extraction with hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide/NaCl and chloroform/isoamyl acetate (19$$Google Scholar). Based on the partial amino acid sequence analysis of the aminoacylase, degenerated primers were designed to amplify fragments between the N terminus and the internal peptide sequences. Standard PCR conditions were used according to the manufacturer (Taq polymerase, Sigma). The annealing temperatures were optimized on a gradient cycler (T-Gradient, Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The amplified DNA was cloned into the vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and the nucleotide sequence was determined on the ABI-Prism model 310 (PE Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using standard methods. Based on the obtained partial sequence, specific nested oligonucleotides were designed to clone the upstream and downstream regions. Chromosomal DNA of Ax20 was digested with SmaI and PvuII and ligated to the GenomeWalker Adaptor (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The upstream and downstream regions were then amplified as described in the instructions to the Universal GenomeWalker™ kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into the vector pGEM T-easy, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The full-length sequence of the open reading frame coding for the enzyme was then amplified with PCR from chromosomal DNA of Ax20 using the specific primers 5′-CAT GCC ATG GCA CAG GAA AAT TTG CAA and 5′-CCC AAG CTT TCA CTT CAT CAA CCA GGG CG. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with NcoI and HindIII and ligated into the vector pBAD/gIIIA (Invitrogen) pre-digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid pBAD/gIIIA-AMRE was transformed into the host strain E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen). This strain was grown in LB broth until it reached an A 600 of 0.5. The culture was induced with arabinose (0.2% final concentration), incubated for 4 h, harvested by centrifugation, and disrupted by ultrasonication. The extracts were used to purify the recombinant enzyme as described above but only with two chromatographic steps, namely phenyl-Sepharose and Mono Q. Data base comparisons of the deduced open reading frame were made to public protein sequence data bases (Swiss-Prot and GenBankTM bacterial sequences and to data bases containing the genomes of different bacteria) using the gapped blast algorithm (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) on the Biology WorkBench (biowb.sdsc.edu) platform. The organic extracts obtained from axilla secretions before hydrolysis were almost odorless, and only upon hydrolysis and re-acidification was a strong axillary odor developed, indicating that the volatiles were mainly present in the collected secretions as covalently linked, water-soluble precursors. The organic phase obtained from extraction of the hydrolyzed and re-acidified samples of axilla secretions was therefore first olfactorily evaluated with a gas chromatograph equipped with a sniff port, and peaks of effluents which exhibited typical axillary odor were marked on the chromatograms. These peaks were then further analyzed by GC-MS. A typical chromatogram is shown in Fig.1 a. The presence of 3M2H could be confirmed to be an important odoriferous component (retention time 30.8 min) based on mass spectrum and retention time compared with a synthetic sample. At a retention time of 37.4 min a second and larger peak with a hypothetical molecular weight of 146 was found. The mass spectra of this unknown peak and that of 3M2H are shown in Fig. 1,b and c. Based on the fractionation pattern and comparisons to MS data bases, this new compound was proposed to be a hydrated derivative of 3M2H, namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid (HMHA). This latter compound was synthesized, and its retention time and mass spectrum were found to be identical with the one of the unknown peak (data not shown). In addition, the hydrolyzed axilla secretion samples contained small amounts of (Z)-3 methyl-2 hexenoic acid and (E)-3-methyl-3-hexenoic acid based on MS analytics of the corresponding peaks (data not shown). Non-hydrolyzed samples of axilla secretions were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column. The resulting chromatogram of the pooled samples of eight donors is shown in Fig.2. The fraction at an elution volume of 17.7 ml (of 24 ml total gel bed size) was found to release a strong odor upon hydrolysis. This elution volume is between the peaks for Gly6 and Gly3 according to the manufacturer. The corresponding peak does not absorb at 280 nm. The typical axilla secretion proteins did elute early (7 ml of elution volume) as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown), and this fraction released no perceivable odor upon hydrolysis. Thus, these data indicate that the precursor is not a protein but a smaller molecule in the range of 200–400 Da. The presence of 3M2H and HMHA was verified in a hydrolyzed aliquot of the fraction of interest by GC-MS analysis (data not shown). This fraction was then subjected to LC-MS analysis. It contained one peak with a pseudo-molecular ion at m/z 257 and a peak with a pseudo-molecular ion at m/z 275. Assuming an ester or amide linkage of the two acids, the molecular masses of 256 and 274 suggested that 3M2H and HMHA are bound to a molecule with molecular mass of 146. Several common biological molecules with this mass were considered, and glutamine was found to fit best the MS fractionation pattern observed. This led to the hypothesis that 3M2H is linked to the Nα atom of l-glutamine (i.e. N α-3-methyl-2-hexenoyl-l-glutamine-; 3M2H-Gln), whereas the second peak with a mass of 274, based on its mass and fractionation pattern, corresponds to the hydrated analogueN α-3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoyl-l-glutamine (HMHA-Gln). These two compounds were then synthesized, and their MS spectra and retention times in the LC-MS/MS analysis were compared and found to be identical to the compounds present in axilla secretions. The presence of these compounds in the hydrophilic phase of non-fractionated axilla secretions of individual donors was then also verified. In Fig. 3 b, the LC-MS/MS analysis of such a sample is shown, and the analytical data for the two synthetic references are given in Fig. 3 a. The synthesized compounds partly released the acids upon hydrolysis with NaOH and re-acidification which perfectly fits the observations made previously by us and others (16Zeng X.N. Leyden J.J.

Thus, from all this analytical evidence one could predict the enzymatic activity needed for the release of the odoriferous component, namely a bacterial N α-acylglutamine aminoacylase, and the corresponding scheme and structures are shown in Fig. 4.Figure 3LC-MS/MS analysis of axilla secretions. a, a mixture of the synthetic HMHA-Gln and 3M2H-Gln (each 50 ppm); b, the aqueous phase of an axilla secretion sample.a-1 and b-1, the total ion chromatogram;a-2 and b-2, the extracted mass chromatogram atm/z = 275; a-3 andb-3, the extracted mass chromatogram atm/z = 257; a-4 andb-4, the MS2 spectrum of the peak at 7.3–7.5 min retention time corresponding to HMHA-Gln; and a-5 andb-5, the MS2 spectrum of the peak at 8.3–8.5 min retention time corresponding to 3M2H-Gln.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Proposed scheme for the release of odoriferous acids by skin bacteria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The axilla flora of 21 donors was isolated on tryptic soy agar, and single isolates obtained after 48 h of incubation were subcultured and identified. A total of 19 individual strains ofCorynebacterium and 25 strains of Staphylococcuswere obtained. Stationary cultures of the strains were amended with HMHA-Gln or 3M2H-Gln and analyzed after a 24-h incubation for released acids. Isolates from both the non-lipophilic C. striatum and the lipophilic Corynebacterium jeikeium andCorynebacterium bovis, but not allCorynebacterium, released a significant quantity of 3M2H and HMHA, whereas none of the strains of Staphylococcus sp. orMicrococcus sp. exhibited this enzymatic activity. TableI gives the results for a subset of the strains tested. These data are in good agreement with the well known fact that only subjects with an axilla flora dominated byCorynebacteria produce the most typical axillary odor. Thus,N α-acylglutamine aminoacylase activity is indeed present in bacteria isolated from the human axilla, as predicted based on the identification of the precursor structure. IfN α-lauroyl-l-glutamine was used as substrate in the same experiment, it was found that also otherCorynebacteria and some Staphylococci can release lauric acid from this substrate, indicating that even more skin bacteria may have a related aminoacylase activity more specific for substrates substituted with a straight chain acid, and thus not directly involved in the formation of the typical odor of the branched chain acids.Table ICleavage of Nα-acylglutamine derivatives by axilla bacteriaStrainSpecies assignmentLipophilicitya+ indicates growth only in media amended with Tween 80 as lipid source.Release of 3M2H from 3M2H-GlnbStationary phase cultures withA 600 = 1 were amended with 2 mm of the substrate and analyzed after 24 h of incubation.

This indicates that the cleavage is mediated by an intracellular, soluble enzyme that is not, or only loosely, associated w"
https://openalex.org/W2013418539,"ClC chloride channels are widely distributed in organisms across the evolutionary spectrum, and members of the mammalian family play crucial roles in cellular function and are mutated in several human diseases (Jentsch, T. J., Stein, V., Weinreich, F., and Zdebik, A. A. (2002) Physiol. Rev.82, 503–568). Within the ClC-3, -4, -5 branch of the family that are intracellular channels, two alternatively spliced ClC-3 isoforms were recognized recently (Ogura, T., Furukawa, T., Toyozaki, T., Yamada, K., Zheng, Y. J., Katayama, Y., Nakaya, H., and Inagaki, N. (2002)FASEB J. 16, 863–865). ClC-3A resides in late endosomes where it serves as an anion shunt during acidification. We show here that the ClC-3B PDZ-binding isoform resides in the Golgi where it co-localizes with a small amount of the other known PDZ-binding chloride channel, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Both channel proteins bind the Golgi PDZ protein, GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein). Interestingly, however, when overexpressed, GOPC, which is thought to influence traffic in the endocytic/secretory pathway, causes a large reduction in the amounts of both channels, probably by leading them to the degradative end of this pathway. ClC-3B as well as CFTR also binds EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50) and PDZK1, which are concentrated at the plasma membrane. However, only PDZK1 was found to promote interaction between the two channels, perhaps because they were able to bind to two different PDZ domains in PDZK1. Thus while small portions of the populations of ClC-3B and CFTR may associate and co-localize, the bulk of the two populations reside in different organelles of cells where they are expressed heterologously or endogenously, and therefore their cellular functions are likely to be distinct and not primarily related. ClC chloride channels are widely distributed in organisms across the evolutionary spectrum, and members of the mammalian family play crucial roles in cellular function and are mutated in several human diseases (Jentsch, T. J., Stein, V., Weinreich, F., and Zdebik, A. A. (2002) Physiol. Rev.82, 503–568).

Chloride channels mediate a broad range of cellular functions. Among the several different families of proteins that constitute these channels, the neurotransmitter ligand-gated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine and voltage-gated ClC classes are the largest and best characterized (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The ClC family is especially diverse with members in all organisms including at least nine in mammals. Mutations in several of these are disease-causing (2Estévez R. Jentsch T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 531Google Scholar). ClC-1, ClC-2, and ClC-K channels within one branch of the mammalian family reside in the plasma membrane of cells in different tissue types whereas ClC-3 through ClC-7 form another large branch and reside primarily in membranes of intracellular organelles with the highly homologous ClC-3, -4, -5 channels occupying the endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These three may all provide negative charge shunts that increase the rate of acidification of these compartments by proton ATPases (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 3Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J.

A similar function has been suggested for bacterial ClC channels in extreme acid resistance response (5Iyer R. Iverson T.M. Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2002; 419: 715-718Google Scholar). Recently, a splice variant of human ClC-3 was discovered that has a PDZ 1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1; EBP50, ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; GIPC, GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus; GOPC, Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein; GRASP, Golgi reassembly stacking protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Mint, Munc18-interacting protein; NKCC, sodium potassium chloride cotransporter 1; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors domain-binding C terminus (6Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Google Scholar). When heterologously expressed, this form, termed ClC-3B, was detectable mainly in a general intracellular localization. However, when co-expressed with the PDZ protein, EBP50, a small amount of the channel protein was detected on the surface at the leading edge of spreading cells. Furthermore, EBP50-mediated association with the other known PDZ-binding chloride channel, CFTR, was reported as was an ability of CFTR to activate ClC-3B. The CFTR chloride channel is distinct from the other families of chloride channels and belongs to the large family of ABC transport proteins (7Hanrahan J.H. Gentzsch M. Riordan J.R. Holland B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press Ltd., London2002: 589-618Google Scholar). CFTR resides in the apical membrane of epithelial cells where it is crucial to ion and fluid secretion and reabsorption (8Frizzell R.A. Physiology of Cystic Fibrosis. 1999; 79Google Scholar). Hence the possibility of ClC-3B trafficking to the plasma membrane and either being influenced by CFTR when it is present or potentially substituting for it when it is absent or dysfunctional in cells of CF patients is of great importance to understanding or influencing the disease. For this reason we have carefully examined the subcellular localization of heterologously and endogenously expressed ClC-3B as well as its possible PDZ protein-mediated interaction with CFTR. We found that ClC-3B is localized to the Golgi and differs in its location from the late endosomal isoform ClC-3A and from most CFTR, present at the plasma membrane. Both ClC-3B and CFTR interact with PDZ domains of GOPC, 2GOPC or Golgi-associatedPDZ coiled-coil protein was discovered and named by Yao et al. (27Yao R. Maeda T. Takada S. Noda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 771-778Google Scholar). Homologous cDNAs were independently isolated by Neudauer et al. (11Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Google Scholar) and termed PIST for PDZ domain protein interactingspecifically with TC10; by Charest et al. (20Charest A. Lane K. McMahon K. Housman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Google Scholar) and termed FIG for Fused InGlioblastoma; and by Cheng et al. (19Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Google Scholar) and termed CAL for CFTR-associatedligand. We have used the term GOPC, which seems most descriptive and does not derive from one of the proteins with which it interacts. EBP50, and PDZK1 and PDZK1 promotes the association of the two PDZ-binding chloride channels. Despite this the only co-localization of CFTR and ClC-3B that we detected is at the Golgi where a small amount of CFTR resides. ClC-3A and ClC-3B were found to interact with each other, most likely as heterodimers as described for other ClC channels. Full-length cDNAs of ClC-3A and ClC-3B were amplified by PCR using a human pancreas cDNA library (Clontech) as template. PCR fragments were first introduced into the EcoRV site of pBluescript and then subcloned into pcDNA3. A c-Myc tag was added to the ClC-3B open reading frame at the N terminus; ClC-3A was tagged at its N terminus with amino acid residues 723–732 of the MRP1 protein as an epitope recognized by mouse monoclonal antibody 42.4 (9Hou Y.-X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Google Scholar). Partial cDNA fragments encoding different PDZ domains of EBP50, PDZK1, and GOPC were subcloned into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The boundaries of the expressed polypeptides containing different PDZ domains were amino acid residues 1–129 for PDZ domain 1 of EBP50, amino acid residues 133 to the C-terminal end for PDZ domain 2 of EBP50, amino acid residues 1–140 for PDZ domain 1 of PDZK1, amino acid residues 127–237 for PDZ domain 2 of PDZK1, amino acid residues 231–371 for PDZ domain 3 of PDZK1, amino acid residues 368 to the C-terminal end for PDZ domain 4 of PDZK1, and amino acid residues 281–363 for the PDZ domain of GOPC. A cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal amino acid residues 1440–1480 of CFTR was subcloned into pGEX-5X-3 vector to produce a fusion of GST and the C terminus of CFTR. BHK-21, HEK293T, Calu-3, Capan-1, CFPAC-1, T84, Caco-2, MDCK, and PANC-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. BHK-21 cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) or stably transfected using calcium phosphate (10Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). For transient expression cells were transfected with cDNAs of CFTR, ClC-3A, ClC-3B, EBP50, or PDZK1 subcloned into pcDNA3. GOPC was transiently expressed using the plasmid pKH3-PIST (11Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Google Scholar). For transient cotransfection experiments equivalent amounts of individual plasmid DNAs were employed. For stable transfections pNUT vector was contransfected with ClC-3A in pcDNA3 or ClC-3B in pcDNA3. Stably transfected cells were selected with 500 μm methotrexate in the growth medium, individual clones were isolated and ClC-3A or ClC-3B expression was analyzed by Western blotting. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaMoO4) at 4 °C for 30 min. Protease inhibitors were added to Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer prior before use as described earlier (12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged at maximal speed in an Eppifuge at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected for further experiments. Scrapings from human bronchus were extracted with 2× Nonidet P-40 buffer and sonicated briefly before centrifugation. Scrapings from colon were first ground in a homogenizer in extraction buffer and then processed exactly as the bronchial scrapings. The preparation of membranes from cultured cells was performed exactly as described earlier (13Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X.-b. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing ClC-3A and ClC-3B were raised against conjugated peptides derived from C-terminal sequences of ClC-3A (RHMAQTANQDPASIMFN) and ClC-3B (KQHVEPLAPPWHYNKKR). Initial screens of hybridomas were performed by peptide ELISA, and followed by secondary screening by Western blotting of lysates or membranes from cells heterologously expressing ClC-3A or ClC-3B. The derived monoclonal antibodies 34.1 and 69.16 recognized ClC-3A and ClC-3B, respectively. Additionally, ClC-3A and ClC-3B were detected with antibodies 42.4 and 9E10 directed against their N-terminal tags. CFTR was detected with antibody 596, 528, or 570, FLAG-tagged PDZK1 with antibody anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), HA-tagged GOPC, and HA-tagged EBP50 with the antibody 16B12 (Babco). The antibodies from the following manufacturers were used to detect proteins by immunofluorescence: Giantin, Babco; Golgin, Molecular Probes, GM130, BD Transduction Laboratories; γ-Adaptin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Calnexin, StressGen; EEA1, BD Transduction Laboratories; ZO-1,Zymed Laboratories Inc.; NaK-ATPase, ABR. Antibodies against MUC1 and NKCC were generously provided by Sandra Gendler and Christian Lytle, respectively. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations were performed as described earlier (14Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Google Scholar). For immunoblots and immunoprecipitations either cell lysates or membranes solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer were used. For pull-down assays GST fusion proteins were overproduced in bacterial strain BL-21 and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation with cell lysates or solubilized membranes, bound proteins were washed three or four times and eluted with electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) orN-glycosidase F (Glyko) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. BHK-21 and HEK293T cells were grown on collagen-coated chamber slides (BD PharMingen) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were added for at least 1 h in the same buffer. Secondary antibodies were either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 568. In addition anti-ClC-3A and ClC-3B antibodies were directly labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Directly labeled anti-HA (Alexa 594 or 488) and anti-FLAG antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3) were purchased from Babco and Sigma, respectively. Calu-3 cells were grown in a liquid air interface on Transwell Clear inserts (Costar) for several weeks. Cell layers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Frozen sections were thawed and treated with 1% sodium borohydride for 10 min and exposed to 1% SDS for 5 min to improve antibody labeling. Detection of endogenously expressed ClC-3B was facilitated using the Alexa 488 Signal-Amplification kit for mouse antibodies from Molecular Probes. RhoB was expressed as a GFP fusion using pEGFP-Endo (Clontech). Cells were examined on a LSM510 confocal microscope from Zeiss. Our interest was attracted by the report by Ogura et al. (6Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Google Scholar) of a PDZ-binding isoform of the ClC-3 chloride channel because of its potential relation to CFTR. To be able to investigate this we cloned cDNAs corresponding to ClC-3A and ClC-3B by PCR from a total human pancreas cDNA pool. The protein sequences coded for by these cDNAs with their principal features are shown in Fig.1 A. As originally shown by Ogura et al. (6Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Google Scholar), the two forms are identical except at their C-terminal ends where insertion of an additional exon makes ClC-3B longer than ClC-3A by 47 residues and makes their sequences differ at several other positions before the end of ClC-3A. The final four amino acids of ClC-3B fit the consensus for binding to Class I PDZ proteins (15Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Google Scholar). Consensus extracytoplasmic N-glycosylation sites are indicated between helices B and C, and L and M, assigned by alignment with the bacteria ClCs for which three-dimensional structures have been obtained (16Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Google Scholar). pcDNA3 plasmids with different epitope tags at the N termini of ClC-3A and ClC-3B were transfected into BHK-21 and HEK293 cells so that the proteins could be detected with antibodies to the tags. Both transient and stable BHK transfectants exhibited a heterogenous larger band of ∼130 kDa and a more distinct smaller band of ∼90 kDa (Fig.1 B). The ClC-3A bands detected with the mAb 42.4 to an MRP1 epitope (9Hou Y.-X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Google Scholar) and ClC-3B bands with mAb 9E10 to the c-Myc tag appear very similar as expected since they differ in size by only 47 amino acids. Comparison of transient and stable expression in BHK cells revealed that the ratio of the smaller to the larger bands was higher in the former as if complete maturation had not yet occurred. This appeared also to be the case in HEK293 cells where both bands appeared nearly identical to those in transiently expressing BHK-21 cells. Endoglycosidase digestion provided further characterization of these electrophoretic bands (Fig. 1 C). N-glycosidase F caused the 130-kDa and 90-kDa bands to collapse to a band slightly smaller than the latter in the case of both isoforms. Endoglycosidase H had a similar effect on the 90-kDa bands, indicating they are glycosylated species. Their decrease in size corresponds to ∼5 kDa, consistent with the removal of two core oligosaccharide chains, probably from the two consensus N-glycosylation sites in the protein sequence (Fig. 1 A). The 130-kDa bands were unaffected by endoglycosidase H as expected if they had acquired complex oligosaccharide chains. Thus both forms of ClC-3 areN-glycosylated membrane proteins that would be synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes and transported to the Golgi where the glycosyl transferases that assemble complex oligosaccharide chains are located. In previous work, ClC-3A has been most definitely localized to late endosomes or lysosomes (4Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Google Scholar) and to synaptic vesicles in the brain (3Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Google Scholar). These same studies provided evidence that its presence contributes to the rate of acidification of these compartments (3Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Google Scholar, 4Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Google Scholar). When expressed in BHK cells ClC-3A co-localizes extensively with the late endosomal marker RhoB, and to a lesser extent with the early endosomal marker EEA-1 (Fig.2 A). This localization is distinct from that of calnexin in the ER and several Golgi markers including giantin, GM130, and γ-adaptin. In distinct contrast ClC-3B did co-localize with these markers, especially giantin, GM130, and γ-adaptin (Fig. 2 B). Of the endosomal markers there was some co-localization only with EEA-1, suggesting that some of both isoforms of the ClC-3 channel may occupy the early endosome compartment, possibly even as heterodimers (see below). The primarily distinct localization of the two channels; however, is emphasized when each is compared with the same marker. With giantin, for example, there is nearly complete correspondence with ClC-3B but very little with ClC-3A, even though some of it is situated contiguous with that compartment. This is not surprising of course since there is extensive traffic between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. The Golgi localization of ClC-3B is emphatically confirmed in Fig.2 C where its staining in HEK293 cells coincides with that of three Golgi proteins. Thus while Ogura et al. (6Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Google Scholar) showed that most heterologously expressed ClC-3B was intracellular, our results further resolve this primarily to the Golgi indicating that the two ClC-3 isoforms reside in virtually continuous but clearly distinct organelles. Since ClC-3A and B are identical except for their C termini and all ClC channels are dimers (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), heterodimerization might be expected. To assess whether this occurred, we determined if they could be co-immunoprecipitated from BHK cells in which they were co-expressed. Fig.3 A shows that each isoform was present in an immunoprecipitate of the other member of the pair. Interestingly, in these cells the intracellular localizations of both were partially shifted toward that of the other (Fig. 3 B). Thus the characteristic endosomal pattern of ClC-3A is also exhibited by a small amount of ClC-3B when the two are expressed together. Conversely, the Golgi pattern of ClC-3B alone is displayed by ClC-3A in many cells on co-expression of the two. Localization to the Golgi seems to dominate over the endosomal location when heterodimerization occurs since there are clearly more cells with a predominant Golgi localization of ClC-3A than cells showing a endosomal location of ClC-3B (not shown). Homodimers of both ClC-3 proteins are expected to also form and retain their individual locations. Since we were primarily interested in its possible relationship to CFTR and relevance to cystic fibrosis, we examined the presence of ClC-3B in epithelial cells. First epithelial scrapings from human bronchus and colon were homogenized in detergent (Nonidet P-40) and immunoprecipitated with a mAb to ClC-3B, 69.16. After SDS-PAGE analysis under fully reducing conditions, a Western blot was probed with the same antibody (Fig.4 A). Distinct ClC-3B bands appeared in colonic samples from all three individuals tested and one bronchial sample; the other two bronchial samples gave weak signals but these observations clearly confirm ClC-3B expression in epithelial tissue affected in cystic fibrosis. We then examined expression in a number of epithelial cell lines and found positive signals of variable intensity in Western blots of lysates of all (Fig. 4 B). ClC-3B appears most highly expressed in two of the lines, which also contain large amounts of CFTR viz. Calu-3 derived from submucosal glands and Capan-1, a pancreatic ductal cell line. Confocal immunofluorescence of Calu-3 cells grown on permeable supports at an air-liquid interface revealed ClC-3B in intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 4 C) as when it was heterologously expressed. This distinct population of vesicles is similar to those stained with the Golgi markers, giantin and golgin and entirely distinct from several apical and basolateral markers which clearly demarcate these portions of the cell surface. Thus, as when heterologously expressed, the principal residences of ClC-3B (Golgi) and CFTR (apical) are different. The PDZ binding capacity of ClC-3B led to the idea that it might associate with and even be influenced by CFTR, possibly via EBP50 (6Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Google Scholar). We tested the ability of ClC-3B to bind to the individual PDZ domains of three different PDZ proteins, EBP50, PDZK, and GOPC, known to interact with CFTR (17Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Google Scholar). GST fusions with each of the PDZ domains were incubated with detergent lysates of BHK cells expressing CFTR and ClC-3B. Both channel proteins bound preferentially to the first PDZ domain of EBP50 and to a much lesser extent to the second (Fig.5 A). This result is different from that of Ogura et al. (6Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Google Scholar) who reported that ClC-3B preferred PDZ2 of EBP50 and hence that ClC-3B and CFTR might be coupled by EBP50. The C-terminal sequences of both channels indicate they should bind class I PDZ domains (15Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Google Scholar). When similar experiments were performed with the four PDZ domains of PDZK1, ClC-3B appeared to bind only the first (Fig. 5 B). CFTR, however, bound strongly to both domains 1 and 3. Hence at least in principle, a ternary complex could form with ClC-3B at PDZ1 and CFTR at PDZ3 of PDZK1. Since we found that ClC-3B resides primarily in the Golgi it seemed reasonable that it might bind to the Golgi-associated coiled-coil PDZ protein, GOPC, which binds CFTR (19Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Google Scholar). Fig. 5 C confirms that the single PDZ domain of GOPC binds ClC-3B as well as CFTR. Since the three PDZ proteins interact with both channel proteins, we examined the influence of each of the PDZ proteins on the localization of ClC-3B and CFTR (Fig. 6). Consistent with the results of Cheng et al. (19Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Google Scholar), EBP50 overexpression had little effect on the expression of CFTR, which is already at the cell surface. ClC-3B, however, was shifted from its presence just in the Golgi to somewhat more peripheral locations in the cell but was not detectible in the plasma membrane. PDZK1 overexpression similarly had little effect on CFTR, which is reasonable because PDZK1 and most CFTR are located in nearly the same place even when not co-expressed. On ClC-3B, however, PDZK1 had a stronger impact than EBP50, causing even more of that channel to move toward the cell periphery, although apparently not entirely to the plasma membrane. GOPC overexpression has a much more dramatic effect on both channels, causing them to become condensed with it in a focal Golgi location. The apparent large reduction in the amount of both channel proteins on co-expression with GOPC but not EBP50 or PDZK1 is confirmed by Western blots of whole cell lysates (Fig. 7). While these findings clearly show that the Golgi PDZ protein, GOPC, interacts strongly with the Golgi chloride channel, ClC-3B, this interaction cannot be entirely responsible for their co-localization since CFTR also is bound by GOPC but resides mostly at the cell surface.Figure 7Influence of overexpression of PDZ proteins on the amount of ClC-3B and CFTR. A, co-expression of GOPC with ClC-3B or CFTR. ClC-3B or CFTR were transiently overexpressed in BHK-21 cells without or with GOPC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies 69.16 and 596 for ClC-3B and CFTR, respectively.B, co-expression of EBP50, GOPC, or PDZK1 with ClC-3B.

To test this possibility two types of experiments were performed. In the first, both ClC-3B and CFTR could be co-immunoprecipitated with PDZK1 (Fig.8 A). Second, we compared the ability of a GST fusion with the C-terminal 40 amino acids of CFTR to pull-down ClC-3B from lysates of cells in which it was overexpressed alone or together with PDZK1 or one of the other PDZ proteins. Fig.8 B shows that interaction between the CFTR tail and ClC-3B is greatly enhanced by PDZK1. The low level of association without overexpressed PDZK1 may reflect the action of endogenous PDZ proteins or interaction between these two integral membrane proteins mediated by other means. In this assay, GOPC did not appear to cause increased association (Fig. 8 B) despite its strong self-association via"
https://openalex.org/W2144929560,"αB-Crystallin is a small heat-shock protein in which three serine residues (positions 19, 45, and 59) can be phosphorylated under various conditions. We describe here the interaction of αB-crystallin with FBX4, an F-box-containing protein that is a component of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase SCF (SKP1/CUL1/F-box). The interaction with FBX4 was enhanced by mimicking phosphorylation of αB-crystallin at both Ser-19 and Ser-45 (S19D/S45D), but not at other combinations. Ser-19 and Ser-45 are preferentially phosphorylated during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Also αB-crystallin R120G, a mutant found to co-segregate with a desmin-related myopathy, displayed increased interaction with FBX4. Both αB-crystallin S19D/S45D and R120G specifically translocated FBX4 to the detergent-insoluble fraction and stimulated the ubiquitination of one or a few yet unknown proteins. These findings implicate the involvement of αB-crystallin in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in a phosphorylation- and cell cycle-dependent manner and may provide new insights into the αB-crystallin-induced aggregation in desmin-related myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2063101836,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is released in response to myocardial infarction and may play a role in regulating cardiac remodeling. Recently, HGF was found to inhibit the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells. Because GATA-4 can induce cell survival, the effects of HGF on GATA-4 activity were investigated. Treatment of HL-1 cells or primary adult rat cardiac myocytes with HGF, at concentrations that can be detected in the human serum after myocardial infarction, rapidly enhances GATA-4 DNA-binding activity. The enhanced DNA-binding activity is associated with the phosphorylation of GATA-4. HGF-induced phosphorylation and activation of GATA-4 is abolished by MEK inhibitors or the mutation of the ERK phosphorylation site (S105A), suggesting that HGF activates GATA-4 via MEK-ERK pathway-dependent phosphorylation. HGF enhances the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, and this is blocked by dominant negative mutants of MEK or GATA-4. Forced expression of wild-type GATA-4, but not the GATA-4 mutant (S105A) increases the expression of Bcl-xL. Furthermore, expression of the GATA-4 mutant (S105A) suppresses HGF-mediated protection of cells against daunorubicin-induced apoptosis.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) suggest that HGF may be an oxidative stress-inducible factor. Similarly, in a rat model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, HGF expression was found to be enhanced (10Ono K. Matsumori A. Shioi T. Furukawa Y. Sasayama S.

Furthermore, human studies have shown that serum HGF levels are elevated 25–50-fold after acute myocardial infarction (11Matsumori A. Furukawa Y. Hashimoto T. Ono K. Shioi T. Okada M. Iwasaki A.

GATA-4 is a member of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors, which plays important roles in transducing nuclear events that modulate cell lineage differentiation during development. Six GATA family members have been identified and shown to alter transcription of target genes via binding to the consensus 5′-WGATAR-3′ sequence. Three members of this family, GATA-4/5/6, are expressed in the heart. Functionally relevant GATA-binding sites have been identified in numerous cardiac transcriptional regulatory regions (18Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev.

In addition to regulating differentiation, there is increasing evidence that GATA factors also control cell survival. Weiss and Orkin (20Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) reported that the GATA-1-deficient erythroid precursors undergo apoptosis. In erythroleukemia cells, the induction of apoptosis by estrogen was dependent on the inhibition of GATA-1 (21Blobel G.A. Sieff C.A. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell.

GATA elements are found in the promoters of other genes involved in antiapoptotic activities such as nitric-oxide synthases (26Keinanen R. Vartiainen N. Koistinaho J.

GATA-4 may play a role in promoting cell survival, as the apoptosis of ovarian cells was found to be associated with a decrease in the expression of GATA-4 (29Heikinheimo M. Ermolaeva M. Bielinska M.

Furthermore, a lack of GATA-4 is also associated with activation of apoptosis in the presumptive foregut (30Ghatpande S. Ghatpande A. Zile M. Evans T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We recently found that the apoptosis of cardiac myocytes induced by anthracycline is associated with decreased GATA-4 expression and that the forced expression of GATA-4 or -6 attenuates apoptosis, indicating that GATA-4 is involved in cell survival signaling in cardiac myocytes (31Kim Y.

To gain insights to the mechanism of HGF-mediated survival signaling in cardiac myocytes, the present study explored the effects of HGF on GATA-4. Results show that HGF activates GATA-4 in HL-1 cells and in the primary culture of adult rat cardiac myocytes via MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation, and this signaling pathway is involved in HGF-mediated antiapoptotic responses. HL-1 cardiac muscle cells (32Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were maintained in EXCELL 320 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen), 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), 1 μm retinoic acid (Sigma), 100 μm norepinephrine (Sigma), 1% nonessential amino acid supplements (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma) in plastic dishes, coated with 12.5 μg/ml fibronectin and 0.02% gelatin, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were replenished with fresh media every 2–3 days. For treatment, cells were starved in EXCELL 320 medium supplemented only with nonessential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B for 18 h and treated with human recombinant HGF (Sigma). Cardiac myocytes were isolated from ventricles of adult male Lewis rats (3–6 months old) using an enzymatic isolation technique previously described (33Suzuki Y.J. Cleemann L. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Viable myocytes were purified via a series of gravity sedimentations in 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm Ca2+, and then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. Ca2+-tolerant myocytes purified through these procedures were >90% viable. Adenovirus-directed gene transfer was implemented by adding 30 plaque forming units of recombinant adenovirus. The culture medium was aspirated from the cell culture growing in a 35-mm dish, and 0.5 ml of the fetal bovine serum-free medium containing the recombinant adenovirus was added. 1.5 ml of growth medium was added following 2 h of culture and maintained for 24–48 h before performing experiments. Adenovirus constructs expressing GATA-4 (wild-type and mutants) and dominant negative MEK1 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Molkentin (University of Cincinnati). To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 10 mmHepes (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate for 15 min at 4 °C. Nonidet P-40 was then added at a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v). Samples were mixed vigorously, and centrifuged. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 1% (v/v) glycerol, then mixed for 20 min and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatants were harvested, protein concentrations determined, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. To perform EMSA, binding reaction mixtures containing 2 μg of protein of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and32P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide probe containing consensus GATA sequence (5′-CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCT-3′) in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Electrophoresis of samples through a native 6% polyacrylamide gel was followed by autoradiography. SDS-PAGE gels (10%) used to separate phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated GATA-4 contained acrylamide/bis at a ratio of 30:0.165. Nuclear extracts (20 μg of protein) were electrophoresed and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked and incubated with rabbit polyclonal IgG for GATA-4 (H-112) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Levels of proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) system (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the effects of λ-protein phosphatase (λPPase), nuclear extracts were isolated without the use of phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, and tetrasodium pyrophosphate). Nuclear extracts were incubated with 2,500 units/ml λPPase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 30 min before subjecting to SDS-PAGE. The neutral comet assay was employed to measure double stranded DNA breaks as indication of cardiac myocyte apoptosis (16Kitta K. Day R.M. Ikeda T. Suzuki Y.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Treated cells were embedded in situ in 1% agarose, then placed in lysis solution (2.5 m NaCl, 1% Na-lauryl sarcosinate, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris base, 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min. The nuclei were subsequently electrophoresed for 20 min at 1 V/cm, followed by staining with SYBR Green and visualized with a fluorescence microscope. Between 100 and 150 comets per treatment were scored and assigned into type A, B, or C categories, based on their tail lengths (34Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Type C comets were defined as apoptotic cells. Mean ± S.E. were calculated, and statistically significant differences between two groups were determined by the Student's t test at p < 0.05. HGF has been shown to protect cardiac myocytes against apoptotic death (15Nakamura T. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Sawa Y. Matsuda H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 16Kitta K. Day R.M. Ikeda T. Suzuki Y.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because our recent study (31Kim Y. Ma A. Kitta K. Fitch S.N. Ikeda T. Ihara Y. Simon A.R. Evans T. Suzuki Y.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) has shown that GATA-4 serves as a cell survival factor of cardiac myocytes, we examined the effects of HGF on GATA-4. We found that HGF increases the GATA DNA-binding activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, nuclear extracts from cultured HL-1 cardiac muscle cells had some constitutive binding activity toward a double stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus GATA sequence as determined by EMSA. This binding activity was further increased by the treatment of cells with HGF (25 ng/ml). The stimulation of GATA DNA-binding activity occurred within 3 min of HGF treatment, and the densitometry analysis determined that the intensity of the band increased 4-fold after 10 min of HGF treatment (Fig. 1 A,bar graph). Both constitutive and activated GATA bands were effectively eliminated by cold double stranded oligonucleotide competitors containing the GATA consensus sequence in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 B). As shown in the line graph in Fig. 1 B, the densitometry analysis revealed that, at a given amount of cold competitor, the GATA-binding activity in HGF-treated cells (closed squares) was higher than that in untreated cells (open circle). To determine the exact transcription factor species in HL-1 cells that binds to the oligonucleotide containing the GATA consensus sequence and is activated in response to HGF treatment, we performed supershift experiments using GATA-4 and GATA-6 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 C, both the constitutive and activated GATA complexes were completely supershifted with the GATA-4 antibody whereas the GATA-6 antibody had no effects. Similarly, HGF-activated GATA DNA-binding activity in primary cultures of adult rat cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1 D) in which GATA-4 is the major GATA-binding protein (31Kim Y. Ma A. Kitta K. Fitch S.N. Ikeda T. Ihara Y. Simon A.R. Evans T. Suzuki Y.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the same nuclear extract samples, we observed that the DNA-binding activity of NFAT (a known mediator of GATA-4 activation) was not affected by HGF (Fig. 1 D, lower panel). These results indicate that HGF activates the DNA-binding activity of GATA-4 in adult cardiac myocytes. In contrast, other known cell survival factors such as NF-κB (Fig. 1 E) and Akt (data not shown) are not activated by HGF. We also noticed that the complex between DNA and the HGF-activated GATA-4 migrated slightly slower through the native gel compared with the complex with the unstimulated GATA-4. Western blot analysis detected two GATA-4 bands at ∼50 kDa in untreated HL-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). The lower band was slightly denser than the higher band (see densitometry analysis shown in the bar graph of Fig. 2 A). Treatment of cells with HGF resulted in a time-dependent upward shift of the lower band. By 10 min of treatment with HGF, all of the GATA-4 protein molecules existed as a single species with a reduced mobility, and this was sustained for at least 30 min. To test the hypothesis that GATA-4 may be phosphorylated and thus give a species with reduced mobility, we incubated nuclear extracts from untreated and HGF-treated HL-1 cells with λPPase in vitro. For these experiments, we isolated nuclear extracts without the use of phosphatase inhibitors. As shown in the Western blot results in Fig. 2 B, the lower GATA-4 band shifted to a higher band in response to treatment with HGF (first and second lanes). This upward shift was slightly attenuated by incubating the nuclear extracts at 30 °C (third andfourth lanes), presumably because of actions of endogenous protein phosphatases. The treatment of nuclear extract samples from untreated and HGF-treated HL-1 cells with λPPase at 30 °C completely abolished the higher band (fifth andsixth lanes). Similarly, λPPase treatment completely abolished the upward shift of the GATA-4 band induced by HGF in EMSA experiments (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that HGF induced the phosphorylation of GATA-4 in HL-1 cells. Towatari et al. (35Towatari M. May G.E. Marais R. Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. Enver T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4101-4107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reported that interleukin-3 activated GATA-2 through the ERK pathway in hematopoietic progenitor cells. The GATA-4 molecule contains putative ERK phosphorylation sites (36Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies showed that hypertrophic stimuli such as α1-adrenergic agonist (37Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and endothelin-1 (38Kitta K. Clement S.A. Remeika J. Blumberg J.B. Suzuki Y.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) induced the phosphorylation of GATA-4 in cardiac myocytes. We, therefore, examined whether HGF phosphorylated GATA-4 through the MEK-ERK pathway. EMSA experiments showed that pretreatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059 (39Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), effectively blocked the upward shift (phosphorylation) of the GATA-4 band induced by HGF (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, these results revealed that HGF-mediated enhancement of the GATA-4 DNA-binding activity was also blocked by the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 3 A, bar graph). PD98059 was dissolved in Me2SO and an equal amount of Me2SO (0.2% final concentration) alone had no effect (data not shown). Similarly, U0126 (another inhibitor of MEK) blocked the phosphorylation and activation of GATA-4 induced by HGF (data not shown). Western blot experiments confirmed our observations that PD98059 abolished the upward mobility shift induced by HGF (Fig. 3 B). Unlike in vitro treatment with λPPase (Fig. 2 B), a cell treatment with PD98059 was not effective in eliminating the constitutively existing higher band and only diminished the HGF-inducible phosphorylation. To confirm the effects of these MEK inhibitors, we used adenovirus expressing the dominant negative MEK described by Liang et al. (40Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, HGF-induced activation of ERK was blocked by dominant negative MEK expression without altering the ERK protein levels. Expression of this dominant negative mutant abolished the phosphorylation and activation of GATA-4 induced by HGF (Fig. 3 D). Liang et al. (40Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) reported that GATA-4 is phosphorylated at serine residue 105, an ERK phosphorylation site, in response to phenylephrine treatment of neonatal ventricular myocytes. Consistently, the mutant GATA-4 with serine 105 replaced with alanine was not phosphorylated or activated by HGF in HL-1 cells (Fig. 4 A) nor in primary culture of adult rat cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4 B), whereas endogenous (Fig. 4 A) or exogenous (Fig. 4 B) wild-type GATA-4 was activated by HGF. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HGF induces phosphorylation and activation of GATA-4 via MEK/ERK phosphorylation of serine 105. HGF has been reported to stimulate antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein expression in a human epithelial cell line (41Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar) and cardiomyocytes (15Nakamura T. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Sawa Y. Matsuda H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Similarly, HGF up-regulated the expression of Bcl-xL in HL-1 cells (Fig. 5). To examine the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in the up-regulation of Bcl-xL, the adenovirus expressing a dominant negative mutant of MEK was employed. As shown in Fig. 5, the dominant negative mutant of MEK blocked the HGF-induced Bcl-xL expression. To determine the role of GATA-4 in HGF-induced Bcl-xLexpression, a dominant mutant of GATA-4 as described by Liang et al. (42Liang Q. De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30245-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was used. EMSA experiments demonstrate that the expression of this dominant negative mutant GATA-4 indeed inhibited that GATA-4 DNA-binding activity in HL-1 cells (Fig. 6 A). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was used to monitor levels of bcl-x mRNA. The data were quantified by calculating the ratio of bcl-x to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a dominant negative mutant GATA-4 increased the basal level of bcl-x, but inhibited the HGF-induced enhancement of bcl-x mRNA expression. Furthermore, forced expression of wild-type GATA-4 induced the expression of Bcl-xL (Fig. 6 C), supporting the experiments with dominant negative mutants demonstrating that GATA-4 regulates thebcl-x expression. To determine the role of serine 105 phosphorylation of GATA-4 in cell survival, adenovirus expressing the S105A mutant of GATA-4 was used. Unlike wild-type GATA-4, the S105A mutant did not cause enhancement of Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, we found that this mutant serves as a dominant negative mutant. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 B, HGF inhibited the apoptotic cell death caused by an anthracycline antibiotic, daunorubicin, but S105A mutant expression blocked the HGF-induced protection of cells against daunorubicin. These results suggest that HGF-mediated protection of cardiac muscle cells is, at least partly, elicited by the up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL mediated by phosphorylation of GATA-4 at serine 105. HGF has been shown to be released in response to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (10Ono K. Matsumori A. Shioi T. Furukawa Y. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1997; 95: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and acute myocardial infarction (11Matsumori A. Furukawa Y. Hashimoto T. Ono K. Shioi T. Okada M. Iwasaki A. Nishio R.

Heart Vessels. 1997; 12: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Human serum HGF has been reported to increase from 0.3 to 0.4 ng/ml to a level as high as 37 ng/ml after acute myocardial infarction (11Matsumori A. Furukawa Y. Hashimoto T. Ono K. Shioi T. Okada M. Iwasaki A. Nishio R. Sasayama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Studies using rat models have supported a protective role by demonstrating that gene transfection (14Ueda H. Sawa Y. Matsumoto K. Kitagawa-Sakakida S. Kawahira Y. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Matsuda H. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1999; 67: 1726-1731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or injection (15Nakamura T. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Sawa Y. Matsuda H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) of HGF attenuated ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart. Therefore, HGF appears to play an important role as an endogenous cardioprotective factor. Furthermore, HGF may be useful as a therapeutic agent to protect the heart against various oxidative stress stimuli. Thus, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of HGF action in the heart. Some of the cardioprotective effects of HGF may be attributed to its ability to induce angiogenesis by acting on vascular endothelial cells (43Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Goldberg I.D. Bhargava M.M. Nickoloff B.J. Kinsella J.L. Polverini P. Rosen E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1937-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). However, HGF may also directly affect cardiac myocytes by attenuating the oxidative stress damage. In support of this hypothesis, we have recently demonstrated that HGF directly protected adult cardiac myocytes against oxidative stress stimuli such as serum deprivation, H2O2, and daunorubicin (16Kitta K. Day R.M. Ikeda T. Suzuki Y.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanism of HGF action to protect the heart may, in part, involve its direct action on cardiac muscle cells to prevent the occurrence of cell death. HGF has also been shown to inhibit the apoptosis in noncardiac tissues. Revoltella et al. (44Revoltella R.P. Borney F. Dal Canto B. D'Urso C.M. Cytotechnology. 1993; 13: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported that C2.8 mouse embryonic hepatocytic cells require exogenous HGF to survive and proliferate in serum-free medium. Apoptosis of hepatocytes induced by interferon-γ was inhibited by HGF (45Morita M. Watanabe Y. Akaike T. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1585-1593PubMed Google Scholar). In human endometrial epithelial cells, HGF suppressed apoptosis induced by Fas antigen (46Tanaka T. Mizuno K. Umesaki N. Ogita S. Clin. Exp. Obstet. Gynecol. 1998; 25: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar). A protective role for HGF in acute renal failure is suggested because HGF protected renal epithelial cells against apoptosis induced by serum starvation (47Yo Y. Morishita R. Nakamura S. Tomita N. Yamamoto K. Moriguchi A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or cisplatin (48Liu Y. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Liu (41Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar) reported that HGF triggered a phosphorylation and resultant inactivation of pro-apoptotic Bad via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and simultaneously up-regulated antiapoptotic Bcl-xL. HGF was shown to block the induction of apoptosis by various DNA damaging agents in breast cancer cells via preventing down-regulation of Bcl-xL (49Fan S. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q. Rockwell S. Andres J. Zlatapolskiy A. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, at least two pathways are responsible for antiapoptotic action of HGF: (i) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent inactivation of Bad and (ii) up-regulation of Bcl-xLthrough unknown mechanisms. Recently, Nakamura et al. (15Nakamura T. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Sawa Y. Matsuda H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) reported that HGF activated the signal transduction pathway for increased Bcl-xLexpression, but not the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway, in intact hearts and in cultured cardiomyocytes. The Bcl-xL expression was also enhanced in HL-1 cells in response to HGF treatment. Previous studies reported that Bcl-xL expression involves NF-κB activation (50Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35591-35595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in our studies, HGF failed to activate this transcription factor. Thus, NF-κB does not appear to play an important cardioprotective role in the HGF-mediated activation of Bcl-xL expression. In addition to the established role of GATA-4 in cardiac hypertrophy, GATA-4 may also play a role in cell survival. We have recently shown that the mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiac muscle cell apoptosis involves the down-regulation of GATA-4 (31Kim Y. Ma A. Kitta K. Fitch S.N. Ikeda T. Ihara Y. Simon A.R. Evans T. Suzuki Y.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Gregory et al. (24Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that GATA-1 induced the expression of Bcl-xL, and the bcl-x gene has two GATA consensus motifs that reside in the 5′ promoter region (23Grillot D.A. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that GATA-4 is involved in HGF-mediated antiapoptotic signaling. Mechanisms of GATA-4 regulation may involve post-translational modifications. A member of the GATA family, GATA-2, has been shown to be phosphorylated in noncardiac muscle cells through the ERK pathway (35Towatari M. May G.E. Marais R. Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. Enver T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4101-4107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GATA-4 also contains putative ERK phosphorylation sites (36Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that hypertrophic stimuli, such as phenylephrine (37Morimoto T.

Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) demonstrated that GATA-4 is phosphorylated at serine 105 by ERK2 in cardiomyocytes in response to agonist stimulation, suggesting that GATA-4 might regulate its downstream events via phosphorylation mediated by ERK1/2. Indeed, our observations suggest that GATA-4 phosphorylation induced by HGF leads to the up-regulation of Bcl-xL resulting in HGF-mediated cardioprotection. In summary, the present study examined the effects of HGF on GATA-4 in cardiac muscle cells. As illustrated in Fig. 8, HGF activates GATA-4 whereas the activation of other cell survival factors such as NF-κB and Akt was not observed. HGF-induced activation of GATA-4 DNA-binding activity is regulated by the MEK-ERK pathway-dependent phosphorylation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of GATA-4 plays an important role in the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL. We propose that the MEK/ERK/GATA-4 pathway is involved in the HGF-mediated protection of cardiac myocytes against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, which can occur during myocardial infarction.

Post-transcriptional regulation ofCOX-2 mRNA is important in controlling the expression of the COX-2 gene. Here, we report that leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export factor CRM1 potently inhibits the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 human mammary cancer cells. However, COX-2 promoter-driven reporter gene expression is not inhibited by LMB, suggesting that LMB acts at the post-transcriptional level. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that LMB inhibited the time-dependent export of COX-2 mRNA into the membrane-bound polysomal compartment at the endoplasmic reticulum. LMB suppressed COX-2 expression by interleukin-1β in HT-29 human colon cancer cells and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells but had no effect on COX-2 expression induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in monocytic THP-1 cells.

PGs are implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological events, including in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases (2Marnett L.J. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

DuBois R.N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 545-546Google Scholar). Two isoforms of COX have been identified and cloned in eukaryotic cells. COX-1, the constitutively expressed isoform, is involved in the maintenance of physiological functions. In contrast, COX-2 is inducible by extracellular stimuli such as tumor promoters, pro-inflammatory cytokines, mitogens, oncogenes, and growth factors in a variety of cells (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Google Scholar). Overexpression of COX-2 is observed in human cancers such as colon and breast (4Hawk E.T. Viner J.L. Dannenberg A. DuBois R.N. J.

Gene deletion of COX-2 suppressed the developmental of intestinal polyps in APC gene deleted mice, suggesting that COX-2 expression is critical for tumorigenesis (5Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of COX-2 in the mammary glands of transgenic mice results in enhanced tumorigenesis in multiparous mice (6Liu C.H. Chang S.H. Narko K. Trifan O.C., Wu, M.T. Smith E.

The control of COX-2 gene expression is regulated at the level of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which COX-2 expression is controlled are not fully understood. Leptomycin B (LMB) was originally discovered as a potent anti-fungal antibiotic from Streptomyces sp. (8Hamamoto T. Gunji S. Tsuji H. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1983; 36: 639-645Google Scholar). However, recent data showed that LMB causes G1 cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells and is a potent anti-tumor agent against murine experimental tumors (9Yoshida M. Nishikawa M. Nishi K. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Google Scholar, 10Komiyama K. Okada K. Tomisaka S. Umezawa I. Hamamoto T. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1985; 38: 427-429Google Scholar). Studies in Scizosaccharomyces pombeidentified the cellular target of LMB as the CRM1 (chromosomal region maintenance)/exportin 1 protein (11Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Google Scholar), which is critical for the export of RNA and proteins containing a nuclear export sequence (NES). In the case of RNA export, CRM1 binds to ribonuclear proteins containing the NES motif (12Watanabe M. Fukuda M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

For example, the export of Rev-response element-containing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA is inhibited by LMB (13Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Google Scholar). Studies from Steitz and co-workers (16Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Google Scholar) indicated that LMB disrupted the interaction of the RNA binding protein HuR with its protein partners, resulting in blockage of nuclear export of c-Fos mRNA and perhaps other immediate-early gene mRNAs that bind to HuR (16Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Google Scholar, 17Moore M.J. Rosbash M. Science. 2001; 294: 1841-1842Google Scholar). We and others have recently showed that the COX-2 mRNA binds specifically to HuR at the 3′-untranslated region (18Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A.

Based on these observations, we speculated that LMB might regulate COX-2 gene expression by controlling nuclear export of its mRNA. In the present study, we investigated whether LMB can regulate the expression of COX-2 by modulating the nuclear export of COX-2 mRNA. MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC HTB-26) were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone).

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Clonetics) were cultured in M199 medium (Cellgro, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS and heparin-stabilized endothelial cell growth factor as described previously (19Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in modified RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixtures (1×, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). After 10-min incubation on ice, cells were collected by cell scraper and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Whole cell lysates (40 μg/lane) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were then transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot analysis using the anti-COX-2 and β-actin mouse monoclonal antibodies were conducted as described previously (20Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the RNA-STAT60 reagent (Tel-test) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (20Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were fixed in 4%(w/v) formaldehyde, 5%(v/v) acetic acid, and 0.9%(w/v) NaCl and dehydrated in 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol (EtOH). For in situ hybridization, digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled DNA probes (5 ng/μl) (DIG-HIGH primer labeling system, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the hybridization solution (60% deionized formamide, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 5% dextran sulfate, and 250 ng/μl sheared salmon DNA). Fifty microliters of the hybridization mixture were added to the fixed cells. After 16-h hybridization, cells were washed under high stringency at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence detection, cells were blocked in a blocking solution (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). After blocking, the slides were incubated with anti-DIG fluorescein (1:500). Slides were washed (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and dehydrated in 70%, 90%, and 100% EtOH. Finally, slides were embeded in the anti-fading solution with DAPI (50 ng/μl) as counter-staining, and cells were imaged by a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss 410 Confocal microscope. MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected for 4 h with luciferase DNA construct containing a COX-2 promoter (21Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Google Scholar, 22Gou Q. Liu C.H. Ben-Av P. Hla T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 508-512Google Scholar). After 48-h post-transfection, cells were grown for 6 h in the presence or absence of serum along with or without LMB. Cell lysates were assayed with the luciferase assay system (Promega) using a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were then washed in PBS and successively extracted as described. First, cells were extracted with the Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 40 units/ml RNasin, 1 mm DTT). The remaining pellet (rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and nucleus) was washed in the same buffer and extracted in buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 0.5%(v/v) Nonidet P-40, 40 mm EDTA, 40 units/ml RNasin, 1 mm DTT). The remaining nuclear pellet was washed in the same buffer and extracted with high salt buffer (10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5%(v/v) Nonidet P-40, 40 units/ml RNasin, 1 mm DTT). RNA was purified from each fraction by the RNA STAT solution as described above. The RNase protection assay was performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Ambion) with some modifications. Briefly, RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes of human COX-2 (500 bp) and human GAPDH (100 bp). The hybridization reaction was then treated with RNases A and T to remove unhybridized probes. The protected and hybridized mRNA was resolved in 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The gel was dried and exposed on a Kodak film at −80 °C. The bands were visualized by autoradiography or PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences). Previously we showed that COX-2 mRNA and protein were induced by serum withdrawal in MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells (20Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). We recently found that the interaction of COX-2 mRNA with the RNA-binding protein HuR is critical for stabilization of COX-2 mRNA.2 Steitz and co-workers (16Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Google Scholar) have shown that one of the functions of HuR is to facilitate the nuclear export of immediate-early mRNAs into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, they showed that HuR ligands bind to CRM1 and that HuR-binding mRNA export is inhibited by LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (16Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Google Scholar). We determined the effect of LMB to see if COX-2 mRNA export is critical in the regulation of expression. Northern and Western analysis showed that LMB potently and effectively suppressed the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Extremely low concentrations of LMB, 10 ng/ml (18 nm), were sufficient to completely inhibit the serum withdrawal-induced COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Serum withdrawal-induced expression of COX-2 gene in MDA-MB-231 cells were previously characterized to require the stabilization of the COX-2 mRNA via signaling of the p38 stress-activated kinase pathway (20Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on analysis did not indicate changes in transcription rate of the COX-2 gene (20Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of LMB most likely is at the post-transcriptional level. To confirm this point, we measured the expression of COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase expression in transiently transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2, LMB had no effect on COX-2 transcription. Neither serum addition nor withdrawal modulated COX-2 transcription, suggesting that LMB inhibits COX-2 expression by an effect at the post-transcriptional level. To better define the subcellular localization of the COX-2 mRNA, we conducted biochemical fractionation and in situ hybridization experiments. Cells were extracted with Nonidet P-40 buffer to isolate the cytosolic fraction. The remaining nuclear/RER pellet was extracted with EDTA to remove the membrane-bound polysomal RNA. The EDTA-resistant fraction was extracted with high salt to isolate nuclear RNA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, U6 RNA was found predominantly in the nuclear fraction and GAPDH RNA was found in the cytosolic and RER compartments. This validates the biochemical extraction scheme that was employed. As expected, COX-2 mRNA was induced only when cells were serum-deprived. In contrast to the fractionation of U6 and GAPDH mRNAs, COX-2 mRNA showed a predominantly RER/polysomal distribution, consistent with the fact that COX-2 is a protein located in the lumen of the ER. A significant proportion of the COX-2 mRNA was also found in the nuclear fraction. Since transcription rates are similar in 10 and 0% serum treated cells, these data suggest that both nuclear and ER-associated COX-2 mRNA species accumulate under serum-deprivation induced condition. To further validate the biochemical fractionation data, we conducted anin situ hybridization experiment with COX-2 and GAPDH probes to detect the respective transcripts. As shown in Fig. 3 B, GAPDH signals were diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells regardless of treatment of the cells with 10% or 0% serum. However, COX-2 mRNA showed a dramatic change when cells were treated with 0% serum for 24 h. A strong signal around the nuclear membrane and ER was observed only under 0% serum treatment, whereas background signals were seen in cells cultured with 10% serum. These data confirm the biochemical fractionation experiments that COX-2 mRNA accumulates in membrane-bound polysomal (ER-associated) and nuclear compartments. Predominant accumulation of the COX-2 mRNA at the nuclear membrane (both EDTA-extractable and high salt-extractable) suggest that nuclear transport of COX-2 mRNA may be rate-limiting. To determine whether the LMB effect on the suppression of the COX-2 mRNA occurs in the nuclear compartment or ER compartment or both, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with LMB, and at various times thereafter COX-2 and GAPDH mRNAs were analyzed by biochemical fractionation followed by RNase protection experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 24-h serum starvation induced significant levels of COX-2 mRNA in both ER-associated and nuclear compartments (lanes 3 and4). Continued treatment with 0% FBS further induced COX-2 mRNA, and at 24 h thereafter, maximal levels of COX-2 mRNA accumulated at the membrane-bound ER fraction, whereas a smaller fraction was found in the nucleus. Treatment with LMB from 0–24 h resulted in pronounced suppression of COX-2 mRNA (but not the GAPDH mRNA), especially at the 24-h time point (lanes 15 and16). Interestingly, both membrane-bound ER and nuclear COX-2 mRNA species were suppressed. To further confirm the time-dependent effect of LMB, cells were treated with 0% FBS at time 0 h and subsequently treated or not with LMB from 8–24 h (Fig. 4 B). As it can be seen, LMB treatment from 8–24 h suppressed both nuclear and RER-localized COX-2 transcript levels. However, membrane-bound ER-localized COX-2 transcripts were profoundly suppressed by LMB. Although nuclear COX-2 mRNA was suppressed by LMB, it was not suppressed to the same degree as the cytosolic counterpart. These data suggest that COX-2 mRNAs accumulate at the nuclear pore complex in MDA-MB-231 cells and that inhibition of the CRM1 pathway with LMB results in degradation of COX-2 mRNA in both the intranuclear and extranuclear (membrane-bound ER) compartments of the nuclear pore complex. Indeed, time course analysis of COX-2 mRNA in membrane-bound ER and nuclear compartments after LMB treatment indicates that COX-2 mRNAs in both compartments decay with similar rates (data not shown). Thus, LMB appears to decouple the COX-2 mRNA from the nuclear export pathway and target it for degradation in both cytosolic and membrane-bound ER compartments. We also tested whether LMB can inhibit the expression of COX-2 by known COX-2 inducers such as IL-1β or LPS in other cell types including HT-29, a human colon carcinoma cell line, HUVEC, or THP1, a human monocytic cell line. The data showed that the expression of COX-2 induced by IL-1β in HT-29 cells is inhibited by LMB in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). The COX-2 expression induced by IL-1 in HUVEC was also partially inhibited by LMB at 10 ng/ml concentration (Fig. 5 B). However, LPS-stimulated COX-2 expression in THP1 cells was not inhibited by LMB at even 20 ng/ml (Fig. 5 C). COX-2 regulation in various cell systems is regulated at both transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional levels (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Google Scholar, 3Hla T. Bishop-Bailey D. Liu C.H. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Google Scholar, 7Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Google Scholar). Since LMB is a specific regulator of CRM1-dependent nuclear export, it is likely that it would only block expression of genes that are controlled by CRM1-dependent export of mRNA. These data suggest that LMB inhibits COX-2 expression in a cell-type and agonist-specific manner. In summary the data presented here demonstrate for the first time that LMB potently inhibits COX-2 expression induced by serum withdrawal in a human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Furthermore, our data suggest a possible mechanism by which LMB inhibits COX-2 expression by showing that LMB blocks nuclear export of COX-2 mRNA, which may be an important control point of COX-2 gene expression. Finally we provide some evidence that LMB may be a new and potent inhibitor of COX-2 expression with a cell- and/or agonist-type specificity. We thank Drs.

We have carried out a systematic study of the influence of the following factors on the yield of S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) generated from the reaction of NO⋅ with oxy-, deoxy-, and metHb: 1) the volumetric ratio of the protein and the NO⋅ solutions; 2) the rate of addition of the NO⋅ solution to the protein solution; 3) the amount of NO⋅ added; and 4) the concentration of the phosphate buffer.

Possible pathways of SNO-Hb formation from the reaction of NO⋅ with oxy-, deoxy-, and metHb are described.

Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 15Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Piantadosi C.A. Stamler J.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been proposed that in vivo NO⋅preferentially binds to the very small amount of deoxygenated heme of hemoglobin that is present under physiological conditions (about 1%) to yield an iron(II)-nitrosyl complex (HbFe(II)NO) (15Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This proposal is based on the hypothesis that NO⋅ binds R-state hemoglobin at least 100 times faster than T-state hemoglobin (25Gross S.S. Lane P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9967-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has further been suggested that the “NO group” can be transferred intramolecularly from the heme (HbFe(II)NO) to the conserved cysteine residue β93, producing S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) (26Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). This process has been proposed to be driven thermodynamically, since the S-nitrosocysteine of SNO-Hb is significantly more stable when Hb is in the R-state. When the red blood cells reach hypoxic tissues, O2 is delivered from SNO-Hb, triggering the conversion of Hb to the T-state (26Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Because of steric interactions with nearby amino acid residues, the S-nitrosocysteine of SNO-Hb is highly destabilized in the deoxyHb T-state (27Chan N.-L. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16459-16464Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, transnitrosation from SNO-Hb to other thiols within the red blood cell is favored. In particular, it has been suggested that the “NO group” is transferred to a cysteine residue of the band 3 anion exchange membrane protein and finally transported out of the red blood cell by a still unidentified route (11Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 24McMahon T.J. Moon R.E. Luschinger B.P. Carraway M.S. Stone A.E. Stolp B.W. Gow A.J. Pawloski J.R. Watke P. Singel D.J. Piantadosi C.A. Stamler J.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). One of the central points of this hypothetical mechanism is that the delivery of both O2 and NO⋅ to tissues is regulated allosterically; cooperative liberation of NO⋅ and O2, transported under physiological conditions by hemoglobin, should thus allow for very efficient delivery of dioxygen to peripheral respiring tissues (11Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 24McMahon T.J. Moon R.E. Luschinger B.P. Carraway M.S. Stone A.E. Stolp B.W. Gow A.J. Pawloski J.R.

An increasing amount of evidence has recently been published that challenges this fascinating hypothesis. Huang et al. (28Huang Z. Louderback J.G. Goyal M. Azizi F. King B. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1568: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have shown that there is a linear correlation between the oxygen saturation of Hb and the yield of HbFe(II)NO, indicating that the rate of NO⋅ binding to deoxyHb is independent of oxygen saturation. In another work, the same group has shown that the rate constant for NO⋅ binding to R-state hemoglobin is (2.1 ± 0.1) × 107m−1 s−1, nearly identical to that reported for NO⋅ binding to T-state Hb (2.6 × 107m−1s−1) (29Cassoly R. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Gladwin et al. (12Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H.

In addition, the same group determined that SNO-Hb is present in the low nm range in the blood, but they did not find a significant arterial-venous gradient (30Gladwin M.T. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Pease-Fye M.E. Waclawiw M.A. Panza J.A. Ognibene F.P. Cannon III, R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, in a recent paper Gladwinet al. (32Gladwin M.T. Wang X. Reiter C.D. Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Bonaventura C. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27818-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) showed that SNO-Hb is intrinsically unstable in the reductive environment of the red blood cells and thus concluded that SNO-Hb cannot accumulate in the red blood cells to form a reservoir of bioactive NO⋅. Taken together, these results suggest that SNO-Hb cannot play a role in the regulation of blood flow under normal physiological conditions. In addition, while this work was in progress, three papers have appeared that address the problem of mixing artifacts from the addition of an NO⋅ bolus to oxyHb (33Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Vaughn M.W.

Med. 2002; 32: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are not always consistent, and contrasting mechanisms have been proposed to explain similar observations. In particular, from their studies of the reaction between oxyHb and NO⋅ in the presence of cyanide, Han et al. (33Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Vaughn M.W. Fukuto J.M. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7763-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) concluded that, when an NO⋅ bolus is added to an oxyHb solution, SNO-Hb is formed through a pathway that does not include NO+ generated from oxidation of NO⋅ by metHb. In contrast, they suggest that SNO-Hb is possibly formed by reaction of Cys-β93 with N2O3. According to their mathematical simulations, formation of N2O3after the addition of NO⋅ to oxyHb under aerobic conditions is not possible kinetically, and thus they suggested that N2O3 must be present in the NO⋅ stock solution. This suggestion is highly unlikely, since N2O3 rapidly hydrolyzes to nitrite in aqueous solutions. Indeed, it has been shown that the addition of unpurified gaseous NO⋅ (directly from the gas tank) to GSH under anaerobic conditions leads to the formation of GSNO (36Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28158-28164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In contrast, GSNO was not detected when a solution of unpurified NO⋅ was added to the GSH solution (under anaerobic conditions) (36Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28158-28164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A final observation of Han et al. (33Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Vaughn M.W. Fukuto J.M. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7763-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is that if NO⋅ is delivered with the NO⋅ donor 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate 2-oxide (DEA), oxyHb is converted exclusively to metHb and nitrate, and no detectable amounts of SNO-Hb are formed. Joshi et al. (34Joshi M.S. Ferguson Jr., T.B. Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Liao J.C. Rassaf T. Bryan N. Feelisch M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10341-10346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) also studied the reaction of NO⋅with oxyHb. From their results, the authors of this paper also concluded that SNO-Hb is generated from the reaction of Cys-β93 with N2O3. However, Joshi et al. (34Joshi M.S. Ferguson Jr., T.B. Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Liao J.C. Rassaf T. Bryan N. Feelisch M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10341-10346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have proposed that, when NO⋅ is added as a bolus, it is possible that substantial amounts of N2O3 are formed from the reaction of NO⋅ with O2. Nevertheless, this conclusion contrasts with their further observation that the SNO-Hb yields were nearly identical when NO⋅ was added as a bolus or with the NO⋅ donor (Z)-1-{N-methyl-N-[6-(N-methylammoniohexyl)amino]}diazenium 1,2-diolate (NHMA). Finally, from their experiments with oxyMb and NO⋅ in the presence of GSH, Zhang et al. (35Zhang Y. Hogg N. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) also concluded that the addition of a bolus of NO⋅ causes mixing artifacts that facilitate the NO⋅/O2 reaction. Thus, analogously to Joshi et al. (34Joshi M.S. Ferguson Jr., T.B. Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Liao J.C. Rassaf T. Bryan N. Feelisch M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10341-10346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), they suggest that GSNO is generated from the reaction of the nitrosating species N2O3with GSH. This conclusion is supported by the observation that, in contrast to the data reported by Joshi et al. (34Joshi M.S. Ferguson Jr., T.B. Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Liao J.C. Rassaf T. Bryan N. Feelisch M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10341-10346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) but in analogy to those described in Han et al. (33Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Vaughn M.W. Fukuto J.M. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7763-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the slow addition of NO⋅ with the NO⋅-donor 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate 2-oxide to an oxyMb/GSH solution did not result in detectable amounts of GSNO. In the present work, we carried out a systematic study of the influence of the following factors on the percentage of SNO-Hb generated relative to the amount of NO⋅ added to oxy-, deoxy-, and metHb solutions: 1) the volumetric ratio of the protein and the NO⋅ solutions; 2) the rate of addition of the NO⋅ solution to the protein solution; 3) the amount of NO⋅ added; and 4) the concentration of the phosphate buffer (0.1 versus 0.01m). For comparison, in some of the reactions, we substituted Hb with equimolar amounts of Mb mixed with 0.5 eq of GSH, to mimic the heme/Cys-β93 ratio in Hb. To be able to directly compare our results, we chose to keep the protein concentration constant in most of our experiments (final concentration 50 μm) and generally added 1 or 0.1 eq of NO⋅. Three different techniques were used to add the NO⋅ solution to the protein solution: the addition of a small volume of a saturated (2 mm) NO⋅solution (Method 1), the addition of an equivalent volume of a diluted NO⋅ solution (Method 2), either as fast as possible or very slowly, within 1–2 min. Buffer solutions (0.1 or 0.01 m) were prepared from K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (Fluka) with deionized Milli-Q water and always contained 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA; Sigma). Sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, sodium dithionite, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), potassium cyanide, potassium permanganate, sulfanilamide,N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediaminedihydrochloride, ammonium sulfamate, and glutathione were obtained from Fluka. 4,4′-Dithiopyridine (4-PDS) was purchased from Aldrich. GSNO was prepared by the method of Hart (37Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Briefly, reduced glutathione was allowed to react with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions at 0 °C, followed by the addition of cold acetone. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed, and dried under vacuum in the dark. The pink solid of GSNO, which had similar visible absorption maxima and extinction coefficients as reported by Hart (37Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar), was stored at −80 °C in the dark. Nitrogen monoxide was obtained from Linde and passed through a NaOH solution as well as a column of NaOH pellets to remove higher nitrogen oxides before use. A saturated NO⋅ solution was prepared by degassing water for at least 1 h with argon and then saturating it with NO⋅ for at least 1 h. When needed, the obtained stock solution (∼2 mm) was diluted with degassed buffer in gas-tight SampleLock Hamilton syringes. The final NO⋅ concentrations were measured with an ANTEK Instruments nitrogen monoxide analyzer, with a chemiluminescence detector. Horse heart myoglobin was purchased from Sigma. metMb was prepared by oxidizing the protein with a small amount of potassium hexacyanoferrate(III). The solution was then purified over a Sephadex G-25 column by using a 0.1 mphosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) as the eluant. The concentration of the metMb solutions was determined by measuring the absorbances at 408, 502, and/or 630 nm (ε408 = 188 mm−1 cm−1, ε502 = 10.2 mm−1 cm−1, and ε630 = 3.9 mm−1cm−1) (38Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). oxyMb was prepared by reducing metMb with a slight excess of sodium dithionite. The solution was purified chromatographically on a Sephadex G-25 column by using a 0.1m phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) as the eluant. The concentration of the oxyMb solutions was determined by measuring the absorbances at 417, 542, and/or 580 nm (ε417 = 128 mm−1 cm−1, ε542 = 13.9 mm−1 cm−1, and ε580 = 14.4 mm−1cm−1) (38Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). Purified human oxyHb stock solution (57 mg/ml solution of HbA0 with ∼1.1% metHb) was a kind gift from APEX Bioscience, Inc. The obtained solution was frozen in small aliquots (0.5–1 ml) and stored at −80 °C. oxyHb solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solution with buffer, and concentrations (always expressed per heme) were determined by measuring the absorbance at 415, 541, and/or 577 nm (ε415 = 125 mm−1 cm−1, ε541 = 13.8 mm−1 cm−1, and ε577 = 14.6 mm−1cm−1) (38Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). metHb solutions were prepared by oxidizing oxyHb with a slight excess of potassium hexacyanoferrate(III). The solution was purified chromatographically on a Sephadex G-25 column by using a 0.1 m phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) as the eluant. The concentration of the metHb solutions (always expressed per heme) was determined by measuring the absorbances at 405, 500, and/or 631 nm (ε405 = 179 mm−1 cm−1, ε500 = 10.0 mm−1 cm−1, and ε631 = 4.4 mm−1cm−1) (38Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). HbFe(II) (deoxyHb) solutions were prepared by thoroughly degassing oxyHb solutions with argon for at least 1 h without causing foaming of the solution. The concentration of the HbFe(II) solutions was determined by measuring the absorbance at 430 and/or 555 nm (ε430 = 133 mm−1cm−1 and ε555 = 12.5 mm−1 cm−1) (38Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). metHbCN solutions were prepared by treating metHb with a slight excess of KCN. The solution was purified chromatographically on a Sephadex G-25 column by using a 0.1 m phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) as the eluant. The concentration of the metHbCN solutions (always expressed per heme) was determined by measuring the absorbances at 419 and/or 540 nm (ε419 = 124 mm−1cm−1 and ε540 = 12.5 mm−1 cm−1) (38Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). SNO-Hb (36 mg/ml with an S-nitroso content of 850 μm;i.e. about 74% of Cys-β93 and metHb content of 10.7%) was a kind gift from APEX Bioscience, Inc. Absorption spectra were collected in 1 cm cells on a UVIKON 820 or on an Analytik Jena Specord 200. All reactions were carried out in phosphate buffer (0.1 or 0.01 m), pH 7.2, at room temperature. For Method 1, 2 ml of a protein solution (mostly ∼50 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mm DTPA) were placed in a 5-ml round bottom flask, which was then closed with a rubber septum. If anaerobic conditions were required, the solutions were thoroughly degassed with argon for 45–60 min. Depending on the equivalents of NO⋅required (mostly 1, 0.5, or 0.1 eq) 5–50 μl of a NO⋅-saturated solution were rapidly added to the oxyHb solution under constant stirring by using a Hamilton gas-tight syringe. For the experiments under aerobic conditions, particular care was taken to add the NO⋅ solution at the bottom of the flask to avoid any contact of NO⋅ with the oxygen present in the head space of the flask. Alternatively, the reaction was carried out in a sealable cell for anaerobic applications (Hellma). In this case, the required amount of a saturated NO⋅ solution (5–50 μl) was added to 2 ml of a protein solution while vortex-mixing. Method 2 used the same procedure as described for Method 1with the difference that the volumetric ratio of the protein and the NO⋅ solutions was always 1. In a typical experiment, 2 ml of a 100 μm protein solution (in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mm DTPA) were mixed under constant stirring with 2 ml of a diluted NO⋅ solution (10–100 μm depending on the required equivalents). The diluted NO⋅ solutions were prepared by mixing in a gas-tight SampleLock Hamilton syringe the NO⋅-saturated solution with the required amounts of degassed buffer. In most cases, each experiment was carried out by adding the NO⋅ solution in two different ways: fast(in one shot as fast as possible) or slow (as slowly as possible, within 1–2 min). The reactions were carried out under aerobic conditions according to Method 1or 2. After the addition of the NO⋅ solution, the reaction mixtures were stirred for 10 min and then analyzed forS-nitrosated Cys-β93 and free Cys-β93, and, in some cases, a UV-visible spectrum was recorded. A control experiment was carried out to check that no artifactual S-nitrosation was taking place under the acidic conditions of the Saville assay. For this purpose, after treating the oxyHb solution with NO⋅, 100 μl of a 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) solution in H2O were added and allowed to react for 20 min. Finally, the amount of S-nitrosated Cys-β93 was quantified. A series of experiments was carried out in the presence of an excess KCN. For this purpose, a solution containing oxyHb and either 10 or 100 eq of KCN (relative to the oxyHb concentration) was treated with 1 eq of NO⋅ according to Method 1 exactly as described above for the reaction in the absence of KCN. Most of the reactions were carried out in a sealable cell for anaerobic applications. The oxyHb solutions were thoroughly degassed for about 30 min, until the recorded UV-visible spectrum indicated the complete formation of deoxyHb. Alternatively, the reactions were carried out in round bottom flasks under anaerobic conditions according to Method 1 or2. After the addition of the NO⋅ solution, the reaction mixtures were stirred for 10 min. Then the flasks or the cells were opened, and the solutions were analyzed forS-nitrosated Cys-β93 (under aerobic conditions) immediately and/or after 10 min. In a control experiment, theS-nitrosated Cys-β93 content was determined under anaerobic conditions by carrying out the analysis in a sealable cell with thoroughly degassed Saville reagents. A series of experiments was carried out by adding an excess KCN before exposing the reaction mixtures to air. For this purpose, to 2 ml of deoxyHb (50 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer) we first added 100 μl of a NO⋅-saturated solution and, immediately after, 100 μl of a 10 mm KCN solution in water. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min, exposed to air, and, after 10 more min, analyzed with the Saville assay. An oxyHb solution (2 ml, 50 μm in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mmDTPA) was placed in a sealable cell and degassed for ∼30 min, until the recorded UV-visible spectrum indicated the formation of deoxyHb. Then 110 or 130 μl of an O2-saturated H2O solution were added until the recorded UV-visible spectrum matched a spectrum calculated for a 1:1 or a 3:1 mixture, respectively. The concentration of the two hemoglobin species present in solution was also controlled by using the equation given in Ref. 39Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Yung S. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 55: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar. The solutions were then treated with a concentrated NO⋅ solution according toMethod 1. The reaction mixtures were stirred for 10 min. Finally, the cell was opened, and the solution was immediately analyzed for S-nitrosated Cys-β93 under aerobic conditions. The reactions were carried out both under aerobic and under anaerobic conditions according to Method 1 or 2. After the addition of the NO⋅ solution, the reaction mixtures were stirred for 30 min, degassed for 30–60 min (only for the anaerobic experiments), and analyzed for S-nitrosated Cys-β93 under aerobic conditions. Solutions containing twice the amount of Hb (50 μm oxyHb and 50 μm metHb) were mixed under aerobic conditions with 50 or 5 μm NO⋅ according to either Method 1 or Method 2 (fast and slow). The reaction mixtures were stirred for 30 min and then analyzed forS-nitrosated Cys-β93. To 2 ml of a solution containing 50 μm oxyHb and 50 μm metMb, 1 or 0.1 eq of NO⋅ were added from a saturated solution (Method 1) under aerobic conditions. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min and then analyzed forS-nitrosated Cys-β93. The addition of NO⋅ was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions according to Method 1 or 2. After 10 min, the solution was thoroughly degassed for 1 h and analyzed forS-nitrosated Cys-β93 under aerobic conditions. metMb was mixed with 0.5 eq of GSH (relative to the metMb concentration), treated with NO⋅, and analyzed exactly as described above for the reaction of metHb with NO⋅. oxyMb was mixed with 0.5 eq of GSH (relative to the oxyMb concentration), treated with NO⋅, and analyzed exactly as described above for the reaction of oxyHb with NO⋅. The S-nitrosothiol content was determined by the method of Saville (40Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Our NO⋅ solutions always contained variable amounts of nitrite (variable amounts between 0.1 and 1 eq, relative to the NO⋅ concentration). Thus, since the analysis of the S-nitrosothiol content is carried out under acidic conditions, we first eliminated excess nitrite by the addition of ammonium sulfamate (40Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). For the analysis of theS-nitrosothiol content, two different sets of reagents were prepared. Diluted reagents include solution"

A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify Ligand-of-Numb protein-X (LNX) as a binding partner to the intracellular tail of CAR. LNX harbors several protein-protein interacting domains, including four PDZ domains, and was previously shown to bind to and regulate the expression level of the cell-fate determinant Numb. CAR was able to bind LNX both in vivo and in vitro. Efficient binding to LNX required not only the consensus PDZ domain binding motif in the C terminus of CAR but also upstream sequences. The CAR binding region in LNX was mapped to the second PDZ domain. CAR and LNX were also shown to colocalize in vivo in mammalian cells.

It was long thought that adenovirus-based vectors could transfer genes promiscuously into almost all tissues and cell types. This optimistic view has, however, been revised; several obstacles for efficient gene transfer, including inaccessibility or complete lack of the primary virus receptor on certain cell types, have been identified. A more detailed investigation regarding the presence, regulation, and normal cellular function of the virus receptor in different tissues is therefore a prerequisite for efficient gene transfers.The primary virus receptor was cloned in 1997 (1Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3352-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S.

The same receptor is shared between two distinct virus groups, Coxsackie B and adenoviruses, and it has therefore been named CVADR (Coxsackie Virus and ADenovirus Receptor) or CAR.1 CAR is a member of the CTX subfamily of the large Ig superfamily characterized by one V-type and one C-type immunoglobulin domain in the extracellular domain, one membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular tail of varying length (for a review on CAR, see Ref. 3Philipson L. Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Because of differential splicing, CAR is expressed as at least two isoforms, here termed CAR-1 and CAR-2 (4Andersson B. Tomko R.P. Edwards K. Mirza M. Darban H. Öncü D. Sonnhammer E. Sollerbrant K. Philipson L. Gene Func. Dis. 2000; 2: 11-15Google Scholar). The two isoforms differ only in the extreme C terminus located in the intracellular tail of the protein.The cellular function for CAR is unknown, and no CAR-specific ligand has yet been identified. CAR might serve as a cell adhesion molecule and has been shown to mediate homophilic interaction with CAR molecules on neighboring cells (5Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K.

One report suggests that CAR might function as a tumor suppressor, because the level of CAR expression inversely correlated with tumorigenicity (7Okegawa T. Li Y. Pong R.C. Bergelson J.M. Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5031-5036PubMed Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, CAR is located at the basolateral surface and specifically concentrates at tight junctions where it colocalizes with the PDZ domain protein ZO-1 (6Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T.

A large variation in CAR expression between tissues has been reported (1Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although high levels of CAR are expressed in the developing brain, expression is very limited in the adult (5Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K. Kozakai I. Kobayashi K.

CAR expression is also down-regulated in skeletal muscle during maturation and in oropharyngeal epithelium during differentiation (10Nalbantoglu J. Pari G. Karpati G. Holland P.C. Hum.

Conditions such as differentiation of erythroid and myeloid cells, increased cell density of endothelial cells, and inflammation in heart muscle involve signals that up-regulate CAR levels in the adult, indicating that CAR expression is tightly regulated (12Rebel V.I.

Both CAR-1 and CAR-2 harbor in their respective C termini possible binding sites for PDZ domain-containing proteins (4Andersson B. Tomko R.P. Edwards K. Mirza M. Darban H. Öncü D. Sonnhammer E.

The PCR fragments were digested withEcoRI/SmaI and cloned into pGEX-2T in the corresponding sites.The sequence of all PCR primers can be found at www.licr.ki.se/. The relevant portions of all new plasmid constructs were sequenced to verify correct DNA sequences.Yeast Two-hybrid and cDNA Library ScreeningThe screen, transformation, and selection procedures were all performed according to instructions by the manufacturer (Clontech, Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system). Briefly, a pACT2 vector-based mouse 17-day embryo cDNA library was purchased from Clontech. The bait pGal4DBD—mCARic construct and the library were transformed sequentially into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech), and the transformation mixture was plated on medium-stringency selection plates that lacked amino acids His, Leu, and Trp. In total, 3 × 106clones were screened. Emerging colonies were replica-plated on high-stringency selection plates lacking the amino acids Ade, His, Leu, and Trp. A colony lift assay to test β-galactosidase expression was then performed. Rescue of library-derived plasmids was done in the bacterial strain KC8 (Clontech) that has a defect in leuB that can be complemented by yeast LEU2.Mammalian Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Transfection-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a CO2-humidified incubator. LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used for plasmid transfection of cells using conditions that were recommended by the manufacturer.Expression of GST Fusion ProteinsGST fusion constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-competent cells using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of purified GST fusion proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and visualized by staining with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (BioRad).Preparation of Mammalian Protein Extract, GST Pull-down Assay, and Western Blot293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of LNX plasmid in 10-cm petri dishes. 24 h later, proteins were extracted by incubating cells in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, EDTA-free 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche)) on ice for 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. 250 μl of supernatant was then diluted with 250 μl of lysis buffer and incubated with GST fusion protein in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 90 min. After several washes in lysis buffer, bound proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and transferred to Protean nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (standard phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (1× phosphate-buffered saline-T) and 5% dry milk) overnight at 4 °C, treated with an HA-specific polyclonal antibody (Clontech) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-T, incubated with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:4000 in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h, and washed again. Peroxidase activity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Transcription/TranslationThe TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) was used according to instructions. [35S]Met-labeled Wt p80 protein was prepared by adding mammalian pWt p80 directly to the reaction mix. To prepare labeled Wt p70, PCR amplification using mammalian pWt p70 as template was first done to introduce a T7 promoter. Primers were Nos. 131 and 89. For a description of the primers, see www.licr.ki.se. Labeled protein extract was diluted to 1 ml in lysis buffer (see above), and 500 μl was used in GST pull-down assays performed as described above.Production of a Polyclonal Antiserum toward CAR-1A peptide encompassing the last 13 amino acids of human CAR-1 (FKYPYKTDGITVV) was coupled to Imject Maleimide activated mcKLH carrier (Pierce) via a Cys residue added to the N terminus and used to immunize rabbits according to standard protocols. The resulting antiserum (RP194) cross-reacts with the mouse CAR-1 homologue.Indirect Immunofluorescence293 cells grown on 6-cm petri dishes were transfected with 0.25 μg of pBKCMVmCAR and/or 1.7 μg of LNX construct. Six hours post-transfection, cells were split and transferred to coverslips in 6-well plates. At 24 h post-transfection, immunofluorescence on permeabilized cells was performed as described in Ref. 18Andersson A.M. Melin L. Bean A. Pettersson R.F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4717-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar except that the antibody incubation time was increased to 1 h. Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal CAR-1-specific RP194 (see above) and monoclonal clone HA-7 (Sigma), both diluted 1:500. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), both diluted 1:200. Stained proteins were analyzed in a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have identified LNX as a protein that binds to the intracellular tail of CAR-1. The interaction between CAR and LNX was shown both in vivo in yeast and in vitro, and the proteins were also shown to colocalize in mammalian cells. Binding did not appear to be confined to the consensus PDZ motif-binding region in the extreme C terminus of CAR-1 but was also found in upstream sequences common to both CAR splice variants. Although binding to C-terminal sequences appears to be the typical mode of interaction, PDZ domains can also interact with internal amino acid sequences within ligands (19Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Why a deletion of the last 13 amino acids of CAR-1 retained binding to LNX whereas a truncation of the last three did not is at present unclear but might be due to masking of the upstream binding site because of conformational changes in the CARΔTVV protein.LNX was originally isolated as a binding partner to Numb, a protein implicated in the control of cell fate decisions during development in Drosophila (16Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Knoblich J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Numb antagonizes the Notch signaling pathway, a process that is regulated through asymmetric cell division in which Numb and Notch segregate to different daughter cells (20Uemura T. Shepherd S. Ackerman L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1989; 58: 349-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 22Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Numb and Notch are both evolutionary conserved proteins. Homologues of the proteins responsible for asymmetric localization of Numb in Drosophila have not been found in the mammalian system, and the mechanism for this process in mammals therefore remains unknown. Efficient binding between LNX and Numb requires the NPAY sequence motif as well as the first PDZ domain in LNX. We demonstrate that CAR interacts with the second PDZ domain of LNX. Because CAR and Numb interact with different domains of LNX, the possibility exists that these three proteins are present in the same multi-protein complex. This raises the possibility that one function of CAR is to regulate the localization of LNX and Numb to specific sites at the plasma membrane. It is interesting to note that LNX2 interacts with Numb and that expression of Numb and LNX/LNX2 were found to overlap in the developing and adult mouse brain (23Rice D.S. Northcutt G.M. Kurschner C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 18: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fact that CAR also interacts with both LNX family members and that CAR is expressed at high levels in the developing mouse brain further strengthens the idea that CAR, LNX, and Numb might form a functional complex. We have so far been unsuccessful in co-precipitating endogenous CAR and LNX. More work is thus needed to unequivocally demonstrate such an interaction in cultured cells or tissues.LNXp80 was shown to regulate the levels of Numb by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets Numb for ubiquitin-dependent degradation via the proteasome (24Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The E3 ligase activity is confined to the RING finger domain of p80. The other isoform of LNX, p70, does not harbor a RING finger domain, suggesting that this protein has a different function. Whether CAR is also a substrate for LNX-mediated ubiquitylation, or alternatively if the ubiquitylation activity of LNX is regulated by CAR is currently being investigated.CAR is localized all over the plasma membrane but concentrates at intercellular contacts when cells starts to reach confluence (Ref. 6Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholarand this study). In polarized epithelial cells, CAR was found to be expressed at tight junctions where it contributed to barrier function. CAR was also found to bind directly or indirectly to ZO-1, a PDZ motif-containing protein previously shown to be a component of tight junctions (6Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Thus CAR interacts with two PDZ motif-containing proteins, LNX and ZO-I, a feature which is not uncommon to plasma membrane receptors (25Bezprozvanny I. Maximov A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whether the two PDZ proteins interact with distinct isoforms of CAR has not been investigated. Binding to LNX and ZO-1 might mediate different functions in different cell types, or the interactions might be differentially regulated if present in the same cell. The interaction between a PDZ domain and its ligand has in some cases been reported to be regulated by phosphorylation at position −2 in the C terminus of the ligand and in other cases by extracellular signals to a transmembrane ligand (19Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).The multi-domain structure of PDZ-containing proteins such as LNX enables them to act as scaffolding proteins interacting with multiple targets simultaneously. Elucidation of the composition and intracellular localization of possible LNX multiprotein complexes will shed light upon the biological function of CAR in vivo. For more than a decade, adenovirus has been used as vector to transfer genes of interest into several tissues in both animals and humans. It was long thought that adenovirus-based vectors could transfer genes promiscuously into almost all tissues and cell types. This optimistic view has, however, been revised; several obstacles for efficient gene transfer, including inaccessibility or complete lack of the primary virus receptor on certain cell types, have been identified. A more detailed investigation regarding the presence, regulation, and normal cellular function of the virus receptor in different tissues is therefore a prerequisite for efficient gene transfers. The primary virus receptor was cloned in 1997 (1Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3352-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). The same receptor is shared between two distinct virus groups, Coxsackie B and adenoviruses, and it has therefore been named CVADR (Coxsackie Virus and ADenovirus Receptor) or CAR.1 CAR is a member of the CTX subfamily of the large Ig superfamily characterized by one V-type and one C-type immunoglobulin domain in the extracellular domain, one membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular tail of varying length (for a review on CAR, see Ref. 3Philipson L. Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Because of differential splicing, CAR is expressed as at least two isoforms, here termed CAR-1 and CAR-2 (4Andersson B. Tomko R.P. Edwards K. Mirza M. Darban H. Öncü D. Sonnhammer E. Sollerbrant K. Philipson L. Gene Func. Dis. 2000; 2: 11-15Google Scholar). The two isoforms differ only in the extreme C terminus located in the intracellular tail of the protein. The cellular function for CAR is unknown, and no CAR-specific ligand has yet been identified. CAR might serve as a cell adhesion molecule and has been shown to mediate homophilic interaction with CAR molecules on neighboring cells (5Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K. Kozakai I. Kobayashi K. Kumanishi T. Watanabe Y.G. Odani S. Kuwano R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 6Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). One report suggests that CAR might function as a tumor suppressor, because the level of CAR expression inversely correlated with tumorigenicity (7Okegawa T. Li Y. Pong R.C. Bergelson J.M. Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5031-5036PubMed Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, CAR is located at the basolateral surface and specifically concentrates at tight junctions where it colocalizes with the PDZ domain protein ZO-1 (6Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A large variation in CAR expression between tissues has been reported (1Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3352-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 8Tomko R.P. Johansson C.B. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Frisen J. Philipson L. Exp.

Poller W. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1520-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). CAR also seems to be developmentally regulated. Although high levels of CAR are expressed in the developing brain, expression is very limited in the adult (5Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K. Kozakai I. Kobayashi K. Kumanishi T. Watanabe Y.G. Odani S. Kuwano R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Tomko R.P. Johansson C.B. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Frisen J. Philipson L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CAR expression is also down-regulated in skeletal muscle during maturation and in oropharyngeal epithelium during differentiation (10Nalbantoglu J. Pari G. Karpati G. Holland P.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,11Hutchin M.E. Pickles R.J. Yarbrough W.G. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Conditions such as differentiation of erythroid and myeloid cells, increased cell density of endothelial cells, and inflammation in heart muscle involve signals that up-regulate CAR levels in the adult, indicating that CAR expression is tightly regulated (12Rebel V.I.

Neutrophil migration is stimulated by a gradient of these chemokines from blood toward the site of inflammation.

Smith J.B. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). High levels of myocardial neutrophil infiltration coincided with peak levels of LIX and MIP-2 expression. Neutralization of LIX, KC, and MIP-2 inhibited myeloperoxidase activity, a measure of neutrophil infiltration, by 79, 28, and 37%, respectively, indicating that LIX may be the predominant neutrophil chemoattractant in this model of reperfusion injury (10Chandrasekar B. Smith J.B. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proinflammatory cytokine expression preceded the chemokine expression in this model, suggesting that chemokine expression was a downstream effect of cytokine production (10Chandrasekar B. Smith J.B. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in in vitro studies where exposure of cardiomyocytes to TNF-α induced LIX expression via NF-κB activation (10Chandrasekar B. Smith J.B. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a ubiquitous, multisubunit, inducible transcription factor that regulates the expression of various genes involved in the immune and inflammatory processes (11Bowie A. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 12Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The p50/p65 heterodimer, which has been most studied, resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive state because of binding of p65 to an inhibitory subunit IκB. The IκB family, including IκB-α, IκB-β, IκB-γ, IκB-ε, all prevent activation and subsequent nuclear translocation of the heterodimer. Various stimuli including cytokines, growth factors, and oxidative stress induce IκB hyperphosphorylation leading to its selective degradation in the cytoplasm by the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome system, resulting in NF-κB activation (11Bowie A. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 12Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A multiprotein complex comprised of IKK (IκB kinase)-α, IKK-β, and a regulatory subunit IKK-γ/NEMO was shown to mediate phosphorylation of IκB by various cytokines (13Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W.

The cytokine-initiated signal transduction cascade leading to IκB phosphorylation has been shown to converge at activation of the IKK by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK associates with IKK-γ and activates the IKK signalsome. PI 3-kinase, PI-phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were implicated as upstream regulators of NIK and IKK. Furthermore, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a nuclear protein involved in DNA repair, has been shown to physically and functionally associate with NF-κB in the nucleus and modulate NF-κB-dependent cytokine gene transcription (18Ha H.C. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3270-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol.

The role of these various regulatory subunits in chemokine-mediated NF-κB activation and cytokine gene transcription has not been investigated. Whereas the agonistic effects of cytokines on chemokine expression are well described, very little is known about chemokine-mediated cytokine expression. In the present study we investigated the role of the ELR+ CXC chemokines, LIX, KC, and MIP-2, in NF-κB activation and induction of IL-1β and TNF-α expression. Furthermore, we explored the chemokine receptor usage and signal transduction pathway involved in chemokine-mediated NF-κB activation. Our results indicate that the ELR+ CXC chemokines activate NF-κB, induce proinflammatory cytokine expression, and signal through CXCR2, and presumably also through CXCR1. Recombinant mouse LIX, KC, and MIP-2 were obtained from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Recombinant carrier-free rat IL-1β and rat TNF-α were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The recombinant proteins contained <1 ng of endotoxin per μg of protein. Polyclonal antibodies against rat IL-1β and TNF-α were fromBIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA), and IκB-α, anti-p50 (sc-1114X), and anti-p65 (sc-372X) subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies, and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Phospho-IκB-α (Ser32) polyclonals, which detect only the phosphorylated form of IκB-α, and not the nonphosphorylated form, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Normal rabbit IgG (control IgG) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, and anti-HA antibodies were from Sigma, Roche Applied Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN), and Covance Inc. (Princeton, NJ), respectively. All tissue culture supplies were from Invitrogen. Radiochemicals ([α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]UTP) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. SB 447232 (N-[2-hydroxy-3-(N“-isoxazolidinyl sulfonamide)-4-chlorophenyl)-N′-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)urea) was synthesized in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at GlaxoSmithKline (King of Prussia, PA). Wortmannin, LY 294002, chelerythrine chloride, MG-132, 3-aminobenzamide, and pertussis toxin were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Nontransformed rat cardiac-derived endothelial cells (rat CDEC; a generous gift of C. A. Diglio; Ref. 20Diglio C.A. Grammas P. Giacomelli F. Wiener J. Tissue Cell. 1988; 20: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and nontransformed mouse cardiac-derived endothelial cells, described previously (21Marelli-Berg F.M. Peek E. Lidington E.A. Stauss H.J. Lechler R.I. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 244: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), were cultured in medium 199 with 10% fetal calf serum, endothelium growth supplement (30 mg/liter), heparin (100 mg/liter), penicillin (100,000 units/liter), and streptomycin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. At 70–80% confluency, the media was replaced with serum-free medium 199 containing 0.5% BSA. After overnight culture, LIX, KC, MIP-2, or PBS was added and incubated for the indicated time periods. To inhibit NF-κB DNA binding activity, the cells were pretreated for 1 h with 3-aminobenzamide (10 mm in ethanol), wortmannin (50 nm), LY 294002 (20 μm), chelerythrine chloride (60 μm), and MG-132 (5 μm) in Me2SO, pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) in PBS or for 4 h with IL-10 (10 ng/ml) or corresponding vehicle before the addition of LIX. The NF-κB driven luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-Luc) was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and contains five copies of NF-κB consensus sequence linked to the minimal E1B promoter-luciferase reporter gene. pEGFP-Luc was used as a control. The phosphorylation-deficient S32A/S36A mutant of IκB-α (pCMX-IκB-α(S32A/S36A)) was a gift from Inder Verma (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), and the Myc-tagged phosphorylation-deficient S19A/S32A mutant of IκB-β in pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene) has been described earlier (22Dulin N.O. Niu J. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20827-20830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Kinase-deficient NIK (pRK7-NIK(KK429–430AA)-Flag), IKK-β (pRK5-IKK-β-Flag), and dominant negative IKK-γ (pcDNA3-IKK-γ-HA) were obtained from David V. Goeddel (Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA), Tom Maniatis (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), and Gabriel Nunez (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. Rat CDEC were plated on six-well tissue culture dishes and transfected the following day at ∼70–80% confluency using LipofectAMINE 2000TM(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. pRLRenilla-luciferase reporter gene (100 ng; pRL-TK vector;Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control. The empty vectors pCMX, pCMV-Tag3B, pRK5, pRK7, and pcDNA3 were used as controls. Data were normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity with that of correspondingRenilla luciferase, and expressed as mean relative stimulation ± S.E. for a representative experiment from three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. The amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (2 μg) in all transfection experiments. After transfection, the cells were found to be viable (trypan blue dye exclusion). 24 h after transfection, the media was changed, and the cells were exposed to LIX, KC, or MIP-2 at the indicated concentrations and for the specified time periods. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined with a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using the PromegaBiotechTM dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Transfection efficiency was determined by transfecting rat CDEC with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) that constitutively expresses the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the regulation of CMV promoter and enhancer. Once the cells reached ∼70% confluency, the media was replaced with M199 + 0.5% BSA. After overnight culture, cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1 and LipofectAMINE 2000. 24 h later, the cells were trypsinized, seeded onto Lab-Tek II chamber slide (NuncTM), and cultured for an additional 48 h. Cells were then washed in PBS (pH 7.4), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, coverslips were mounted using ProLongTMAntifade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After the mounting media was dried, the coverslips were sealed with black nail polish, and stored at 4 °C in the dark. The cells were visualized by a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200, Nikon Inc., Melville, MA), and 1,000 cells were counted under ×20 objective, and bright to very-bright green fluorescent cells were considered positive for the expression of EGFP, and the others as nontransfected (controls). The transfection efficiency varied between 37 and 46% with an average of 38.1 ± 2.9%. To determine the role of CXC receptors in LIX-mediated NF-κB activation, rat and mouse CDEC were treated with SB447232 (GlaxoSmithKline Beecham), a specific CXCR2 antagonist, for 10 min before the addition of LIX. To demonstrate expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using total RNA isolated from rat CDEC. The primers were designed based on published sequences for CXCR1 and CXCR2 in rats (23Nguyen D. Stangel M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 128: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Dunstan C.A. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Xia Y. Feng L. Harrison J.K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1997; 1326: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated with lysis buffer containing phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate (TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen). 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. Amplification of CXCR1 (183 bp) and CXCR2 (413 bp) cDNAs was performed using the following primers: CXCR1-sense, 5′-CAGGCTTCTCCAGCACACAAG-3; CXCR1-antisense, 5′-TTGGTCATTGGAACCCTCTTAC-3′; and CXCR2-sense, 5′-GCAAACCCTTCTACCGTAG-3; CXCR2-antisense, 5′-AGAAGTCCATGGCGAAATT-3′. Amplification was performed with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min with a final 7-min extension. The PCR products were electrophoresed at 100 volts on a Tris-acetate-EDTA, 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. NF-κB DNA binding activity was measured in the nuclear protein extracts by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described earlier (10Chandrasekar B. Smith J.B. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26Chandrasekar B. Mitchell D.H. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 1999; 99: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the gel supershift assay, the protein extract (10 μg) was preincubated for 40 min on ice with either anti-p50 or -p65 subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies (1 μg) or control IgG (1 μg) prior to the addition of 32P-labeled double stranded NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). Absence of protein extract, competition with 100-fold molar excess unlabeled consensus NF-κB, and mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) served as controls. Levels of Oct-1, a constitutively expressed transcription factor, were also measured by EMSA using Oct-1 consensus sequence (5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 20 μg of total RNA were resolved on a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. After prehybridization for 4 h, hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C for 16 h, followed by high stringency washing at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The cDNAs were amplified using total RNA isolated from rat CDEC and gene-specific primers (rat IL-1β, GenBankTM accession number NM_031512, 324-bp product, sense, 5′-CTCTGTGACTCGTGGGATGATGAC-3′ (bases 383–405) and antisense, 5′-TCTTCTTCTTTGGGTATTGTTTGG-3′ (bases 684–707); TNF-α, GenBankTM accession number AF329985, 295-bp product, sense, 5′-TACTGAACTTCGGGGTGATTGGTCC-3′ (bases 955–979) and antisense, 5′-CAGCCTTGTCCCTTGAAGAGAACC-3′ (bases 2161–2138). The PCR products were cloned into pCRTM2.1-TOPOTM vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands for confirmation. The probe for rat LIX (GenBankTM accession number U90448) was a 329-bp cDNA cloned into pCRTM2.1-TOPO vector from a reverse transcriptase-PCR product generated with primers: sense, 5′-GGTCCTGCTCGTCATTCA-3′ (bases 41 to 58) and antisense, 5′-CAGTGCAAGTGCATTCCGCT-3′ (bases 350 to 369). The cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) using random hexanucleotide primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Expression levels were normalized to 28 S rRNA expression. The 28 S rRNA probe (40 base single stranded oligonucleotide; Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (26Chandrasekar B. Mitchell D.H. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 1999; 99: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The murine IL-1β promoter (−4093 to +45) construct in pBluescript vector was a kind gift from Clifford J. Bellone (St. Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; Ref. 27Godambe S.A. Chaplin D.D. Takova T. Bellone C.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). This construct contains 4,093 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence that includes the first exon, first intron, and untranslated region of the second exon. This promoter construct has been demonstrated to confer a strong responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (27Godambe S.A. Chaplin D.D. Takova T. Bellone C.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Rat CDEC were transfected with 3 μg of either the IL-1β −4093 to +45-CAT (chloramphenical acetyltransferase) or a mock plasmid that contains CAT reporter gene alone (pFR-CAT; Stratagene). To compensate for variations in transfection, cells were cotransfected with a β-galactosidase reporter construct (pSV-β-galactosidase control vector, Promega) in which the SV40 early promoter and enhancer drives transcription of thelacZ gene, which encodes the β-galactosidase enzyme. 24 h later, the media was changed, and the cells were treated with LIX (100 ng/ml), neutralized LIX, or vehicle. Seven hours later the cells were processed for CAT levels using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and β-galactosidase levels by using the β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen) essentially as described by the manufacturers. Rat CDEC were transfected with pTNF−1080/+138, pTNF−85/+135, or empty vector (pGL3 basic). These murine TNF-α promoter reporter constructs were described earlier (28Singh I.S. Viscardi R.M. Kalvakolanu I. Calderwood S. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 1.1-kb TNF-α promoter construct (−1080/+138 nucleotides; relative to the transcription start site) contains 4 NF-κB response elements, and has been demonstrated to confer responsiveness to a variety of stimuli including lipopolysaccharide. Its deletion mutant construct (−85/+135) lacks all the four NF-κB response elements but contains only TATA box and Sp1 site, and responds poorly to lipopolysaccharide (28Singh I.S. Viscardi R.M. Kalvakolanu I. Calderwood S. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with pRK-Renilla to compensate for transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, the media was changed, and the cells were treated with LIX, neutralized LIX, or vehicle. Seven hours later the cells were processed for luciferase activity by the dual luciferase assay kit. Rat CDEC were cultured in M199 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. At 70–80% confluency, the complete medium was replaced with M199 + 0.5% BSA, and cultured for an additional 16 h. The cells were then treated with either LIX (100 ng/ml) or vehicle (control) for 4 h. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Sigma), a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, was then added. At the indicated time periods 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h), cells were harvested for total RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to quantitate IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA levels as described above. After treating rat CDEC with LIX (100 ng/ml) for 4 h in M199 medium containing 0.5% BSA, nuclei were isolated, counted in a hemocytometer, and resuspended (2 × 108/ml) in a storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 40% glycerol) as described in detail previously (29Clark R.A. Li S.L. Pearson D.W. Leidal K.G. Clark J.R. Denning G.M. Reddick R. Krause K.H. Valente A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32369-32378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nuclei were aliquoted and snap frozen in methanol/dry ice bath and stored in liquid N2 until further use. For labeling RNA, nuclei were thawed (100 μl), mixed with equal volumes of labeling mixture (200 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each of ATP, UTP, and CTP, 100 μm GTP) and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and 20 μl (4 μg) of RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega Corp.) was added and incubated for an additional 10 min. After digestion with proteinase K (60 μg in 20 μl) in a buffer containing 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm EDTA for 30 min at 42 °C, it was subjected to phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and chloroform extractions. The aqueous phase was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of carrier RNA (Escherichia coli transfer RNA, RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The pellet was dissolved in 80 μl of STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA), and the unincorporated label was removed using NucTrapTM probe purification columns (Stratagene), and the incorporated radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Equal amounts of plasmid vectors containing IL-1β, TNF-α, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GenBankTMaccession number M17701; 339-bp product, sense: 5′-TCCGCCCCTTCCGCTGATG-3′ (bases 388–406), antisense: 5′-CACGGAAGGCCATGCCAGTGA-3′ (bases 707–727)), or empty plasmid (pCRTM2.1-TOPOTM vector) were alkaline denatured, applied to nitrocellulose membranes using a slot-blot apparatus (HYBRI-SLOTTM MANIFOLD, Invitrogen). After fixing the DNA to the membranes by UV cross-linking, prehybridization was performed at 52 °C overnight, followed by hybridization for 3 days with ∼106 cpm/ml of labeled RNA. The filters were then washed three times for 10 min each in 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, two times in 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min each, and then treated with RNase A (10 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in 2× SSC. Finally the membranes were washed with 2× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min, and subjected to autoradiography, and the visualized bands were semiquantitated by densitometry. 30 μg of cell extract in RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF) from untreated (control) and treated CDEC were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (preimmune; DAKO) for 1 h at room temperature, drained, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20) containing normal goat serum, washed in TBST, and incubated further for 1 h with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After extensive washings with TBST, the membranes were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then washed, exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film, and the autoradiographic bands were semiquantified and normalized to β-actin levels (10Chandrasekar B. Smith J.B. Freeman G.L.

https://openalex.org/W1990752413,"Oxidants such as H2O2 play a role in the toxicity of certain DNA-damaging agents, a process that often involves the tumor suppressor p53. H2O2 is rapidly degraded by catalase, which protects cells against oxidant injury. To study the effect of catalase on apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents, HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus containing the cDNA of catalase (Ad-Cat). Forty-eight hours after infection, catalase protein and activity was increased 7–10-fold compared with control cells infected with Ad-LacZ. After treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C, control cells underwent apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner; however, overexpression of catalase inhibited this apoptosis. Basal levels as well as Vp16- or mitomycin C-stimulated levels of p53 and p21 protein were decreased in the catalase-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells; however, p53 mRNA levels were not decreased by catalase. There was no difference in p53 protein synthesis between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells. However, pulse-chase experiments indicated that p53 protein degradation was enhanced in the catalase-overexpressing cells. Proteasome inhibitors but not calpeptin prevented the catalase-mediated decrease of p53 content. Whereas Vp16 increased, catalase overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of p53. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid did not prevent the catalase-mediated down-regulation of p53 or phosphorylated p53. These results demonstrate that catalase protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents in association with decreasing p53 phosphorylation; the latter may lead to an acceleration in the degradation of p53 protein by the proteasome complex. This suggests that the level of catalase may play a critical role in cell-induced resistance to the effects of anti-cancer drugs which up-regulate p53. Oxidants such as H2O2 play a role in the toxicity of certain DNA-damaging agents, a process that often involves the tumor suppressor p53. H2O2 is rapidly degraded by catalase, which protects cells against oxidant injury. To study the effect of catalase on apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents, HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus containing the cDNA of catalase (Ad-Cat). Forty-eight hours after infection, catalase protein and activity was increased 7–10-fold compared with control cells infected with Ad-LacZ. After treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C, control cells underwent apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner; however, overexpression of catalase inhibited this apoptosis. Basal levels as well as Vp16- or mitomycin C-stimulated levels of p53 and p21 protein were decreased in the catalase-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells; however, p53 mRNA levels were not decreased by catalase. There was no difference in p53 protein synthesis between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells. However, pulse-chase experiments indicated that p53 protein degradation was enhanced in the catalase-overexpressing cells. Proteasome inhibitors but not calpeptin prevented the catalase-mediated decrease of p53 content. Whereas Vp16 increased, catalase overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of p53. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid did not prevent the catalase-mediated down-regulation of p53 or phosphorylated p53. These results demonstrate that catalase protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents in association with decreasing p53 phosphorylation; the latter may lead to an acceleration in the degradation of p53 protein by the proteasome complex. This suggests that the level of catalase may play a critical role in cell-induced resistance to the effects of anti-cancer drugs which up-regulate p53. Many chemotherapeutic drugs, including Vp16 and mitomycin C, induce cells to undergo apoptosis through damage of nuclear DNA. The activation of wild type p53, a major tumor suppressor protein, which is implicated in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis (1Levine A.J.

The increase in p53 levels after DNA damage results in large part from stabilization of the p53 protein against degradation, and accumulation of p53 occurs because of this increased protein stability in the presence of ongoing translation (4Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). Acute overexpression of wild type p53 mediated by adenovirus facilitates the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce death of cancer and normal cells (5Blagosklonny M.V. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, p53 protein enhances the transcription rate of several genes including p21WAF1, GADD45, and 14-3-3ς, which are genes involved in cell cycle arrest (6el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Studies in a variety of cell types have suggested that ROS formation may be directly related to the ability of DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis (14Siitonen T. Alaruikka P. Mantymaa P.

Other studies indicate that ROS are downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis (15Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). p53 results in apoptosis through a multi-step process, including the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes, the generation of ROS, and the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, leading to apoptosis (15Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that ROS could regulate apoptosis as a signal transmitter or mediator (16Jabs T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 18Finkel T.

However, other studies indicate that apoptosis can be induced in the absence of any detectable oxidative stress when cells are treated with VP-16 and cisplatin (20Senturker S. Tschirret-Guth R. Morrow J. Levine R. Shacter E. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and oxidative stress can inhibit apoptosis in human lymphoma cells (21Lee Y.J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Catalase, an anti-oxidative enzyme, is able to degrade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is an important ROS related to p53 activation. Catalase has been shown to protect a variety of cells against oxidative stress-induced toxicity (22Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has utilized adenoviral catalase expression systems to study the ability of catalase to prevent CYP2E1-dependent, and ROS-dependent toxicity to HepG2 cells (23Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4315-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the current study, catalase adenovirus was used to infect HepG2 cells to study the effects of catalase on the regulation of apoptosis and the modulation of p53 expression induced by DNA-damaging agents. Propidium Iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against human catalase was obtained from Calbiochem, and antibodies raised in rabbit against p53, phosphorylated p53 on serine 20, p21, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG, MEM, 1The abbreviations used are: MEM, minimum essential medium; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pp53, phosphorylated p53; 2′7′-DCF-DA, 2′7′ dichlorofluorescin diacetate and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Sigma. HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mmglutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Ad-LacZ, a β-galactosidase-expressing replication-deficient adenovirus, and Ad-Cat, a human catalase-expressing replication-deficient adenovirus, were constructed as described previously (23Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4315-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Before infection, cells were seeded onto dishes or plates, grown to 60% confluence, and infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-Cat with 100 m.o.i. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were collected and assayed for catalase expression or treated with DNA-damaging agents. Cell Transfection—HepG2 cells were seeded onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown to 80% confluence. The expression plasmid vector pCMV-p53mt135 (Clontech), containing mutant p53 or empty vector pCMV-neo, were transfected into HepG2 cells using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. This mutant p53 expression vector encodes a mutant p53 protein that combines with wild type p53 protein in a dominant-negative manner and blocks the DNA binding domain on wild type p53, therefore inhibiting the activity of wild type p53. Cells were selected by MEM containing 1 mg/ml G418. Two weeks after transfection, the surviving clones were isolated and grown to large scale. Stable cell lines with overexpression of mutant p53 (HepG2-mtp53) as well as cells transfected with empty vector (HepG2-neo) were selected and maintained in MEM containing 1 mg/ml G418. Cell lysates were prepared by sonicating cells followed by centrifugation. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured (DC protein assay reagent, Bio-Rad), and ten μg of denatured protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human catalase polyclonal antibody (1:1000) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) (1:5000). Detection by the chemiluminescence reaction was carried out for 1 min using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Similar Western blots were carried out to detect P53, phosphorylated p53 (pp53), P21, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. To validate expression of functional catalase, catalase activity of fresh sonicated cell extracts was determined at 25 °C. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase was followed by ultraviolet spectroscopy at 240 nm. The reaction was performed using a solution of 20 mm hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, containing 10 μg of total cellular protein in a final volume of 1 ml. Specific activity of catalase was calculated from the equation: specific activity (units/mg of protein/min) = ΔA 240 nm (1 min) × 1000/43.6 × mg of protein. Fluorescence spectrophotometry was used to measure production of intracellular ROS with 2′,7′-DCF-DA as the probe as previously described (24Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were uninfected or infected with Ad-Cat or Ad-LacZ at 100 m.o.i. for 48 h with or without further treatment with 50 μm Vp16 for 16 h followed by incubation with 5 μm DCF-DA in MEM for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS, and the intensity of fluorescence was immediately read in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650–10S, Hitachi, Ltd.) at 503 nm for excitation and at 529 nm for emission. The DNA fragmentation pattern (DNA ladder) was carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cells (1 × 106) treated with various reagents were scraped and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.5% SDS and incubated for 2 h at 50 °C. DNA was extracted with 1 ml of phenol, pH 8.0, followed by extraction with 1 ml of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and chloroform. The aqueous phase was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at 20 °C overnight. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase A. DNA was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, electrophoresed in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer for 2 h at 50 V, and photographed under UV illumination. Flow cytometry DNA analysis was used to quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto six-well plates and incubated with various reagents. At different time points, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with PBS, followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 80% ethanol and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), and analyzed by flow cytometry DNA analysis as described previously (24Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were plated separately in 10% fetal bovine serum, MEM; after overnight incubation, cells were infected with Ad-Cat and Ad-LacZ adenovirus with 100 m.o.i. Forty-eight hours latter, 50 μm Vp16 was added, and the cells incubated for a further 16 h. The medium was replaced with methionine-cysteine-free MEM plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 50 μm Vp16, and the cells were incubated for 2 h, after which they were pulse-labeled with 150 μCi of EasyTagTM Expre35S35S Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 0.5, 2, and 4 h to study the rate of p53 synthesis. One set of samples was pulse-labeled for 2 h in the presence of 40 μm cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, as a control for the analysis of p53 synthesis. After the pulse period, cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at the indicated time points with 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 IgG as described below. To study the rate of p53 degradation, HepG2 cells were treated as above but pulse-labeled with the Expre35S35S mix for 4 h. The cells were then washed 3 times and chased with complete MEM supplemented with 300 μg/ml cold methionine. Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at chase times of 0, 2, and 4 h in the same lysis buffer. In all cases, p53 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit-anti-human p53 IgG-protein G-agarose as follows; 40 μl of cell lysate (100 μg of protein) was first incubated with 10 μl of preimmune rabbit serum for 15 min followed by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein G-agarose. After centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatant was incubated with anti-p53 IgG and shaking overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 30 μl of a suspension of protein G-agarose. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm, and the pellets were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer plus 2% SDS, and 3 times with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. p53 was eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer, and samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm to remove the protein G-agarose, resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, and dried. The radioactive signal was detected by exposure to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of RNA was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels and transferred onto GeneScreen nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA was UV-cross-linked at 1200 J × 100 for 30 s and prehybridized in a hybridization oven for 2 h at 42 °C in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate), 50% formamide, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), and 1× Denhardt's solution containing 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (specific activity >3000 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) using a random primer DNA labeling kit (AmershamBiosciences). Immobilized RNA was hybridized in 0.1% SDS, 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 12.5× dextran sulfate containing 106 cpm/ml labeled cDNA and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 16 h at 42 °C. Blots were washed 4 times for 15 min with 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. To examine the capacity of Ad-Cat to enhance the expression and activity of catalase in cells, HepG2 cells were infected with 100 m.o.i. of Ad-Cat or Ad-LacZ. By 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assay it was determined that more than 98% of the HepG2 cells were infected with the adenovirus under these reaction conditions. 48 h later, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig. 1 A shows the expression of catalase in the total cell extract from these cells. Results from densitometric analyses of the intensity of the various bands indicated that the expression of catalase in total cell extracts of cells infected with Ad-Cat was 7–10-fold higher than that in uninfected HepG2 cells or HepG2 cells infected with Ad-LacZ. Similar results were obtained by measuring catalase activity (Fig. 1 B). In total cellular extracts of HepG2 cells infected with Ad-Cat, catalase activity was 7–10-fold higher than that in uninfected HepG2 cells or HepG2 cells infected with Ad-LacZ. We evaluated ROS generation by measuring dichlorofluorescein fluorescence after loading the cells with 5 μm DCF-DA. It is recognized that dihydrochlorofluorescin may be oxidized by several oxidants including H2O2, superoxide radical, lipid hydroperoxides, lipid peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals, and by cellular peroxidases (25Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Bilski P. Belanger A.G. Chignell C.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 938-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and is not specific for e.g.H2O2 but serves as a general index for ROS production. In the absence of VP16, control fluorescence was 150 arbitrary units (Fig. 2). Infection with Ad-LacZ had no effect on DCF production, but infection with Ad-Cat decreased fluorescence by about 45%. The addition of 50 μm VP16 increased DCF production by about 60%. Ad-LacZ again had no effect, whereas Ad-Cat decreased fluorescence by about 40%. Thus, VP16 increased production of ROS by HepG2 cells, and catalase decreased the basal as well as the VP16-stimulated ROS generation. HepG2 cells were plated separately in 10% fetal bovine serum, MEM; after overnight incubation, cells were infected with Ad-Cat and Ad-LacZ adenovirus with 100 m.o.i. Forty-eight hours later, 500 μm Vp16 or 10 μg/ml mitomycin C were added, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. DNA fragmentation and DNA analysis by flow cytometry as well as cellular morphology changes were carried out as described under “Material and Methods.” Fig. 3 A shows the results of DNA fragmentation. No DNA ladder was seen in either Ad-LacZ (lane 2)- or Ad-Cat (lane 3)-infected HepG2 cells without any treatment. When treated with Vp16 (lanes 4 and 5) or mitomycin C (lanes 6 and 7), HepG2 cells infected with Ad-LacZ showed a clear DNA ladder (lanes 4 and6), whereas only a very weak DNA ladder was seen in HepG2 cells infected with Ad-Cat (lanes 5 and 7). DNA analysis by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide was used to measure the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3 B). After 48 h infection with either Ad-LacZ or Ad-Cat, the percentage of apoptotic cells was less than 3% in the absence of any treatment with DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 3 B, panels a andb). The percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 25 and 21% after 24 h of treatment with 500 μm Vp16 or 10 μg/ml mitomycin C, respectively (Fig. 3 B, panels c and e). The HepG2 cells infected with Ad-Cat were resistant to 500 μm Vp16 or to 10 μg/ml mitomycin C-induced apoptosis, displaying only 5 and 7% apoptotic cells, respectively (Fig. 3 B, panels d andf). Similar results were observed when studying morphologic changes (Fig. 3 C). Cells infected with Ad-LacZ lost normal morphology when treated with 500 μm Vp16 or 10 μg/ml mitomycin C for 24 h, becoming round in shape and shrinking in size (panels c and e), whereas most of the cells infected with Ad-Cat retained their shape and structure (panels d and f). We investigated the expression of selected proteins related to apoptosis in cells infected with Ad-LacZ and Ad-Cat for 48 h with or without further treatment with 50 μm Vp16 or 5 μg/ml mitomycin C for 16 h. The basal level of p53 was low in HepG2 cells, most likely due to the short half-life of wild type p53. This basal level of p53 was even lower in cells infected with Ad-Cat than in cells infected with Ad-LacZ (Fig. 4, panel a). After treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C, the p53 protein level was dramatically increased in cells infected with Ad-LacZ but only slightly increased in the cells infected with Ad-Cat. Because p21 is one of the downstream genes of p53, which is induced by activation of p53, p21 protein level was also detected by Western blot. Coincident with p53, the p21 protein level was dramatically increased in cells infected with Ad-LacZ after treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C (Fig. 4, panel b). Infection with catalase adenovirus lowered the basal as well as the stimulated levels of p21, analogous to results with p53 levels. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are two anti-apoptotic genes. The expression of these proteins was not different between Ad-LacZ and Ad-Cat infection with or without treatment by Vp16 or mitomycin C (Fig. 4, panels c and d). To evaluate whether catalase protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents through down-regulation of p53 protein, it was important to first demonstrate that p53 was required for the developing apoptosis. HepG2-mtp53 and HepG2-neo cell lines were set up by stable transfection of HepG2 cells with the expression plasmid vector containing mutant p53 or empty vector. This mutant p53 expression vector encodes a mutant p53 protein, which combines with wild type p53 protein in a dominant-negative manner and blocks the DNA binding domain on wild type p53, therefore inhibiting the activity of wild type p53. After treatment with different concentrations (50, 250, and 500 μm) of Vp16 for 24 h, HepG2 cells transfected with the empty vector (HepG2-neo) underwent DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5). However, no or very weak DNA fragmentation was observed in HepG2 cells transfected with the mutant p53 expression vector (HepG2-mtp53), even at the maximum concentration of Vp16 (500 μm) studied (Fig. 5). These results indicate that p53 is necessary for the Vp16-induced apoptosis in the HepG2 cells and suggest that one mechanism by which catalase protects against this apoptosis is to lower the intracellular levels of p53. The catalase down-regulation of the expression of p53 protein under basal conditions or after treatment with DNA-damaging agents could be due to an effect on p53 transcription or translation or protein degradation. HepG2 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ and Ad-Cat for 48 h with or without further treatment by 50 μm Vp16 for 16 h. RNA was isolated, and a Northern blot was performed using [32P]dCTP-labeled p53 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes. There was no significant difference in p53 mRNA levels between cells infected with Ad-LacZ and Ad-Cat either under basal conditions or after treatment with Vp16 (Fig. 6). Vp16 treatment, which dramatically elevated p53 protein levels (Fig. 4), did not have any effect on p53 mRNA levels (Fig. 6). This result indicates that overexpression of catalase does not decrease transcription of the p53 gene into mRNA; therefore, changes in mRNA are not responsible for the inhibitory effect of catalase on the level of p53 protein. Two other possibilities that might relate to the inhibitory effect of catalase on the level of p53 protein were considered, which are that catalase inhibits p53 protein synthesis or catalase increases the degradation of p53 protein. Pulse-labeling and pulse-chase assays were performed to investigate these possibilities. HepG2 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ and Ad-Cat for 48 h and then treated with 50 μm Vp16 for 16 h followed by pulsing with35S-labeled methionine for 0.5, 2, and 4 h. p53 protein was immunoprecipitated, and the incorporated label was quantified by SDS-PAGE and recorded on x-ray film. The intensity of the p53 signal increased after 2 h of pulsing as compared with 0.5 h (Fig. 7 A). To validate the assay, the effect of cycloheximide was determined; p53 synthesis was inhibited by adding 40 μm cycloheximide. There was no decrease in the p53 signal intensity in cells infected with Ad-Cat compared with cells infected with Ad-LacZ at any time point (Fig. 7 A). This indicates that overexpression of catalase does not change the rate of p53 protein synthesis. To determine the rate of p53 protein degradation, pulse-chase was performed by adding cold methionine for 0, 2, and 4 h after a 4-h pulse with 35S-labeled methionine. Compared with cells infected with Ad-LacZ, the p53 signal in cells infected with Ad-Cat was considerably lower after the 2- and 4-h chase (Fig. 7 B; quantification in Fig. 7 C). This indicates that the rate of p53 degradation was potentiated by overexpression of catalase. In the presence of Vp16, p53 levels were maintained over the 4-h chase period in the Ad-LacZ-infected HepG2 cells. The proteasome complex plays an important role in the turnover of p53; therefore, the effect of proteasome inhibitors such as 5 μm lactacystin or 10 μm MG115 as well as the calpain inhibitor calpeptin on p53 protein levels in cells infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-Cat was determined (Fig. 8). The administration of lactacystin or MG115 increased the p53 protein level 3–4-fold in Ad-LacZ-infected cells not treated with Vp16. This likely reflects the prevention of p53 degradation. The elevated level of p53 in the Vp16-treated cells was not further increased by lactacystin or MG115, which may reflect that both treatments result in decreasing p53 turnover (further described below, Fig. 9). Calpeptin did not affect the basal level of p53 or the Vp16-stimulated levels in the Ad-LacZ-infected cells (Fig. 8). In the Vp16-treated cells, catalase lowered p53 levels by 50–60% in the control or calpeptin-treated cells but only 20–25% in the lactacystin- or MG115-treated cells. Thus, the lowering of p53 levels by catalase was partially prevented or diminished by administration of proteasome inhibitors but not by calpeptin. B"

Alternatively, these proteins form soluble complexes with GDI proteins. To assess how this membrane partitioning influences the activation of Rac by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GDP-to-GTP exchange reactions were performed in the presence of liposomes using different forms of Rac-GDP. We show that both non-prenylated Rac-GDP and the soluble complex between prenylated Rac-GDP and GDI are poorly activated by the Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domain of the exchange factor Tiam1, whereas prenylated Rac-GDP bound to liposomes is activated about 10 times more rapidly. Sedimentation experiments with liposomes reveal that the DH-PH region of Tiam1 forms, with nucleotide-free prenylated Rac, a membrane-bound complex from which GDI is excluded. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the dissociation of Rac-GDP from GDI and its translocation to membrane lipids favor DH-PH-catalyzed nucleotide exchange because the steric hindrance caused by GDI is relieved and because the membrane environment favors functional interaction between the DH-PH domain and the small G protein.

Small G proteins of the Rho family, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42p, undergo two interdependent cycles. First, they cycle between inactive (GDP) and active (GTP) conformations through the catalytic action of guanine exchange factors (GEF) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine exchange factor; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate and GTPase-activating proteins. Second, they cycle between cytosolic and membrane-associated forms through the action of GDI proteins (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Olofsson B. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). How these two cycles are coupled is critical for the proper interaction of Rho proteins with their targets. It is generally assumed that Rho proteins must be in the GTP conformation and associated to membranes to trigger a cellular response. Dbl homology (DH) domains catalyze the exchange of guanine nucleotides on small G proteins of the Rho family (4Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The DH domain is an all-α-helix fold that is systematically followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH-PH tandem is thus the hallmark of Rho GEFs, which otherwise display variable domain composition and organization. Recent structural and mutagenesis studies on DH-PH domains, either isolated or in complex with Rho proteins, have given insights into the mechanism by which these domains promote the release of the bound nucleotide (6Aghazadeh B.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). One of the best-studied examples is Tiam, a GEF for Rac. The DH domain of Tiam makes extensive contacts with the switch I and II regions of Rac and modifies the magnesium, sugar, and guanine base-binding regions to destabilize the bound nucleotide (9Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition, structure-based mutagenesis studies show that the specificity between functional GEF/Rho pairs relies on a few residues at the DH/switch II interface (11Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M.

Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding to switch I and II regions is a general property of GEFs for small G proteins (14Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Despite these spectacular progresses, one aspect of the activation of Rho proteins by DH domains remains obscure: how does the nucleotide exchange reaction accommodate with the interaction of Rho proteins with membrane lipids or with GDI proteins? Rho proteins contain a geranyl-geranyl group at their C termini. This C20 branched isoprene has a high lipid/water partition coefficient and anchors Rho proteins on lipid membranes (15Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GDI proteins solubilize Rho proteins in the cytosol by shielding the geranyl-geranyl group from the solvent (2Olofsson B. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 16Hori Y. Kikuchi A. Isomura M. Katayama M. Miura Y. Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y.

Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The GDI/Rho interaction is based on two contacts: the isoprene group inserts into a deep pocket made by the immunoglobulin-like β sandwich of GDI and the switch I and II regions of Rho interact with the regulatory arm of GDI, a small helix-loop-helix motif (18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The latter interaction makes the Rho/GDI interaction partially dependent on the conformation of Rho. Thus GDI interacts preferentially with the GDP-bound form of Rho proteins (19Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although equal interactions with the GDP- and GTP-bound forms have been reported in some cases (20Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Beliveau R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Consequently, Rac-GDP is generally found in complex with GDI in the cytosol, whereas Rac-GTP is preferentially associated with membranes (2Olofsson B. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the structure of nucleotide-free Rac in complex with the DH-PH region of Tiam1 and that of prenylated Cdc42-GDP in complex with GDI show a strong overlap of the interacting regions, particularly at the level of the switch I and II regions (9Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the two interactions are mutually exclusive and consequently that Rho-GDP must be released from GDI before being activated by the DH-PH module. However, given the bipartite nature of the Rho/GDI interface, the formation at early stages of the exchange reaction of a ternary complex, where GDI interacts only with the prenyl group of Rho, leaving the switch regions accessible for the exchange factor, cannot be excluded. Schematically, two opposite models have been proposed for GEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on Rho proteins coupled to membrane translocation (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Olofsson B. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). In the first model, the GEF acts on the cytosolic complex between Rho-GDP and GDI. After nucleotide exchange, Rac-GTP translocates to membranes. In the second model, membrane translocation precedes GEF action: Rac-GDP dissociates from GDI and translocates to membranes; then GEF promotes GDP-to-GTP exchange on membrane-bound Rac. As a first step toward understanding the sequence of events that, from soluble GDI-RacGDP complex, leads to membrane bound Rac-GTP, we have studied the catalysis of nucleotide exchange on geranyl-geranylated Rac by the DH-PH region of Tiam1 in the presence of GDI and liposomes. Our results demonstrate that dissociation of GDI and membrane translocation is a prerequisite for the efficient activation of Rac by a DH-PH domain. Constructions of Human Rac1 with an N-terminal His6 tag and RhoGDI-1 with an N-terminal FLAG cloned in the yeast 2μ shuttle vector YEpPGAL were a gift from R. Nakamoto (23Read P.W. Nakamoto R.K.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These constructs were transformed in S. cerevisiae SY1 strain (MATa, ura3-52, leu2-3,112,his4-619,sec6-4,GAL) and selected for leucine/uracil independence. Transformed yeast cells were grown in a 5-liter fermenter. After cell wall lysis and fractionation, the Rac1-RhoGDI complex was purified from the cytosol as described for the RhoA-GDI complex using two sequential affinity chromatography assays on a TALON metal affinity resin column (Clontech) and an M2-anti-FLAG antibody column (Sigma Chemical) (23Read P.W. Nakamoto R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 15-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Read P.W. Liu X. Longenecker K. Dipierro C.G. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Nakamoto R.K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). About 100 μg of Rac1-RhoGDI complex (95% purity) was obtained from one fermenter. The Rac-GDP-GDI complex was stored at −80 °C in 25 mmTris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 2 μm GDP. Full-length human Rac1 was cloned in a PGEX-T vector. The pProEX-Hta vector containing the DH-PH fragment of mouse Tiam1 (residues 1033–1406) was provided by J. Sondek (9Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). GST-Rac1 and His6-Tiam1 fragment were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) or Ni2+-agarose beads (QIAGEN) respectively according to the manufacturer procedures. GST from the Rac chimera was removed by cleavage with thrombin. All constructs were sequence-proofed. The purity of proteins was assessed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was estimated by a protein assay (Bio-Rad). Large unilamellar liposomes made of unpurified soybean phospholipids (azolectin type IIS; Sigma Chemical) were prepared by the reversed-phase method (25Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Azolectin (20 mg) was dissolved in 6 ml diethylether in a 100-ml round-bottomed flask. One milliliter of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 180 mm sucrose (iso-osmotic with 100 mm NaCl)) was added and the two-phase mixture was sonicated at 4 °C for 1–2 min in a bath sonicator to make an emulsion. The solvent was slowly evaporated in a rotary evaporator (100 rpm) under moderate vacuum at 20–25 °C. After 45 min, the liposome suspension was collected in an Eppendorf tube and was further incubated in a vacuum chamber for 15 min to eliminate traces of ether and completed up to 1 ml with buffer A. The liposome suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. Liposomes were extruded before use through 0.4-μm pore-size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). The suspension was diluted five times in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl) to dilute the external sucrose solution. The liposomes were collected by centrifugation in a TL100 Beckman centrifuge at 400,000 × g, 18 °C, for 25 min and resuspended in buffer B. Prenylated Rac-GDP in complex with GDI was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with sucrose-loaded azolectin liposomes in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol (buffer C) in a final volume of 80 μl. Nucleotides (50 μm final of GDP-Mg or GTPγS-Mg) were added as indicated. When indicated, magnesium was chelated by the addition of 2 mm EDTA (1 μm free Mg2+) and alkaline phosphatase (Sigma; final concentration, 180 units/ml) was added to hydrolyze guanine nucleotides. After incubation, vesicles were recovered by centrifugation at 400,000 × g, 24 °C, for 25 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer, and the amount of prenylated Rac and Tiam1 in the pellet and in the supernatant was determined by densitometry after protein separation by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The RacGDP-GDI complex (1.0 μm) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with azolectin liposomes (5 mg/ml) in buffer C supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 50 μm GTP. Liposomes and bound proteins were collected by centrifugation (400,000 × g, 25 min, 18 °C) and washed one time by resuspension/centrifugation in buffer C. The final liposome suspension containing liposome-translocated RacGTP was incubated for 30 min at room temperature to promote GTP hydrolysis. The binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rac was measured as described by Francoet al. (26Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) for Arf1. Briefly, the Rac1-GDP-GDI complex was incubated at 30 °C with [35S]GTPγS (20 μm, 2000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of azolectin liposomes (0 to 3 mg/ml) in buffer C. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were removed, diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold buffer (buffer D; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2), and filtered on nitrocellulose filter discs (Schleicher & Schüll). Filters discs were washed twice with 2 ml of buffer D, dried, and counted. The same protocol was used to measure the binding of [35S]GTPγS on Rac-GDP bound to liposomes and on unprenylated Rac in solution or in the presence of liposomes. Unprenylated Rac-GDP (0.8 μm) or prenylated RacGTP bound to liposomes (see the GDI removal protocol) was incubated at room temperature for 15 min in buffer C with 2 mm EDTA (1 μm free MgCl2) and with [γ-32P]GTP (10 μm). The GTPase reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mmMgCl2 (1 mm free MgCl2). At the indicated times, 20 μl were removed, diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold buffer D, and counted on nitrocellulose filter as described for nucleotide binding. We purified recombinant geranylgeranylated Rac-GDP from yeast cells as a stoichiometric complex with RhoGDI-1 (GDI) according to the protocol developped by Read et al.(23Read P.W. Nakamoto R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 15-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Read P.W. Liu X. Longenecker K. Dipierro C.G. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Nakamoto R.K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for the complex between RhoA-GDP and GDI (Fig. 1). We first assessed the ability of Rac-GDP, initially associated with GDI, to interact with membrane lipids and undergo GDP to GTP exchange. To this end, we incubated the complex between Rac-GDP and GDI with radiolabeled GTPγS and with liposomes made from soybean lipids (azolectin). Because GDI strongly inhibits the spontaneous release of GDP from Rho proteins, incubations were performed at low Mg2+ concentration (1 μm) to accelerate nucleotide exchange. At the end of the incubation, the concentration of free Mg2+ was set back at 1 mm. The binding of GTPγS to Rac was determined by a filtration assay, and the membrane partitioning of Rac and GDI was determined by separating the soluble proteins and the liposome-bound proteins by centrifugation. Fig. 2 B shows that the extent of GTPγS binding on Rac strongly increased with the liposome concentration. Notably, no detectable binding of GTPγS was observed in the absence of membrane lipids (Fig. 2 B, open circles). Fig. 2 A shows that in all incubations with GTPγS GDI remained essentially soluble, whereas the amount of membrane-bound Rac increased with liposome concentration. In contrast, in the presence of GDP, Rac remained essentially soluble as a complex with GDI. However, a fraction of Rac-GDP bound to liposomes could be observed at high liposome concentration (> 1 mg/ml) (Fig. 2 A). Note a slight contamination of the pellet by soluble GDI at increasing liposome concentration caused by the increase in the volume of the pellet. A slight contamination of the pellet with soluble Rac could also have occurred but this could not account for the full Rac signal in the pellet. These experiments show that one can reconstitute on liposomes the GTP-dependent translocation of Rac to membrane lipids starting from a soluble Rac-GDP-GDI complex.Figure 2GTP-dependent translocation of prenylated Rac from GDI to liposomes. A, prenylated Rac-GDP in complex with GDI (0.8 μm) was incubated with sucrose-loaded azolectin liposomes (from 0.2 to 3 mg/ml) at 30 °C with 50 μm GTPγS at 1 μm free Mg2+ (2 mm EDTA) or with 50 μmGDP at 1 mm free Mg2+. After incubation, 2 mm MgCl2 was added back in the samples with GTPγS to get 1 mm free Mg2+. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant (S) and the liposome pellet (P) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. B, time course of GTPγS binding at 30 °C on incubations containing 0.2 μm Rac-GDP-GDI complex, 20 μm[35S]GTPγS, 1 μm free Mg2+and 0 (open circles), 0.05 (filled circles), 0.2 (filled squares), or 3 mg/ml (filled triangles) azolectin vesicles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we studied the influence of liposomes on the kinetics of Tiam1-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on Rac-GDP, initially in complex with GDI, at physiological (1 mm) Mg2+ concentration. We did not observe any significant GDP-to-GTPγS exchange when the complex was incubated in the absence of liposomes with or without Tiam (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, in the presence of azolectin liposomes, both spontaneous and Tiam-catalyzed GDP-to-GTPγS exchange on Rac could be detected (Fig. 3, Band C). Interestingly, increasing liposome concentration had two effects: it accelerated the initial rate of the reaction and increased the amount of Rac-GTP that formed at equilibrium. The second effect resembles that observed at low magnesium concentrations in the absence of Tiam (see Fig. 2 B) and may reflect the opposite mass action effects of liposomes and GDI on the balance between the GTP- and the GDP-bound forms of Rac. More surprising is the effect of liposome concentration on the initial rate of GTPγS binding. Insofar as only Rac-GDP was present initially, an increase in the initial rate of GTPγS binding must reflect a positive effect of liposomes on the ability of Rac-GDP to undergo spontaneous or Tiam-catalyzed nucleotide exchange. At first glance, this does not seem compatible with the fact that Rac-GDP is essentially soluble and in complex with GDI. However, because sedimentation experiments revealed that a small amount of Rac, bound to liposomes and devoid of GDI, could be detected in incubations conducted in the presence of GDP (Fig. 2 A), we suspected that this fraction of Rac could be a better substrate for Tiam-catalyzed nucleotide exchange than Rac-GDP in complex with GDI. We reasoned that if Rac-GDP bound to liposome was more readily activated by Tiam than soluble Rac-GDP in complex with GDI, one should change dramatically the kinetics of GDP-to-GTPγS exchange by modifying the partitioning of Rac-GDP between the soluble complex with GDI and the liposome-bound form. To get rid of GDI and obtain Rac-GDP bound to liposomes, we devised a three-stage protocol based on a single round of Rac-GTP translocation to liposomes and GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 4 A). During stage 1, the Rac-GDP-GDI complex was incubated with liposomes and with GTP and EDTA to promote the formation of membrane bound Rac-GTP. Liposomes were then collected by centrifugation and washed to separate membrane bound Rac-GTP from soluble GDI and excess GTP. In a second stage, the lipid pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 1 mmMgCl2 and incubated at 30 °C to allow Rac to hydrolyze the bound GTP. Rac displays a fast intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity, and control experiments with [γ-32P]GTP showed that GTP in liposome-bound prenylated Rac was completely hydrolyzed within 30 min with a kinetics similar to that observed with the soluble unprenylated form of Rac (Fig. 4 B). In a third stage, the resulting liposome suspension containing membrane-bound Rac-GDP (Fig. 4 C) was assayed for nucleotide exchange with GTPγS with or without Tiam1 DH-PH (Fig. 5 B). The time course of GTPγS binding was compared with that observed on the initial mixture containing liposomes (1 mg/ml) and Rac-GDP in complex with GDI (Fig. 5 A). The GDI removal protocol dramatically potentiated the rate of GDP-to-GTPγS exchange on Rac, in both the absence and the presence of Tiam1 DH-PH. This effect was reversible because restoring purified GDI inhibited the nucleotide exchange reaction (data not shown). For each time-course experiment, the apparent rate constant of the exchange reaction was determined and plotted as a function of Tiam1 DH-PH concentration (Fig. 5 E). With GDI present, apparent rate constants in the range of 10−3 s−1 were observed. In the absence of GDI, the apparent rate constant of nucleotide exchange was about 1 order of magnitude higher than that observed for the Rac-GDP-GDI complex. Therefore, these experiments demonstrate that Tiam1 DH-PH acts preferentially, if not exclusively, on prenylated Rac-GDP dissociated from GDI and bound to membrane lipids.Figure 5Membrane translocation of prenylated Rac-GDP facilitates its activation by Tiam DH-PH. Comparison between prenylated Rac-GDP initially in complex with GDI (A), or prenylated Rac-GDP associated with azolectin liposomes (B), or unprenylated Rac-GDP in solution (C) for Tiam1 DH-PH-catalyzed GDP-to-GTPγS exchange. All experiments were performed at 1 mm free Mg2+ with 20 μm[35S]GTPγS and with 0 (open circles), 0.04 (inverted filled triangles), 0.08 (filled triangles), 0.2 (filled diamonds), 1 (filled squares), 3 (filled circles), or 4 μm (×) Tiam1 DH-PH.A, the experiments were performed with 0.2 μmRac-GDP-GDI complex in the presence of 1 mg/ml azolectin liposomes.B, the experiments were performed with prenylated Rac-GDP (estimated at 0.1 μm) bound to liposomes, which was prepared according to the GDI-removal protocol (see Fig. 4).C, the experiments were performed with 0.2 μmunprenylated Rac-GDP in buffer. D, apparent rate constant of [35S]GTPγS binding on soluble unprenylated Rac (0.5 μm) in the presence of 1 μm Tiam1 DH-PH as a function of azolectin liposome concentration. E, the apparent rate constants of nucleotide exchange (k app) for prenylated Rac in complex with GDI (open circles), liposome-bound prenylated Rac (filled circles), or unprenylated Rac (filled triangles) were determined from single exponential fits of the time courses shown in A,B, and C and plotted as a function of Tiam1 DH-PH concentration on a linear or log/log scale. Shown are means ± S.E. of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we wished to compare liposome-bound prenylated Rac-GDP with soluble non-prenylated Rac-GDP for their responsiveness to the exchange activity of Tiam DH-PH. This should allow us to assess the effect of the membrane colocalization of Rac-GDP and Tiam1 DH-PH on the nucleotide exchange reaction per se (i.e.independently of the effect of GDI on Rac). Indeed, besides being required for the dissociation of prenylated Rac from GDI, liposomes may also positively or negatively influence the interaction between Rac-GDP and Tiam DH-PH by effects such as reduction of dimensionality (liquid volume versus membrane surface) or conformational change. GDP-to-GTPγS exchange reactions on non-prenylated Rac-GDP were conducted in solution at various Tiam1 DH-PH concentration (Fig. 5 C). Importantly, azolectine liposomes had no effect on the reaction (Fig. 5 D). The apparent rate constant was plotted as a function of Tiam DH-PH concentration and was compared with that observed on liposomes-bound Rac-GDP (Fig. 5 E). Remarkably, the DH-PH region of Tiam1 was 10 to 20 times more active on prenylated Rac-GDP bound to membrane lipids than on soluble non-prenylated Rac-GDP. The comparison between these two forms was made easy by the fact that both underwent similar spontaneous exchange kinetics in the absence of exchange factor. The maximal exchange activity (k cat) of Tiam DH-PH on Rac-GDP bound to liposomes could not be determined because we could not resolve the kinetics of GDP/GTPγS exchange at saturating DH-PH concentration. However, from a rough extrapolation of the data, one can estimate that there a difference of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in the maximal exchange activity (Fig. 5 E). We conclude from these experiments that colocalization at a lipid membrane surface strongly favors the nucleotide exchange activity of the DH-PH domain of Tiam toward Rac. The above experiments suggest that the DH-PH domain of Tiam acts preferentially on prenylated Rac-GDP associated with membrane lipids. If this assessment is correct, catalytic intermediates of the nucleotide exchange reaction should be found also associated with membrane lipids. The essential intermediate of the catalysis of nucleotide exchange on G protein by GEFs is a nucleotide-free G protein-GEF complex. We assessed the membrane partitioning of such a complex in liposome sedimentation experiments. Prenylated Rac-GDP in complex with GDI (0.8 μm) and Tiam DH-PH (0.3 μm) were incubated with liposomes. To favor the stabilization of the nucleotide-free complex, incubations were performed at low Mg2+ (2 mm EDTA) in the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which hydrolyzes GDP as it dissociates from Rac. As shown in Fig. 6, the DH-PH domain alone of Tiam was more than 50% soluble (lane 3) although a significant amount of protein (30%) was associated with liposomes. However, after incubation with prenylated Rac, initially in the GDP-bound form and complexed to GDI but under conditions that favor the formation of the nucleotide-free form of Rac, the amount of membrane-bound Tiam DH-PH increased 2.5-fold (lane 2). Rac was also found to be almost completely associated with liposomes, whereas GDI remained in the supernatant (lanes 2and 4). Importantly, no cotranslocation of Rac and Tiam DH-PH to liposomes was observed in a control incubation conducted in the presence of GDP and in the absence of EDTA and alkaline phosphatase (lane 1). We conclude from these experiments that the nucleotide-free complex between prenylated Rac and Tiam DH-PH is a membrane-bound complex from which GDI is excluded. With the notable exception of Ran, most small G proteins interact with lipid membranes at some steps of the GDP/GTP cycle. In many cases, the interconversion between GDP- and GTP-bound forms is directly or indirectly coupled to the translocation of the protein between the cytosol and membranes, making the catalysis of GDP to GTP exchange by GEFs a complex issue. In Arf1, the coupling is direct: a conformational change in the myristoylated N-terminal helix of Arf1 strengthens its interaction with membrane lipids and is required for GEF-catalyzed GDP-to-GTP exchange (27Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Beraud-Dufour S. Paris S. Chabre M. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37629-37636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In Rho proteins, the coupling is indirect. The GDP- and GTP-bound forms display the same avidity for membrane lipids, but Rho-GDP is more cytosolic because of its preferential interaction with GDI (19; see, however, Ref. 20Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sequence of events that leads, starting from Rho-GDP in a cytosolic complex with GDI, to membrane anchored Rho-GTP is not well understood (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that exchange factors act on the soluble GDI-Rho-GDP complex and that after nucleotide exchange, Rho-GTP dissociates from the tripartite complex and translocates to membranes (24Read P.W. Liu X. Longenecker K. Dipierro C.G. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Nakamoto R.K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the dissociation of GDI and the membrane translocation of the GDP-bound form may precede or accompany the functional interaction of Rho with GEF (22Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have taken advantage of a recently described overexpression system for prenylated Rho proteins in complex with GDI (24Read P.W. Liu X. Longenecker K. Dipierro C.G. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Nakamoto R.K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to explore the nucleotide exchange reaction on the small G protein Rac in a minimal system with liposomes. To reconstitute the GDP/GTP switch of Rac on liposomes, one faces a dilemma. To handle prenylated Rac easily, the protein must be purified in complex with GDI. In that case, however, Rac-GDP remains essentially associated with GDI in solution even after incubation with a large amount of liposomes (Fig. 2). Alternatively, detergents may be used during the purification procedure to dissociate Rac-GDP from GDI. However, this will make the reconstitution with liposomes difficult. The group of Takai (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 30Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported interesting observations on the effects of both GDI and prenylation of Rho/Rac proteins on the catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange, but the influence of detergent and lipids in the reaction was not appreciated and thus prenylation was considered to participate directly in the interaction of Rho/Rac proteins with exchange factors. To overcome these difficulties, we devised a protocol whereby, starting from Rac-GDP in complex with GDI, we recapitulated a complete cycle of nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis to get prenylated Rac-GDP bound to liposomes and devoid of GDI (Fig. 4). This allows us to establish an elementary scheme for the GDI and DH-PH-dependent activation of Rac at the lipid surface. In solution, the DH-PH domain of Tiam was unable to promote GDP-to-GTP exchange on prenylated Rac-GDP in complex with GDI (Fig. 3 A). In sharp contrast, robust exchange activity was observed on prenylated Rac-GDP that was bound to azolectin liposomes (Fig. 5 B). Starting from the Rac-GDP-GDI complex, the exchange rate increases with liposome concentration, and this correlates with the appearance of a small fraction of Rac-GDP associated with liposomes and dissociated from GDI (Figs. 2 and 3). Last, sedimentation experiments revealed the formation of a liposome-bound complex between nucleotide-free Rac and the DH-PH domain of Tiam1, from which GDI was excluded (Fig. 6). These four observations exclude the formation of a functional tripartite complex between Rac, GDI, and DH-PH in solution and favor a two-step mechanism. First, Rac-GDP dissociates from GDI and translocates to membrane lipids. Second, DH-PH catalyzes the replacement of GDP by GTP on Rac anchored at the membrane surface. Although these two steps may be functionally coupled, they are mechanistically different. In the cell, membrane translocation of Rac can occur even with a catalytically inactive form of the exchange factor Vav, suggesting that there is a mechanism that controls the membrane recruitment of Rac before the nucleotide exchange reaction (31Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One important finding is that the DH-PH module of Tiam1 displays a much better activity on prenylated RacGDP bound to liposomes (Fig. 5 B) than on soluble unprenylated Rac-GDP (Fig. 5 C). Because the two forms display the same rate of spontaneous GDP release (compare Fig. 5, B andC), it is unlikely that the difference in DH-PH-catalyzed nucleotide exchange arises from differences in the conformation of Rac. One explanation for the catalytic advantage provided by membrane localization is reduction of dimensionality: the lipid membrane acts as a template that concentrates and better orients the small G protein and the DH-PH module, hence favoring their mutual interaction. Because both Rac and the DH-PH module have elements permitting membrane attachment (prenylation and PH domain), this mechanism is likely to contribute to the effects observed here. However additional mechanisms may play a role. If membranes solely concentrated the proteins, the maximal activities at saturating concentration (k cat) should be similar in solution and in the presence of liposomes. However, extrapolation of the dose response curves shown in Fig. 5 E suggests different k cat, implying that membrane colocalization favors the catalytic mechanism per se. One recurrent observation on DH-PH domains is that their activity on non-prenylated Rho proteins in solution is very weak compared with other catalytic domains that promote nucleotide exchange on small G proteins (discussed in Ref. 32Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the DH-PH module in solution may be somehow autoinhibited. Because the structures of DH-PH modules show great variations in the relative orientation of the DH and PH domains, it is tempting to assume that membrane binding of the PH domain may favor structural rearrangements at the interface with the DH domain that impact on the nucleotide exchange activity (4Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). If so, membrane-bound prenylated Rac-GDP should be in a better position to detect membrane-induced changes in the DH-PH module than soluble unprenylated Rac-GDP. Notably, we did not observe any effect of liposomes on the nucleotide exchange activity of Tiam1 DH-PH on soluble unprenylated Rac (Fig. 5 D). It has been shown recently that the PH domain of Tiam1 interacts preferentially with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate but that this interaction had no effect on the activity of Tiam1 on unprenylated Rac in solution (33Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to assess the effect of phosphoinositides on nucleotide exchange reactions performed in the presence of liposomes of defined lipid composition and with prenylated Rac. In addition, it should be noted that the membrane localization of full-length Tiam1 has been shown to depend on domains upstream of the DH-PH module, including a second PH domain, and can be regulated by phosphorylation (34Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol.

The reconstitution of the GTPase cycle of Rac on liposomes should help to define the molecular mechanisms by which the activation of this small G protein is regulated. We thank J.

The overexpression of 14-3-3β compromises the ability of the TSC1-TSC2 complex to reduce S6K phosphorylation. The antagonistic activity of 14-3-3β toward TSC is dependent on the 14-3-3β-TSC2 interaction, since a mutant of TSC2 that is not recognized by 14-3-3β is refractory to 14-3-3β.

However, the range of biological functions that PPARγ regulates is much wider than originally thought and the receptor has been shown to modulate the growth of a wide variety of cell types (5Mueller E.

However, ∼8% of primary colorectal tumors were found to harbor a loss of function mutation in the PPARγ gene emphasizing the putative role of this receptor as a tumor suppressor in humans (12Sarraf P.

The TGF-β family of growth factors regulate a plethora of biological processes including embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation of cells (reviewed in Ref. 13Blobe G.C.

This latter function has been well defined in the colon, where TGF-β is a potent inhibitor of colonic epithelial cell growth (14Barnard J.A. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Under these circumstances continued expression of TGF-β paradoxically leads to enhanced tumor growth through stimulation of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix production, and immuno suppression (20Cui W.

Thus, although both PPARγ and TGF-β are key regulators of epithelial cell biology, the molecular mechanisms by which either pathway induces growth inhibition and differentiation are incompletely understood. Here we have identified transforming growth factor simulated clone-22 (TSC-22) as a target gene of both pathways in intestinal epithelial cells. Functional studies with wild-type and dominant negative forms of TSC-22 suggest that TSC-22 is an important downstream component of PPARγ and TGF-β signaling during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. The MOSER S (M-S) (21Levine A.E. McRae L.J. Hamilton D.A. Brattain D.E. Yeoman L.C. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2248-2254PubMed Google Scholar) and MOSER R (M-R) (22Mulder K.M. Ramey M.K.

Brattain (University of Texas Health Sciences, San Antonio, TX). The FET cell line was a gift of W. Grady (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) and the CBS cell line was a gift of H. Moses (Vanderbilt University). COS7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with constant humidity. TGF-β1, cycloheximide, and 5,6-dichloro-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic PPAR and RXR ligands were synthesized at GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC) and dissolved in Me2SO. RNA was isolated using the TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). For all experiments in which TGF-β1 or a PPAR ligand were added, the cells were grown in the above media except that regular fetal bovine serum was replaced by charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Human named genes GENEFILTERS Release I blots (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL) were probed with [33P]dCTP-labeled reverse transcriptase-derived cDNA. The cDNA was synthesized from RNA isolated from exponentially growing M-S cells that had been exposed for 12 or 24 h to one of the following treatments: 0.1% 4 mm HCl containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Me2SO, 1 μm rosiglitazone, or 2 ng/ml TGF-β1. Membranes were hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were imaged using the Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Hewlett-Packard) and imported into the Pathways Software (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL) to identify differences in the intensity of cDNA spots between different treatments. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Gupta R.A. Tan J. Krause W.F. Geraci M.W. Willson T.M. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13275-13280Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although representative Northern blot images are shown, all Northern blot experiments were repeated a minimum of two times. Briefly, total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-NX nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in Ultrahyb (Ambion, Austin, TX). Hybridization was conducted in the same buffer in the presence of 32P radiolabeled cDNA of a partial fragment of human TSC-22. Blots were washed 4× for 15 min at 50 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and once for 30 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and images were analyzed using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor system. Quantification of mRNA intensities for Fig. 4 (A–D) was done using Optiquant Software (Hewlett-Packard). Exponentially growing cells were harvested in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer. Centrifuged lysates (50 μg) from each cell line were fractionated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% powdered milk. The primary antibody was then added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody clone HA.11 (1:1000; Babco, Richmond, CA), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody clone M2 (1:500; Sigma), monoclonal anti-keratin 20 antibody clone Ks20.8 (1:500; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), goat polyclonal anti-p21 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-TSC-22 antibody 2T. Soma, C. Dohrmann, G. Bi, J. Brissette, and L. Raftery, manuscript in preparation. (1:100). This was followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Labs) at a dilution of 1:50,000 for 1 h. Detection of immunoreactive polypeptides was accomplished using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (AmershamBiosciences). For all PCR reactions, Pfu Turbo Taq Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. Every construct generated was sequenced to ensure the absence of any unwanted mutations. Full-lengthTSC-22 was cloned using PCR from a cDNA library of M-S cells treated with 1 μm rosiglitazone for 24 h. The product was cloned into the pPCR-Script cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and this plasmid was utilized as a template for all subsequent PCR reactions. For all primers, the 5′ primer was designed to include a NotI site and nucleotides encoding the full-length HA or FLAG epitope. Each 3′ primer was designed to include a BglII site. For HA TSC-22 wild-type (wt) or FLAG TSC-22 wt, the 5′ primer included a partial region of TSC-22starting at the second codon and the 3′ primer included a partial region starting at codon 145 (stop codon). For HA TSC-22dn, in which both repressor domains (RD) were deleted, the 5′ primer included a partial region of TSC-22 beginning at codon 38. The 3′ primer included a stop codon and a partial region starting at codon 102. For HA TSC-22dncon, both RDs were deleted and two highly conserved leucine residues in the leucine zipper domain were mutated to alanine (L91A and L97A). The 5′ primer was identical to that used for HA TSC-22dn. The 3′ primer was also the same except for a mismatch at codons 91 and 97 such that the amplified product would contain the L91A and L97A mutations. See Fig. 5 A for a schematic of all constructs generated. Each PCR product was digested withNotI/BglII and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1Zeo expression vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). Exponentially growing COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) at a lipid:DNA ratio of 3.5:1 and with a DNA concentration of 1.5 μg/ml in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). 6 h post-transfection, regular media was added back and the cells were allowed to grow for another 48 h prior to harvest. Anti-HA affinity matrix (100 μl; Roche Molecular Biosciences) was added to 500 μg of COS7 cell lysate and the cells were incubated in NET-N buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were then washed 3× with NET-N buffer. Protein was eluted by the addition of 1× SDS loading buffer followed by a 5-min incubation at 100 °C. Four different vectors were utilized to generate eight unique pools of stable transfected cells: 1) pcDNA3.1Zeo (pools designated as M-S VECTOR clones A and B); 2) HA TSC-22wt/pcDNA3.1Zeo (M-S TSC WT clones A and B); 3) HA TSC-22dn/pCDNA3.1Zeo (M-S TSC DN clones A and B); and 4) HA TSC-22dncon/pcDNA3.1Zeo (M-S TSC DNCON clones A and B). M-S cells were transfected with the appropriate vector using FuGENE 6 at a lipid:DNA ratio of 3:1 and a DNA concentration of 5 μg/ml in Opti-MEM. After 6 h of transfection, normal media was added back and the cells were allowed to grow for another 72 h. Cells were then split into media containing 200 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) and selected for 2 weeks. Resistant clones were combined into two unique pools and expanded. Zeocin was maintained in the media prior to all experiments at a dose of 100 μg/ml. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 and replaced the next day with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and rosiglitazone or TGF-β1. Cells were counted at the indicated times using a Coulter counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (24Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Sense or antisense 35S-labeled cRNA probes were generated from human TSC-22. The probes had specific activities at 2 × 109 disintegrations per minute (dpm)/μg. Sections hybridized with the sense probes did not exhibit any positive autoradiographic signals and served as negative controls. We noticed a striking similarity in the cellular response to either TGF-β1 or PPARγ ligands in colorectal cancer cells with intact PPARγ and TGF-β signaling pathways. For example, in the M-S, CBS, and FET colon carcinoma lines, exposure to the high affinity PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (25Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) or TGF-β1 results in accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (data not shown) and a decrease in cell growth (Fig.1 A). Moreover, in all three cell lines, addition of either agent results in an increase in the p21 (Fig. 1 B) and keratin 20 (data not shown). Elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (26Tian J.Q. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1094-G1104PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tian J.Q. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1245-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Calnek D. Quaroni A. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and keratin 20 (28) are associated with intestinal epithelial differentiation in various model systems and p21 is a well characterized TGF-β-regulated gene (29Elbendary A. Berchuck A. Davis P. Havrilesky L. Bast R.C. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1301-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Because both PPARγ and TGF-β1 regulate such a wide spectrum of physiological processes, the genomic response to either pathway is complex. This makes it difficult to identify those target genes that play functionally important roles in cell growth and differentiation. These data led us to hypothesize that one way to identify relevant target genes of PPARγ and TGF-β1 in the setting of colon epithelial cell growth and differentiation is to focus on the common subset of downstream target genes regulated by both pathways. Microarray analysis was utilized to determine the genomic response of one of these lines, the M-S cells, after exposure to rosiglitazone or TGF-β1 for 12 or 24 h. A subset of genes was commonly regulated by either pathway, including several members of the keratin and carcinogenic embryonic antigen superfamilies. However, time course experiments suggested that these genes were not likely to be direct targets of PPARγ or TGF-β and may represent end points (rather than effectors) of the differentiation process. One promising candidate rapidly induced by either treatment was TSC-22, a gene originally identified as a TGF-β1-stimulated gene in osteoblast cells (30Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10219-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis confirmed that either PPARγ or TGF-β could induceTSC-22 in the M-S, CBS, and FET cell lines (Fig.2). We further became interested in studying this gene when in situ hybridization of TSC-22 in the normal colon demonstrated that its expression was enriched in the postmitotic epithelial compartment of the normal human colon, where the most differentiated enterocytes reside (Fig.3).Figure 3TSC-22 is localized to the postmitotic epithelial compartment of the normal human colon. The surface of the human intestine is divided into an epithelial mucosal layer and submucosal layer containing supportive connective tissue, lymphatics, and vasculature. Within the mucosal layer, undifferentiated stem cells located at the base of invaginated crypts give rise to cells that migrate toward the lumen as they further differentiate into specialized enterocytes. Sections of normal colon were probed with antisense TSC-22 using in situ hybridization and a representative section is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The M-S cells were chosen as a system to study TSC-22 regulation by PPARγ or TGF-β1 and to test the hypothesis that TSC-22 is a regulator of intestinal epithelial differentiation. The induction of TSC-22 by either PPARγ or TGF-β1 was both time- and dose-dependent (Fig.4, A–D). Following treatment with either rosiglitazone or TGF-β1, anti-TSC-22 antiserum detected an appropriately sized polypeptide, which was absent in untreated cells (Fig. 4 E). We conclude that TSC-22 protein levels increase as well. TSC-22 has been shown to be a direct target gene of TGF-β1 (30Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10219-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether it is also a target for PPARγ as well. Cells were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB followed by rosiglitazone. DRB co-treatment blocked the ability of PPARγ to induce TSC-22 suggesting that the ability of PPARγ to increase steady-state RNA levels of the gene was dependent on de novotranscription rather than through an increase in mRNA stability (Fig. 5). Furthermore, whereas cycloheximide slightly induced TSC-22, co-treatment of rosiglitazone and cycloheximide led to a superinduction (Fig. 5), suggesting thatde novo protein synthesis was not required for PPARγ to induce TSC-22. This result suggested that PPARγ was not inducing TSC-22 by first increasing the levels of TGF-β and in fact rosiglitazone was not able to induce TGF-β1 in the parental M-S cells (data not shown). As TSC-22 has not previously been shown to be a target of PPARs, we wanted to determine the specificity and selectivity of this induction. Cells were treated with two structurally distinct PPARγ ligands (the thiazolidinedione-based agonist rosiglitazone or the tyrosine-based agonist GW7845 (31Cobb J.E. Blanchard S.G. Boswell E.G.

Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar)), or rosiglitazone plus GW9662. TSC-22 was induced by both PPARγ agonists and the induction by rosiglitazone could be blocked by co-treatment with the PPARγ antagonist (Fig.6). Cells were also treated with a PPARα selective ligand (GW7647 (33Brown P.J. Stuart L.W. Hurley K.P. Lewis M.C. Winegar D.A. Wilson J.G. Wilkinson W.O. Ittoop O.R. Willson T.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1225-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)), a dual PPARα/δ ligand (GW2433 (34Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W.

A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar)), an RXR specific ligand (LG100268), or a combination of rosiglitazone and LG100268. Despite the fact that M-S cells express both PPARα and PPARδ (data not shown), neither of these other two PPAR isoforms was able to regulate TSC-22 expression (Fig. 6). To further clarify the issue of whether PPARγ signaling in the colon was dependent on the TGF-β pathway, the M-R cell line was utilized. The M-R line is a subclone of the parental M-S cells that are relatively refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β (22Mulder K.M. Ramey M.K. Hoosein N.M. Levine A.E. Hinshaw X.H. Brattain D.E. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 7120-7715PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ, but not TGF-β1, could induce expression ofTSC-22 in the M-R cells (Fig.7 A). Finally, activators of PPARγ inhibited the growth of either cell line by equivalent amounts, whereas the M-S-R cells (as has been previously reported) were relatively resistant to TGF-β induced growth inhibition (Fig.7 B). The functional role of TSC-22 in mediating any of the biological effects induced by either PPARγ or TGF-β is unknown. To address this issue we focused on two experimental strategies: 1) to determine whether expression of TSC-22 in the M-S cells could recapitulate any of the phenotypic changes induced by PPARγ or TGF-β1, and 2) to determine whether inhibition of normal TSC-22 function blocks the phenotypic changes induced by either treatment. Kester et al. (35Kester H.A. Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27439-27447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have defined 4 functional domains within TSC-22 (Fig.8 A). Using both glutathioneS-transferase pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays, they demonstrated that TSC-22 could form homodimers via the leucine zipper domain. They also showed that TSC-22 has transcriptional repressor activity when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain and identified two domains within TSC-22, RD 1 and 2, which were in large part responsible for this effect. Finally, they were able to demonstrate that titration of a mutant TSC-22 in which both RD 1 and 2 were deleted could inhibit the repressor activity of the wild-type protein and thus act as a dominant-negative (dn) inhibitor. Based on these results, we constructed three different HA-tagged TSC-22 constructs for stable introduction of this gene into the M-S cells: TSC-22 wt, TSC-22dn (in which both RD 1 and 2 were deleted), and TSC-22dncon (which, in addition to both RD domains being deleted, contains mutations in two highly conserved leucine residues within the leucine zipper domain) (Fig. 8 A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that TSC-22dn, but not TSC-22dncon, could dimerize with TSC-22 wt (Fig. 8 B). This last construct was made to help properly interpret any potential artifacts because of expression of TSC-22dn that were independent of its ability to dimerize and inhibit the function of the wild-type protein. Each of these three constructs (plus empty vector) was used to generate eight unique pools of stably transfected cells. Each of the pooled cell lines was found to express relatively equivalent protein levels of the integrated cDNA (Fig. 8, C and D). The two different pools of M-S cells expressing TSC-22 wt were found to have significantly reduced growth rates compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 9 A). They also displayed higher levels of p21 protein but showed no difference in the levels of keratin 20 protein (Fig. 9 B). We next tested the ability of TSC-22dn and TSC-22dncon to block the ability of PPARγ or TGF-β to inhibit the growth of M-S cells. In the two different pools of cells expressing TSC-22dn, the ability of PPARγ or TGF-β1 to inhibit growth was reduced by ∼60% (Fig. 10 A). Importantly, no differences in the inhibitory activity of either PPARγ or TGF-β1 were seen when comparing vector and TSC-22dncon-transfected cells (Fig.10 A). Northern blot analysis confirmed that PPARγ and TGF-β1 could still induce TSC-22 in these cell lines (data not shown). Finally, the ability of rosiglitazone or TGF-β1 to induce p21, but not keratin 20, was greatly diminished in M-S cells expressing TSC-22dn but not TSC- 22dncon (Fig. 10 B). The complex mechanisms by which the undifferentiated stem cells of the intestine give rise to differentiated cells with specialized functions remain incompletely understood. Some of the key pathways that govern this process in the intestine have been identified from understanding genetic lesions found in colorectal cancer (36Chung D.C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 854-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For example, a majority of human colorectal cancers contain a loss of function mutation in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (37Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have suggested a critical role for this gene in exerting strict growth controls such that the renewing population of intestinal epithelial cells is kept at a constant number. Likewise, loss of function mutations have been identified in genes involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway and PPARγ. Further studies have shown that activation of either of these pathways in cell culture models can lea"
https://openalex.org/W2122109494,"The β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) is proteolytically processed by two secretase activities to produce the pathogenic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). N-terminal cleavage is mediated by β-secretase (BACE) whereas C-terminal intramembraneous cleavage is exerted by the presenilin (PS) γ-secretase complex. The Aβ-generating γ-secretase cleavage principally occurs after amino acid 40 or 42 and results in secretion of Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42). Upon overexpression of BACE in cultured cells we unexpectedly noticed a reduction of secreted Aβ-(1–40/42). However, mass spectrometry revealed a truncated Aβ species, which terminates at amino acid 34 (Aβ-(1–34)) suggesting an alternative γ-secretase cut. Indeed, expression of a loss-of-function variant of PS1 inhibited not only the production of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) but also that of Aβ-(1–34). However, expression levels of BACE correlate with the amount of Aβ-(1–34), and Aβ-(1–34) is produced at the expense of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42). Since this suggested that BACE is involved in a C-terminal truncation of Aβ, we incubated purified BACE with Aβ-(1–40) in vitro. Under these conditions Aβ-(1–34) was generated. Moreover, when conditioned media containing Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) were incubated with cells expressing a loss-of-function PS1 variant together with BACE, Aβ-(1–34) was efficiently produced in vivo. These data demonstrate that an apparently γ-secretase-dependent Aβ derivative is produced after the generation of the non-truncated Aβ via an additional and unexpected activity of BACE.

However, expression levels of BACE correlate with the amount of Aβ-(1–34), and Aβ-(1–34) is produced at the expense of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42). Since this suggested that BACE is involved in a C-terminal truncation of Aβ, we incubated purified BACE with Aβ-(1–40) in vitro. Under these conditions Aβ-(1–34) was generated. Moreover, when conditioned media containing Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) were incubated with cells expressing a loss-of-function PS1 variant together with BACE, Aβ-(1–34) was efficiently produced in vivo. These data demonstrate that an apparently γ-secretase-dependent Aβ derivative is produced after the generation of the non-truncated Aβ via an additional and unexpected activity of BACE. Because of the increasing mean life expectancy, there is considerable interest in the understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of age-related diseases. By far the most frequent age-related neurological disorder is Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PS, presenilin; BACE, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme; sBACE, soluble BACE; wt, wild type; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PS, presenilin; BACE, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme; sBACE, soluble BACE; wt, wild type; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight During the aging process the patients accumulate insoluble amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), which is deposited in senile plaques and microvessels in the brain. Aβ is generated by endoproteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), involving β- and γ-secretase (1Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Google Scholar). β-secretase (also called BACE; β-site APP-cleaving enzyme) was identified as a membrane-associated aspartyl protease (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D.

A close homologue (BACE-2) (6Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Google Scholar, 10Fan W. Bennett B. Babu-Kahn S. Luo Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9712-9717Google Scholar). BACE-2 rather exhibits an α-secretase-like activity, which cleaves in the middle of the Aβ domain at amino acid 19 and 20 (9, 13, 14). Apparently BACE-2 does not contribute to the amyloidogenic processing of Aβ, since the deletion of BACE fully abrogates Aβ generation (15Luo Y. Bolon B. Kahn S. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Denis P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Google Scholar). The catalytic activity is most likely contributed by the PSs (1Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Google Scholar, 27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar). PSs are polytopic transmembrane proteins, which together with the signal peptide peptidases and the type-4 prepilin peptidases may belong to a novel family of aspartyl proteases of the GXGD type (for review see Ref. 1Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Google Scholar). The cleavage of BACE-generated CTFβ by γ-secretase results in the secretion of Aβ into biological fluids (1Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Google Scholar). This cleavage principally occurs after amino acid 40 and 42, the latter being enhanced by numerous familial AD-associated mutations in the PS genes and βAPP itself (28Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Google Scholar). Beside the predominant cleavage after amino acid 40 and 42 slightly shorter peptides have been observed as well, suggesting that the γ-secretase has loose sequence specificity (29Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Google Scholar). This includes peptides terminating after amino acid 34, 37, 38, and 39 (29). In addition or in parallel to these cleavages, γ-secretase also cleaves within the transmembrane domain shortly before the cytoplasmic border after amino acid 49 to liberate the βAPP intracellular domain (AICD) (30Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar, 31Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar), which may be involved in nuclear signaling (34Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar, 35Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Google Scholar). The biological function of γ-secretase is related to the very similar intramembraneous processing of Notch. Indeed, a depletion of PS1 leads to a very severe Notch phenotype (summarized in Ref. 36Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Google Scholar). BACE and γ-secretase are obvious targets for therapeutic strategies aimed to inhibit Aβ generation. Unfortunately γ-secretase inhibitors not only block Aβ generation but also interfere with Notch signaling (37Hadland B. Manley N. Su D.M. Longmore G. Moore C. Wolfe M. Schroeter E. Kopan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7487-7491Google Scholar, 38Doerfler P. Shearman M.S. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9312-9317Google Scholar, 39Geling A. Steiner H. Willem M. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Google Scholar). Therefore treatment of patients with such inhibitors remains problematic. On the other side it has been shown that the gene encoding BACE can be removed without any deleterious effects (15Luo Y. Bolon B. Kahn S. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Denis P. Fan W. Kha H. Zhang J. Gong Y. Martin L. Louis J.C. Yan Q. Richards W.G. Citron M. Vassar R. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 231-232Google Scholar, 16Roberds S.L. Anderson J. Basi G. Bienkowski M.J. Branstetter D.G. Chen K.S.

Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 233-234Google Scholar). Therefore inhibition of BACE with small chemical compounds seems to be a safer approach for long term treatment. However, a detailed understanding of the cleavage specificity and the substrate specificity of BACE is required for the generation of selective drugs. Surprisingly, overexpression of BACE in cell culture models leads to reduced Aβ secretion (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Google Scholar). In order to investigate this paradox we analyzed Aβ peptides secreted from cells stably expressing various levels of BACE and made the surprising observation that BACE can also cleave 34 amino acids C-terminal from its primary cleavage site, thus mimicking a PS-like cleavage specificity. HEK293 were cultured as described (9Fluhrer R. Capell A. Westmeyer G. Willem M. Hartung B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Walter J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1011-1020Google Scholar).

For immunodetection of PS1 the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the large hydrophilic loop of PS1 (3027 and BI.3D7) were used (47Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B.

The fluorometric BACE activity assay was carried out as described previously (46Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Google Scholar). To selectively inhibit BACE activity GL189 was used as described previously (46Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Google Scholar). Soluble BACE (sBACE) was isolated and incubated with synthetic Aβ as follows: HEK 293 cells expressing sBACE were incubated with Optimem 1 containing Glutamax (Invitrogen) for 24 h. 400 ml of the conditioned medium were purified using a mono Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). 20 μl of the fraction derived from cells expressing sBACE or from control fractions not containing sBACE were incubated with 50 μg of synthetic Aβ-(1–40) for MALDI-TOF MS and with 6 μg of synthetic Aβ-(1–40) for gel analysis at 37 °C for the indicated time points. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 with acetic acid. Samples were dried in a Speed Vac and resuspended in acetic acid. Subsequently samples were purified by using a Zip-Tip column and were then subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. Cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and incubated with 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (DMEM; PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) and penicillin/streptomycin for 24 h. Subsequently the samples were prepared for mass spectrometry as described previously (49Kulic L. Walter J. Multhaup G. Teplow D.B. Baumeister R. Romig H. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. Proc. Natl.

Samples were analyzed on MALDI-target plates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (Brucker Reflex III). In order to analyze the Aβ species secreted by BACE-expressing cells we collected conditioned media from HEK 293 cells stably transfected with Swedish mutant βAPP695 (βAPPsw) and BACE. Cells expressing either endogenous levels of BACE or moderate or high levels of transfected BACE were investigated (Fig.1 A). To prove the catalytic activity of BACE in these cell lines we performed in vitroactivity assays using solubilized membranes of the respective cell lines (46Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Google Scholar). As expected we found substantially increased β-secretase activity in the cell line expressing high levels of BACE as compared with non-transfected cells or cells expressing low levels of BACE (data not shown). These cell lines were labeled with [35S]methionine and conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Aβ antibody 3926. Surprisingly, increasing BACE expression negatively correlated with Aβ production (Fig. 1 B). This is consistent with previous findings by Vassar et al. (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Google Scholar) who observed reduced Aβ production despite increased BACE activity in cells transfected with βAPPsw (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Google Scholar). This paradoxical finding raised the possibility that Aβ species produced under these conditions could either not be metabolically labeled or not detected by conventional gel electrophoresis. We thus used an independent method and attempted to identify secreted Aβ species by a combined immunoprecipitation/MALDI-TOF MS method. As expected cells expressing endogenous BACE secreted predominantly Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 1 C). In addition we also obtained small amounts of Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–37/38/39) (Fig. 1 C). Upon expression of moderate levels of BACE we observed an additional Aβ species (Aβ-(1–34); Fig. 1 C). In order to analyze if the production of this truncated species is related to BACE expression levels, we next investigated Aβ species secreted from cells expressing higher levels of BACE (Fig. 1 A). This revealed robust amounts of Aβ-(1–34), which was accompanied by reduced levels of Aβ-(1−40), Aβ-(1−42), and Aβ-(1–37/38/39) (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained using cell lines co-expressing wtAPP and BACE (data not shown). The detection of robust levels of Aβ-(1–34) upon expression of BACE explains the lack of its detection upon metabolic labeling, since the single radioactively labeled Met residue at position 35 of the Aβ peptide has been removed by the additional cleavage. Although the above described results suggest that BACE is directly involved in the enhanced production of Aβ-(1–34), previous observations indicated that C-terminally truncated Aβ species including Aβ-(1–34) are generated by the γ-secretase complex in a PS-dependent manner (52Vandermeeren M. Geraerts M. Pype S. Dillen L. Van Hove C. Mercken M. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 315: 145-148Google Scholar, 53Beher D. Wrigley J.D. Owens A.P. Shearman M.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 563-575Google Scholar). In order to analyze if a PS-dependent γ-secretase activity is required for Aβ-(1–34) generation, we co-expressed BACE with either PS1 wt or the non-functional PS1 D385N mutant (Fig.2 A). As shown previously (42Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Google Scholar), PS1 wt undergoes endoproteolysis whereas no endoproteolysis was obtained in cells expressing PS1 D385N (Fig. 2 A, right panel; Ref. 27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar). The non-functional PS1 D385N fully replaced biologically active endogenous PS (Fig. 2 A,right panel). Whereas robust levels of Aβ-(1–34) and Aβ-(1–40) (and all other minor Aβ species) were produced from cells co-expressing PS1 wt and BACE, Aβ-(1–34) generation as well as generation of all other Aβ species was almost completely inhibited in the presence of the non-functional PS1 D385N (Fig. 2 B,right panel). This clearly demonstrates that a PS-dependent γ-secretase activity is involved directly or indirectly in the production of Aβ-(1–34). However, the results described in Fig. 1, demonstrated that upon BACE expression Aβ-(1–34) generation occurs to the expense of the production of all other Aβ variants and thus suggests a direct involvement of BACE in the cleavage of Aβ at position 34. This apparent paradox may indicate that γ-secretase activity is required first to produce secreted Aβ species, which are then trimmed at their C termini by a so far unknown BACE activity. In order to prove this hypothesis, synthetic Aβ-(1–40) was incubated with purified BACE isolated from conditioned media of cells secreting a soluble version of BACE lacking the transmembrane domain and the C terminus (43Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M. Kaiser H. Meyer C. Walter J. Lammich S. Multhaup G. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30849-30854Google Scholar). To prove the catalytic activity of secreted BACE we carried out in vitro assays (46Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Google Scholar). Soluble BACE was fully active in the in vitro assay, whereas no activity was obtained in control media (Fig.3 A). This activity was fully blocked by the BACE-specific inhibitor GL189 (Fig. 3 A). Upon incubation of synthetic Aβ-(1–40) with soluble BACE an additional peptide, which co-migrated with synthetic Aβ-(1–34) was detected on a gel system capable to separate low molecular weight peptides (Fig.3 B; Ref. 54Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Google Scholar). In vitro generation of Aβ-(1–34) was completely inhibited upon addition of the specific BACE inhibitor GL189 (Fig. 3 B). Using MALDI-TOF MS we confirmed a time-dependent generation of Aβ-(1–34) during incubation of soluble BACE with Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 3 C). In contrast incubation of synthetic Aβ-(1–40) with conditioned media, not containing soluble BACE does not reveal truncated Aβ species (Fig.3 C). This finding demonstrates that BACE has the ability to cleave Aβ after amino acid 34 and, together with the results shown in Fig. 1, excludes artificial trimming by exopeptidases. Because in vivo, only very minor amounts of BACE are secreted (data not shown and Ref. 55Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Google Scholar) we next investigated if membrane-bound BACE can convert secreted Aβ-(1–40/42) to Aβ-(1–34) in living cells. To do so we collected conditioned media (Fig. 4 A) from cells expressing βAPPsw and endogenous BACE. These media were then added either to cells expressing PS1 D385N alone or to cells co-expressing PS1 D385N and BACE. Because of the lack of γ-secretase activity in the latter cell line almost no de novo synthesis of any Aβ species occurs (Ref. 42Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Google Scholar; compare also Fig. 2 B). Therefore any truncation of Aβ should occur independent of γ-secretase activity. In conditioned media incubated with cells expressing PS1 D385N no detectable conversion of Aβ-(1–40) to Aβ-(1–34) was observed (Fig. 4 B). However, upon addition of the conditioned media to cells expressing both PS1 D385N and BACE, Aβ-(1–34) was readily produced (Fig. 4 C). Taken together these results demonstrate that BACE can proteolytically modify Aβ species, which were originally produced by a γ-secretase-dependent pathway. While BACE is the protease with the major β-secretase activity (15Luo Y. Bolon B. Kahn S. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Denis P. Fan W. Kha H. Zhang J. Gong Y. Martin L. Louis J.C. Yan Q. Richards W.G.

https://openalex.org/W2047534013,"It is well known that the type 3 Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR3) exhibits strikingly different pharmacological and functional properties depending on the tissues in which it resides. To investigate the molecular basis for this tissue-dependent heterogeneity, we examined the primary structure of RyR3 from various tissues by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis. As many as seven alternatively spliced variants of RyR3 were detected. Ribonuclease protection assays revealed that one of these splice variants, RyR3 (AS-8a), which lacks a 29-amino acid fragment (His4406–Lys4434) encompassing a predicted transmembrane helix, was highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues, but not in skeletal muscle, the heart, or the brain. Although the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant did not form a functional Ca2+release channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, it was able to form functional heteromeric channels with reduced caffeine sensitivity when co-expressed with the wild type RyR3. Interestingly, this RyR3 splice variant was also able to form heteromeric channels with and suppress the activity of the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Tissue-specific expression of RyR3 splice variants is therefore likely to account for some of the pharmacological and functional heterogeneities of RyR3. These observations also reveal a novel mechanism by which a splice variant of one RyR isoform (RyR3) can suppress the activity of another RyR isoform (RyR2) via a dominant negative effect.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; wt, wild type; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; wt, wild type; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay were initially described in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles. It is now known that there are three mammalian RyR isoforms (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3) and that they are expressed in a variety of cells and tissues (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 2Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76 (5): 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Murayama T. Adv. Biophys. 1999; 36: 27-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RyR1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas RyR2 is mainly expressed in heart, brain, and smooth muscles. The expression of RyR3 has been detected in a broad range of tissues, including brain, smooth muscles, and skeletal muscle (4Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). RyR1 and RyR2 function as Ca2+ release channels and play an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscles (5Fleischer S. Inui M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 273: 435-450PubMed Google Scholar, 6Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 7Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am.

However, the physiological role and channel properties of RyR3 remain elusive. Depending on the tissues in which it is expressed, RyR3 exhibits different functional properties. In skeletal muscle, it functions as a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release channel similar to RyR1 and RyR2 (9Takeshima H. Yamazawa T. Ikemoto T. Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and is involved in amplifying the Ca2+ signals generated by RyR1 (10Yang D. Pan Z. Takeshima H. Wu C. Nagaraj R.Y. Ma J. Cheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40210-40214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in smooth muscle cells, RyR3 forms a ryanodine-sensitive but caffeine-insensitive Ca2+ release channel (11Lynn S. Morgan J.M. Gillespie J.I. Greenwell J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Lynn S. Morgan J.M. Lamb H.K. Meissner G. Gillespie J.I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and may negatively regulate the activity of RyR2 and/or RyR1 (13Lohn M. Jessner W. Furstenau M. Wellner M. Sorrentino V. Haller H. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The expression of RyR3 has also been demonstrated in human Jurkat T-lymphocytes and mink lung epithelial cells. Interestingly, these cells also exhibit ryanodine-sensitive, caffeine-insensitive Ca2+ release activity (14Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V. Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the notion that RyR3 expressed in smooth muscles and peripheral tissues possesses unique functional properties, although the molecular mechanism underlying this tissue-specific function of RyR3 is unknown. To account for the pharmacological and functional heterogeneity of RyR3, it has been proposed that smooth muscle and peripheral tissues may express a unique isoform of RyR3 as a result of alternative splicing (16Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we systematically investigated the existence of alternatively spliced variants of RyR3 expressed in the uterus by amplifying and sequencing the entire ∼15-kb coding region of RyR3. Our results show that RyR3 expressed in smooth muscle tissues is extensively modified by alternative splicing and that one of the splice variants, RyR3 (AS-8a), is highly and selectively expressed in smooth muscle tissues. Functional characterization reveals that this major RyR3 splice variant does not form a functional channel when expressed alone but is able to form functional heteromeric channels with the wild type RyR3 and RyR2. Our data provide the molecular basis for the tissue-dependent heterogeneity of RyR3 and demonstrate for the first time that a splice variant of RyR3 is able to interact with and suppress the activity of another RyR isoform, RyR2, via the formation of heteromeric channel complexes. Total RNA was isolated from various rabbit tissues as described previously (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). Briefly, first strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Invitrogen). The entire 15-kb coding region of RyR3 was amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and eight pairs of primers (CP-1F/CP-1R through CP-8F/CP-8R) (17Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The following PCR primers were used to amplify the splice regions: AS2-F, 5′-GCATCTCCTTCCGCATC-3′; AS2-R, 5′-TTCAGCCAGCCTGTCTC-3; AS5-F, 5′-TAGCAGCAGTGGGTATG-3′; AS5-R, 5′-CCTTCACCAGCTCTGAG-3′; AS6-F, 5′-ACCAACTCTTCCGCATG-3′; AS6-R, 5′-CCGCTCCTGGTCCTGT-3′; AS7-F, 5′-ATGGAGGCAACGCCGGT-3′; AS7-R, 5′-GTGAACTCATCATTCTGG-3′; AS8a-F, 5′-GGGTTGGAAATCTATCA-3′; AS8a-R, 5′-AGTGCTCTCCTGCAGGA-3′; AS8b-F, 5′-CTGACATGAAGTGTGAC-3′; and AS8b-R, 5′-AGCTGATCTTCATACTGT-3′. A ribonuclease protection assay was carried out using the RPA II kit from Ambion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a RyR3 cDNA fragment (231 bp) encompassing the AS-8a splice region (87 bp), a 114-bp 5′-flanking, and a 30-bp 3′-flanking sequence was generated by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript. The plasmid was linearized and used as template to synthesize 32P-labeled RNA probe using the T7 RNA polymerase. The 32P-labeled RNA probe was hybridized with total RNA isolated from various tissues followed by treatment with RNases. The protected probes were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Construction of the full-length RyR3 cDNA and insertion of the c-Myc epitope tag into RyR3 after glutamate 4318 have been described previously (17Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M.R. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted into the same position in RyR3 as the c-Myc tag using the same strategy. A SpeI (12864)-NotI (vector) fragment containing the AS-8a deletion was removed from the PCR8 RT-PCR fragment and was used to replace the corresponding wild type fragment in the full-length RyR3 cDNA. TheSpeI (10659)-SpeI (12864) fragment was ligated back to form RyR3 (AS-8a). The KpnI (6313)-AflII (7588) fragment containing the ΔE2256-T2429 deletion was generated by the overlap extension method (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) and was used to replace the corresponding wild type fragment in the full-length RyR3 to form RyR3 (ΔE2256-T2429). HEK293 cells were transfected with RyR cDNAs using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (17Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cell lysates prepared from transfected HEK293 cells as described previously (21Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were incubated with protein G-agarose (30 μl) that was prebound with 5–10 μg of anti-c-Myc or anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C for 17–19 h. The immunocomplexes bound to the agarose beads were solubilized by Laemmli's sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar) and were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE resolved proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 45 mV for 18–20 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.01% SDS according to Towbin et al. (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 1 h with a blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder). The blocked membrane was incubated with primary antibodies, anti-RyR3 (34C), anti-c-Myc, or anti-HA antibodies for 2–4 h and washed for 15 min three times with the blocking buffer. The membrane was then incubated with the secondary anti-mouse IgG (H&L) antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 30–40 min. After washing, the bound antibodies were visualized by the alkaline phosphatase-mediated color reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrates. The free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was measured using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3-AM as described previously (17Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cells grown for ∼18 h after transfection were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) and incubated in KRH buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mmglucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) without MgCl2 or CaCl2 at room temperature for 45 min and then at 37 °C for 45 min. After being detached from culture dishes by pipetting, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min in a Thermo/EC Centra CL2 centrifuge. The cell pellets were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 mg of streptomycin/ml, 4.5 g of glucose/liter, and 10% fetal calf serum and were loaded with 10 μm fluo-3-AM at room temperature for 60 min. The fluo-3-loaded cells were washed with KRH buffer three times and resuspended in KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone. An aliquot of fluo-3-loaded cells was then added to 2 ml (final volume) of KRH buffer in a cuvette, and the fluorescence intensity of fluo-3 at 530 nm was measured in an SLM-Aminco series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 480-nm excitation at 25 °C (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Preparation of cell lysates from transfected HEK293 cells was carried out as described previously (21Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysate was also performed as described previously with some modifications (21Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A binding mixture (300 μl) containing 30 μl of cell lysate (3–5 mg/ml), 500 mm KCl, 25 mmTris, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 nm[3H]ryanodine, 0.4 μm free Ca2+, and a protease inhibitor mix containing 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, was incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h. The binding mix was diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 250 mm KCl and immediately filtered through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed four times with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer, and the radioactivity associated with the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 50 μm unlabeled ryanodine. All of the binding assays were done in duplicate. The entire coding region of RyR3 from rabbit uterus was amplified by using RT-PCR and eight pairs of PCR primers (Fig. 1 A). The resulting overlapping cDNA fragments (PCR1 through PCR8) were subcloned into the pBluescript vector. At least 14 individual clones of each RT-PCR fragment were isolated and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion. A single digestion pattern was observed when individual clones of the PCR1, PCR3, and PCR4 fragments were digested with multiple restriction endonucleases (data not shown). On the other hand, two or more digestion patterns were detected in clones of PCR2, PCR5, PCR6, PCR7, and PCR8, indicating that each of these later PCR products contain heterogeneous DNA species. The nature of this heterogeneity was further investigated by DNA sequence analysis. Two or three clones of each PCR fragment representing each unique digestion pattern were sequenced. This analysis revealed that as many as seven regions in RyR3 cDNA were either excluded or included (Fig. 1 B and Table I). Exclusion of regions AS-6, AS-7, AS-8a, and AS-8b led to deletions of 5, 6, 29, and 51 amino acids, respectively, without changing the reading frame. Exclusion of region AS-7 also led to a substitution of Arg for Gly3724. On the other hand, exclusion of regions AS-2 and AS-5 resulted in a frameshift. Different from other regions, AS-4 represented an insertion of a single serine residue after valine 2271 as a result of using an alternative splicing acceptor site (Table I). A comparison between the intron/exon boundaries of the human RyR3 gene and the sequences of these deleted regions (Table I) reveals that each of these regions corresponds to one or more exons of the human RyR3 gene (Table I and Fig. 1 B). Thus, the exclusion of these regions is most likely generated by alternative splicing.Table ILocations and sequences of the alternatively spliced junctions Open table in a new tab To examine whether alternative splicing of the RyR3 transcript also occurs in tissues other than uterus, total RNA from rabbit vas deferens, aorta, stomach, small intestine, heart, brain, and diaphragm were isolated and used for RT-PCR. RyR3-specific primers flanking each splice region identified in uterus (except for AS-4) were used to amplify cDNA fragments both containing and lacking each splice region at the same time. RT-PCR products along with those generated from plasmid clones containing (control 1) or lacking (control 2) the known splice region were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The sequences of RT-PCR fragments obtained from different tissues were confirmed to be identical to RyR3 by direct sequencing. Both the exclusion and inclusion of splice regions AS-2, AS-5, AS-7, AS-8a, and AS-8b were observed in all smooth muscle tissues examined (Fig. 2, a,b, and d–f, lanes 3–7). However, for the most part, only the inclusion of these regions was detected in heart, brain, and diaphragm (Fig. 2, a, b, andd–f, lanes 8–10). Thus, the deletion of these regions seems to be smooth muscle-specific. On the other hand, only the exclusion of region AS-6 was detected in smooth muscle tissues, heart, and diaphragm, whereas both the exclusion and inclusion of this region were observed in brain. Hence, the inclusion of region AS-6 appears to be brain-specific. Of all splice variants detected in smooth muscle tissues, splice variant AS-8a (containing deletion of the AS-8a region) appears to be highly expressed (Fig. 2 e). To further quantify the level of the AS-8a splice variant, we performed a ribonuclease protection assay using total RNA isolated from uterus, aorta, heart, brain, and diaphragm and an antisense32P-labeled RNA probe that encompasses the AS-8a region. A major band with a size of ∼114 bases and a minor band of ∼231 bases were detected in uterus and aorta (Fig. 3). The 231-base band corresponds to transcripts that contain the AS-8a region (AS-8a (+)), whereas the 114-base band represents transcripts that lack the AS-8a region (AS-8a (−)). The relative level of the 114-base AS-8a (−) band, as determined by phosphorimaging analysis, was more than 5-fold of that of the 231-base AS-8a (+) band in uterus and aorta. In contrast, the relative level of AS-8a (+) band (231 bases) detected in heart, brain, and diaphragm was about 5-fold of that of the AS-8a (−) band (114 bases). The AS-8a (−) transcript was also found to be the major transcript expressed in vas deferens and stomach (data not shown). Hence, consistent with the results of RT-PCR (Fig. 2), these ribonuclease protection assay results indicate that the AS-8a splice variant is highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues but not in the heart, brain, or diaphragm. To investigate the functional properties of the highly expressed AS-8a splice variant, we constructed a RyR3 cDNA containing a deletion of the 87-bp AS-8a region and expressed the RyR3 (AS-8a) cDNA in HEK293 cells. Functional characterization revealed that the AS-8a splice variant did not form a functional Ca2+ release channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells. Because both the alternatively spliced and unspliced forms of AS-8a transcripts are present in smooth muscle tissues, it is possible that the AS-8a splice variant and the unspliced RyR3 form heteromeric RyR3 channels. To test this possibility, we inserted the c-Myc antibody epitope tag into RyR3 (wt) and the HA tag into RyR3 (AS-8a) and co-expressed them in HEK293 cells. Interactions between RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) and RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) were examined by immunoprecipitation. Fig. 4 a (top panel) shows that the anti-c-Myc antibody was able to pull down RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) from lysate of HEK293 cells transfected with RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) or co-transfected with RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) and RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) (lanes 1 and 3) but not RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) from cells transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) alone (lane 2). The same anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitates were subsequently blotted with the anti-HA antibody. This antibody recognized a major band in the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitate from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) and RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) (lane 3, bottom panel), but not from cells transfected with RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) alone (lane 1, bottom panel). These data indicate that the anti-c-Myc and anti-HA antibodies are specific and that RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) when expressed together with RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) can be co-precipitated with RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) by the anti-c-Myc antibody. We also performed the reciprocal experiment in which the RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) was immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody and the presence of RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4 b (top panel), the anti-HA antibody pulled down the RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) (lanes 2 and 3) but not the RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) (lane 1). The anti-c-Myc antibody did not cross-react with the RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) (lane 2, bottom panel), but recognized a major band in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate from cells co-transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) and RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) (lane 3, bottom panel). Hence, although the anti-HA antibody is unable to pull down RyR3 (wt, c-Myc), it is able to precipitate the RyR3 (wt, c-Myc) in the presence of RyR3 (AS-8a, HA). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is able to form heteromeric complexes with the wild type RyR3. The ability of the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant to form heteromeric complexes was further assessed by complementation analysis using a RyR3 mutant. The rationale being that if RyR3 (AS-8a) is able to form heteromeric channels with other RyR3 variants, co-expression of RyR3 (AS-8a) with a nonfunctional RyR3 mutant may produce a functional heteromeric channel, because two nonfunctional mutants may complement each other's defects. During deletion analysis of RyR3, we generated a caffeine-insensitive RyR3 mutant, RyR3 (ΔE2256-T2429). To test whether RyR3 (AS-8a) can complement this mutant, HEK293 cells were transfected individually or in combination with RyR3 (AS-8a) and RyR3 (ΔE2256-T2429). As indicated in Fig. 5, HEK293 cells transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a; Fig. 5 a) or RyR3 (ΔE2256-T2429; Fig. 5 b) alone did not respond to caffeine, whereas co-expression of RyR3 (AS-8a) and RyR3 (ΔE2256-T2429) led to a caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ release (Fig. 5,c–e). These data suggest that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is able to form functional heteromeric channels with other RyR3 variants. The functional aspect of the RyR3 (AS-8a)/RyR3 (wt) heteromeric complexes was further investigated by examining their caffeine response. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with RyR3 (wt) and pCDNA3 vector cDNA or with RyR3 (wt) and RyR3 (AS-8a). The peaks of Ca2+ release from aliquots of transfected cells induced by different concentrations of caffeine (0.05–20 mm) were measured. As shown in Fig. 6, Ca2+ release from RyR3 (wt)-transfected cells was activated by caffeine with an EC50 of 0.87 + 0.09 mm (mean ± S.E.,n = 3). On the other hand, Ca2+ release from cells co-transfected with RyR3 (wt) and RyR3 (AS-8a) was activated by caffeine with an EC50 of 2.4 + 0.02 mm(n = 3). Therefore, co-expression of RyR3 (AS-8a) reduces the caffeine sensitivity of RyR3 (wt), suggesting that by forming heteromeric channels, the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant can influence the activity of RyR3 (wt). We have recently shown that RyR3 (wt) is capable of forming heteromeric channels with RyR2 (wt) in HEK293 cells (24Xiao B. Masumiya H. Jiang D. Wang R. Sei Y. Zhang L. Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Lai F.A. Wagenknecht T. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41778-41785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One would expect that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant would be also able to form heteromeric channels with RyR2 (wt). To directly test this hypothesis, we co-expressed HA-tagged RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) with c-Myc-tagged RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) in HEK293 cells. The association of RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) with RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) was examined by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. As indicated in Fig. 7 A (panel a), in addition to precipitating RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) from cells transfected with RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) alone (lane 1, top panel) or co-transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) and RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) (lane 3, top panel), the anti-c-Myc antibody was also able to precipitate RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) from cells co-transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) and RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) (lane 3, bottom panel) but not from cells transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) alone (lane 2). Similarly, in a reciprocal experiment, the anti-HA antibody was able to pull down RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) from cells co-transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) and RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) (Fig. 7 A, panel b, lane 3), but not from cells transfected with RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) alone (Fig. 7 A,panel b, lane 1). Taken together, these data indicate that RyR3 (AS-8a, HA) and RyR2 (wt, c-Myc) when expressed together can be co-precipitated either by anti-HA or anti-c-Myc antibody, demonstrating that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant, like RyR3 (wt), can form heteromeric complexes with RyR2 (wt). To examine whether the physical interaction between RyR3 (AS-8a) and RyR2 (wt) affect the activity of RyR2 (wt), we co-transfected HEK293 cells with RyR2 (wt) and RyR3 (AS-8a) or RyR2 (wt) with vector DNA, pCDNA3. [3H]Ryanodine binding to lysates of co-transfected HEK293 cells were determined. As shown in Fig. 7 B, no [3H]ryanodine binding was detected in cells transfected with RyR3 (AS-8a) alone, consistent with the results of Ca2+ release experiments (Fig. 5 a) that showed that RyR3 (AS-8a) does not form a functional Ca2+release channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, co-expression of RyR3 (AS-8a) reduced [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 (wt) by about 50%. [3H]ryanodine binding has been widely used as a functional assay for RyR channel activities, because ryanodine binds to only the open state of the channel. Thus, these studies indicate that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is able to suppress not only the activity of RyR3 (wt) (Fig. 6) but also the activity of RyR2 (wt) (Fig. 7 B) through the formation of heteromeric channels. The results of our present study demonstrate that the majority of the RyR3 transcripts expressed in various smooth muscle tissues contain a deletion of an 87-base pair region encoding a 29-amino acid fragment (His4406–Lys4434) encompassing a predicted transmembrane segment (25Zorzato F.

This major RyR3 splice variant, RyR3 (AS-8a), when expressed by itself in HEK293 cells, does not form a functional Ca2+ release channel but in combination with the wild type RyR3 is able to form functional heteromeric channels with reduced caffeine sensitivity (Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, this major RyR3 splice variant is also able to form heteromeric channels with and suppress the activity of RyR2 (Fig. 7). Together, these observations reveal a novel mechanism of RyR regulation in which the activity of RyR3 and RyR2 can be inhibited by a RyR3 splice variant through a dominant negative effect. Among the three known RyR isoforms, RyR3 is the most heterogeneous in both function and regulation (3Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Murayama T. Adv. Biophys. 1999; 36: 27-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of its major heterogeneities is its response to caffeine activation. RyR3 expressed in skeletal muscle and the brain is caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive (9Takeshima H. Yamazawa T. Ikemoto T. Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas RyR3 expressed in uterine smooth muscle cells is ryanodine-sensitive but caffeine-insensitive (11Lynn S. Morgan J.M. Gillespie J.I. Greenwell J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Lynn S. Morgan J.M. Lamb H.K. Meissner G. Gillespie J.I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this tissue- or cell-dependent RyR3 heterogeneity is unclear. Our findings that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues but not in skeletal muscle and the brain and that co-expression of this major splice variant with the wild type RyR3 reduces the caffeine sensitivity of RyR3 strongly suggest that tissue-specific expression of RyR3 splice variants, in particular the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant, may account for the heterogeneous caffeine response of RyR3 observed in different tissues or cells. In support of this view, the corresponding AS-8a region was found to be deleted in RyR3 from mink lung epithelial cells, which also display ryanodine-sensitive but caffeine-insensitive Ca2+ release (14Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V. Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Ryanodine-sensitive but caffeine-insensitive Ca2+release activity was also observed in human Jurkat T-cells (15Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to see whether the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is expressed in these cells. The physiological function of the AS-8a splice variant is unknown. Because caffeine activates RyR by sensitizing the channel to Ca2+ activation, altered caffeine response may reflect changes in Ca2+ regulation. In this context, it is of interest to know that RyR3 expressed in nonpregnant myometrial smooth muscle cells does not respond to activation by Ca2+ and caffeine under normal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading but becomes active when sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading is increased (27Mironneau J. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Sorrentino V. Mironneau C. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that RyR3 from these smooth muscle cells has a reduced sensitivity to activation by luminal Ca2+ and that its activity is normally suppressed. It remains to be explored whether the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is highly expressed in these smooth muscle cells and whether this splice variant is involved in luminal Ca2+ regulation. Another observation that may provide some clues to the physiological role of the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant comes from a study using RyR3 knock-out mice. Cerebral artery smooth muscle cells isolated from these mice displayed an increased frequency of Ca2+ sparks and spontaneous transient outward currents and a reduced myogenic tone as compared with the wild type cells (13Lohn M. Jessner W. Furstenau M. Wellner M. Sorrentino V. Haller H. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings led to the suggestion that Ca2+ sparks and spontaneous transient outward currents in arterial vascular smooth muscle cells are negatively regulated by RyR3. The molecular mechanism by which RyR3 inhibits Ca2+ spark frequency is not clear. It has been proposed that RyR1 and RyR2, but not RyR3, are responsible for Ca2+ spark generation and that inhibition of Ca2+ spark frequency may result from RyR3-mediated prolonged Ca2+ release, which may then inactivate RyR1 or RyR2 (13Lohn M. Jessner W. Furstenau M. Wellner M. Sorrentino V. Haller H. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The findings that RyR3 expressed in myometrial smooth muscle cells is inactive under normal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+loading and that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant, the major form of RyR3 expressed in various smooth muscle tissues, does not form a functional Ca2+ release channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells are inconsistent with the idea of RyR3-mediated prolonged Ca2+ release. Alternatively, our observation that the RyR3 (AS-8a) splice variant is able to interact physically with and suppress the activity of RyR2 suggests the interesting possibility that RyR3 expressed in smooth muscle cells as a splice variant may suppress Ca2+ sparks, spontaneous transient outward currents, and myogenic tone by forming heteromeric channel complexes with RyR2. Thus, it appears that the main functional role of RyR3 in smooth muscle cells differs from that of RyR3 in skeletal muscle and the brain. Unlike RyR3 expressed in skeletal muscle, where it functions as a Ca2+release channel, RyR3 expressed in smooth muscles or epithelial cells in the form of alternatively spliced variants may function largely as a suppressor of Ca2+ release. The observation that very low levels of RyR3 transcripts that contain the AS-8a region were detected in various smooth muscle tissues as compared with those of the AS-8a splice transcripts is in agreement with this view (Fig. 2). An excess amount of the AS-8a splice variant would ensure that all of the wt RyR3 subunits would be oligomerized with the AS-8a, so that no homomeric wt RyR3 channels or heteromeric wt RyR3/AS-8a channels with high wt RyR3:AS-8a subunit ratios would be formed to suppress the activity of the wt RyR3 channels. Because AS-8a can also form heteromeric channels with wt RyR2, the AS-8a splice variant may also be involved in oligomerization with wt RyR2 where they are co-expressed, as shown in vascular smooth muscle. It is important to note that an excess amount of AS-8a does not completely suppress the activity of either wt RyR3 or wt RyR2. We were able to detect the activity of RyR3 or RyR2, although at reduced levels, after co-expression of AS-8a with wt RyR3 in a ratio of 15:1 (AS-8a:wt RyR3) or with RyR2 in a 10:1 ratio (AS-8a:wt RyR2) in HEK293 cells (Figs. 6and 7). In addition to AS-8a, several other splice regions in RyR3 have also been detected in various smooth muscle tissues (Fig. 2). Of these splice regions, AS-2 and AS-5 are of interest. They are located near the 5′-end and in the middle of the RyR3 cDNA, respectively (Fig. 1). Exclusion of each of these regions leads to a frameshift and is predicted to result in the synthesis of truncated RyR3 proteins containing the first NH2-terminal ∼800 and ∼2900 amino acid residues, respectively. These truncated RyR3 proteins lack the COOH-terminal pore-forming region and, if expressed alone, would be nonfunctional. However, whether they can form heteromeric channel complexes with and thereby affect the channel activity of the full-length RyR3 or RyR2 remains to be assessed. We have previously shown that co-expression of NH2-terminal fragments of RyR2 with overlapping COOH-terminal fragments produces functional Ca2+ release channels in HEK293 cells (28Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that the NH2-terminal region of RyR2 is able to interact functionally with the COOH-terminal region. It will be of interest to determine whether the NH2-terminal regions of RyR3, corresponding to the AS-2 and AS-5 splice variants, are able to interact functionally with the COOH-terminal regions of RyR3 and RyR2. The presence of these frameshifted splice variants raises the possibility that splice variants such as AS-8a, whose splice regions are located downstream of the frameshifted splice regions, are not made into proteins in smooth muscles, despite their existence at the RNA level. Based on the results shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that not all of the RyR3 transcripts are alternatively spliced in the AS-2 or AS-5 regions, because considerable levels of AS-2 (+) and AS-5 (+) transcripts were detected in various smooth muscle tissues. Thus, some RyR3 transcripts without the AS-2 and AS-5 deletions are likely to exist and be translated. Consistent with this view, RyR3 expressed in uterine smooth muscle cells has been shown to function as a Ca2+ release channel with properties different from those of RyR3 expressed in skeletal muscle and the brain (27Mironneau J. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Sorrentino V. Mironneau C. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RyR3 expressed in vascular myocytes is capable of binding fluorescent ryanodine, suggesting that vascular RyR3 is also functional (29Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that, although frameshifted alternatively spliced transcripts are present in smooth muscles, not all of the RyR3 proteins expressed in smooth muscles were in the truncated form and that some of the RyR3 transcripts must have been translated all the way to the 3′-end encoding the channel conduction pathway to be functional. The presence of both the alternatively spliced and nonspliced transcripts and the detection of functional RyR3 with altered properties suggest that multiple alternatively spliced variants are co-expressed in smooth muscles at the protein level. To test this possibility, antibodies that recognize the NH2-terminal region of RyR3 would be useful in detecting the expression of the AS-2 and AS-5 proteins. Direct amino acid determination of the appropriate protease fragments of RyR3 isolated from smooth muscle tissues that encompasses the AS-8a or other splice regions by the use of mass spectrometry would represent an alternative approach to definitively demonstrate the existence of AS-8a or other splice variants at the protein level. Further investigations are required to characterize the functional properties of other potential RyR3 splice variants and to delineate the physiological roles of RyR3 splice variants in smooth muscles and other cells.

In this study, we observed that nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells leads to a progressive increase in the expression of AChE transcripts, reaching ∼3.5-fold by 72 h. Given that the AChE 3′-untranslated region (UTR) contains an AU-rich element, we focused on the potential role of the RNA-binding protein HuD in mediating the increase in AChE mRNA seen in differentiating neurons. Using PC12 cells engineered to stably express HuD or an antisense to HuD, our studies indicate that HuD can regulate the abundance of AChE transcripts in neuronal cells. Furthermore, transfection of a reporter construct containing the AChE 3′-UTR showed that this 3′-UTR can increase expression of the reporter gene product in cells expressing HuD but not in cells expressing the antisense. RNA gel shifts and Northwestern blots revealed an increase in the binding of several protein complexes in differentiated neurons. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HuD can bind directly AChE transcripts. These results show the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in regulating AChE expression in differentiating neurons and implicate HuD as a keytrans-acting factor in these events.

The enzyme exists in multiple molecular forms that differ in their C terminus and mode of anchoring to subcellular structures. The different C termini of the protein are generated through alternative splicing of a single gene, and three different mature mRNAs, referred to as the T (tail), H (hydrophobic), and R (readthrough) transcripts, can be produced. The pattern of expression of these transcripts is known to be tissue-specific because, for example, the T transcript is abundantly expressed in excitable cells such as skeletal muscle and neurons, whereas the H transcript is found predominantly in the hematopoietic lineage. Two polyadenylation signals can be used in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) to produce a ∼2.4- or 3.2-kb transcripts. Choice of the polyadenylation signal is also tissue-specific because neurons appear to preferentially express the shorter form of the transcript whereas skeletal muscle express both species but in different amounts (5Legay C.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Google Scholar). By contrast, there is relatively little information concerning the mechanisms regulating AChE expression in neurons. In addition, of the few available reports, there also appear to be some contradictory findings. In particular, Greene and Rukenstein (31Greene L.A. Rukenstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6363-6367Google Scholar) have provided evidence indicating that differentiation of PC12 cells, which leads to an increase in AChE expression, induces an increase in AChE gene transcription. Alternatively, embryonic P19 carcinoma cells induced to differentiate into neurons via retinoic acid treatment failed to increase the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene, thereby indicating that post-transcriptional mechanisms represent key events in regulating the abundance of AChE transcripts during neuronal development (32Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Google Scholar). Given the diverse and key functions of AChE within the nervous system, it appears important to gain a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control AChE expression in neurons. Accordingly, we have initiated a series of experiments in attempts to characterize some of the molecular events involved in AChE expression during neuronal differentiation. Specifically, we have examined the importance of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of AChE during NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma-derived cell line (33Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Ruckenstein A. Greene S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 147: 207-216Google Scholar), were cultured on culture dishes coated with type I collagen (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, in a humidified chamber at 37 °C containing 5% CO2. Stably transfected PC12 cells were maintained as described elsewhere (34Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Google Scholar). These lines were transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone (pcDNA) or with plasmids containing the human HuD sequence in sense (pcHuD) or antisense (pDuH) orientation. All cells were plated at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/cm2 and induced to differentiate by adding 100 ng/ml 7S-NGF (Sigma) to the culture medium. Culture media were changed every 72 h. Cultures of undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells (three 35-mm wells) were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped, and homogenized on ice with a glass Kontes homogenizer in 0.5 ml of a high salt detergent buffer containing anti-proteolytic agents (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma), and 25 units/ml aprotinin (Sigma)). Following centrifugation of the homogenates (20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was removed and stored immediately at −80 °C. AChE activity was measured using a modified version of the spectrophotometric method of Ellman et al. (35Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Google Scholar) as described previously (36Jasmin B.J. Gisiger V. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1444-1454Google Scholar). The total amount of protein present in the extracts was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Pierce). Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cell cultures (three 35-mm wells) using 0.5–1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were scraped from the plates and disrupted by vigorous pipetting, followed by addition of chloroform. The resulting solution was mixed vigorously and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). The aqueous layer was then transferred to a fresh tube and combined with an equal volume of isopropanol. The RNA was precipitated by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was washed twice with 75% ice-cold ethanol and resuspended in RNase-free water. All samples were stored in −80 °C until used. RNA from each sample was quantified using the AmershamBiosciences Gene Quant II RNA/DNA spectrophotometer and adjusted to a final concentration of 80 ng/μl. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed using 2 μl of each RNA sample at 42 °C for 45 min, followed by 5 min at 99 °C, as previously described elsewhere (37Boudreau-Lariviere C. Sveistrup H. Parry D.J. Jasmin B.J. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 613-622Google Scholar, 38Michel R.N. Vu C.Q. Tetzlaff W. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1061-1069Google Scholar, 39Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Google Scholar). Negative controls consist of the same RT mixture in which the RNA was replaced with 2 μl of RNase-free water. PCR was used to amplify cDNAs corresponding to AChE and S12 rRNA as described in detail elsewhere (23Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Google Scholar, 37Boudreau-Lariviere C. Sveistrup H. Parry D.J. Jasmin B.J. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 613-622Google Scholar, 38Michel R.N. Vu C.Q. Tetzlaff W. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1061-1069Google Scholar, 39Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Google Scholar). Primers for AChE (see Ref. 12Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulie J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Google Scholar) and S12 rRNA (used as an internal control; see Ref. 40Forster E. Otten U. Frotscher M. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 155: 216-219Google Scholar) were synthesized based on available sequences that have been previously described, and they amplified products of 670 and 368 bp, respectively. PCR cycling parameters for AChE and S12 rRNA consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, followed by primer annealing and extension for 3 min at 70 °C for AChE and primer annealing for 1 min at 54 °C and extension for 2 min at 72 °C for S12 rRNA, followed by a 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. PCR products were visualized and quantified on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels. Quantitation of the labeling intensity of the PCR products was performed using the Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440 CF and related Kodak Digital Science 1D Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Co.). All values obtained for AChE were corrected according to the corresponding level of S12 rRNA present in the sample. All RT-PCR experiments aimed at determining the relative abundance of AChE transcripts were performed using cycle numbers that fell within the linear range of amplification (37Boudreau-Lariviere C. Sveistrup H. Parry D.J. Jasmin B.J. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 613-622Google Scholar, 38Michel R.N. Vu C.Q. Tetzlaff W. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1061-1069Google Scholar, 39Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Google Scholar). The cycle numbers were between 24 and 27 for AChE and 22 for S12 rRNA. RT-PCR conditions (primer concentration, input RNA, choice of RT primer, cycling conditions) were initially optimized, and these were identical for all experiments. Appropriate precautions (use of sterile filtered tips and gloves) were taken to prevent contamination of the samples and degradation of the RNA. Samples, including the negative control, were always prepared using the same RT and PCR reagents and master mixes, and were run in parallel. In all experiments, PCR products were never detected in the negative controls. Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described in detail elsewhere (23Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Google Scholar, 41Boudreau-Lariviere C. Jasmin B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 22-26Google Scholar, 42Chan R.Y. Adatia F.A. Krupa A.M. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9727-9733Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells (two 250-ml flasks) and resuspended in a transcription buffer containing GTP, ATP, CTP, and 25 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. RNA was transcribed for 60 min at 30 °C in the presence of an RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). Following a 30-min RQ1 DNase I (Promega) treatment, the nascent radiolabeled RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (see above) and hybridized for 48 h to 10 μg of linearized AChE cDNA (2 kb) immobilized on a Protran pure nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After hybridization the membranes were washed thoroughly at 42 °C in a 1× saline-sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution and subjected to autoradiography. The intensity of the resulting signals was quantified using a STORM PhosphorImager and the accompanying ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The signals corresponding to AChE were standardized relative to the signal obtained from genomic DNA. The recently described 5.3-kb AChE promoter fragment termed GRAP (25Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Lariviere C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Google Scholar) was subcloned into a LacZ reporter vector. In addition, the 3′-UTR from the mouse ∼2.4-kb AChE transcript, which contains the shorter 3′-UTR in comparison to the ∼3.2-kb AChE mRNA (see Introduction), was amplified by RT-PCR and first inserted into the pGL3 vector. For these experiments, we focused on the short 3′-UTR as opposed to the longer one because (i) previous studies showed that it appears to contain important cis-acting regulatory elements (24Boudreau-Lariviere C. Chan R.Y. Wu J. Jasmin B.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2250-2258Google Scholar, 43Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Google Scholar, 44Sketelj J. Crne-Finderle N. Strukelj B. Trontelj J.V. Pette D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1944-1952Google Scholar), and (ii) the ∼2.4-kb AChE transcript is considerably more abundant in nervous tissues (12Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulie J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Google Scholar) including PC12 cells (45Li Y. Liu L. Kang J. Sheng J.G. Barger S.W. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 149-155Google Scholar, 46Meshorer E. Erb C. Gazit R. Pavlovsky L. Kaufer D. Friedman A. Glick D. Ben Arie N. Soreq H. Science. 2002; 295: 508-512Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR was subsequently cloned into a luciferase reporter construct driven by the thymidine kinase promoter (phRG-TK) (Promega). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Mega-Prep procedure (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). DNA pellets were resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Undifferentiated cells (1–2 × 105cells/cm2) were transfected with 0.5 μg of the appropriate reporter gene construct and 0.5 μg of the constitutively expressed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid driven by the SV40 promoter used, in this case, to control for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were induced to differentiate 24 h later by the addition of NGF. To determine reporter gene activity, undifferentiated and differentiated cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in Reporter-Lysis buffer (Promega) following two cycles of freezing and thawing. The extracts were then centrifuged (15,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants were assayed for β-galactosidase, luciferase, or CAT activities using available kits (Promega). The β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were normalized to CAT levels. Background values, obtained by transfecting promoterless LacZ and luciferase plasmids, were subtracted from the activities obtained with the reporter constructs. cDNAs encoding different lengths of the AChE 3′-UTR were obtained by PCR amplification of the plasmid template pGL3–3′-UTR (see above). The PCR primers employed to amplify: 1) the full-length AChE 3′-UTR, 2) a truncated fragment in which the AU-rich element was absent (−ARE), and 3) a small fragment encompassing the ARE (see Fig. 5A), were designed to include a T7 promoter. An in vitro T7 transcription system (Promega) was used to synthesize radiolabeled AChE 3′-UTR fragments. Briefly, the transcription reaction containing 0.5 μg of PCR fragment, 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, nucleotides, RNase inhibitor, and T7 polymerase, was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The template PCR fragments were digested with 1 unit of RQ1 DNase I (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C. The resulting radiolabeled RNA was purified on an RNase-free G-25 RNA purification column (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Unlabeled RNA probes were generated by the same method and used in cold competition assays. RNA-based electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSAs) and Northwestern blots were performed using total protein extracts obtained from undifferentiated and differentiated cells (two 250-ml flasks). The cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped, and lysed in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 60 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 10 μg/μl pepstatin A, 1 μg/μl aprotinin, pH 7.4). The samples were centrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was stored at −80 °C until used. The total amount of protein present in the extracts was determined by the BCA method (see above). REMSAs were performed as described elsewhere in detail (47Alterio J. Mallet J. Biguet N.F. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 179-189Google Scholar, 48Hew Y. Lau C. Grzelczak Z. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24857-24864Google Scholar, 49Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Google Scholar). Forty μg of protein extract were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled AChE 3′-UTR fragments in 2× binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.2 μg/μl yeast tRNA) in a total volume of 20 μl. The unbound RNA was digested with ribonuclease T1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 20 min at 37 °C, and the samples were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min with heparin (2.5 mg/ml). This mixture was separated by 4 or 6% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 0.5× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) running buffer. The gels were subsequently dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Competition assays were performed by incubating a 25 m excess of cold probe with the protein extract for 10 min prior to the incubation with the radiolabeled probe. Northwestern analyses were performed according to the procedure described elsewhere (50Erondu N.E. Nwankwo J. Zhong Y. Boes M. Dake B. Bar R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 495-504Google Scholar, 51Sagesser R. Martinez E. Tsagris M. Tabler M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3816-3822Google Scholar). Fifty μg of protein extract diluted in SDS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) were denatured at 100 °C for 3 min and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. After separation, proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was then incubated in renaturation buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm DTT, 0.1% (w/v) Ficoll 400 d-L, 0.1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.01% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (a Nonidet P-40 substitute) in RNase-free water) at 4 °C overnight. Following pre-hybridization at room temperature for 1 h in renaturation buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA, the membrane was incubated for 4 h with 1 × 106cpm/ml of a probe corresponding to the radiolabeled AChE 3′-UTR RNA dissolved in renaturation buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA and 5 mg/ml heparin at room temperature. After several 5-min washes, the membrane was put to x-ray film at −70 °C. To ensure that equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded for each sample, membranes were also stained with Ponceau S (Sigma), following exposure to x-ray films. The RNA-binding protein HuD was immunoprecipitated from a total protein extract as described (52Chung S. Eckrich M. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6593-6598Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted from PC12 cells stably transfected to express HuD (8 × 100-mm plate). To this end, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.3 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg/μl pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/μl aprotinin, 10 units of RNase inhibitor), and sonicated (10-s pulse at 50% duty cycle and a power output of 1 using the Branson Sonifier 450). Protein samples (200 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, with an affinity-purified antibody to HuD previously described (34Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Google Scholar) or with normal rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in IP buffer. This reaction mixture was subsequently added to 20 μl of pre-washed A/G chimera Sepharose beads (Pierce) and incubated by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged (10,000 × g for 20 s), and the supernatant was removed. After several washes with IP buffer, the RNA was extracted from the pellet using the TRIzol reagent and analyzed by RT-PCR as described above. Cultured cells were washed in 1× PBS; resuspended in a homogenization buffer containing 0.3 msucrose, 60 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg of leupeptin, 10 μg of pepstatin A, and 1 μg of aprotinin; and sonicated (see above). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of proteins in each sample was determined using the BCA method (see above). For Western blotting, 50 μg of protein extracts were denaturated in SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel. The proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma). Following transfer, the membranes were incubated with antibodies directed against HuD (34Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Google Scholar) and revealed using a commercially available ECL kit from Pierce. An analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the effects of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation on AChE expression. The Fisher's Least Square Difference test was used to determine whether the differences seen between group means were significant. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. throughout. In a first series of experiments, we examined the expression of AChE during the process of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Initially, we compared the level of cell-associated AChE between undifferentiated and 24-, 48-, and 72-h differentiated PC12 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that undifferentiated PC12 cells express a basal level of AChE activity that increases upon NGF stimulation (31Greene L.A. Rukenstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6363-6367Google Scholar, 53Inestrosa N.C. Reiness C.G. Reichardt L.F. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 1260-1267Google Scholar, 54Lucas C.A. Czlonkowska A. Kreutzberg G.W. Neurosci. Lett. 1980; 18: 333-337Google Scholar). In agreement with these earlier reports, Fig.1 A shows that AChE activity increases considerably during differentiation. In fact, the cell-associated activity increased significantly by ∼2.5-fold (p < 0.01) within the first 48 h, and reached a maximal 5-fold induction (p < 0.0001) following 72 h of NGF treatment. We next examined the impact of NGF on the relative abundance of AChE transcripts in PC12 cells. We focused on the level of the T transcript because this transcript is the predominant splice variant found in nervous tissues (12Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulie J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Google Scholar) and PC12 cells (45Li Y. Liu L. Kang J. Sheng J.G. Barger S.W. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 149-155Google Scholar, 46Meshorer E. Erb C. Gazit R. Pavlovsky L. Kaufer D. Friedman A. Glick D. Ben Arie N. Soreq H. Science. 2002; 295: 508-512Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1 B, AChE mRNAs could be detected in undifferentiated cells. However, treatment of PC12 cells with NGF led to a pronounced increase in the levels of AChE mRNA. These increases were highly significant, reaching more than 2-fold (p < 0.002) and 3.5-fold (p < 0.0001) by 48 and 72 h, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The relative amount of S12 rRNA, which was used as an internal control for these assays, did not change during differentiation. The observed increase in transcript level was directly related to the NGF treatment and not to the length of time in culture or cell density because, in separate studies, both of these factors had no effect on AChE expression (data not shown). In addition, NGF removal from the culture medium 24 h after the initial treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in AChE mRNA levels (data not shown). Because recent studies demonstrated the importance of transcriptional events in regulating AChE expression at the early stages of muscle differentiation (23Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Google Scholar, 30Siow N.L. Choi R.C. Cheng A.W. Jiang J.X. Wan D.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Google Scholar), we determined whether the increase in the abundance of AChE transcripts seen in differentiating PC12 cells could be linked to an increase in transcription. To this end, we performed transfection studies using an AChE promoter-reporter gene construct that cont"
https://openalex.org/W2169191806,"Under normoxic conditions the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein is targeted for degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) tumor suppressor protein acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Binding of pVHL to HIF-1α is dependent on hydroxylation of specific proline residues by O2-dependent prolyl 4-hydroxylases. Upon exposure to hypoxia the hydroxylase activity is inhibited, resulting in stabilization of HIF-1α protein levels and activation of transcription of target genes. One of the two critical proline residues, Pro563 in mouse HIF-1α, is located within a bifunctional domain, the N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD), which mediates both pVHL-dependent degradation at normoxia and transcriptional activation at hypoxia. Here we have identified two N-TAD residues, Tyr564 and Ile565, which, in addition to Pro563, were critical for pVHL-mediated degradation at normoxia. We have also identified D568A/D569A/D570A, F571A, and L573A as mutations of the N-TAD that abrogated binding to pVHL both in vitro andin vivo, and constitutively stabilized N-TAD against degradation. Moreover, the mutations Y564G, L556A/L558A, and F571A/L573A drastically reduced the transactivation function of either the isolated N-TAD or full-length HIF-1α in hypoxic cells. Interestingly, the P563A mutant exhibited a constitutively active and potent transactivation function that was enhanced by functional interaction with the transcriptional coactivator protein CREB-binding protein. In conclusion, we have identified by mutation analysis several residues that are critical for either one or both of the interdigitated and conditionally regulated degradation and transactivation functions of the N-TAD of HIF-1α.

In conclusion, we have identified by mutation analysis several residues that are critical for either one or both of the interdigitated and conditionally regulated degradation and transactivation functions of the N-TAD of HIF-1α. hypoxia-inducible factor von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product pVHL-ElonginB-ElonginC hypoxia-response element transactivation domain N-terminal TAD C-terminal TAD CREB-binding protein Tris-buffered saline human embryonic kidney Mammalian organisms are able to adapt to low oxygen levels by activating a network of genes encoding erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes (1Semenza G.L.

Hypoxia-dependent activation of transcription is mediated by the heterodimeric complex of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)1 with the structurally related partner factor Arnt. In contrast to Arnt, HIF-1α protein expression is regulated in response to alterations in cellular oxygen levels. At normoxia, HIF-1α is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway (2Salceda S.

HIF-1α contains two distinct transactivation domains that mediate hypoxia-dependent activation of transcription, the N-TAD (residues 531–584 and 532–585 in mHIF-1α and hHIF-1α, respectively) and the C-TAD (residues 772–822 of mouse HIF-1α corresponding to residues 776–826 in hHIF-1α) (7Jiang B.H.

However, the mechanism of regulation of these two TADs is quite distinct because N-TAD protein stability is strictly regulated by oxygen levels, whereas the C-TAD is constitutively stable (9Ema M.

In addition, the VHL gene is also inactivated in sporadic clear cell renal carcinoma.

We have identified previously a central563PYI565 motif within the N-TAD that is critical for binding of pVHL and conditional degradation of the N-TAD. In the present work we have identified further residues within the N-TAD that are important for binding of pVHL. Amino acid mutations that inhibit interaction with pVHL and subsequent degradation at normoxia include P563A, Y564G, I565G, D568A/D569A/D570A, F571A, and L573A. Moreover, reporter gene assays demonstrated that the P563A mutation generates a more potent and constitutively active transactivation domain, as compared with the wild type N-TAD. We have also shown that mutations that decrease N-TAD transactivation affect the activation of transcription mediated by the full-length HIF-1α. pFLAG-GAL4/mHIF-1α−(531–584) and pFLAG-GAL4/mHIF-1α-(546–574) were constructed by using PCR fragments generated with primer pairs carrying EcoRI andBamHI ends. The PCR fragments were inserted in-frame intoEcoRI-BamHI-restricted pFLAG-GAL4 (36Ruas J.L. Poellinger L. Pereira T. J. Biol.

The inserts generated by PCR were completely sequenced using the Dynamic sequencing kit (AmershamBiosciences). Amino acid mutations were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and positive mutants were screened by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium in a 1:1 ratio containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Medium and other products for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK 293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were cultured 24 h before transfection in 6-well plates, and cells incubated after transfection were cultured at normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for different times, as detailed in the figure legends. For reporter gene assays the cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was determined. Total protein concentration was analyzed in whole cell extracts using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). In vitroimmunoprecipitation assays were performed with proteins translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) either in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine. Translated proteins were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in lysis buffer in a volume of 100 μl (17Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and added to 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) preincubated with anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma) antibodies. After a further incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature under rotation, the Sepharose pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In in vivo immunoprecipitation assays transfected cells were used to prepare whole cell extracts by sonication of cells for 5 s (performed twice) in lysis buffer (17Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts (800 μg to 1 mg of total protein) were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with anti-FLAG-M2 antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose as described previously (36Ruas J.L. Poellinger L. Pereira T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38723-38730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Sepharose pellet was washed three times with TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 4.0), and precipitated proteins were eluted from Sepharose by incubation under rotation with 0.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in TBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitated proteins or 50 μg of whole cell extract protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Blocking was performed in TBS with 5% non-fat milk and was followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti-FLAG or anti-VHL (Pharmingen) antibodies diluted 1:500 and 1:250, respectively, in TBS with 5 and 1% non-fat milk, respectively. After several washes with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, the filters were incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS with 1% non-fat milk and washed several times with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). We have previously identified the N-TAD as an interaction interface with pVHL and have identified the PYI motif (residues 563–565 in mHIF-1α) as an essential motif for this interaction (17Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have generated point mutants of each single residue of the PYI motif and constructed double and triple mutants of the residues located N- or C-terminally of this motif (schematically represented in Fig.1 A). Interaction of N-TAD (FLAG-GAL4/mHIF-1α-(531–584)) and mutants with pVHL was investigated using proteins in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In these assays pVHL was [35S]methionine-labeled and precipitated by the FLAG-GAL4/mHIF-1α fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 B two of the N-TAD mutants, L556A/L558A (lane 4) and Q572A/R574A (lane 13), maintained wild type levels of pVHL binding activity, whereas P566E/M567E (lane 10) demonstrated reduced but detectable levels of pVHL binding activity. In contrast, all the point mutants of the PYI motif, P463A (lane 7), Y564G (lane 8), and I565G (lane 9) did not show any in vitro interaction with pVHL. Three additional N-TAD mutations, M560A/L561A (lane 5), D568A/D569A/D570A (lane 11), and F571A/L573A (lane 12) also completely abrogated binding of the N-TAD to pVHL. We and others (17Tanimoto K.

This interaction is inhibited when cells are exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia-mimicking agents (21Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F.

A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In the present report we have examined if binding of pVHL to the N-TAD can be observed without the use of proteosome inhibitors. To this end we used experimental conditions where overexpression of N-TAD will saturate the endogenous degradation machinery (17Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C). HEK 293 cells were transfected with pFLAG-GAL4/mHIF-1α-(531–584) and VHL expression plasmid, and the cells were exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 16 h followed by different times of reoxygenation. As shown in Fig. 1 C strong binding of VHL to the N-TAD can be observed in the absence of MG132 treatment after 1 (lane 2) and 10 min (lane 3) of reoxygenation. In contrast, much lower levels of N-TAD- pVHL interaction were observed either at normoxia (lane 1) or following 1 h (lane 4) of reoxygenation. Treatment of the cells with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 increased the levels of expressed pVHL (lanes 5–8) and inhibited the decrease in pVHL binding observed after 1 h of reoxygenation (lane 8). Interestingly, binding of VHL to the N-TAD was increased also in the cells treated with MG132 under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that some modification occurs during hypoxia that allows a more efficient recruitment of pVHL when the cells return to normoxia. Possibly, these observations could be explained by an increase in prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity during reoxygenation because some of these prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzymes have been shown to be induced at the mRNA levels by hypoxia (25Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Given these results we performed the subsequentin vivo VHL binding assays using cells not treated with MG132 and exposed to short periods of reoxygenation. In order to know if the mutants that disrupt the interaction between the N-TAD and pVHLin vitro are also critical for the binding in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using transfected cells expressing FLAG-GAL4-(531–584) mutants and pVHL. Abrogation of the interaction between the N-TAD and pVHL was observed in the case of the mutant P563D/Y564D/I565G (lanes 5 and 6) and the corresponding point mutants P563A (lanes 23 and24) and Y564G (lanes 13 and 14) (Fig.1 D). Notably, the hydrophobicity of Tyr564 plays an essential role in the binding to pVHL. Mutation of tyrosine to glycine completely disrupted binding of pVHL (Fig. 1 D). On the other hand, phosphorylation of Tyr564 does not seem to be relevant for pVHL interaction because the tyrosine residue could be replaced by phenylalanine without affecting the pVHL binding activity (data not shown). Mutation of residue Ile565 drastically reduced the interaction with pVHL but did not completely inhibit binding activity (lanes 15 and 16). Moreover, the two HIF-1α N-TAD mutants, D568A/D569A/D570A and F571A/L573A, which did not interact with pVHL, also failed to bind pVHL in vivo(Fig. 1 D, lanes 9–12). In contrast to thein vitro results (Fig. 1 B), mutation of residues Met560 and Leu561 did not inhibit pVHL bindingin vivo (Fig. 1 D, lanes 3 and4), possibly because of the absence in reticulocyte lysate of appropriate modifying enzymes (i.e. prolyl 4-hydroxylases) required for binding of pVHL to these mutants. Interestingly, the mutant P566E/M567E demonstrated significantly stronger pVHL binding activity than the wild type N-TAD (Fig.1 D,lanes 7 and 8). Interaction of pVHL was also observed with a shorter protein fragment of the N-TAD spanning residues 546–574 (lanes 17 and 18), whereas no binding was observed with the C-TAD (Fig. 1 D,lanes 19 and 20) that has been shown previously to be a constitutively stable but hypoxia-regulated transactivation domain of HIF-1α (9Ema M.

To evaluate the effect of different point mutations introduced into the N-TAD on the ability of pVHL to mediate protein degradation at normoxia (21% O2), we transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells pFLAG-GAL4-mHIF-1α-(531–584) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of pVHL. As shown in Fig. 2 A, N-TAD-(531–584) and N-TAD-(546–574) as well as the mutants L556A/L558A, M560A/L561A, and P565E/M566E were degraded by pVHL in a dose-dependent manner at normoxia. In these experiments the mutant M560A/L561A was more resistant to degradation than the other expressed GAL4 fusion proteins. In contrast, mutants P563D/Y564D/I565D, P563A, Y564G, I565G, D568A/D569A/D570A, FL571A/L573A, and the C-TAD (Fig. 2, Aand B) were not degraded even following exposure to the highest tested levels of pVHL tested. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that in vivo binding of pVHL to the various N-TAD mutants correlated with its ability to mediate degradation of these protein fragments. Because we performed our in vivobinding assays with cells exposed to normoxia or to conditions of reoxygenation, we also compared the efficiency of pVHL-mediated degradation under these two conditions (Fig. 2 C). Degradation of the wild type N-TAD motif was observed both at normoxia and in reoxygenated cells in a manner that was strictly dependent on the concentration of pVHL. In contrast, the N-TAD P563A mutant did not show any differences in protein levels between cells exposed to 21 or 1% O2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of pVHL (Fig. 2 C). In the case of the wild type N-TAD motif, pVHL was significantly more potent in mediating protein degradation under conditions of reoxygenation, as compared with normoxic cells, consistent with the notion that pVHL may have a higher affinity for the N-TAD in the reoxygenated cells (25Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

The mutants D568A/D569A/D570A and F571A/L573A failed to interact with pVHL in vitro andin vivo and were resistant to pVHL-mediated degradation at normoxia (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig.2 A). Because these are triple and double mutants, we also generated single amino acid point mutants of all these residues in a shorter protein fragment of the NTAD spanning residues 546–574 (pFLAG-GAL4-mHIF-1α-(546–574)). The mutants D568A, D569A, and Q572A were able to interact with pVHL in an in vitro binding assay (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5,6, and 9, respectively). In the case of the mutant D568A (lane 5) we consistently observed weaker binding to pVHL. In contrast to these results, mutation of residues Asp570, Phe571, and Leu572completely abrogate pVHL-N-TAD interaction (Fig. 3 A,lanes 7,8, and 10, respectively). In the in vivo pVHL-mediated degradation assay, the shorter fragment of the N-TAD spanning residues 546–574 and the mutant D570A were degraded by pVHL in a dose-dependent manner. The D570A was more resistant to pVHL-mediated degradation than the wild type. These results indicate the presence in HEK 293 cells of enzymes (notably one or several prolyl 4-hydroxylases) that facilitate binding of pVHL in vivo. The other two mutants F571A and L573A, which failed to bind pVHL in vitro, were resistant to pVHL-mediated degradation even at the highest doses of pVHL tested. These data demonstrated that, in addition to the PYI motif, residues Phe571 and Leu573 were critical for the physical interaction with pVHL and pVHL-mediated degradation of the N-TAD. The HIF-1α N-TAD motif has been shown previously to function as a bifunctional domain both constituting a hypoxia-regulated degradation box as well as a hypoxia-dependent transactivation domain that can be potentiated by coactivators such as p300/CBP (7Jiang B.H.

Here we show that the intramonomer interaction between the side chains of Asp29 and Arg87 influences dimerization significantly more than the intermonomer interaction between Asp29 and Arg8′.

The mature HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy protease, a homodimer composed of two 99-amino acid polypeptides, plays a critical role in the life cycle of retroviruses by processing the precursor proteins Gag and Gag-Pol into the essential mature structural and functional proteins (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185Google Scholar). Dimerization of the protease is indispensable for catalytic activity because each subunit contributes one of the two catalytic aspartic acid residues (Asp25) that form the active site (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185Google Scholar). The mature protease catalyzes its own release from the Gag-Pol precursor and forms a highly stable dimer (2Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Google Scholar,3Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Google Scholar). The two major areas that constitute the dimer interface are 1) the active site region 24–29 comprising the triplet Asp25-Thr26-Gly27 (DTG) forming a hydrogen bond network, called the “fireman's grip” (4Vondrasek J. van Buskirk C.P. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 8Google Scholar, 5Strisovsky K. Tessmer U. Langner J. Konvalinka J. Krausslich H.G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1631-1641Google Scholar) and 2) the four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet comprising residues 1–4 and 96–99 (Fig. 1) (4Vondrasek J. van Buskirk C.P. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 8Google Scholar, 6Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Google Scholar). These two interfaces are adjacent in the three-dimensional structure and form a nearly continuous region. Inhibitor or substrate binding to the protease further enhances the dimer stability (7Grant S.K. Deckman I.C. Culp J.S. Minnich M.D. Brooks I.S. Hensley P. Debouck C. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9491-9501Google Scholar, 8Todd M.J. Semo N. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 475-488Google Scholar). The active site of the mature protease has been the predominant target for drug development in the fight against AIDS (4Vondrasek J. van Buskirk C.P. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 8Google Scholar, 9Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Google Scholar). However, long term treatment of any HIV-infected individual is complicated by genetic variation in viral strains resulting in the selection of drug-resistant variants during therapy (10Condra J.H. Haemophilia. 1998; 4: 610-615Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional structure of the protease, it has been suggested that interfering with the terminal β-sheet, particularly disrupting the interaction between the two C-terminal strands, may provide an alternative mechanism for protease inhibition and drug design (6Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Google Scholar). This mode of inhibition may carry the added advantage of reducing the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Several reports indicate that peptides derived from the terminal regions of the protease inhibit enzymatic activity by blocking dimer formation (11Schramm H.J. Boetzel J. Buttner J. Fritsche E. Gohring W. Jaeger E. Konig S. Thumfart O. Wenger T. Nagel N.E. Schramm W. Antiviral Res. 1996; 30: 155-170Google Scholar, 12Cartas M. Singh S.P. Serio D. Rizvi T.A. Kalyanaraman V.S. Goldsmith C.S. Zaki S.R. Weber I.T. Srinivasan A. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 797-805Google Scholar). However, to date this has not been confirmed structurally, either by x-ray crystallography or NMR. In addition, potential leads of this kind have not been developed further for possible clinical use, to our knowledge. We are particularly interested in understanding the structural role of conserved regions in the protease sequence for monomer folding and dimerization. Residues in the dimer interface are well conserved both from the point of genetic variation and drug resistance (13.(hiv-web.lanl.gov).Google Scholar). In addition, the unique triad Gly86-Arg87-Asn/Asp88, is also invariant among retroviral proteases (Figs. 1 and 2) (14Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 351-354Google Scholar). These residues are located in the helical stretch of the structure, connecting the main body of the protein to the last β-strand of the terminal β-sheet (6Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Google Scholar). This motif appears to constitute a crucial structural element, because even a conservative mutation, R87K, disrupted dimerization of the mature protease (15Louis J.M. Smith C.A. Wondrak E.M. Mora P.T. Oroszlan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 30-38Google Scholar, 16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar). Interestingly, substrates with micromolar affinity to protease did not restore the dimeric form of PRR87K, as evidenced by its poor catalytic activity. In contrast, inhibitors with nanomolar affinity do induce dimer formation. We reasoned that the R87K mutation disturbed the interfacial β-sheet and therefore carefully assessed deletion mutants in which either the N- or C-terminal residues were absent (Fig. 2). Studies on PR-(1–95), PR-(5–99), and PR-(5–95) demonstrated that even though both the N- and C-terminal strands contributed to dimer stability, interactions between the C-terminal residues 96–99 that form the inner strands of the sheet were absolutely essential for dimer formation at protease concentrations below 1 mm (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar). Here we analyze the influence of two conserved active site interface residues on monomer folding and dimer formation. NMR studies indicated that both mutants, PRD29N and PRT26A, are monomers with a tertiary fold similar to that of the PRR87Kmonomer. In the three-dimensional structure of the protease dimer, Asp29 is involved in two pivotal interactions; the first is an hydrogen bond between one of the carboxylate oxygens and the guanidinium group of Arg87 within the monomer, whereas the second is an intermolecular hydrogen bond across the dimer interface between the second Asp29 carboxylate oxygen and guanidine group of Arg8′ of the other monomer (Fig. 1; Protein Data Bank code 1A30) (6Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Google Scholar). 2The prime symbol with the position number indicates a residue in the second monomer of the dimer. Our present studies of PRD29N suggest that the interaction between the Asp29 and Arg87 is more critical for dimerization than that between residues Asp29 and Arg8′. We propose that the folded monomer of protease will aid in the design of dissociative inhibitors of the protease by targeting the exposed interface. To that end, detailed structural information on the monomer and candidate complexes either by x-ray crystallography or NMR need to be obtained. We therefore designed protease constructs in which the terminal strands can be linked by disulfide bonds. This allows for 1) destabilization of the native-like terminal β-sheet dimer interface and 2) stabilization of the monomer by an intramolecular staple, i.e. the S-S bond. Three related constructs, PRQ2C/L97C, PRD25N/Q2C/L97C, and PRQ2C/N98C, all with only one intrachain disulfide bond, were prepared and characterized. The DNA template, PR (bearing five mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A) (17Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Google Scholar) was used to construct PRT26A and PRD29N, PRD25N, PRQ2C/L97C, and PRQ2C/N98C. The PRD25N template was subsequently employed to make PRD25N/Q2C/L97C. All of the mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the nucleotide sequences of all of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, and the proteins were verified by mass spectrometry. The intrachain disulfide-linked forms of PRQ2C/L97C, PRD25N/Q2C/L97C, and PRQ2C/N98C are termed PRC2-S-S-C97, PRD25N/C2-S-S-C97, and PRC2-S-S-C98, respectively. The cells were grown at 37 °C either in Luria-Bertani medium or in a modified minimal medium for uniform (>99%) 15N labeling with15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells derived from 1 liter of culture were suspended in 20 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication at 4 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml lysozyme. The insoluble fraction was washed by resuspension in buffer A containing 2m urea and 0.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently in buffer A. In both cases, the insoluble fraction (inclusion bodies) was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final pellet of inclusion bodies was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7.5 m guanidine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol to yield a protein concentration not exceeding 20 mg/ml estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay. PRT26A and PRD29N were isolated using an established protocol comprising isolation of inclusion bodies followed by fractionation of the protease by size exclusion chromatography in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4 m guanidine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and reversephase high pressure liquid chromatography (see below). The proteins were folded according to the procedure previously described (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified proteins were determined spectrophotometrically. For the PRQ2C/L97C, PRD25N/Q2C/L97C, and PRQ2C/N98C constructs, 20 mg of the solubilized protein (inclusion bodies) at a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml was gradually diluted into 100 ml of buffer B without dithiothreitol (buffer C) and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer C at room temperature overnight. The protein was concentrated to about 2 ml and applied to a Superdex-75 column (HiLoad 2.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer C at a flow rate of 3 ml/min at ambient temperature. Peak fractions corresponding to the monomer were combined and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on POROS 20 R2 resin (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using a linear gradient of 0 to 60% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The peak fractions were combined and stored at −80 °C. The protein (2 mg) was diluted to about 0.33 mg/ml in 35% acetonitrile, water, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid or in 0.1 m formic acid and dialyzed (Slide-A-Lyzer, 10K dialysis cassettes; Pierce) against 2 liters of 30 mm formic acid, pH 2.8, for 1–1.5 h. The sample was drawn out of the dialysis cassette, diluted with 5 volumes of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and dialyzed further against 4 liters of 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 5.8, for 1.5–2 h. Finally the protein was concentrated to ∼8 mg/ml using Centriprep YM-10 and Centricon YM-10 concentrators (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4 °C or used for the experiments described below. PRD25N/Q2C/L97C or PRQ2C/N98C was digested overnight either with Glu C in 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, at room temperature or with trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, at 37 °C. The protein to enzyme ratio was 50:1 for Glu C and 10:1 for trypsin. 50–100 pmol of the digest was injected onto a Zorbax C3 column (2.1 × 150 mm; Agilent, San Jose, CA) fitted to an HP1100 integrated high pressure liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometer (Agilent) and equilibrated in 5% acetic acid. The peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 100% acetonitrile over a period of 25 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The peptides that eluted into the mass spectrometer were scanned fromm/z 300 to 1700 every 4 s. The spectra were deconvoluted using the Agilent software to yield the mass of the peptides. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20 °C and three different rotor speeds (16,000, 20,000 and 24,000) on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The protein samples were prepared and loaded into the ultracentrifuge cells at nominal loading concentrations of ∼0.7 absorbance at 280 nm (∼60 μm in monomer). The data were analyzed in terms of a single ideal solute to obtain the buoyant molecular mass, M(1 − v), using the Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman). The value for the experimental molecular mass M was determined using the calculated values for the density (determined at 20 °C using standard tables) and partial specific volume v (calculated on the basis of amino acid composition; see Ref. 18Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were assayed using a spectrophotometric substrate (19Richards A.D. Phylip L.H. Farmerie W.G. Scarborough P.E. Alvarez A.

All of the NMR experiments were carried out at protein concentrations in the range of 0.6–1.0 mm in monomer (unless noted otherwise) in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.8, 95% H2O, 5% D2O at 20 °C with a sample volume of ∼280 μl in a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi, Inc., Allison Park, PA). NMR spectra were acquired on a DMX500 spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA). The data were processed and analyzed using nmrPipe, nmrDraw, and PIPP software (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar, 21Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Google Scholar). Protein aggregation was followed at 20 °C by measuring amide signal intensities in 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH-15N HSQC spectra recorded over a period of 4 days. The initial protein concentration used in these latter experiments was ∼1 mm. We previously demonstrated that a protease construct bearing the conservative mutation R87K does not exhibit dimer formation, even at concentrations up to ∼1 mm (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar). This suggested that an interaction involving the side chain of Arg87, most likely the one between Arg87 and Asp29, stabilized the dimer, possibly by anchoring the α-helix and thereby correctly positioning the two C-terminal strands of the β-sheet. Here we constructed and investigated PRD29N, a construct containing the complementary change to that of PRR87K in the Arg87/Asp29pair. PRR87K and PRD29N were ∼4600- and 920-fold less active than PR (Fig. 2). The 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH-15N HSQC spectrum of PRD29Nrecorded on a 0.9 mm sample is displayed in Fig.3 A. Characteristic peaks resulting from the monomeric protein (squares) as well as dimer peaks (dashed squares) are apparent. This demonstrated that PRD29N is also a dimerization-deficient mutant. In the structure of the protease dimer, an extensive network of backbone and side chain interactions exist between residues Arg8′, Asp29, Arg87, and Asn88 (6Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Google Scholar). Noteworthy among these interactions are the hydrogen bonds formed between the Asp29 carboxylates and the Arg87 and Arg8′ side chains. Each oxygen of the Asp29 side chain accepts a hydrogen bond from one of the terminal amino groups of each arginine (Fig. 1 A). Previous results indicated that the intermonomer interaction between Asp29 and Arg8′ does not significantly influence the maturation, stability, or enzymatic activity of the protease (17Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Google Scholar). For example, the R8Q mutant of the mature PR (PRR8Q) does not exhibit any changes in the dimer dissociation constant (17Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinetic parameters for mature PRR8Q-catalyzed hydrolysis of a peptide substrate and the inhibition constant for the hydrolytic reaction with an inhibitor are comparable with those of PR. This contrasts results obtained for PRD29N and PRR87K mutants. Drastic effects on dimer stability and catalytic activity were noted. It is also known that the conserved Asp29 residue is involved in substrate/inhibitor binding (22Prabu-Jeyabalan M. Nalivaika E. Schiffer C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1207-1220Google Scholar, 23Tozser J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 946: 145-159Google Scholar). Thus, the poor catalytic activity of PRD29Narises both from the destabilization of the dimer (increase in dissociation constant, K d) as well as changes in the active site environment. Separation of the kinetic parameters was precluded by the very low catalytic activity of PRD29Nreaching the sensitivity limit of the spectrophotometric assay. Consistent with its poor catalytic activity, autoproteolysis of PRD29N is significantly impaired (Fig. 3 A,inset), although a significant fraction of PRD29N is dimeric at 0.9 mm concentration. Slow aggregation of this mutant was observed, similar to results for other monomers investigated previously. The dimer interface of the free mature protease is formed by residues contributing to the active site and those located at the N and C termini. Of these, terminal residues constitute about 50% of the total interface interactions (6Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Google Scholar, 24Miller M. Schneider J. Sathyanarayana B.K. Toth M.V. Marshall G.R. Clawson L. Selk L. Kent S.B. Wlodawer A. Science. 1989; 246: 1149-1152Google Scholar). Complementing our mutational studies of the terminal β-sheet dimer interface, earlier studies have shown that a T26A mutation of the active site interface significantly affects dimer formation as compared with the mutations T26C or T26S (5Strisovsky K. Tessmer U. Langner J. Konvalinka J. Krausslich H.G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1631-1641Google Scholar). To compare the effect of these two distinct interfaces (active site residues versus terminal β-sheet) on monomer folding, we investigated the T26A mutant further. The T26A substitution mutation was introduced into our idealized PR construct, and the protein was purified and assessed by NMR. The 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH-15N HSQC spectrum of PRT26A is similar to those of PR-(1–95) and PRR87K monomers (Fig. 3 B) (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar), demonstrating that PRT26A is also a folded monomer. 15N NMR relaxation measurements on PRR87K in the absence of inhibitor DMP323 revealed significant motions on the subnanosecond time scale for the N- and C-terminal residues 2–10 and 93–99 unique to the monomer (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar). These motions were attributed in part to the loss of the interfacial β-sheet in PRR87K. This notion is supported by the random coil chemical shifts of the C-terminal residues of PRR87K. As illustrated in Fig. 3, residues Thr96 and Phe99 of PRT26A exhibit nearly identical shifts to those of PRR87K, suggesting that the terminal strands of PRT26A are also disordered and flexible, resembling those of PRR87K. The disorder of the terminal residues observed for these monomers is most likely due to the loss of the formation of a terminal β-sheet arrangement and not a direct effect of the mutation. Thus, in the absence of a bound inhibitor, the highly conserved Thr26 residue of the active site DTG triad is as critical to dimer stability as Arg87, Asp29, or the N-terminal residues 1–4. Unlike PR-(1–95), which does not show evidence of dimer formation even in the presence of the potent inhibitor DMP323, PRT26A, like PRR87K and PR-(5–99), forms dimers in the presence of DMP323, as evidenced by its 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 3 C). Thus, interactions between the inhibitor and the active site/flap residues for these mutants offset the effect of the mutation on the dimerization constant. 15N and 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH chemical shifts of the terminal residues,e.g. Ile3 and Ala95, of PRT26A/DMP323 are nearly identical to those of the PR/DMP323, implying very similar terminal β-sheet arrangements of PR and PRT26A. Like other protease monomers studied previously, PRT26A slowly aggregates. The decay in signal intensity of selected peaks in the 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH-15N HSQC spectra for PRT26A and PR-(1–95) at 1 mm protein concentration indicates the loss of monomer species at approximately similar rates. The time course for the Gly68 resonances is plotted for both proteins in Fig. 4. Note that a comparison with PRR87K at pH 5.8 and PR-(5–99) could not be carried out because the former aggregates considerably faster and the latter experiences substantial autoproteolysis (17Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that partially or misfolded forms of proteins are prone to aggregation (25Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Google Scholar). In the case of the protease monomers investigated here, we propose that the terminal β-sheet residues, when not properly engaged, and those at the active site present a substantial solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface that would naturally cause nonspecific aggregation. Our 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PR, wild-type mature HIV-1 protease bearing the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyH-15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 3) (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar) indicate that the folds of the PRT26Aand PR-(1–95) monomers are very similar to the monomeric unit in the PR dimer. The fact that PRT26A aggregates at a rate comparable with PR-(1–95), although different regions of the chain are involved, suggests that both the active site region and the termini can be responsible for aggregation. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the terminal residues of the monomer subunits in the protease dimer form a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, thereby interleaving strands from the two subunits. We previously demonstrated that interfering with the formation of this sheet by deleting either the N- or C-terminal 4 residues disrupts dimerization of the free protease. Except for the conservative substitutions L97V, no other major drug-resistant mutations of protease terminal residues have been reported (23Tozser J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 946: 145-159Google Scholar). This suggests that hydrophobic packing of the terminal side chains may be critical for dimer stability. Based on the crystal structure of the protease dimer, we reasoned that substitution of cysteines for one amino acid in each of the terminal regions (1–4 and 96–99) that can form intrachain disulfide bonds may prevent the formation of the four-stranded β-sheet. In addition, we anticipated that linking the terminal segments of the monomer would reduce the rate of monomer aggregation by reducing the probability of random interaction of exposed terminal hydrophobic residues. Although PR carries three mutations (Q7K, L33I, and L63I) to suppress autoproteolysis, it is prone to slow cleavage in the absence of inhibitor at protein concentrations of ∼0.5 mm required for NMR experiments. In addition, protease constructs containing mutations that significantly reduce dimer stability, such as PR5–99, are prone to autoproteolysis at NMR concentrations (16Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Google Scholar). We therefore chose the protease mutant PRD25N as the template to create an intrachain disulfide bridge between the N- and C-terminal strands. This active site mutant PRD25N forms a stable but inactive dimer at 0.5 mm (Fig. 3 D), which makes it ideal for studies of the mature PR dimer either free or bound to a native substrate (22Prabu-Jeyabalan M. Nalivaika E. Schiffer C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1207-1220Google Scholar). The mutation D25N may also influence the dimer stability of the mature protease (K D = ∼10−6m), 3D. A. Torchia, R. Ishima, and J. M. Louis, unpublished data. albeit to a much lesser extent than the mutants that form monomers discussed above (also see Table I). The construct PRD25N/Q2C/L97C was used to optimize the protocol for disulfide bond formation (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We opted for oxidation prior to the final size exclusion column chromatography because this allows for efficient separation of monomer, intermolecularly disulfide-linked dimer, and multimeric forms of the protein.

We have examined in most detail the mechanism of gene repression by HSF1 in monocytes responding to bacterial endotoxin exposure. We find that the pro-inflammatory IL-1β gene is repressed by HSF1 and that this response is mediated by HSF1 binding to and quenching the activating effect of an essential factor on theIL-1β promoter, nuclear factor of interleukin 6 (NF-IL6/C/EBPβ), which regulates the transcription of many genes in myeloid cells (15Cahill C.M.

HSF1 appears to repress the IL-1β promoter by a mechanism that involves HSF1 binding to a functional heat shock element (HSE) and interaction with NF-IL6; HSF1 then blocks essential cooperative interactions between NF-IL6 and PU.1 required for IL-1β promoter activation (15Cahill C.M.

Indeed, NF-IL6 activation caused either by overexpression of the protein from transfected expression plasmid or by bacterial endotoxin stimulation of endogenous NF-IL6 leads to the repression of thehsp70b promoter through a mechanism that appears to involve directly HSF1-NF-IL6 binding (21Xie Y. Chen C. Stevenson M.A. Hume D.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is not known whether other members of the bZIP family including C/EBP, AP-1 binding, or activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein family proteins can interact with HSF1 (31McKnight S.L. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-796Google Scholar). Such an interaction could potentially be involved in the repression of genes such as c-fos or TNFα in which NF-IL6 does not play a major role in transcriptional activation. In the work presented here we have examined the mechanisms of gene repression by HSF1 using mutational analysis to map repression domains. We have found that gene repression is conferred by sequences in the N-terminal half of the protein and that the C terminus, which contains the major trans-activation domains, does not play a major role in repression. We have identified two regions in the N terminus of HSF1 essential in the repression of c-fos and c-fms, including a region (amino acids 229–279) needed for repression but not required for NF-IL6 binding and a sequence (amino acids 106–205) essential for NF-IL6 binding. We next developed a dominant interfering negative construct (HSF1-(1–205)) that competitively inhibits c-fos repression by HSF1. This construct was also found to inhibit repression of theIL-1β promoter and the c-fms promoter by HSF1 suggesting the presence of a common repression domain within HSF1 that acts on a range of target promoters. Chinese hamster ovaricytes, CHO K1, were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.0 mml-glutamine. The c-fms promoter reporter gene, pGLfms, contains the 500-bp promoter sequence of the murine c-fmsgene (21Xie Y. Chen C. Stevenson M.A. Hume D.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Both reporter genes were constructed using the commercially available pGL3.Basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The c-fos reporter gene, pGLfos, and the hsp70B promoter reporter gene, pGLhsp70B, were constructed as described previously (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol.

The HSF1 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(−)/HSF1, contains the humanhsf1 coding sequence driven by the CMV promoter in mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). A series of C-terminal truncation mutants derived from HSF1, which result in deletions of amino acid residues from the C terminus (amino acid 529) to amino acids 479, 429, 379, 329, 279, 264, 249, 229, 205, and 179 were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using pcDNA3.1(−)/HSF1 as the template. N- and C-terminal deletion mutants, HSF1-(106–279) and HSF1-(146–279), and the internal deletion mutant, HSF1-(Δ215–278), were generated similarly. The N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were cloned into a plasmid encoding the His6 tag. The HSF1/HSF2 chimeras, HSF1-(1–327)/HSF2-(344–536), HSF2-(1–222)/HSF1-(225–281), HSF2-(1–222)/HSF1-(225–529), and HSF2-(1–222)/HSF1-(279–529), were constructed by fusing PCR-amplified fragments from HSF1 and HSF2 cDNA templates using standard techniques. The expression plasmid for the full-length NF-IL6, pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6, was derived by cloning the entire NF-IL6 cDNA into pcDNA3.1(−). A truncated form of NF-IL6, pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6bZIP, was prepared from an internal SplI deletion (amino acids 41–205) of thetrans-activation domain from the full-length NF-IL6 cDNA that retained the intact basic zipper (b-ZIP) region (32Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1 (+)/HSF-2A, which contains the coding sequence of HSF-2A, was used in in vitro protein interaction assays as control. The expression plasmid for the GST/HSF1 fusion protein contains the full-length HSF1 coding sequence inserted in-frame downstream of the coding sequence for glutathione S-transferase in the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The expression plasmid for the GST-NF-IL6b-ZIP fusion protein contains the truncated NF-IL6 cDNA inserted in pGEX vector and is designated as GST/NF-IL6b-ZIP. The control plasmid, pGEX-2T, was used to produce GST control protein. For promoter activity analysis, transient transfection was carried out using the liposomal transfection reagentN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Unless specified in the figure legends, cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 × 104/well and cultured for 18 h before being transfected with 0.4 μg/well of promoter reporter construct. As the control for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg/well of pCMV-βGal expression vector was simultaneously transfected. For co-expression assays, a total of 0.4 μg/well expression vector for transcription factors was used. Cells were harvested 18–24 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity and β-galactosidase expression levels were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). The promoter activities were normalized in relative light units per milliunits of β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear or whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE by using standard methodology. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon) membranes (Millipore) as described (33Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1234-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The membranes were then blocked by incubation in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated at 4 °C with a specific antibody against the N terminus of HSF1 (for C-terminal deletion mutants), against the C terminus of HSF1 (for chimeras and mutants containing complete C terminus), or against His6tag (for mutants with both N- and C-terminal deletions). The membranes were then washed and incubated with a second antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, AmershamBiosciences). HSF1 and NF-IL6 were produced in vitro from pcDNA3.1(−)/HSF1, pcDNA3.1 (−)/NF-IL6, and pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6bZIP using a TnT Quick T7 Transcription/Translation kit according to manufacturer's protocol (Promega). HSF1 constructs generated by PCR as described above and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors (which contain promoters for in vitro transcription) were used as the templates forin vitro production of truncated proteins for “pull-down” analysis. The in vitro translated proteins were checked for size and integrity by SDS-PAGE analysis and for function by assaying the binding properties to oligonucleotides containing specific binding motifs for HSF1 and NF-IL6 using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Briefly, cells were incubated for 10 min on ice in 200 μl of CERI solution containing 0.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 20 mm NaF, and 2.0 mm Na3VO4. 11 μl of CERII solution was than added, and cytoplasmic extracts were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Nuclear pellets were lysed in 100 μl of nuclear extraction reagent solution containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Extracts were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and labeled by end filling with 32P. Consensus HSE from humanhsp70A gene, 5′-CACCTCGGCTGGAATATTCCCGACCTGGCAGCCGA-3′, was used in EMSA. Each binding mixture (12 μl) for EMSA contained 2.0 μl of nuclear extract or 10 μl of in vitro translated protein, 2.0 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5–1.0 ng of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, 12 mm HEPES, 12% glycerol, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.9 mmMgCl2, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin (pH 7.9). Final concentrations of KCl in the binding mixture were defined for optimal binding of each oligonucleotide. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and complexes were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. To produce GST fusion proteins and control GST protein, 250-ml cultures of Escherichia coli DH5α cells expressing GST/NF-IL6b-ZIP fusion protein, GST/HSF1 fusion protein, or GST control protein were incubated by shaking at 37 °C until the A 600reached 0.4–0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to the bacterial culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mm in order to induce GST fusion protein expression. GST proteins were prepared as described previously (34Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). For each in vitro protein binding reaction, 50 pmol of GST fusion protein or GST control protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and then incubated with 20 μl of in vitro translated,35S-labeled proteins in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rocking. The protein-GST beads were then washed five times with binding buffer and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. As input controls, 1 μl each of in vitro translation samples was run in parallel with relevant binding reactions. As our previous studies showed that heat shock represses the transcription of multiple genes, including c-fos, uPA,IL-1β, TNFα, and c-fms through a mechanism involving interactions between HSF1 and the target promoters of these genes, we have investigated potential structural domains within HSF1 that mediate repression. We first examined a series of deletion mutants generated from the human hsf1 gene as well as chimeras between hsf1 and the structurally relatedhsf2 gene. We generated C-terminal truncation mutants by depleting successive 50 codon segments from the 3′ terminus of thehsf1 coding region and expressed the fragments in CHO-K1 cells in vivo using a eukaryotic expression vector (Fig. 1 A). After expression in vivo, the mutants were then tested for their ability to repress the activity of co-transfected target promoter-reporter constructs. For this purpose, cells were first transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the human c-fos core promoter and an expression vector for c-fos activator, H-Ras (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The c-fos core promoter has fairly low basal activity, and the activity is induced by exposure of cells to growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (35Greenberg M.E. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). H-ras transfection substitutes for growth factor activation by mimicking the signaling effects of cellular Ras activated by ligand-bound growth factor receptors, a system described by us previously (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We showed previously (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that heat shock inhibits serum-induced c-fos expression. We have observed that wild-type HSF1 is a very effective repressor of the c-fos promoter previously activated either by H-Ras expression or serum stimulation and reduces activity of the reporter luciferase by over 90% (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We used the Ras-activated c-fos promoter as a well defined model system of choice in these studies due to this susceptibility of repression by HSF1. In addition, as c-fos repression by HSF1 does not involve binding to HSE, we were able to concentrate on domains required for functional repression without the complication of taking into account the already characterized DNA binding domain (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our control studies indicated that neither heat shock nor HSF1 overexpression affect Ras synthesis and that the effects of heat and HSF1 are on factors proximal to the c-fos promoter (16Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These effects appear to be downstream of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase as indicated by our studies showing that extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity is actually stimulated rather than inhibited by heat shock in CHO cells. 2M. A. Stevenson and S. K. Calderwood, manuscript in preparation. When the C-terminal deletion mutants of HSF1 were co-expressed with the c-fospromoter, we found that sequences from HSF1 could be deleted from the C terminus spanning codon 529 to codon 279 without significant loss of ability to repress Ras-induced activity (Fig. 1 B). Wild-type HSF1 repressed c-fos by over 90% (Fig. 1 B,compare lane 2 with lane 1), and this repression was similar in each mutant up to HSF1-(1–279) (lanes 3–7). Although the 1–279 fragment efficiently represses the c-fospromoter (Fig. 1 B, lane 7), this mutation has lost all ability to activate the hsp70B promoter as indicated in our control studies (Fig. 1 D, compare lanes 2 and7), largely due to removal of the C-terminaltrans-activation domains (amino acids 379–529). By contrast, overexpression of wild-type HSF1 activates thehsp70B promoter (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the transcriptional activation domains of HSF1 do not play a major role intrans-repression of target genes. Further deletion from the C terminus led to the loss of ability to repress the c-fospromoter (Fig. 1 B). Much of the potency of HSF1 to repress c-fos was lost by deletion from codon 279 to 264, and repression was abolished by deletion to codon 205 (Fig. 1 B). We also carried out similar experiments with the c-fmspromoter activated by co-transfection with the factor NF-IL6 (Fig. 1 C). Our previous studies showed that heat shock also blocks the transcription of the endogenous c-fms gene, and both heat shock and HSF1 overexpression inhibit the ac"

We have identified that the β1–3 subunits exhibit distinct assembly capabilities with the γ2L subunit. Similarly, analysis of an assembly box in α1-(57–68) has revealed an absolute requirement for this region in the assembly of αβ receptors. Furthermore, a selective requirement for a single amino acid (Arg-66), previously shown to be essential for the formation of the low affinity GABA binding site, is observed. This residue is critical for the assembly of α1β2 but not α1β1 or α1β3 receptors. We have confirmed the ability of the previously identified GKER signal in β3 to direct the assembly of βγ receptors. The GKER signal is also involved in driving assembly with the α1 subunit, conferring the ability to assemble with α1R66A on the β2 subunit. Although this signal is sufficient to permit the formation of β2γ2 receptors, it is not necessary for β3γ2 receptor formation, suggesting the existence of alternative assembly signals. These findings support the belief that GABAA receptor assembly occurs via defined pathways to limit the receptor diversity.

Similarly, the homologous region in ρ1 is an important component of the GABA binding domain (25Torres V.I. Weiss D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43741-43748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given the high degree of homology between the α and γ subunits in this region combined with their differential ability to assemble with β subunits (α1 with β1–3, γ2 with β3, possibly β1, but not β2) (20Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to investigate the role of these sequences in the differential assembly of α/γ subunits with β subunits. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have determined that the conversion of a single amino acid in α1 to that of γ2 (R66A) is sufficient to alter the assembly profile of the α1 subunit to that of the γ2, as determined by immunofluorescence and cell surface ELISA. These results demonstrate that the identity of a single amino acid may be critical in determining assembly with particular receptor subunits and may identify a basis for subunit-specific GABAA receptor assembly. Furthermore, we present evidence for the existence of alternative assembly signals, which may permit the formation of diverse receptor types, dependent upon subunit availability. COS 7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.

The mutant constructs α1S, α1(ρ1), β2GKER, and β3DNTK were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as reported previously (18Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining mutant α1/γ2 constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides: α1(γ2), 5′-CATCCTTCCAAGTTTGAGCGAAAAAAATATCTATTGTATACTC-3′; α1(R-A), 5′-CTTCCAACTTTGAGCGAAAAACACATC-3′; γ2(α1), 5′-TGTCATACCAGGATTGGCGAAAAAAAACATCAATTGTATATTC-3′, γ2(A-R), 5′-CATACCAGGTTTGGCGAAAAAAAATATC-3′. The fidelity of the final expression constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. The 9E10 antibody was obtained from 9E10 hybridoma cells (27Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) and used directly as supernatant without purification. The secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, were purchased from Molecular Probes and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxide was fromAmersham Biosciences. COS7 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS), washed twice in 50 mmNH4Cl (in PBS), and blocked (10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min. Subsequent washes and antibody dilutions were performed in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After surface immunofluorescence cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 (10 min), and the immunofluorescence protocol was repeated from the NH4Cl step. Cells were examined using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510). COS7 cells were plated onto 3-cm wells of a 6-well dish. Two transfections were pooled and used to seed 6 wells (“surface” and “total” in triplicate). Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS). Cell surface detection was performed in the absence of detergent, and total expression levels were determined following Triton X-100 (0.5%, 15 min) treatment. Cells were washed twice in 50 mmNH4Cl (in PBS) and blocked (5% fat-free powdered milk (Marvel), 10% fetal bovine serum , 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. Subsequent washes were performed in block. Receptor expression was determined using a horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody and assayed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) as the substrate, with detection at 450 nm after 30 min, after the addition of 0.5m H2SO4. The reaction rate was determined to remain linear for up to 1 h (results not shown). Cells werel-methionine-starved for 30 min before labeling with [35S]methionine (0.5 mCi/10-cm dish, Translabel ICN/Flow) for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer). Post-nuclear supernatants were preabsorbed with protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with 200 μl of 9E10 supernatant in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. Pellets were washed in lysis buffer (containing 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.2% SDS) and centrifuged through a 30% sucrose cushion followed by 3 additional washes in buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and a final wash without NaCl. Pellets were then resuspended in reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.68 m Tris, pH 6.8) and analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Previous studies have revealed that the subunits of the most commonly expressed GABAA receptor (α1β2γ2) cannot reach the cell surface when expressed alone nor when α1γ2L or β2γ2L combinations are co-expressed. Only when α1β2 or α1β2γ2L subunits are co-expressed are functional cell surface receptors produced (5Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Non-productive subunit monomers or α1γ2L or β2γ2L dimers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by interactions with BiP or calnexin. Recently, a putative assembly signal within the α1 and α6 subunits (see α6S, Fig. 1 A) was identified as being required for assembly and cell surface expression with β3 (18Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region exhibits homology between all the GABAA receptor subunits (Fig. 1). The highest homology exists within subunit classes (α values = 63.2%, β values = 78.9%, and γ values = 71.1%), whereas homology between the subunit classes (including δ and ε) is 26.3%. Within this region, both the glutamine (Gln-67) and the tryptophan (Trp-69) have been shown to be essential for assembly (18Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Srinivasan S. Nichols C.J. Lawless G.M. Olsen R.W. Tobin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26633-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the glutamine is completely conserved among all GABAA receptors, and the tryptophan is completely conserved among all members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, indicating a general role in subunit architecture or folding. To implicate residues that may be involved in subunit class-specific assembly of GABAA receptors, we examined the sequences in this region to identify residues completely conserved within a subunit class but absent from the other subunit classes. Surprisingly, despite the high degree of homology evident, only one residue (Arg-66 in α1) fits this criterion. At this position, an arginine (αs), glutamine (βs), or alanine (γs), is always present (histidine in δ, serine in ε). Interestingly, this residue in α1 has been shown to be critical for GABA binding (22Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of this region in GABAA receptor assembly we investigated α1/γ2 subunit chimeras and mutants for their ability to assemble with the β subunits. The constructs used are α1myc, α1Smyc (lacking residues 57–68), α1(γ2)myc (residues 57–68 replaced with the homologous residues from γ2), α1(R-A)myc(arginine at position 66 mutated to alanine), γ2Lmyc, γ2L(α1)myc (residues replaced with homologous residues from α1), and γ2L(A-R)myc. Subunit detection was performed using 9E10 antibodies that recognize the Myc epitope present in all the α1/γ2L subunits. All β subunits used were epitope-tagged with the FLAG epitope. When expressed alone, all the above α1/γ2L subunits do not reach the cell surface but are retained within the ER (5Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (results not shown). Thus, we measure the ability of the α1/γ2L subunits to be rescued from the ER and expressed on the surface as heteromeric receptors with β subunits. COS7 cells were transfected with α/γmycβ2FLAG, and immunofluorescence was performed using 9E10 antibodies. As shown previously (5Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), α1 and β2 subunits are able to assemble and form heteromeric receptors on the cell surface (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the presence of an assembly signal existing between residues 57 and 68 of the α1 subunit, α1S (lacking this region) cannot reach the cell surface despite the presence of the β2 subunit. The α1S is retained within the ER, as evidenced by the classic reticular staining pattern observed (Fig. 2 A). To address the possibility that this subunit might misfold, we examined an α1(ρ1) chimera in which residues 57–68 in the α1 were replaced with the homologous residues from GABACreceptor ρ1 subunit (18Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the expected structural similarities between ρ1 and GABAA receptor subunits combined with the recent observation that this region in ρ1 also contributes to the GABA binding site (25Torres V.I. Weiss D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43741-43748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this chimera would be less likely to misfold. In keeping with the inability of the ρ1 subunit to assemble with the GABAA receptor β subunits (29Hackam A.S. Wang T.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Koulen P. Brandstatter J.H. Enz R. Bormann J. Wassle H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), coexpression of α1(ρ1) with β2 did not lead to cell surface expression (results not shown). Receptors composed of β2γ2 do not access the cell surface but are retained in the ER (5Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Therefore, we assessed the ability of α1(γ2) to assemble with β2. Consistent with a role for α1 residues 57–68 in assembly with β2, cell surface expression of α1(γ2) is abolished. Given the critical role of arginine at position 66 of α1 in GABA binding (22Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the complete conservation of this position within all subunit classes (Fig. 1), we mutated this arginine (in α1) to the corresponding residue (alanine) in γ2 creating α1(R-A). This mutation completely abolished the ability of α1 to assemble with β2. To determine whether this putative α1 assembly signal might be transplanted into the γ2 subunit, we generated a γ2L(α1) construct containing the residues 57–68 from α1 in place of the homologous γ2 sequence. When expressed with β2, γ2L(α1) is still incapable of assembling with β2 (Fig. 2 A). Thus, although the α1 region 57–68 is essential for the assembly of α1 and β2 and critically dependent upon an arginine at position 66, this region is insufficient to direct this assembly event. This is corroborated by the γ2L(A-R)construct, which cannot assemble with β2. Quantification of these observations was performed by whole cell ELISA to determine receptor cell surface expression (no detergent)versus total (detergent) receptor expression. The values presented here do not reflect a true percentage of surface-expressed receptors for two reasons; first, the α1β2 values have been normalized to 100% and, second, surface values greater than 100% have been detected for β3 homomers (results not shown), suggesting a possible inhibitory influence of prior detergent treatment on this assay. In these experiments (Fig. 2 B, Table I) it can be seen clearly that the assembly of β2 with α1 requires residues 57–68 of α1 (α1S = 0.9 ± 1.3%), most notably an arginine at position 66 (α1(R-A) = 5.0 ± 4.3%). In agreement with the results observed by immunofluorescence, although this region is critically involved in assembly with β2, transplantation of this signal to γ2 does not confer the ability to assemble with β2 (α1(γ2) = 3.7 ± 3.1%).Table ISummary of cell surface expression for mutant GABAA receptorsβ1β2β3β2GKERβ3DNTKα1100 ± 7.6101 ± 8.7100 ± 10.5100.4 ± 18.2100.2 ± 9.7α1S2.7 ± 3.10.9 ± 1.33.5 ± 3.69.7 ± 6.97.9 ± 5.6γ2L10.2 ± 11.83.0 ± 3.054.7 ± 19.774.3 ± 19.926.8 ± 11.5α1(γ2)108.6 ± 23.410.2 ± 10.0163 ± 24.6118.6 ± 21.999.6 ± 5.8α1(R-A)83.9 ± 16.15.0 ± 4.381.2 ± 9.290.1 ± 24.361.6 ± 13.2γ2L(α1)5.6 ± 2.53.7 ± 3.150.9 ± 16.255.8 ± 26.038.3 ± 20.5γ2L(A-R)4.9 ± 5.07.5 ± 6.085 ± 23.331.3 ± 9.924.7 ± 13.2Values are obtained from Fig. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and are expressed as the percentage cell surface expression relative to α1 (normalized to 100%) ± S.E.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) α1 and β1 subunits are able to assemble and form heteromeric receptors on the cell surface (Fig. 3). Consistent with the presence of an assembly signal existing between residues 57–68 of the α1 subunit, α1S cannot reach the cell surface despite the presence of the β1 subunit (2.7 ± 3.1%). Similar results were observed for the α1(ρ1) (results not shown). In this study, we could detect only very low levels of γ2Lβ1 surface receptors by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3 A) that could not be resolved from background (mock-transfected cells) when analyzed quantitatively (10.2 ± 11.8%, Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the robust surface expression observed upon α1β1 expression results from the use of the α1 57–68 assembly signal, we assessed the ability of α1(γ2) to assemble with β1. In contrast to the results observed with the β2 subunit, cell surface expression of α1(γ2) is not significantly different (108.6 ± 23.4%) from that observed for wild-type α1 (100 ± 7.6%) but higher than that observed for the wild-type γ2L (10.2 ± 11.8%). These findings suggest that, in contrast to the β2 subunit, the β1 subunit does not exhibit the same requirements for this region of the α1 for the assembly of α1β1 heteromeric receptors. This possibility is corroborated by the efficient assembly of β1 with α1(R-A) (83.9 ± 16.1%, Fig. 3). However, this region is still essential for α1β1 receptor assembly, as evidenced by the inability of α1S (Fig. 3) and α1(ρ1) (results not shown) to assemble with β1. Both of the γ2 mutants (γ2(α1) and γ2(A-R)) were indistinguishable from the wild-type γ2L with respect to cell surface expression with β1, i.e. weak surface immunofluorescence and non-detectable surface levels by ELISA (Fig. 3). COS7 cells were transfected with α/γmycβ3FLAG, and immunofluorescence was performed using 9E10 antibodies. As shown previously (26Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) α1 and β3 subunits are able to assemble and form heteromeric receptors on the cell surface (Fig. 3). Consistent with the presence of an assembly signal existing between residues 57 and 68 of the α1 subunit, α1S cannot reach the cell surface (3.5 ± 3.6%) despite the presence of the β3 subunit. Similar results were observed for the α1(ρ1) (results not shown). Receptors composed of β3γ2 have been reported to be capable of forming functional cell surface receptors (18Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we observed robust surface expression by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4 A) and ELISA (54.7 ± 19.7%, Fig. 4 B). We assessed the ability of α1(γ2) to assemble with β3. As observed with the β1 subunit, α1(γ2) is capable of assembling with β3 and even exhibits enhanced levels of surface expression (163 ± 21.9%, p < 0.02, t test) compared with α1 (100 ± 10.5%) or γ2L (54.7 ± 19.7%). These findings suggest that, like the β1 subunit but in contrast to the β2 subunit, β3 does not require this region of the α1 for the assembly of α1β3 heteromeric receptors. This possibility is corroborated by the efficient assembly of β3 with α1(R-A) (81.2 ± 9.2%, Fig. 4). Both of the γ2 mutants (γ2(α1) and γ2(A-R)) were indistinguishable from the wild-type γ2L with respect to cell surface expression with β3, i.e. strong surface immunofluorescence and detectable surface levels by ELISA (Fig. 4, γ2L(α1)= 50.9 ± 16.2% and γ2L(A-R) = 85 ± 23.3%). Interestingly, the β3 subunit (20Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wooltorton J.R."

In this study, we verified the peroxisomal localization of M-LP by performing dual-color confocal analysis of COS-7 cells cotransfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged M-LP and DsRED2-PTS1, a red fluorescent peroxisomal marker. To characterize the peroxisomal membrane targeting signal, we examined the intracellular localizations of several green fluorescent protein-tagged deletion mutants and demonstrated that, of the three transmembrane segments predicted, the first near the NH2 terminus and NH2-terminal half of the following loop region, which is abundant in positively charged amino acids, were necessary and sufficient for peroxisomal targeting. To elucidate the function of M-LP, we examined the activities of several enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species metabolism in COS-7 cells and found that transfection with M-LP increased the superoxide dismutase activity significantly. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the manganese SOD (SOD2) mRNA level of COS-7 cells transfected with M-LP was elevated.

Commun. 2001; 283: 292-296Google Scholar). The M-LP gene is expressed mainly in the kidney and spleen and the amount expressed increases steadily during development, reaches its highest level in adulthood, and decreases gradually with aging. It encodes 194 amino acids of a polypeptide with a sequence and membrane topology markedly similar to those of two peroxisomal membrane proteins, Mpv17 protein (3Weiher H. Noda T. Gray D.A. Sharpe A.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1990; 62: 425-434Google Scholar) (30.4% identity, 66.7% similarity) and PMP22 (4Bryant D.D. Wilson G.N. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 55: 22-30Google Scholar) (25.0% identity, 72.1% similarity). These results suggest that M-LP might be embedded in the peroxisomal membrane in a similar manner to these two proteins. Peroxisomes are ubiquitous eukaryotic subcellular organelles that play essential roles in a variety of metabolic pathways, including H2O2 metabolism and the oxidative degradation of fatty acids (5Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Google Scholar). Recently, a number of studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of peroxisomal biogenesis and protein import (6Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Google Scholar, 7Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Google Scholar, 8Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Google Scholar). Targeting of peroxisomal matrix proteins is mediated by cytosolic receptors Pex5p and Pex7p that recognize the peroxisomal targeting signals PTS1, which consists of the sequence SKL (and conservative variants) at the carboxyl terminus (9Gould S.G. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Google Scholar, 10Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M. Metzig B. America T. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 97-109Google Scholar), and PTS2, which consists of the consensus sequence (R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(H/Q)(L/A) near the amino terminus (11Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Google Scholar, 12Rehling P. Marzioch M. Niesen F. Wittke E. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2901-2913Google Scholar), respectively. Whereas the targeting of peroxisomal matrix protein import has been well characterized, neither conclusive consensus sequence nor the receptor(s) involved in peroxisomal membrane protein targeting have been determined. Thus, it is important to characterize the membrane peroxisome targeting signals (mPTSs) in as many peroxisomal membrane proteins as possible to understand the biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes. The Mpv17-negative mouse strain was generated by inserting a defective retrovirus into the germ line of mice and is characterized by progressive glomerulosclerosis and neurosensory deafness at a young age (3Weiher H. Noda T. Gray D.A. Sharpe A.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1990; 62: 425-434Google Scholar, 13Meyer zum Gottesberge A.M. Reuter A. Weiher H. Eur. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 1996; 253: 470-474Google Scholar). The phenotype results from loss of function of the Mpv17 gene encoding a 20-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein. The molecular function of the Mpv17 protein has yet to be elucidated, but it was recently hypothesized that it plays an important role in peroxisomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and that glomerular damage is because of overproduction of ROS. In Mpv17 gene-inactivated mice, a significant increase in ROS and lipid peroxidation adduct production was observed and oxygen radical scavengers prevented glomerular damage (14Binder C.J. Weiher H. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1067-1075Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study showed that the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase enzyme activity and mRNA expression level were higher, whereas plasma glutathione peroxidase (Gpx3) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were lower, in Mpv17 null cells than normal cells (15Wagner G. Stettmaier K. Bors W. Sies H. Wagner E.M. Reuter A. Weiher H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1019-1025Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the Mpv17 protein is involved in enzymatic antioxidant defense systems. The aims of this study were first, to confirm the peroxisomal localization of M-LP and characterize the mPTS of this new protein and second, to investigate the activities and expression of antioxidant enzymes to determine whether there is a connection between M-LP and ROS metabolism. All the primers used for expression vector construction in this study are listed in Table I. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-PTS1 was amplified by the PCR using the primer set exGFPS and GFPPTS1A and pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as the template. DsRED2-PTS1 was amplified using the primer set DsREDS and DsREDPTS1A and pDsRED2 (Clontech) as the template.

A DNA fragment encoding full-length M-LP was created by PCR amplification using the primer set exMLPS2 and exMLPA2 and first-strand cDNA synthesized using the total RNAs from the kidneys of 9-month-old mice as the template. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (the resulting vector was designated pcDNA3.1/MLP). GFP tagging of the COOH or NH2 terminus of M-LP was done using a PCR gene fusion technique (16Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar) as follows. To produce MLP-GFP (COOH-terminal GFP-tagged M-LP), two separate PCRs to amplify the M-LP and GFP genes were performed: the M-LP gene was amplified using the primer set exMLPS2 and exMG1A2 and first-strand cDNA synthesized using the total RNAs from the kidneys of 9-month-old mice as the template and the GFP gene was amplified using the primer set exMG2S and exGFPA and pEGFP as the template. Then, the two PCR products were mixed with the primer set exMLPS2 and exGFPA and extended by the PCR to form the chimeric gene. Likewise, to produce GFP-MLP (NH2-terminal GFP-tagged M-LP), separate PCRs for GFP and M-LP gene amplification were performed with the two primer sets exGFPS and exGM1A and exGM2S and exMLPA, respectively. Then, the two PCR products were mixed with the primer set exGFPS and exMLPA, extended by the PCR and each PCR-amplified chimeric gene was cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI site of pcDNA3.1 (the resulting vectors were designated pcDNA3.1/MLP-GFP and pcDNA3.1/GFP-MLP, respectively). NH2-terminal truncated Δ15MLP-GFP (NH2-terminal amino acids 1–15 are deleted from M-LP), Δ34MLP-GFP (NH2-terminal amino acids 1–34 are deleted), and Δ91MLP-GFP (NH2-terminal amino acids 1–91 are deleted) were generated by the PCR using the primer pair sets 16MGS and exGFPA, 35MGS and exGFPA, or 92MGS and exGFPA, respectively, and pcDNA3.1/MLP-GFP as the template. The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pcDNA3.1. COOH-terminal truncation variants 34MLP-GFP (comprising NH2-terminal amino acids 1–34), 55MLP-GFP (comprising NH2-terminal amino acids 1–55), 91MLP-GFP (comprising NH2-terminal amino acids 1–91), and an NH2- and COOH-terminal truncation variant 16/55MLP-GFP (comprising amino acids 16–55) were generated as follows. The GFP gene was PCR-amplified using the primer set exGFPS and exGFPA and pEGFP as the template and the PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (the resulting vector was designated pcDNA3.1/GFP). DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–34, 1–55, 1–91, and 16–55 of M-LP were PCR amplified using the primer sets 91MS and 34MA, 91MS and 55MA, 91MS and 91MA, or 15DMS and 55MA, respectively, and pcDNA3.1/GFP-MLP as the template. The PCR products were cloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1/GFP, which contained the coding sequence of GFP behind the KpnI/HindIII site. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated in 3.5-cm poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and 24 h after transfection, fluorescent images were analyzed by a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM-GB200 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). An argon laser at 488 nm was used for excitation and the fluorescent signals emitted by GFP and DsRED2 were detected using a 535-nm band-pass filter and a 570-nm long pass filter, respectively. The cDNA encoding NH2-terminal amino acids 1–103 or COOH-terminal amino acids 105–194 of M-LP were cloned in-frame with glutathioneS-transferase into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (AmershamBiosciences, Tokyo, Japan), introduced into Escherichia coliINVαF′ (Invitrogen), and induced using standard procedures. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were solubilized from inclusion bodies using 8 m urea and affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose-4B (Amersham Biosciences). For antibody production, the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were emulsified with adjuvant (TiterMax Gold; CytRx, Atlanta, GA), injected intramuscularly into Japanese white rabbits three times and the immunoglobulin G fractions were purified using a protein A column (Hitrap Protein A; Amersham Biosciences). The activities of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/MLP and pcDNA3.1 as a control were determined. Three days after transfection, culture media and cell lysates were recovered and their enzymatic activities were determined. The cell lysates used for the measurement of SOD and Gpx activities were prepared by mixing them with 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and subjecting them to three freeze-thaw cycles, after which the SOD and Gpx activities were assayed using a SOD assay kit-WST (Dojin Molecular Technologies, Kumamoto, Japan) and a glutathione peroxidase assay kit (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. To investigate the effects of the anti-M-LP antibody on the SOD activities, cell lysates were incubated with antibody serially diluted with 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 8% (w/v) sodium chloride and 0.2% (w/v) potassium chloride at 37 °C for 1 h and the remaining activities were measured. Cell lysates were prepared for the measurement of catalase (CAT) activity as follows. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.01% (w/v) digitonin, and 0.25% (w/v) sodium cholate and sonicated 30 s for 8–10 times until the solution was cleared. The sonicated sample was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and the catalase activity of the supernatant was measured using a BIOXYTECH Catalase-520 kit (OxisResearch, Portland, OR). Protein concentrations were determined using a QuantiPro BCA assay kit (Sigma). The data shown are mean ± S.E. Differences between means were determined using Student's t test and those atp < 0.05 were considered significant. Total RNA from mouse kidneys was prepared as described in our previous report (1Iida R. Yasuda T. Aoyama M. Tsubota E. Matsuki T. Kishi K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 113: 135-144Google Scholar) and total RNA was extracted from COS-7 cells using Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis with a LightCycler Instrument (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as previously described (17Iida R. Yasuda T. Tsubota E. Takatsuka H. Masuyama M. Matsuki T. Kishi K. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1121-1126Google Scholar). The primer sequences and product size for each gene are summarized in Table II. The amount of mRNA was normalized to the internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Accordingly, colocalization analysis of GFP-tagged M-LP and a peroxisomal marker protein was performed. First, the effectiveness of DsRED2-PTS1 as a peroxisomal marker was tested. Punctate fluorescence signals were observed in cells expressing DsRED2-PTS1 and they colocalized completely with the signals because of GFP-PTS1 (Fig.1 A), which has been used as a peroxisomal marker in previous studies (18Kalish J.E. Keller G.A. Morrell J.C. Mihalik S.J. Smith B. Cregg J.M. Gould S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3275-3285Google Scholar, 19Wiemer E.A. Wenzel T. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 71-80Google Scholar), whereas diffuse cytosolic fluorescence was observed in control cells expressing DsRED2. These results demonstrate that DsRed2-PTS1, as well as GFP-PTS1, is an effective marker for peroxisomal protein. Next, cells were co-transfected with DsRED2-PTS1 and either MLP-GFP or GFP-MLP and their intracellular distributions were examined (Fig. 1 B). Punctate green fluorescence because of MLP-GFP was observed in MLP-GFP-expressing cells and was superimposable on the red fluorescence because of DsRED2-PTS1, demonstrating clearly that M-LP was targeted to peroxisomes. However, GFP-MLP was detected in peroxisomes and the cytoplasm. These results could be interpreted as meaning that the mPTS exists around the NH2-terminal and the interaction between the mPTS and its receptor(s) was hindered by tagging GFP onto the NH2 terminus of M-LP. To assess the mPTS of M-LP more closely, we constructed several NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants, as shown in Fig. 2 A, and examined their intracellular localizations (Fig. 1 C). From the putative topology of M-LP derived from its primary structure, three TMSs, TMS1-(16–34), TMS2-(92–110), and TMS3-(151–168) have been predicted (2Iida R. Yasuda T. Tsubota E. Matsuki T. Kishi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 292-296Google Scholar). Δ15MLP-GFP, the mutant lacking the NH2-terminal tail consisting of the first 15 amino acids, was targeted properly to peroxisomes, as revealed by its colocalization with DsRED2-PTS1. However, the signals from cells expressing Δ34MLP-GFP, which lacks the NH2-terminal tail and TMS1, did not correspond to peroxisomes, although several punctate signals were observed. In the case of Δ91MLP-GFP, which lacks the NH2-terminal tail, TMS1, and the loop between TMS1 and TMS2, overall diffuse cytosolic fluorescence was observed. Next, in the cases of mutants truncated at the COOH-terminal region, 91MLP-GFP comprising residues 1–91, which include the NH2-terminal tail, TMS1, and the loop between TMS1 and TMS2, and 55MLP-GFP comprising residues 1–55, which include the NH2-terminal tail, TMS1, and half of the loop between TMS1 and TMS2, were located exclusively in peroxisomes, whereas 34MLP-GFP comprising residues 1–34, which include the NH2-terminal tail and TMS1, was partially localized in peroxisomes. These results demonstrate that TMS1 and the NH2-terminal half of the loop between TMS1 and TMS2 are required for the correct peroxisomal localization of M-LP. To confirm this hypothesis, 16/55MLP-GFP, comprising residues 16–55, which include TMS1 and the NH2-terminal half of the loop between TMS1 and TMS2, was constructed and its intracellular localization was examined. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the signals were localized exclusively in peroxisomes, suggesting that TMS1 and the NH2-terminal half of the loop between TMS1 and TMS2 are sufficient to function as an mPTS. Although a great deal of information about peroxisomal matrix protein import has been obtained, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins are targeted and integrated into peroxisomal membranes is still poor. The sequences involved in targeting or insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins described so far are as follows: inPichia pastoris Pas2p (20Wiemer E.A. Luers G.H. Faber K.N. Wenzel T. Veenhuis M. Subramani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18973-18980Google Scholar) and human (21Kammerer S. Holzinger A. Welsch U. Roscher A.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 53-60Google Scholar) andHansenula polymorpha (22Baerends R.J. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Google Scholar) Pex3p, positively charged amino acids at the NH2-terminal region were shown to be involved in targeting or insertion; in Saccharomyces cerevisiaePex15p, the COOH-terminal luminal tail was required for targeting (23Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Google Scholar); in rat PMP70, an internal region that roughly corresponded to the TMS3 was necessary for targeting and insertion (24Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3706-3713Google Scholar); in S. cerevisiae PMP47, TMS2 plus an adjacent cytoplasmic oriented sequence, a matrix facing basic cluster, and an anchoring TMS were sufficient for targeting (25Wang X. Unruh M.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10897-10905Google Scholar); in human PMP34, the loop region between TMS4 and TMS5 and three transmembrane segments were required for targeting and insertion (26Honsho M. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9375-9382Google Scholar); and in rat PMP22, the NH2-terminal region and more than one TMS were required for targeting and insertion (27Pause B. Saffrich R. Hunziker A. Ansorge W. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 23-28Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of M-LP and PMP22 are very similar (25.0% identity, 72.1% similarity), those in the NH2-terminal regions are quite different and the mPTS identified in PMP22 was not found in M-LP. Honsyo and Fujiki (26Honsho M. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9375-9382Google Scholar) pointed out that no conclusive consensus sequence had been observed, but the feature common to most of these proteins was the presence of positively charged amino acids located in the flanking region of a TMS. From this point of view, M-LP has two clusters of positively charged amino acids in the loop between TMS1 and TMS2 (the first cluster at amino acid positions 37, 39, 46, 49, and 50; the second at positions 68, 72, 77, 80, and 85). Our results demonstrate that the presence of the NH2-terminal half of the loop containing the first cluster and adjacent TMS1 were sufficient for M-LP to function as an mPTS. Therefore, it can be said that M-LP satisfies the law these authors suggested. The high sequence and membrane topological homologies of M-LP and Mpv17 have led to speculation that M-LP, as well as Mpv17, functions as an ROS scavenger. Accordingly, we determined the activities of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/MLP and pcDNA3.1 as a control. As shown in Table III, there was no significant difference between the Gpx or CAT activities of these cells. However, the SOD activity of the cell lysates prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with M-LP was significantly higher than that of the control cells. The following two mechanisms may be responsible for the elevation of SOD activity: activation of SOD at the protein level and an increase in the amount of SOD enzyme expressed. However, in view of our finding that preincubation with an anti-M-LP antibody did not influence the SOD activity (data not shown), it seems unlikely that the SOD activity is regulated by an interaction with M-LP at the protein level.Table IIIEnzyme activities in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1/MLPpcDNA3.1pcDNA3.1/MLPpunits/mg proteinSOD medium0.19 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.010.094SOD lysate0.24 ± 0.020.33 ± 0.030.010aStatistically significant.nmol/min/mg proteinGpx medium0.37 ± 0.030.41 ± 0.030.205Gpx lysate10.50 ± 1.0411.95 ± 0.930.146units/mg proteinCAT5.37 ± 0.887.43 ± 1.100.065a Statistically significant. Open table in a new tab Three SOD isoforms, a cytosolic, copper-zinc SOD (SOD1), a mitochondrial, manganese SOD (SOD2), and an extracellular SOD (SOD3) have been detected in mammalian cells (27Pause B. Saffrich R. Hunziker A. Ansorge W. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 23-28Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of these three SODs, cellular Gpx (Gpx1), Gpx3, and CAT in COS-7 cells transfected with M-LP were examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 3). Whereas the expression levels of five genes (SOD1,SOD3,Gpx1,Gpx3, and CAT) were unchanged, an increase in SOD2 mRNA compared with the control cell level was observed, suggesting that the increase in SOD activity in the M-LP expressing cells was due mainly to up-regulation of the SOD2 gene. Recently, Wagneret al. (15Wagner G. Stettmaier K. Bors W. Sies H. Wagner E.M. Reuter A. Weiher H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1019-1025Google Scholar) performed the reverse experiment,i.e. examination of the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes in Mpv17 null cells, and found that the absence of the Mpv17 protein reduced expression of all three SOD isoforms and Gpx3 and concomitantly increased γ-glutamyl transpeptidase expression. Therefore, M-LP seems to have the same function as the Mpv17 protein from the point of view that its action leads to a reduction in ROS production. In our previous study, we used comparative reverse transcriptase-PCR and showed that M-LP gene expression changed age-dependently (2Iida R. Yasuda T. Tsubota E. Matsuki T. Kishi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 292-296Google Scholar). Our finding that M-LP affected expression of the SOD2 gene awoke our interest in the expression patterns of the SOD2 gene during development and aging. Therefore, the levels of M-LP and SOD2 mRNAs in the kidneys of 3-day- to 15-month-old mice were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Fig.4 A, the amount of M-LP expressed increased steadily during development, reached its highest levels in adulthood and decreased gradually with aging. This observation agreed quite well with our previous results (2Iida R. Yasuda T. Tsubota E. Matsuki T. Kishi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 292-296Google Scholar). As expected, the expression pattern of the SOD2 gene was very similar to that of M-LP (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that M-LP participates in the regulation of SOD2 gene expression. Age-dependent changes in SOD2 activity or its gene expression have been reported in several mammalian tissues. However, the expression patterns vary depending on species and/or tissues. For instance, SOD2 activity was observed to be lower in human skin fibroblast cell lines derived from fetal skin than those from postnatal skin, although no postnatal age-dependent differences were observed (29Allen R.G. Keogh B.P. Gerhard G.S. Pignolo R. Horton J. Cristofalo V.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 576-587Google Scholar). Three-month-old rats had higher hepatic SOD2 activities than 24-month-old rats, whereas there was no significant age-related difference in the SOD2 activities of the lungs (30Santa Maria C. Ayala A. Revilla E. Free Radical Res. 1996; 25: 401-405Google Scholar). In our previous study, we showed that the M-LP gene is expressed mainly in the kidney and spleen. The different expression patterns in various tissues may be attributable to the participation of a tissue-specific molecule like M-LP in the regulation of SOD2. ROS are generated constantly during oxidative metabolism and cause cellular damage by reacting with proteins, lipids, DNA, and carbohydrates. SOD is considered to be one of the most important constituents of the first line of defense against ROS production by virtue of its ability to convert highly reactive superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. Our data demonstrated that, of the three SODs, only the SOD2 gene was up-regulated by the expression of M-LP. The biological importance of SOD2 has been shown in studies on knockout mice (31Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Google Scholar, 32Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H.

A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Google Scholar): homozygous mutant mice died less than 3 weeks after birth, probably because of severe impairment of mitochondrial function because of the elevated level of ROS (28Przedborski S. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 99-100Google Scholar). Analysis of the 5′-flanking region resulted in the identification of several regulatory sequences, including Sp1, NF-κB, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein, and an antioxidant-response element (33Jones P.L. Kucera G. Gordon H. Boss J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 155-161Google Scholar). Of the antioxidant enzymes, only SOD2 is induced by various stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (34Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Google Scholar), interleukin-1 (35Masuda A. Longo D.L. Kobayashi Y. Appella E. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3087-3091Google Scholar), and X-irradiation (36Akashi M. Hachiya M. Paquette R.L. Osawa Y. Shimizu S. Suzuki G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15864-15869Google Scholar) that are known to produce ROS or induce intracellular ROS generation. The mechanism responsible for the induction of SOD2 under these conditions has yet to be elucidated, however, it has been proposed that tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 regulate SOD2 expression by activating the transcription factor NF-κB (37Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L588-L602Google Scholar, 38Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 474-486Google Scholar). Thus, further investigation is needed to clarify the relationship between M-LP and these factors and the role(s) of M-LP in ROS metabolism. We thank F. Nakamura for secretarial assistance. We also thank S. Ikeda and K. Ikeda for heartfelt encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W1984339303,"In this study, we have identified novel regulatory steps involved in the cross-talk between protein kinase B (PKB) and MAPK signaling pathways. We found that PKB down-regulates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway by reducing the activity of ERK, which leads to inactivation of the transcription factor Elk1. In addition, PKB is able to reduce protein levels of Elk1. Both events lead to suppression of serum response element (SRE)-dependent transcription and a consequent decrease in the transcription of SRE-containing genes, such as c-fos. Because activation of the Ras/MAPK cascade is reported to increase c-fos transcription before apoptosis, our results are consistent with a specific role for PKB in promoting cell survival. Decrease in c-Fos protein levels in glioblastoma cells with constitutively active PKB provides further support for our observations. Therefore, our findings delineate a novel mechanism regulating immediate-early transcription, which may be involved in the initial steps in PKB-induced oncogenic transformation.

Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), where it directly regulates transcription. The targets of PKB regulation are either genes whose products are involved in insulin metabolism or transcription factors regulating cell survival (for review, see Ref. 4Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Thus, PKB mediates transcription of several hepatic genes by acting through the insulin response sequences within the respective promoters. Insulin-induced genes include fatty acid synthase and GLUT1, whereas insulin also represses transcription of the IGF-binding protein-1 gene (for review, see Ref. 5Galetic I. Andjelkovic M. Meier R. Brodbeck D. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors are also regulated by PKB. Phosphorylation by PKB is reported to stimulate the activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) (6Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In addition, PKB participates in IκB degradation, which results in NFκB induction (7Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). This implicates PKB in cytokine-mediated immunity and anti-apoptotic signaling. On the other hand, Forkhead transcription factors, members of the FOXO subfamily, are negatively regulated when phosphorylated by PKB (for review, see Ref. 8Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Anat. 2000; 197: 571-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated FOXOs are inactive and sequestered in the cytoplasm away from their transcriptional targets, which prevents induction of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest by these transcription factors. Furthermore, it was reported recently that PKB phosphorylates Mdm2 and, thus, promotes its nuclear translocation. This leads to increased ubiquitination of p53 and resistance to apoptosis in some cancer cells (9Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 10Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Another key mediator of cellular response to external stimuli is the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which is highly conserved in all eukaryotes (for review, see Refs. 11Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar and 12Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). It is activated by a GTP-binding protein, p21 Ras, which leads to recruitment of Raf (MAPKKK) to the plasma membrane. Activated Raf phosphorylates MEK (MAPKK), a dual specificity kinase that phosphorylates the Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Upon activation, ERK translocates to the nucleus and regulates the activity of many transcription factors, which results in distinct biological responses (for review, see Refs. 11Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar and 12Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The most-studied transcription factors regulated by MAPK are ternary complex factors (TCFs). TCF proteins belong to the ETS family of transcription factors, which have a characteristic DNA binding domain (the ETS-DBD), forming a highly conserved helix-turn-helix structural motif (for review, see Ref. 13Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The C terminus of TCFs comprises a transactivation domain with multiple serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated by different groups of MAP kinases. Whereas serum, growth factors and TPA stimulate phosphorylation of TCFs via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor α, osmotic stress, H2O2, UV radiation, and anisomycin can induce phosphorylation of TCF through the MEK kinase (MEKK)-SEK1-JNK as well as through the TAK1-MKK3-p38 pathways (for review, see Ref. 13Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and14Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The mammalian TCFs, Elk1, Sap1, and Sap2/ERP/Net, regulate transcription from the serum response element (SRE) (for review, see Ref. 13Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). SRE is the major cis-element responsible for activation of immediate-early gene transcription in response to mitogens (for review, see Ref. 15Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It functions as a target for the Ras-MAPK pathway; thus, SRE is also termed a Ras-responsive element. The c-fos SRE is constitutively occupied by a serum response factor (SRF) dimer, which binds with high affinity to the CC(A/T)6GG motif within the SRE. SRF dimer recruits monomeric TCF, which forms a ternary complex with SRF on SRE and promotes transcription (for review, see Ref. 13Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). PKB and ERK signaling cascades are activated under similar conditions, which provides the possibility for cross-regulation. Thus, under specific conditions PKB can phosphorylate Raf1 (16Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 17Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) or B-Raf (18Guan K.L. Figueroa C. Brtva T.R. Zhu T. Taylor J. Barber T.D. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27354-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which inactivates the MAPK pathway. On the other hand, PI3K can stimulate the activity of the MAPK cascade via the Rac1-PAK pathway by activating Raf (19Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that Rho-family GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, inhibit MAPK signaling at the level of Raf through PI3K/PKB activation (20Zugasti O. Rul W. Roux P. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Franke T.F. Fort P. Hibner U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6706-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Rac1/Cdc42 signaling mimics the loss of cell anchorage, which activates the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and induces apoptosis (20Zugasti O. Rul W. Roux P. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Franke T.F. Fort P. Hibner U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6706-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify novel regulatory points in the cross-talk between PKB and MAPK pathways that contribute to the PKB-mediated changes in transcription. We found that PKB down-regulates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway by reducing the activity of ERK, which leads to inactivation of transcription factor Elk1. Significantly, active PKB also indirectly induces a reduction of Elk1 protein levels. Both events lead to suppression of SRE-dependent transcription and consequently change the immediate-early gene response. Our results delineate a novel mechanism of regulating transcription from the SRE/c-fos promoters that may be involved in oncogenic transformation by PKB. Mammalian expression pCMV5 constructs encoding hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged PKB and pSG5-FLAG-C-terminal modulator protein (CTMP) have been described previously (3Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

HA-RasV12 cDNA was sub-cloned by PCR into the BamHI site of pSG5 (Stratagene). pcDNA1.RafBXB, pEXV3.EEMEK, and pcDNA-HA-ERK2 were obtained from Dr. Y. Nagamine (Friedrich Miescher Institute), and pCMV5-Myc-ERK was from Dr. M. Cobb (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). SRE and TCF constructs were obtained from Drs. B. Wasylyk (CNRS, Illkirch, France), P. E. Shaw (University of Nottingham), and A. D. Sharrocks (University of Manchester), and pfos-luc was provided by Dr. J. L. Bos (University Medical Center Utrecht). (Gal)5-TK-luc was obtained by subcloning the promoter of pG4CAT (Clontech) in pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) in front of the TK promoter. pGL2-(Pal)8-TK-luc was obtained by subcloning the (Pal)8-TK fragment of the (Pal)8-TK-CAT reporter in pGL2-Basic. Secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporters were from the Mercury Pathway Profiling System from Clontech. HEK 293 and glioblastoma cell lines LN229, U87MG, and U343MG were maintained as described previously (21Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at 60% confluency and transfected the following day by a modified calcium phosphate method (22Chen C.A. Okayama H. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 24 h with the transfection mix, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and serum-starved for 24 h, in some cases in the presence of 20 μm UO126 (Tocris). After starvation, the cells were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum for 6 h, or 100 ng/ml TPA or 50 ng/ml IGF-1 as indicated. HEK 293 cells were lysed with 200 μl of buffer (cell culture lysis reagent; Promega) supplemented with 1 μm microcystin-LR (Alexis), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmbenzamidine. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was assayed according to the Promega protocol and corrected for transfection efficiency. SEAP assays were done according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Great EscAPe chemiluminescence protocol (Clontech). HEK 293 cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μm microcystin-LR (Alexis), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthopervanadate, and 10 mm NaF. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined as described above. The HA-tagged PKBα and Myc-tagged ERK2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell extracts as described previously (3Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl followed by lysis buffer and finally with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 60 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 30 μl of immunoprecipitate in kinase buffer, 3 μg of glutathione S-transferase-ElkC as a substrate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Bachem), and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences; 1000–2000 cpm/pmol). All reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-10% PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography and quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For endogenous PKB and ERK kinase assays, proteins were immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of cell extracts, and immune complexes were washed as above. In vitro kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C with crosstide (PKB) or myelin base protein (ERK) as described (24Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 25Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

HEK 293, LN229, U87MG, and U343MG cells were lysed as described above, and 20–40 μg of the cell extracts was resolved by SDS-10% PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. The filters were blocked for 30 min in 1× Tris-buffered saline blocking buffer containing 5% skimmed milk, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20 followed by a 2-h incubation with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for active MAPK (Promega), PKB (26Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), phospho-Akt Ser-473 (Cell Signaling Technology), and ERK1 (C-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with the following mouse monoclonal antibodies: pan-actin (Ab5; NeoMarkers), c-Fos (4–10G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 12CA5 anti-HA, or 9E10 anti-Myc antibody. The secondary antibodies used were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Detection was performed using alkaline phosphatase color development reagents from Bio-Rad. To investigate possible cross-talk between PKB and other signaling cascades, we performed a screen of signal transduction pathways by monitoring the transcriptional activity of several reporter constructs. For this purpose, we used the SEAP reporter system, where a specific response element is located upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter fused to secreted alkaline phosphatase. Secreted phosphatase activity represents a direct readout for induction of specific signaling pathways. Thus, AP1 mirrors mitogen-activated JNK signaling, cAMP-response element (CRE) responds to polypeptide hormone- and neurotransmitter-activated protein kinase A and the stress-activated JNK/p38 pathway, NFκB activity increases after IκK-mediated cytokine and platelet-derived growth factor signaling, and the SRE is activated by mitogen-induced ERK/JNK pathways. To monitor the influence of PKB on other signaling cascades, constitutively active membrane targeted myristoylated/palmitoylated PKB (m/pPKB) was co-transfected with different SEAP reporter vectors. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the basal activity of the tested response elements was already high in HEK 293 cells, even in the absence of stimuli. Under these conditions, co-expression of m/pPKB led to a 20 and 30% increase in AP1- and NFκB-driven transcription, respectively, whereas the CRE pathway was not significantly affected by m/pPKB. The most significant change in transcription was observed when m/pPKB was co-transfected with the SRE-dependent construct, the activity of which decreased 85% compared with the control. This suggests that PKB plays an important role in the regulation of ERK/JNK pathways and/or ternary complex factor Elk1/Sap1-mediated transcription. To further confirm whether the SRE can be regulated by the PKB pathway, a luciferase reporter gene was constructed that contained binding sites for the TCFs and SRF as well as an AP1-binding site (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the expression of increasing amounts of wild-type PKB reduced the basal level of transcription of the SRE in a dose-dependent manner in HEK 293 cells. In contrast, the same effect could not be observed with an inactive form of the kinase lacking the C-terminal 14 amino acids (PKB-KD), which indicates that the kinase activity of PKB is required for the effect on the SRE. Importantly, wild-type PKB promoted 50% inhibition at a concentration as low as 1 ng/ml transfected DNA, whereas inactive PKB had no effect on transcription. To further test whether this effect was due to PKB kinase activity, we compared the activity of constitutively active PKB mutants with that of wild-type PKB. For this purpose, we expressed in HEK 293 cells constitutively active m/pPKB as well as the constitutively active cytosolic PKB mutant in which both the regulatory sites Thr-308 and Ser-473 were mutated to aspartate (PKB-DD). As shown in Fig. 1 C, both constitutively active mutants suppressed the basal level of SRE trans-activation, whereas the inactive PKB-KD had no effect on transcription (Fig. 1 C, open bars). The effect of PKB mutants was in accordance with their previously described activity (3Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Because it is well known that mitogens induce transcription by acting on SRE, we examined whether this activation is blocked by PKB. Serum stimulation led to a significant increase in SRE transcription (Fig. 1 C). However, all the active PKB mutants not only prevented activation of the SRE but also lowered its activity to below basal levels. As observed for basal conditions, PKB-KD was also unable to repress induction of the promoter by serum (Fig. 1 C,black bars). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKB can suppress basal as well as activated transcription from SRE. These data also suggest that PKB interfered with one or more pathways involved in SRE regulation. The SRE is the major cis-element activated in response to growth factors and is, thus, responsible for rapid and transient activation of immediate early genes, including c-fos and egr-1 (27Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of PKB on SRE within a physiologically relevant promoter, we performed experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1, with the luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 750-bp proximal human c-fos promoter containing Sis-inducible enhancer (SIS) and CRE elements in addition to SRE (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with our results with the SRE reporter (Fig. 1), wild-type but not kinase-inactive PKB reduced basal transcription from the c-fos promoter by 90% (Fig. 2 B). The effect of PKB was dose-dependent and caused a 50% inhibition of c-fos transcription at concentrations as low as 4 ng/ml transfected expression vector. Significantly, PKB and the constitutively active mutants also abolished the activity of the c-fos promoter after serum stimulation (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, reduction in c-fos transcription in HEK 293 cells correlated with the level of activity of endogenous PKB induced by upstream activators such as serum, TPA, or insulin (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with NIH 3T3 and COS-1 cells (data not shown), indicating that this regulation is not cell type-specific but may be a general mechanism of transcriptional regulation. We showed that PKB was able to suppress transcription mediated by SRE, which results in inhibition of its function to promote transcription of serum-responsive genes, such as c-fos. Mitogens activate immediate-early gene transcription through all three Ras-induced MAPK signaling pathways. The SRE is mainly activated via the pathway involving Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK (for review, see Ref. 15Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We first searched for a direct target of PKB regulation in this pathway using the c-fospromoter construct as a readout. For this purpose, HEK 293 cells were transfected with constitutively active components of the pathway (Fig. 3, A–C). As expected, constitutively active RasV12 stimulated c-fos transcription 20-fold (Fig. 3 A). This was almost completely inhibited by a MEK-specific inhibitor UO126 (Fig. 3 A) and indicates that the MEK-ERK signaling cascade was the main pathway involved in c-fos transcription. Constitutively active PKB, when coexpressed with Ras, displayed the same effect as the MEK inhibitor, decreasing c-fos transcription below the basal level, indicating that PKB affects the same pathway (Fig. 3 A). To investigate whether PKB acts downstream or upstream of Raf, PKB was co-transfected with constitutively active Raf BXB. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Raf BXB induced c-fos transcription 45-fold, which was completely abolished when UO126 was added to the cells. Similar to the experiments with RasV12, constitutively active PKB was able to decrease Raf-induced transcription from the c-fospromoter (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that PKB does not act directly on Ras but, rather, downstream in the pathway. By a similar strategy, constitutively active EE-MEK was co-transfected with PKB. Transfection of EE-MEK alone stimulated transcription 10-fold (Fig. 3 C). PKB diminished the activity of the promoter to its basal level, similar to that observed with UO126 (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these data indicate a PKB target downstream of Ras, Raf, and MEK, which directed us to investigate transcription factors regulated by ERK. The c-fos SRE is constitutively occupied by an SRF dimer, which recruits monomeric TCFs, Elk1, Sap1, or Sap2/ERP/Net, to form a ternary complex with SRF (for review, see Refs. 13Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 14Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). All three MAPK pathways converge on the TCFs, and ERK, JNK, and p38 are all able to phosphorylate Elk1 (for review, see Refs. 13Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 14Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined TCFs as possible targets of PKB downstream of MAP kinases. All three ETS-domain-containing transcription factors that can form ternary complexes on SREs were transfected with a minimal reporter containing the ETS palindromic site joined to the luciferase reporter. Both Elk1 (35-fold) and Sap1 (4-fold) activated, whereas Net inhibited (70%) transcription from the luciferase reporter (Fig. 4 A and data not shown), as previously demonstrated (28Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PKB repressed Elk- as well as Sap-induced transcription but did not interfere with Net-mediated inhibition (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). As a positive control, we used an Ets1 expression vector, which specifically binds to the ETS palindromic site and activates transcription. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Ets1-induced transcription was also efficiently suppressed by PKB, which can be explained by the fact that Ets1 can be regulated by MAP kinases (29Wasylyk C. Bradford A.P. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, TCF activity was sufficient to drive transcription from this reporter, indicating that the presence of SRF was not required and, therefore, strongly suggesting that inhibition of the c-fos transcription was not SRF-dependent. Because Elk was a more potent activator of transcription than Sap and it can be regulated by all MAP kinases, we next examined whether Elk is a target of PKB. For these experiments we used an expression vector containing the C-terminal MAP kinase-inducible activation domain of Elk1 fused to the heterologous DNA binding domain of the yeast protein Gal4 (Gal.ElkC). As shown in Fig. 4 B, Elk promoted transcription from the Gal4 reporter, but this was completely inhibited by PKB, whereas PKB-KD had no effect on transcription. Furthermore, UO126 only partially reduced Elk-stimulated transcription (Fig. 4 B). This confirmed previous data suggesting that several pathways contribute to Elk activation (Fig. 4 B). PKB, however, was able to abolish transcription completely and, thus, acts on an effector common to all these pathways (Fig. 4 B). We examined next whether PKB directly phosphorylates Elk1 in vitro. Under the conditions employed we could not find any evidence for Elk as a PKB substrate (data not shown), which prompted us to investigate the effect of PKB on Elk phosphorylation indirectly. ERK2 and PKB constructs were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells, and Ras-activated ERK2 was used as a positive control. In vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitated ERK2 and PKB were performed using glutathioneS-transferase-Elk (ERK) or crosstide (PKB) as a substrate. Unstimulated ERK showed low activity toward glutathioneS-transferase-Elk, whereas activation by RasV12 increased phosphorylation of Elk by ERK more than 10-fold (Fig. 5 A, middle panel). Constitutively active, but not inactive PKB suppressed Ras-induced ERK activity, resulting in 80% lower phosphorylation of Elk (Fig. 5 A, middle panel, bar graph). The level of repression of ERK activity (Fig. 5 A, middle panel, bar graph) was proportional to PKB activity (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). Levels of immunoprecipitated ERK on the beads were controlled by blotting the same autoradiograph with the Myc monoclonal antibody. This revealed similar amounts of ERK in each lane and, thus, excludes the possibility that lower ERK activity in the presence of PKB is due to the lower amount of ERK (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). ERK is activated by phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr in the activation loop. This TEY phosphorylation is regularly regarded as a measure of ERK activity. Therefore, to examine the phosphorylation status of ERK2 in our experiments, the membranes were stripped and re-probed with TEY phospho-sp"
https://openalex.org/W1987460236,"μ-Conotoxins (μ-CTXs) block skeletal muscle Na+ channels with an affinity 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than cardiac and brain Na+ channels. Although a number of conserved pore residues are recognized as critical determinants of μ-CTX block, the molecular basis of isoform-specific toxin sensitivity remains unresolved. Sequence comparison of the domain II (DII) S5-S6 loops of rat skeletal muscle (μ1, Nav1.4), human heart (hh1, Nav1.5), and rat brain (rb1, Nav1.1) Na+ channels reveals substantial divergence in their N-terminal S5-P linkers even though the P-S6 and C-terminal P segments are almost identical. We used Nav1.4 as the backbone and systematically converted these DII S5-P isoform variants to the corresponding residues in Nav1.1 and Nav1.5. The Nav1.4→Nav1.5 variant substitutions V724R, C725S, A728S, D730S, and C731S (Nav1.4 numbering) reduced block of Nav1.4 by 4-, 86-, 12-, 185-, and 55-fold respectively, rendering the skeletal muscle isoform more “cardiac-like.” Conversely, an Nav1.5→ Nav1.4 chimeric construct in which the Nav1.4 DII S5-P linker replaces the analogous segment in Nav1.5 showed enhanced μ-CTX block. However, these variant determinants are conserved between Nav1.1 and Nav1.4 and thus cannot explain their different sensitivities to μ-CTX. Comparison of their sequences reveals two variants at Nav1.4 positions 729 and 732: Ser and Asn in Nav1.4 compared with Thr and Lys in Nav1.1, respectively. The double mutation S729T/N732K rendered Nav1.4 more “brain-like” (30-fold↓ in block), and the converse mutation T925S/K928N in Nav1.1 reproduced the high affinity blocking phenotype of Nav1.4. We conclude that the DII S5-P linker, although lying outside the conventional ion-conducting pore, plays a prominent role in μ-CTX binding, thus shaping isoform-specific toxin sensitivity. μ-Conotoxins (μ-CTXs) block skeletal muscle Na+ channels with an affinity 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than cardiac and brain Na+ channels. Although a number of conserved pore residues are recognized as critical determinants of μ-CTX block, the molecular basis of isoform-specific toxin sensitivity remains unresolved. Sequence comparison of the domain II (DII) S5-S6 loops of rat skeletal muscle (μ1, Nav1.4), human heart (hh1, Nav1.5), and rat brain (rb1, Nav1.1) Na+ channels reveals substantial divergence in their N-terminal S5-P linkers even though the P-S6 and C-terminal P segments are almost identical. We used Nav1.4 as the backbone and systematically converted these DII S5-P isoform variants to the corresponding residues in Nav1.1 and Nav1.5. The Nav1.4→Nav1.5 variant substitutions V724R, C725S, A728S, D730S, and C731S (Nav1.4 numbering) reduced block of Nav1.4 by 4-, 86-, 12-, 185-, and 55-fold respectively, rendering the skeletal muscle isoform more “cardiac-like.” Conversely, an Nav1.5→ Nav1.4 chimeric construct in which the Nav1.4 DII S5-P linker replaces the analogous segment in Nav1.5 showed enhanced μ-CTX block. However, these variant determinants are conserved between Nav1.1 and Nav1.4 and thus cannot explain their different sensitivities to μ-CTX.

We conclude that the DII S5-P linker, although lying outside the conventional ion-conducting pore, plays a prominent role in μ-CTX binding, thus shaping isoform-specific toxin sensitivity. μ-conotoxin(s) brain-to-muscle DII, DIII, DIV, domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively heart-to-muscle saxitoxin tetrodotoxin wild-type μ-Conotoxins (μ-CTXs)1 are guanidinium toxins that are produced by the sea snail Conus geographus (1Cruz L.J.

Although chemically dissimilar to the pufferfish-derived tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the red tide saxitoxin (STX), μ-CTXs show biological actions similar to those of TTX and STX. Like TTX and STX, μ-CTXs block Na+ channels from different tissues with vastly different affinities. μ-CTXs preferentially block skeletal muscle and eel Na+ channels with affinities 2 orders of magnitude higher than for block of the cardiac and brain counterparts. In contrast, brain and skeletal muscle channels are 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to TTX/STX than are heart channels (11Fozzard H.A. Hanck D.A. Physiol.

Although the key determinant for isoform-specific TTX and STX block has been identified (tyrosine and phenylalanine in the domain I (DI) P loop of the TTX/STX-sensitive skeletal muscle and brain isoforms, respectively, but cysteine at the homologous position in the toxin-resistant cardiac subtype (16Backx P.H.

The S5-S6 linkers that form the outer pore vestibule and the selectivity filter are divided into three regions: S5-P, P loop (whose descending and ascending regions are referred to as SS1 and SS2, respectively), and P-S6 (see Fig. 1 A) (11Fozzard H.A. Hanck D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 887-926Google Scholar). Even though homologous regions are found in all four S5-P linkers of different Na+ channel isoforms, those of domains I–III display substantial divergence. DIII and DIV have small variable regions distal to the highly conserved P loops. To date, all critical determinants for μ-CTX block identified in the conventional aqueous pore formed by the P loop SS2s (11Fozzard H.A. Hanck D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 887-926Google Scholar) and the P-S6 linkers (10Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Velez P. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27551-27558Google Scholar, 24Li R.A. Velez P. Chiamvimonvat N. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 115: 81-92Google Scholar) are residues that are invariant in cardiac, skeletal muscle, and brain channels (8Dudley Jr., S.C. Todt H. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1657-1665Google Scholar, 9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Kallen R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Google Scholar, 10Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Velez P.

Therefore, they cannot explain the vast differences in isoform-specific μ-CTX sensitivity. Chimeric studies have demonstrated that DI and especially DII are more critical determinants of isoform-specific μ-CTX affinity than are DIII and DIV (the rat skeletal muscle (Nav1.4) Na+ channels carrying the entire DI or DII from the human heart (Nav1.5) isoform were ∼20- and >200-fold less sensitive, respectively, than wild-type (WT) Nav1.4) (14Chahine M. Sirois J. Marcotte P. Chen L. Kallen R.G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 236-246Google Scholar, 15Chen L.Q. Chahine M. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Horn R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 253-257Google Scholar); however, the detailed molecular basis remains unresolved. Sequence inspection of the DII S5-S6 loops of the toxin-sensitive Nav1.4 and the toxin-resistant rat brain (Nav1.1) and Nav1.5 Na+ channels reveals substantial divergence in their S5-P linkers, although the C-terminal portions (i.e. P and P-S6) that form the conventional ion-conducting pore are almost identical (for sequence comparisons, see Figs. 1 B and 4 A). Because many of the known toxin determinants are clustered in the DII pore region (8Dudley Jr., S.C. Todt H. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1657-1665Google Scholar, 9Li R.A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Google Scholar), the divergence of the adjacent DII S5-P linker motivated us to test whether the differences therein might underlie isoform-specific μ-CTX block. To test this hypothesis, we systematically converted the isoform-specific variants in Nav1.4 to those in Nav1.1 and Nav1.5 and vice versa and then assayed their effects on μ-CTX sensitivity. We identified DII S5-P variants that prominently determine isoform-specific μ-CTX block. The molecular basis of isoform-specific μ-CTX block is discussed in the context of structural implications of the sodium channel pore. A preliminary report has appeared (25Li R.A. Ennis I.I. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. Circulation. 2001; 104 (abstr.)Google Scholar).Figure 4Effects of DII S5-P isoform variants between Nav1.1 and Nav1.4 on μ-CTX block.

Nuss H.B. Marbán E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31598-31603Google Scholar); that of Nav1.1 was cloned into pLCT1 (27Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 811-820Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed using PCR with overlapping mutagenic primers. The presence of the desired mutation(s) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 channels were transfected into tsA-201 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, plasmid DNA encoding the WT or mutant α subunit (1 μg/60-mm dish) was added to the cells with LipofectAMINE, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 48–72 h before electrical recordings. For Nav1.1 channels, cRNA was transcribed from NotI-linearized DNA using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and coinjected with the rat brain β1 subunit into Xenopus oocytes for heterologous expression as described (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Kallen R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Google Scholar, 28Xue T. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46233-46242Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature using the whole cell patch clamp technique (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar) for tsA-201 cells and two-electrode voltage clamp recordings for oocytes. Transfected tsA-201cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy from the coexpressed green fluorescent protein. Patch pipette electrodes had final tip resistances of 1–3 megohms; the internal recording solution contained (in mm): 35 NaCl, 105 CsF, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. For oocyte recordings, the pipette contained 3m KCl and had final tip resistances of 2–4 megohms. All electrical recordings were performed in a bath solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Designated amounts of μ-CTX were added to the bath when required. Toxin was superfused continuously during the experiment at ∼10 ml/min (bath volume was 150 μl). Raw current records were analyzed using custom written software. Half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for μ-CTX were determined by fitting the dose-response data to the binding isotherm,I/IO=1/{1+([toxin]/IC50)}Equation 1 where IC50 is the half-blocking concentration, [toxin] is the toxin concentration, andI 0 and I are the peak currents measured from a step depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV before and after application of the blocker, respectively. Concentrations of 30 and/or 100 nm μ-CTX were initially used to screen mutants for changes in sensitivity. Depending on the sensitivity, concentrations used for subsequent experiments were chosen to bracket the IC50 of a particular mutant (e.g.1 and 3 μm for C731S). All data reported are the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's t test at the 5% level. We first compared the μ-CTX GIIIB sensitivity of WT Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 Na+ channels (Fig.1 B). Consistent with previous studies (12Moczydlowski E. Uehara A. Guo X. Heiny J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 479: 269-292Google Scholar, 14Chahine M. Sirois J. Marcotte P. Chen L. Kallen R.G. Biophys.

Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Google Scholar), Nav1.4 (IC50 = 29.7 ± 8.6 nm; n = 7) was substantially more susceptible to μ-CTX block than Nav1.5 (IC50 = 15.3 ± 7.7 μm;n = 3; p < 0.01). This vast isoform-specific difference in toxin block prompted us to investigate the underlying molecular basis. Even though the P loops of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 Na+ channels are highly conserved, a number of differences do exist. One such difference is the residue at position 401 in DI (Nav1.4 numbering throughout this manuscript unless otherwise specified). Although replacing Tyr401 with a cysteine could largely explain the isoform-specific differences in TTX and STX block observed with Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 channels (16Backx P.H. Yue D.T. Lawrence J.H. Marbán E. Tomaselli G.F. Science. 1992; 257: 248-251Google Scholar, 18Satin J. Kyle J.W. Chen M. Bell P. Cribbs L.L. Fozzard H.A. Rogart R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1202-1205Google Scholar), this mutation had little effect on μ-CTX block (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Kallen R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Google Scholar, 14Chahine M. Sirois J. Marcotte P. Chen L. Kallen R.G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 236-246Google Scholar). Despite the lack of a significant role for this pore residue, it is still conceivable that other differences in the pore, especially those involving a charge difference, may be responsible for isoform-specific μ-CTX block. Charge-variant residues in the pore include DIII Glu1251, DIII Lys1252, and DIV Asp1545 (Gly, Tyr, and Tyr, respectively, at the equivalent locations in Nav1.5). To examine the role of these residues in the isoform specificity of μ-CTX, we created and studied the Nav1.4 constructs E1521G/K1252Y and D1545Y. Both E1521G/K1252Y (IC50 = 53.6 ± 17.6 nm, n = 3) and D1545Y (IC50 = 54.7 ± 9.1 nm, n= 3) channels displayed Nav1.4-like sensitivity to μ-CTX GIIIB (p > 0.05), indicating that these variants in the conventional pore are not responsible for isoform-specific μ-CTX block of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 Na+channels. The lack of effect observed with isoform-specific mutations in the conventional pore prompted us to examine other channel regions. Comparison of the primary sequences of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 reveals substantial divergence in the DII S5-P linkers. Sequence alignment of the two isoforms, however, is ambiguous because the Nav1.5 linker is shorter than that in Nav1.4, and the remaining residues contain numerous conservative differences. Fig. 1 B shows the two alignments that we used as a guide to create DII S5-P Nav1.4 constructs (isoform-specific residues mutated are identified byasterisks). Fig. 1 C summarizes the effects of these variant mutations on μ-CTX GIIIB block. All DII S5-P mutants except Δ723C/V724R/Δ725C/K726R expressed functional channels. Because the deletion of Cys723 and Cys725 did not yield measurable currents, we studied the roles of these residues by serine substitution (i.e. C723S and C725S, respectively) as inspired by the Cys → Ser difference at position 731. Indeed, the isoform-specific point mutations V724R (IC50 = 111.4 ± 14.4 nm, n = 5), C725S (IC50= 2.5 ± 0.1 μm, n = 6), A728S (IC50 = 364.3 ± 24.3 nm,n = 4), D730S (IC50 = 5.5 ± 0.5 μm, n = 3), and C731S (IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.5 μm, n = 3) significantly reduced GIIIB block of μ1 by 4-, 86-, 12-, 185-, and 55-fold respectively, rendering the muscle isoform more “cardiac-like.” Interestingly, N732D slightly improved toxin binding. To obtain further mechanistic insights, we also studied the mutations A728V and A728L (Fig. 2 A). Of the mutations at the 728 position, A728L channels displayed the lowest sensitivity to GIIIB (IC50 = 1.4 ± 0.2 μm,n = 3) followed by A728V (IC50 = 1.1 ± 0.4 μm, n = 4), A728S, and WT Nav1.4. Because leucine has the largest side chain (124 Å3), followed by valine (105 Å3), serine (73 Å3), and alanine (67Å3), these observations are consistent with the notion that side chain volume at position 728 influences toxin block and that μ-CTX binding is optimal when an alanine is present. For channel position 730, we neutralized the native cationic residue also by replacing it with an asparagine (i.e. D730N). Similar to D730S, D730N showed significantly reduced GIIIB block (IC50 = 3.0 ± 0.3 μm, n = 4, p < 0.05). Interestingly, although the charge-conserved mutation D730E (IC50 = 553.4 ± 77.9 nm,n = 4) improved toxin block compared with D730S and D730N channels, the charge-reversed mutation D730K (IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.2 μm, n = 3) did not worsen it compared with the charge-neutralized substitutions D730S and D730N, as might have been anticipated from a simple electrostatic effect. Instead, D730K channels were >2-fold more susceptible than either of the neutral counterparts. These results of Asp730 mutations are summarized in Fig. 2 B. If the DII S5-P isoform-specific variants identified above are truly responsible for isoform-specific μ-CTX block of Nav1.4, then conversion of the equivalent residues in Nav1.5 to those in Nav1.4 should enhance the sensitivity of the toxin-resistant heart channels. However, it should be pointed out that no single residue completely reproduced the cardiac sensitivity. The closest was D730S, whose “isoform specificity” is somewhat debatable because the sequence alignment in this region is ambiguous, as shown in Fig. 1 B, and because of the seemingly important steric role of DII S5-P, as gauged by the mutations at position 728. We postulate that the spacing between these residues plays a role in high affinity toxin block of WT Nav1.4. Therefore, we created a Nav1.5 → Nav1.4 (heart-to-muscle or H-to-M) chimera in which 10 consecutive DII S5-P residues from Nav1.4 were spliced into the “homologous” region of Nav1.5 (Fig.3 A). Although falling short of reproducing the high affinity μ-CTX block seen in Nav1.4 (Nav1.4 H-to-M IC50 = 4.2 ± 1.3 μm, n = 7), block by 5 μmμ-CTX GIIIB was enhanced significantly in the DII S5-P Nav1.5 chimeric construct (60.7 ± 7.5%,n = 7) compared with the WT Nav1.5 (31.2 ± 8.9%, n = 3; p < 0.05; Fig. 3 B). Although the amino acid differences between Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 at positions 724, 725, 728, 730, and 731 in the DII S5-P linker appear to modulate μ-CTX block prominently, these residues are absolutely conserved between Nav1.1 and Nav1.4 (Fig.4 A) and thus cannot explain their known difference in μ-CTX sensitivity (11Fozzard H.A. Hanck D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 887-926Google Scholar, 12Moczydlowski E. Uehara A. Guo X. Heiny J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 479: 269-292Google Scholar). Further sequence comparison of the DII S5-P linker of the muscle and brain isoforms reveals two other unique variants at positions 729 and 732: serine and asparagine in Nav1.4 compared with threonine and lysine in Nav1.1. To test their roles, we replaced the Nav1.4 residues Ser729 and Asn732with those in Nav1.1 and studied their effects (Fig. 4,B and C). Consistent with the notion that the DII S5-P linker plays a prominent role in determining the isoform-specific μ-CTX response, the chimeric single mutations S729T (IC50= 100.1 ± 22.4 nm, n = 3) and N732K (IC50 = 249.6 ± 100.7 nm,n = 8) rendered Nav1.4 more “brain-like” by reducing their sensitivity. Similar to N732K, replacement of residue 732 with an arginine (N732R), which also places a positive charge at the same position but with a slightly larger side chain volume (148 Å3 versus 135 Å3of lysine), also reduced GIIIB block (IC50 = 151.1 ± 25.8 nm, n = 3; Fig.5). Combining S729T and N732K mutations (S729T/N732K) further decreased μ-CTX sensitivity (IC50 = 904.9 ± 286.0 nm, n = 4) to a level comparable with that of WT Nav1.1 (IC50 = 2686.5 ± 138.8 nm, n = 6; Fig. 4,B and C), suggesting that the effects of these mutations were additive. To confirm the isoform-specific role of residues 729 and 732, we next converted the analogous residues in Nav1.1 simultaneously to those of Nav1.4 (i.e.Nav1.1-T925S/K928N). Indeed, this chimeric double mutation reproduced the high affinity μ-CTX GIIIB block observed with Nav1.4 channels (IC50 = 52.8 ± 10.6 nm, n = 4; Fig. 4, B andC). Collectively, our data substantively bolster the notion that the DII S5-P linker is a determinant for isoform-specific μ-CTX block. Even though μ-CTX GIIIA and GIIIB have nearly identical backbone structures and block WT Nav1.4 with the same affinity, we recently reported that the negatively charged DII P-S6 residues Asp762 and Glu765, when mutated to lysine, confer upon Nav1.4 channels the unique ability to distinguish between these toxin forms (20Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Tomaselli G.F. French R.J. Marbán E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6002-6008Google Scholar, 31Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Google Scholar, 32Wakamatsu K.

Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6908-6916Google Scholar). Because the DII S5-P variants identified are also in DII (in particular, the Asp → Lys N732K variant is also a lysine substitution), we tested whether our DII S5-P variant channels possessed such discriminative ability so as to obtain insights into this obscure channel region. Fig. 5 shows that V724R, C725S, A728S, S729T, D730N, and C731S channels had equal susceptibilities to GIIIA and GIIIB (p > 0.05). In contrast, although ∼10-fold less sensitive to block by GIIIB than WT Nav1.4, both N732K and N732R channels displayed GIIIA sensitivity not different from WT Nav1.4 (p> 0.05). Therefore, these constructs could discriminate between GIIIA and GIIIB in a manner similar to the DII P-S6 lysine mutants. Likewise, WT Nav1.1 could also discriminate between the two toxin forms (IC50 for GIIIA = 290.6 ± 11.4 nm, n = 11). This discriminative ability of WT Nav1.1, however, was lost in the B-to-M chimeric double mutant (IC50 for GIIIA = 52.8 ± 10.6 nm, n = 6). Reversing both the DII P-S6 negative charges at positions 762 and 765 by lysine substitution (D762K/E765K) results in an additional decrease in GIIIB (but not GIIIA) block compared with the individual single mutations alone, suggesting that both charges are required simultaneously for high affinity GIIIB block (10Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Velez P. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27551-27558Google Scholar, 20Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Tomaselli G.F. French R.J. Marbán E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6002-6008Google Scholar). We next investigated whether a similar additive effect was observed when N732K from DII S5-P and the DII P-S6 mutations are combined. The triple mutation N732K/D762K/E765K rendered Nav1.4 channels highly insensitive to μ-CTX GIIIB (IC50 = 110 ± 25 μm; n= 4) but only modestly reduced GIIIA block (IC50 = 182.4 ± 90.8 nm; n = 3). Fig.6 shows a typical toxin experiment performed with this channel construct. Application of 5 μm GIIIB to N732K/D762K/E765K channels produced no significant current blockade, and 10 μm GIIIB blockedI Na only to 92.4 ± 4.5% of the control toxin-free level (versus ∼87% block of D762K/E765K with 3 μm GIIIB; see Fig. 4 of Ref. 20Li R.A. Ennis I.L. Tomaselli G.F. French R.J. Marbán E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6002-6008Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of N732K on GIIIB block and those of the DII P-S6 mutations were largely additive. In contrast, application of 300 nm GIIIA to N732K/D762K/E765K mutant channels substantially reducedI Na to 33.8 ± 10.6%. Therefore, N732K/D762K/E765K, as anticipated from the blocking phenotypes of the individual mutations, could also discriminate between GIIIA and GIIIB. Ion channels with similar ionic selectivity may differ significantly in other properties related to the pore, such as drug and toxin sensitivity. As mentioned, skeletal muscle Na+channels exhibit sensitivity to block by μ-CTX which is 2 orders of magnitude greater than their cardiac and brain counterparts. Although previous studies have identified critical pore residues for high affinity μ-CTX block (8Dudley Jr., S.C. Todt H. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. Biophys.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15481-15487Google Scholar), these residues are well conserved among different channel isoforms and therefore cannot explain their vastly different toxin sensitivities. To look for the molecular components responsible for such isoform-specific differences, we switched our focus to the DII S5-P linker, a highly variable region lying N-terminal to the highly conserved conventional pore formed by the P loop and the P-S6 linker (11Fozzard H.A. Hanck D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 887-926Google Scholar, 24Li R.A. Velez P. Chiamvimonvat N. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 115: 81-92Google Scholar).

We propose that Toxoplasma Rab6 regulates retrograde transport from post-Golgi secretory granules to the parasite Golgi. The Golgi complex coordinates secretory protein maturation and sorting and is a central intermediary of bidirectional transport between exocytic and endocytic pathways. In most protozoa, the early secretory pathway is well conserved in that of other eukaryotes, performing the critical function of biosynthetic transport to organelles, the cell surface, and the extracellular environment. Members of Apicomplexa, a diverse phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, are distinct from other eukaryotes in harboring three unique polarized secretory organelles, termed micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. As exemplified inToxoplasma gondii, sequential secretion from these organelles is essential for host cell invasion and the concomitant formation of an intracellular parasitophorous vacuole (PV) 1The abbreviations used are: PV, parasitophorous vacuole; TGN, trans-Golgi network; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ARF1, ADP-ribosylation factor-1; SNARE, soluble underln]N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; IMC, inner membrane complex; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BFA, brefeldin A 1The abbreviations used are: PV, parasitophorous vacuole; TGN, trans-Golgi network; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ARF1, ADP-ribosylation factor-1; SNARE, soluble underln]N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; IMC, inner membrane complex; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BFA, brefeldin A enveloping the parasite (1Joiner K.A. Roos D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Micronemes and rhoptries are apically tethered and secreted during attachment and penetration of a host cell. Dense granules inToxoplasma secrete aggregates of soluble and transmembrane proteins constitutively at a basal level and are stimulated for enhanced release following parasite invasion, suggesting a regulated, but Ca2+-independent, component (2Chaturvedi S.

Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that the sorting of dense granule proteins from those targeted to micronemes and rhoptries occurs at the late Golgi cisternae or trans-Golgi network (TGN). Although rhoptries originate from a precursor organelle formed by the Golgi during parasite division, the process regulating biogenesis ofToxoplasma dense granules is completely unknown. Two hypotheses are proposed to account for the biogenesis of regulated secretory vesicles in specialized mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 3Tooze S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the selective aggregation model, secretory proteins aggregate in the TGN and are sorted for entry into secretory granules by receptors in the TGN membrane. Proteins that fail to aggregate may exit the TGN independently in constitutive secretory vesicles. In the sorting-by-retention model, regulated proteins are retained and sorted from constitutive secretory cargo after formation of immature secretory granules. In this model, immature secretory granules budding from the TGN contain the bulk of biosynthetic cargo and undergo maturation by selective budding of constitutive secretory vesicles containing non-aggregate proteins. Toxoplasma dense granule protein aggregates may dissociate and insert post-translationally into target membranes only after secretion into the PV (4Lecordier L. Mercier C. Sibley L.D.

Understanding the biogenesis of Toxoplasma dense granules and the mechanisms involved in regulating dense granule protein transport will provide fundamental insight into the minimal requirements for sorting between regulated and constitutive secretory pathways in eukaryotes. Molecular evidence and genomic sequencing efforts indicate that the molecular machinery regulating vesicular transport in Apicomplexa is partially conserved in other eukaryotes, particularly early in the secretory pathway. Morphologically, these protozoa possess an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is contiguous with the nuclear envelope and a Golgi apparatus that ranges from single dispersed cisternae in malarial parasites (genus Plasmodium) to a stacked apically oriented Golgi in Toxoplasma. Components of the vesicle budding, transport, and fusion machinery have been cloned inToxoplasma, including N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, multiple Rab proteins (7Stedman T.T. Joiner K.A. Gordon S. Phagocytosis and Pathogens. 6. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1999: 233-261Google Scholar), ARF1 (8Liendo A. Stedman T.T. Ngo H.M. Chaturvedi S. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7332-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, targeting motifs have not been found in dense granule proteins, and heterologous soluble proteins expressed with an N-terminal signal sequence are constitutively secreted into the PV through dense granules (12Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J. Reddy A. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To further define regulation of dense granule secretion, we sought to identify molecular effectors of dense granule protein transport. In conjunction with effector proteins, monomeric GTPases of the Rab family localize to distinct intracellular compartments and confer one level of specificity on vesicle transport and fusion by mediating tethering or docking of opposing membranes prior to pairing of SNAREs. The small GTPase Rab6 appears to function in intra-Golgi transport (13Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J.

The yeast homolog of Rab6, Ypt6p, was initially reported to function in early Golgi transport (17Li B. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16813-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Li B. Warner J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Current evidence now indicates that Ypt6p aids recycling of endosome-derived vesicles with late Golgi membranes and is dependent upon a guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex, SNAREs, and the VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) complex (19Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R.

In this report, we show that Toxoplasma Rab6 regulates protein transport at a step between dense granules and the late Golgi cisternae and that overstimulation or inhibition of Rab6 function partially blocks constitutive secretion of proteins by disregulating their transport to dense granules. The effect of Rab6 overstimulation appears to enhance the brefeldin A-induced resorption of constitutively secreted cargo and Golgi cisternae to the ER. Furthermore, expression of either GTP-activated or dominant-interfering Rab6 mutants altered parasite cytokinesis, leading to a partial switch in daughter parasite budding to endopolygeny. These results suggest that Toxoplasma Rab6 mediates a retrograde pathway from post-Golgi secretory organelles to the late Golgi and may provide a link between Rab6 function and coupled mitosis and cytokinesis. T. gondii RH strain cells were maintained in vitro by infection of Vero cell monolayers as previously described (22Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT)-deficient T. gondii cells were obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research Reference Reagent Program (23Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). T. gondii RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and primer oligo(dT17)XX. PCR amplification of cDNA was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using degenerate oligonucleotides and targeting domains conserved either among Rab proteins in general (primer URABF, encoding the conserved PM3-binding site QLWDTAGQE) or Rab6 proteins in particular (primers AVVYDIT and AQEYNT). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 45 s, 52.5 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 rounds of amplification. Amplification products from the URABF/oligo(dT17)XX primer set were used as template for nested 3′-RACE/PCR with the AIVVYDIT/oligo(dT17)XX primer set. Template for 5′-RACE/PCR was generated by reverse transcription with Rab6R and dCTP tailing with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and used for PCR with Rab6R and the RACE anchor primer (Invitrogen). Nested 5′-RACE/PCR was performed with Rab6I and the anchor primer. Nested PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and screened by colony hybridization. Sequence analysis of independent RACE clones confirmed the 5′- and 3′-ends ofT. gondii rab6 cDNA, including an overlapping region of 133 bp. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of T. gondii rab6 was amplified from cDNA using the Rab6F/Rab6R primer set, overlapping the initiation and stop codons, respectively. Sequences of independent clones confirmed the identity of the full-length 597-bp rab6 ORF to the 5′- and 3′-RACE clones, and Rab6 homology was confirmed by TBLASTN analysis. The T. gondii rab6 cDNA sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number AF228419). The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used in the isolation of rab6 cDNA are as follows (where positions of deoxynucleotide base degeneracy are in parentheses and I is inosine): oligo(dT17)XX, 5′-T17(G/A/C)(G/A/T/C)-3′; URABF, 5′-CA(G/A) AT(A/T/C) TGG GA(T/C) AC(G/A/T/C) GCI GG(G/A/T/C) CA(G/A) GA-3′; AIVVYDIT, 5′-GCI AT(A/T/C) GTI GT(G/A/T/C) TA(T/C) GA(T/C) AT(A/T/C) AC-3′; AQEYNT, 5′-AAC ATI GT(G/A) TG(G/A) TA(T/C) TC(T/C) TG(G/A/T/C) GC-3′; Rab6R, 5′-AAC AGA TCT TTC AGC AAG AGC AGG ATG-3′; Rab6I, 5′-GAT CCA CTT GGT TGT ATT GAG-3′; Rab6HANsi, 5′-GTC AAC ATG CAT TAC CCA TAC GAC GTC CCA GAC TAC GCG GAG GCG ACA GTT GCG-3′; and R6rPacI, 5′-TCT TTA ATT AAC AAG AGC AGG ATG AAG TC-3′. Northern blot analysis was performed after electrophoresis of 20 μg of total RNA on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels (1.2% Sea Kem GTG agarose (FMC Corp.), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 6% formaldehyde) in HEPES/Formalin running buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% formaldehyde). RNA samples were transferred to Zetaprobe membranes (Bio-Rad) in sodium phosphate transfer buffer (25 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4), pH 6.5. Southern and colony blot hybridization analyses were performed as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A rab6 cDNA fragment generated by PCR primers AIVVYDIT and AQEYNT was agarose gel-purified and labeled by random oligonucleotide priming with [α-32P]dCTP and the Rediprime II kit (Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of >108 cpm/μg. Hybridizations were performed in high stringency buffer. Sequences homologous to Rab6 were aligned using the Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin package. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the PAUP program (phylogenetic analysis underln]usingparsimony). Bootstrap analysis was carried out with 1000 replicates. The consensus tree derived from bootstrap analysis was topologically identical to the single best parsimony tree. Graphical output from the tree file was provided using TreeView (R. Page, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland). A cytosolic T. gondii HA-Rab6 expression vector was developed by amplifying therab6 ORF using the Rab6HANsi/R6rPacI primer set. The product was subcloned into the NsiI-PacI sites of pSAG, a SAG1 expression vector (25Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), modified by removal of the SAG1 signal sequence for cytosolic protein expression, creating vector pSAGRab6HA. HA-Rab6(Q70L) and HA-Rab6(N124I) were generated by amplification of therab6 ORF with mutagenic primers and cloned by triple ligation into the NsiI-PacI sites of pSAG. Expression vectors encoding HA-Rab6(T25N) were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding HA-Rab6 vectors with complementary mutagenic primers by amplification using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). For bacterial expression, a 1.7-kilobase pairNcoI-BamHI fragment was excised from pNTPRab6 and subcloned into NcoI-BamHI-digested pET15b. HA-Rab6(Q70L) and HA-Rab6(N124I) were subcloned into the same sites after amplification of pSAGRab6 with appropriate mutagenic primers. Therab6 ORF in all vectors was fully sequenced for confirmation of the site-directed mutations and exclusion of additional mutations. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Plasmid vector pminCATBAP was modified for coexpression with HA-Rab6 or HA-Rab6 point mutants. This vector contains the heterologous secretory reporterEscherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (BAP), expressed from the T. gondiinucleoside-triphosphate hydrolase-3 promoter and fused to the nucleoside-triphosphate hydrolase-3 signal sequence (12Karsten V.

Therab6 ORFs were excised asHindIII-BamHI fragments from pSAGRab6HA and subcloned by replacement of the dihydrofolate reductase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion cassette in pminCATBAP, generating the pHXBAPRab6HA series plasmids. Parasites were transfected by electroporation according to published protocols (22Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For selection of stable lines, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient parasites were transfected, passaged twice in human foreskin fibroblast cultures under selection with 25 μm mycophenolic acid and 50 μm xanthine, and cloned by limiting dilution on 96-well plates (22Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression plasmids pET15HARab6, pET15HARab6(Q70L), and pET15HARab6(N124I) were transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Crude extracts from isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cultures and extracts from T. gondii and Vero cells were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and prepared for immunoblotting or GTP binding by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was performed with the ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences) using, as primary antibody, rabbit serum (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) immunized with a synthetic peptide encompassingT. gondii Rab6-(192–206) and displaying strong enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity. Membranes were exposed on X-Omat AR autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Scanned images were semiquantitatively analyzed with Scion Image software. Nitrocellulose transfer blots containing crude recombinant T. gondii HA-Rab6, HA-Rab6(Q70L), and HA-Rab6(N124I) proteins were analyzed for GTP-binding activity as previously described (26Lapetina E.G.

A. 1987; 84: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), except that phosphate buffer was substituted for Tris-HCl in the binding buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3% Tween 20). Blots were preincubated in binding buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP for 30 min. [α-32P]GTP was added to a concentration of 1 μCi/ml and incubated for 2 h, and the blots were washed with several changes of binding buffer for 2 h. Gels were dried and exposed at −70 °C on X-Omat AR film. Human foreskin fibroblast cell monolayers grown on coverslips were infected with freshly transfected (106 cells/coverslip) or untransfected (105 cells/coverslip) T. gondii cells for 16 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were prepared for immunofluorescence assay as previously described (12Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J. Reddy A. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included mouse anti-HA-11 (Covance), rabbit anti-BAP (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.), anti-IMC1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 45.5 (gift of Gary Ward, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT), and anti-GRA1 mAb T5-2B4 and anti-GRA2 mAb T4-1F5 (27Achbarou A.

Secondary antibodies included fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem), and Alexa-conjugated equivalents (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Epifluorescence and phase-contrast microscope images were captured on a Photometrics SenSys CCD camera and processed using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). For immunohistochemistry, infected Vero cell monolayers were fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde in 0.25m HEPES, pH 7.4. Sections (95 nm) were obtained from the Yale Center for Cell Imaging. Immunolabeling was performed with mouse anti-HA mAb (1:100; Babco), followed by rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:50; Cappel or ICN) and protein A-gold (1:70; J. Slot, University of Utrecht, Holland). The sections were contrasted with neutral uranyl acetate (2%), infiltrated with methyl cellulose (1.8%) and uranyl acetate (0.5%), and examined with a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope. For transmission electron microscopy, infected Vero cell monolayers were fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde and 100 mm cacodylate buffer for 2 h. Blocks were prepared for Epon embedding by the Yale Center for Cell Imaging. Ultrathin 60–80-nm sections were collected on grids, contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined as described above. Parasite cultures were washed three times with cysteine/methionine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and metabolically labeled in 1 ml of minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Promix, Amersham). For analysis of BAP and GRA2 secretion, parasites were labeled for 30 min. For pulse-chase analysis of GRA4, parasites were labeled for 10 min and chased after three washes for 0, 15, and 30 min. Parasites were freed from host cells by syringe passage in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing proteinase inhibitors (2Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D. Rodriguez A. Hanson P.I. Striepen B.

Cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Supernatants following the 1400 × g spin (containing T. gondii soluble secreted proteins of the vacuolar space) were used for immunoprecipitation after addition of Nonidet P-40 to 1% as previously described (28Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J. Joiner K.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 13: 103-111Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with antibody to BAP, GRA4 (mAb T8-4B9), or GRA2 (mAb T4-1F5) as described above. Gels were dried and exposed to Biomax film (Kodak). Images were scanned and quantitated using Scion Image software. Because Rab6 functions in Golgi transport in yeast and mammalian cells, we sought to identify this protein inToxoplasma as a potential regulatory target for secretory protein trafficking. Combinatorial RACE/PCR amplification was used to clone a T. gondii rab6 cDNA. In genomic digests, a rab6 cDNA probe strongly hybridized to a single T. gondii restriction fragment in each case (Fig. 1 A), indicating thatrab6 is a single-copy gene in T. gondii. Northern blot analysis indicated a major RNA transcript size of ∼1.3 kb, along with a larger, possibly unprocessed transcript (Fig. 1 B). In neither case did the rab6 probe hybridize to nucleic acid controls derived from host cell cultures, confirming that Rab6 is of parasite origin. The Toxoplasma rab6 cDNA encodes a 209-amino acid protein (Fig. 1 D) with a predicted molecular mass of 23.7 kDa. Of the available sequences, the Toxoplasma Rab6 protein is most homologous to Rab6 of the Apicomplexa malarial parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei (76–77% similarity and ∼72% identity using BESTFIT analysis). The phylogenetic relationship of T. gondii Rab6 to other Rab6 homologs was examined by alignment (Fig. 1 D) and parsimony analysis using the PAUP program (Fig. 1 C). The Rab family domains are well conserved, including the nucleotide-binding pocket domains and switch regions, which confer nucleotide-dependent conformational changes and interaction with Rab effectors (Fig. 1 D). Distinct fromSaccharomyces and Plasmodium,Toxoplasma Rab6 encodes a conservative Ser85residue within a motif essential for interaction with a cytoskeleton-associated Rab6 effector, Rabkinesin-6 (29Echard A. Opdam F.J. de Leeuw H.J. Jollivet F. Savelkoul P. Hendriks W. Voorberg J. Goud B. Fransen J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3819-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The hypervariable C-terminal region and extreme N terminus of Rab6, important in conferring functional specificity and intracellular distribution between Rab proteins, are divergent among Rab6 homologs. A single most parsimonious phylogenetic tree, well supported by bootstrap analysis, was generated with representatives of animal, plant, and fungal Rab6 homologs (Fig. 1 C). To initiate a functional analysis of T. gondii Rab6, we developed expression plasmids encoding Toxoplasma Rab6 and Rab6 GTP-binding domain mutants predicted to be altered in their GTP-binding affinity. An N-terminal 9-HA epitope tag was fused to theToxoplasma rab6 ORF or to point mutants Rab6(Q70L) and Rab6(N124I). Rab6(Q70L) is predicted to be deficient in GTPase activity, whereas Rab6(N124I) is predicted to lack affinity for guanine nucleotide, based upon homology to known Ras-related protein mutations (30Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 31Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Soluble bacterial lysates were probed by immunoblotting with antiserum to a synthetic peptide (T. gondii Rab6-(192–206)) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4) or with antibody to the HA epitope (data not shown); in each case, proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa were recognized. GTP-binding activity was assessed for HA-Rab6, HA-Rab6(Q70L), and HA-Rab6(N124I). Both HA-Rab6 (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) and HA-Rab6(Q70L) (lane 3) bound [α-32P]GTP nearly equally, but HA-Rab6(N124I) (lane 4) did not bind detectable amounts of GTP, confirming the anticipated GTP-binding characteristics of the mutants. In transiently or stably transfected Toxoplasmatachyzoites, both HA-Rab6 (Fig. 3 A) and HA-Rab6(Q70L) (Fig. 3 C) proteins localized, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay, predominantly to a discrete irregular structure apical to the parasite nucleus. HA-Rab6 signal was detected in lower amounts throughout the parasite cytoplasm and in one or more dense granules (Fig. 3, A and C). We reasoned that Rab6 motifs necessary for Golgi localization would be functionally conserved among eukaryotes, given the general ability to functionally complement subsets of Rab proteins between yeast and mammals. To compare the distribution of Toxoplasma Rab6 within a higher organism, T. gondii Rab6 was transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells and localized with endogenous markers, including the Golgi-associated tethering proteins giantin and GRASP65, the ER protein calnexin, and mannose 6-phosphate receptor protein, a marker principally of late endosomes. In addition to labeling a cytosolic pool, T. gondii HA-Rab6 localized in a juxtanuclear pattern typical of the Golgi (Fig. 3, E and H) and colocalized in this region with giantin (Fig. 3, E–G). Likewise, HA-Rab6 signal overlapped GRASP65 on the Golgi (Fig. 3,H–J). In contrast, HA-Rab6 exhibited minimal colocalization with the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and calnexin (data not shown). To more precisely define Rab6 localization in Toxoplasma, HA-Rab6(Q70L) parasite clones were subjected to immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 4, A–E). Activated Rab6 was most heavily concentrated on lateToxoplasma Golgi cisternae (Fig. 4, A andF). Specifically, Rab6 was distributed on the apical (trans) cytosolic face of the late Golgi cisternae and the TGN, on the cisternal rims of the trans- a"

Interaction between tissue-type plasminogen activator and its cellular receptor is critical for many of the functions of this protease. The annexin A2 motif that mediates tissue plasminogen activator interaction has been assigned to the hexapeptide LCKLSL in the amino-terminal domain of the protein, and it has been proposed that Cys8 of this sequence is essential for tPA binding. In an attempt to identify other amino acids critical for tPA-annexin A2 interaction, we have analyzed a set of peptides containing several modifications of the original hexapeptide, including glycine scans, alanine scans, d-amino acid scans, conservative mutations, cysteine blocking, and enantiomer and retroenantiomer sequences. Using a non-radioactive competitive binding assay, we have found that all cysteine-containing peptides, independently of their sequence, compete the interaction between tPA and annexin A2. Cysteine-containing peptides also inhibit tPA binding to the surface of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Mass spectrometry demonstrates that the peptides bind through a disulfide bond to a cysteine residue of annexin A2, the same mechanism that has been suggested for the inhibition mediated by homocysteine. These data call for a revision of the role of the LCKLSL sequence as the sole annexin A2 structural region required to bind tPA and indicate that further studies are necessary to better define the annexin A2-tPA interaction.

In addition to its important role in thrombolysis, plasmin participates in the extravascular breakdown of matrix and basement membrane in events such as cell migration, tissue remodeling, and invasive growth (3Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Google Scholar, 4Liotta L.A. Rao C.N. Barsky S.H. Lab.

Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Google Scholar). Characterization of specific receptors for components of the fibrinolytic system has been a crucial point of interest in this area. In addition to regulating the dynamics of clot lysis, these receptors may contribute to numerous cellular functions that are dependent upon cell-surface proteolytic activity (7Redlitz A. Plow E.F. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1995; 8: 313-327Google Scholar). Endothelial cell receptors for tPA and plasminogen are particularly relevant because of the proximity of these cells to vascular injury and fibrin deposition sites. Annexin A2 (also termed annexin II, p36, calpactin 1, or lipocortin II) has been identified as a receptor for tPA and plasminogen (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol.

All members of the annexin family contain four or more units of a conserved structural element of ∼70 amino acids, designated the annexin repeat, and a highly variable amino-terminal domain believed to determine individual annexin functions. A variety of biological functions have been described for the annexins, including regulation of membrane traffic (12Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J.

Extracellular AnxA2 has also been described as a membrane-bound receptor for a number of different molecules, although its interaction with the plasminogen system elements on the endothelial cell surface is the best characterized. Simultaneous binding of tPA and plasminogen to AnxA2 at the endothelial cell surface results in a 60-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of plasmin generation (9Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Google Scholar, 30Hajjar K.A. Krishnan S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 128-138Google Scholar). Previous reports (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar) have mapped the tPA binding site of AnxA2 to the hexapeptide LCKLSL, corresponding to residues 7–12 of its amino-terminal domain. These results were obtained using a competitive solid phase radioligand binding assay with synthetic peptides corresponding to the AnxA2 amino-terminal domain sequence as competitors of either purified or recombinant AnxA2. Results were further confirmed in vivousing primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The LCKLSL sequence contains a free thiol group (Cys8) (32Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Google Scholar) that is crucial for tPA interaction. Evidence for this conclusion included i) mutation of AnxA2 Cys8 to Gly resulted in loss of tPA binding, whereas mutations in the other Cys residues of the protein (C133G, C262G, and C335G) did not (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar), and ii) homocysteine (hC), an amino acid with prothrombotic properties, competed the binding of tPA to AnxA2 by forming a disulfide bond with Cys8 (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar). AnxA2 is expressed not only in endothelial cells but also in other cell types (33Ma A.S. Bell D.J. Mittal A.A. Harrison H.H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1973-1984Google Scholar, 34Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Google Scholar), including tumor cells (35Yeatman T.J. Updyke T.V. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Nicolson G.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 37-44Google Scholar). Interestingly, pancreas cancer cells overexpress AnxA2 (36Vishwanatha J.K. Chiang Y. Kumble K.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Pour P.M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2575-2579Google Scholar, 37Paciucci R. Tora M. Diaz V.M. Real F.X. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 625-633Google Scholar). Previous results from our group have demonstrated that tPA is also overexpressed in human pancreas tumors, and its inhibition using neutralizing antibodies or chemicals results in decreased invasiveness and tumorigenicity (37Paciucci R. Tora M. Diaz V.M. Real F.X. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 625-633Google Scholar,38Paciucci R. Berrozpe G. Tora M. Navarro E. Garcia D.H. Real F.X. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 72-76Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify tPA receptors in pancreatic cells and their involvement in tumorigenesis. The fact that AnxA2 has been shown to be overexpressed in pancreatic tumors supports the hypothesis that it could act as a tPA receptor. Recent work 2S. Peiró, S. Aguilar, J. M. Corominas, F. X. Real, and P. Navarro, unpublished work. indicates that AnxA2 may mediate, at least in part, the effects of tPA on pancreas cancer cells and therefore supports the notion that this protein could be used as a potential therapeutic target. To further probe this hypothesis, we evaluated a panel of synthetic peptides as competitors of the tPA-AnxA2 interaction. On the basis of the original LCKLSL motif, we generated a small library of peptides with alterations in sequence, chain length, configuration/conformation, and/or availability of the Cys-free thiol group. Our results demonstrate that all Cys-containing peptides, regardless of their sequence, are able to compete the tPA-AnxA2 interaction. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to determine the nature of the interaction between recombinant AnxA2 and Cys (LCKLSL) or homocysteine (L(hC)KLSL)-containing peptides and a Cys-lacking peptide of similar sequence (LAKLSL). In the first two instances, an increase in molecular weight compatible with a Cys and HC residue, respectively, strongly argued for the formation of the disulfide bond, whereas incubation of recombinant AnxA2 (rAnxA2) with the peptide lacking a thiol group had no effect. These results suggest that the LCKLSL hexapeptide, which has been assumed to be a key feature in tPA-AnxA2 binding, plays a distinctive, though probably not exclusive, role in such interaction, to the extent that blocking of the Cys residue will preclude the association of both proteins. Further research thus appears to be necessary to identify additional domains of AnxA2 involved in binding to tPA. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. rAnxA2 was prepared from BL21Escherichia coli transformed with the pET21b(+) vector containing the human AnxA2 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. K. A. Hajjar (Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY), as previously described (40Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Google Scholar). Purification was performed using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column after elution using a pH gradient from pH 8 to 4.8. Two elution peaks were collected, one at pH 5.2, corresponding to the monomeric form of the protein, and another one at pH 4.8, corresponding to the dimer. Both peaks were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Hexapeptides designed on the basis of the LCKLSL sequence (Table I) were synthesized onp-methylbenzhydrylamine resin as C-terminal carboxamides by solid phase methods using Boc chemistry. After HF cleavage, the peptides were purified to homogeneity (≥90% by analytical HPLC) by preparative reverse phase HPLC (41Carreño C. Roig X. Cairó J. Camarero J. Mateu M.G. Domingo E. Giralt E.

The integrity of biotinylated tPA was examined by SDS-PAGE (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Binding experiments were performed essentially as previously described (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Google Scholar) except that biotinylated tPA (btntPA) was used instead of125I-tPA. Ninety-six well Nunc Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were incubated with rAnxA2 (50 μl/well at 10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, plates were equilibrated (2 h, 37 °C) with incubation buffer (11 mmHepes, 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmglucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) and btntPA (100 nm, 2 h, 37 °C) was then added in the presence or in the absence of peptides. Alternatively, peptides were directly added to rAnxA2, either directly or after washing, andbtntPA was subsequently added. Plates were washed 3 times with 0.02% Tween 20, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with alkaline phosphatase-coupled streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Enzymatic activity was measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in triethanolamine buffer, pH 9.5) for 20 min at room temperature. Quantification was performed using a Cytofluor 235 instrument (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Confluent HUVEC, cultured in 96-well Nunclon plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL), were equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C with incubation buffer (same as above). 100 nmbtntPA was then added for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of selected peptides (10–1000 μm). After 3 washes with incubation buffer, cells were fixed with methanol (5 min at −20 °C), washed 3 times with 0.02% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-coupled streptavidin (1 h, 37 °C). Reactions were developed and quantified as described above. To determine specific binding, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled tPA was added during the incubation with btntPA. rAnxA2 (450 μm in phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated with a 5-mmsolution of peptide (LCKLSL, L(hC)KLSL or LAKLSL) and with 5 mm free homocysteine (hC) for 3 h at 37 °C. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NH4CO3 before the incubation. The reaction was stopped with 1 μl of formic acid and diluted 1:5 with 50% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One microliter of the resulting solution was mixed with sinapinic acid (1:1) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystem). The direct binding of LCKLSL, L(hC)KLSL, and LAKLSL peptides to rtPA was analyzed under the same experimental conditions. Previous work led to the identification of the hexapeptide LCKLSL (residues 7–12) from the AnxA2 amino-terminal domain as the minimum sequence required for interaction between AnxA2 and tPA (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar). Replacement of the Cys8 of this sequence by Gly abolished the interaction with tPA, indicating that this amino acid is critical for such interaction. To determine whether additional amino acids of this hexapeptide are required for the tPA-AnxA2 interaction and to identify peptides with improved blocking properties, we designed a small hexapeptide library with the modifications summarized on Table I. These modifications include glycine scans (peptides 2–7), alanine scans (peptides 8–13),d-amino acid scans (peptides 14–19), conservative replacements (Leu/Ile, peptides 20–22; Leu/Val, peptides 23–25; Lys/Arg, peptide 26; Ser/Thr, peptide 27), Cys protection (peptide 28), and enantiomer and retroenantiomer sequences (peptides 29 and 30). The competitive properties of the peptides were then evaluated in the tPA-AnxA2 interaction assays described below. We employed a non-radioactive modification of the competitive binding experiments already described (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar) using tPA labeled with biotin (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig.1 shows that solublebtntPA interacts in a dose-dependent fashion with immobilized rAnxA2, showing half-maximal binding at a 200 nm concentration. This binding profile is in the same range as that already described for 125I-tPA (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar), indicating the comparability of both assays. Moreover, an excess of unlabeled tPA completely inhibited the binding of btntPA to AnxA2 (not shown). In addition, cell binding studies were performed by assaying the binding of btntPA to HUVEC cells because AnxA2 is the main receptor for tPA in endothelial cells. As shown in Fig.2, btntPA binds to the surface of HUVEC in a selective and dose-dependent manner, indicating that the labeled protein also recognizes native AnxA2 on the cell membrane. The peptides described in TableI were tested for their ability to compete with the interaction betweenbtntPA and rAnxA2. Fig. 3shows the results obtained with several representative peptides. As expected, peptides lacking Cys8 (Fig. 3, peptide 9, LAKLSL) did not compete for tPA binding; the Ala substitution is shown, but similar results were obtained with the Gly substitution and when the Cys was protected, confirming the crucial role of this amino acid in the interaction. Surprisingly, the enantiomer (Fig. 3, peptide 29, lcklsl) and the retroenantiomer (Fig. 3, peptide 30, lslkcl) competed the interaction in a manner similar to that of the canonical hexapeptide (Fig. 3, peptide 1, LCKLSL), indicating that configurational/conformational characteristics are not determinant for the binding. Moreover, all other amino acid modifications resulting from the Ala and Gly scans showed the same competition activity as the LCKLSL sequence (Table I). We next assayed the inhibitory effect of the modified hexapeptides on tPA binding to the surface of endothelial cells. Fig.4 shows that the canonical hexapeptide (peptide 1, LCKLSL) and its enantiomer (peptide 29, lcklsl) cause a 40–60% reduction of the binding of btntPA to HUVEC. Peptides with mutations in Cys had no effect (peptide 9, LAKLSL, is shown in Fig. 4). The results described above strongly suggested that the presence of a Cys residue in the sequence was sufficient to compete the tPA-AnxA2 interaction. To test this hypothesis, a completely unrelated peptide containing one Cys residue (peptide 31, SFQTTTTYPTPSHPQTTLPC), a randomized version of the LCKLSL sequence (peptide 32, KLLCLS), and a four-amino acid peptide fragment of the canonical hexapeptide (peptide 33, LCKL) were next assayed. As shown in Fig.5, all these peptides display the same competitive activity as LCKLSL, indicating that the presence of a Cys residue in the competing peptide is sufficient to disrupt the interaction. To determine whether binding of peptides to tPA, rather than to AnxA2, was required for the inhibition, peptides were directly added to rAnxA2, plates were washed, and btntPA was then added. The results were similar to those described above, strongly suggesting the direct interaction of AnxA2 with the peptides (data not shown). The specific interaction of tPA with endothelial cells is inhibited by the thiol-containing amino acid hC, a fact that has been postulated as an explanation for the thrombotic events related to homocysteinemia (45Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 663-664Google Scholar, 46Graham I.M. Daly L.E. Refsum H.M. Robinson K. Brattstrom L.E. Ueland P.M. Palma-Reis R.J. Boers G.H. Sheahan R.G. Israelsson B. Uiterwaal C.S. Meleady R. McMaster D. Verhoef P. Witteman J. Rubba P. Bellet H. Wautrecht J.C. de Valk H.W. Sales Luis A.C. Parrot-Rouland F.M. Tan K.S. Higgins I. Garcon D. Medrano M.J. Candito M. Evans A.E. Andria G. JAMA. 1997; 277: 1775-1781Google Scholar, 47D'Angelo A. Selhub J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1-11Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which hC impairs tPA-endothelium interaction has been proposed to be based on the direct blockade of the tPA binding domain of AnxA2 through formation of a disulfide link with Cys8 (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar). We have compared the effects of hC and the peptides used in this study on the binding of tPA to AnxA2 under the experimental conditions described above. Fig.6 shows that hC competed less efficiently than the peptides. In contrast, when an analogue of the canonical hexapeptide containing hC instead of Cys (peptide 34, L(hC)KLSL) was assayed, it competed as efficiently as the consensus LCKLSL peptide. The lower effect of free versuspeptide-incorporated hC may be explained by differences in stability of the reduced state. As mentioned above, the mechanism proposed to explain the blocking effect of hC on the tPA-AnxA2 interaction is direct binding between hC and Cys8 through a disulfide bond (31Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Google Scholar). Our previous results suggest that any Cys-containing sequence can compete the binding between tPA and rAnxA2 in a similar fashion. To account for this fact we have considered two possible explanations: i) a low affinity interaction (disrupted by high concentrations of thiol-containing peptides) exists between tPA and AnxA2, which implicates Cys8 of AnxA2, or ii) by forming a disulfide bond with Cys8 of AnxA2 (as does homocysteine), Cys-containing peptides render this amino acid unavailable for further interaction, such as tPA binding. To test these hypotheses, we have studied the binding of Cys-containing peptides to rAnxA2 by mass spectrometry. Fig. 7 shows the MALDI-TOF spectra of AnxA2 incubated, or not, with the hexapeptides LCKLSL (panel A) and L(hC)KLSL (panel B). Both peptides bound to rAnxA2, as reflected by the increase of molecular mass from 41,043 Da (free rAnxA2) to 41,619 Da (rAnxA2 incubated with LCKLSL) or 41,598 Da (rAnxA2 incubated with L(hC)KLSL). These increments in 576 and 555 Da, respectively, fit well with the molecular mass of the hexapeptides and suggest the formation of a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, incubation of rAnxA2 with the Cys-lacking hexapeptide LAKLSL had no effect on the mass spectrum (Fig. 7,panel C). These results indicate that peptide competition is mediated by direct disulfide bond formation with rAnxA2. This interaction is likely to be mediated by Cys8, although the participation of other Cys residues cannot be completely ruled out. To exclude the possibility that the peptides bound promiscuously to any Cys-containing protein, and more specifically to tPA, LCKLSL, L(hC)KLSL, and LAKLSL peptides were incubated with tPA, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The spectra of tPA were not significantly changed upon incubation with any of the peptides analyzed (data not shown). The dramatic increase in tPA catalytic activity resulting from its binding to cellular membranes provides an interesting target for the modulation of its biological functions related to the proteolytic degradation of fibrin as well as other substrates. We have recently shown that tPA is overexpressed in pancreas cancer cells and the blockade of tPA is associated with reduced in vitroinvasiveness and tumorigenicity (37Paciucci R. Tora M. Diaz V.M. Real F.X. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 625-633Google Scholar, 38Paciucci R. Berrozpe G. Tora M. Navarro E. Garcia D.H. Real F.X. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 72-76Google Scholar). Therefore, the tPA system constitutes an attractive target for the development of novel therapies. Because cell surface receptors allow focalization of the proteolytic activity at the cell membrane and may also participate in signal transduction, their identification is of major importance. AnxA2 has been shown to be a major tPA receptor in endothelial cells, among others, and preliminary data indicate that this protein is also overexpressed in pancreas cancers (36Vishwanatha J.K. Chiang Y. Kumble K.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Pour P.M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2575-2579Google Scholar, 37Paciucci R. Tora M. Diaz V.M. Real F.X. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 625-633Google Scholar).2 On the basis of these findings, it can be postulated that AnxA2 might play a role in stimulating tPA activity and plasmin generation at the membrane of cancer cells, potentially leading to increased tumorigenic properties. Nevertheless, our data do not exclude the possibility that some of the effects of tPA and it(s) receptor(s) take place independently"

To investigate functional interactions within Mediator, we have tested such fusions of the lexA DNA binding domain to Med1, Med2, Gal11, Srb7, and Srb10 in wild type,med1, med2, gal11,sin4, srb8, srb10, andsrb11 strains. We found that lexA-Med2 and lexA-Gal11 are strong activators that are independent of all Mediator subunits tested. lexA-Srb10 is a weak activator that depends on Srb8 and Srb11. lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7 are both cryptic activators that become active in the absence of Srb8, Srb10, Srb11, or Sin4. An unexpected finding was that lexA-VP16 differs from Gal4-VP16 in that it is independent of the activator binding Mediator module. Both lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7 are stably associated with Med4 and Med8, which suggests that they are incorporated into Mediator. Med4 and Med8 exist in two mobility forms that differ in their association with lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7. Within purified Mediator, Med4 is present as a phosphorylated lower mobility form.

RNA polymerase II RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 transcribes all protein-encoding genes and some small nuclear RNA genes in eukaryotes. The yeast pol II holoenzyme (1Kim Y.J. Björklund S., Li, Y.

Transcription can be reconstituted in vitro from highly purified pol II core enzyme and five general transcription factors, which are the TATA binding protein, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. These proteins are necessary and sufficient for basal transcriptionin vitro, but they are unable to respond to transcriptional activators (13Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Mediator was originally defined as an activity in yeast nuclear extracts that is required for such regulated transcription (14Flanagan P.M. Kelleher R.J.D. Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Kelleher R.J.D. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1990; 61: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In addition, Mediator enhances basal transcription, stimulates phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest pol II subunit by TFIIH, and binds to the C-terminal domain. The latter interaction is important for the integrity of the holoenzyme (1Kim Y.J. Björklund S., Li, Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). A partial truncation of the C-terminal domain causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype (16Nonet M.L. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is suppressed by mutations in the SRB genes. Several of the Srb proteins are present both in Mediator and in another complex that contains the pol II core enzyme and which also has been referred to as the pol II holoenzyme (17Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). It differs from the holoenzyme described above in that it also contains the Srb8–11 proteins, the SWI/SNF complex, some general transcription factors, and other yet unidentified proteins (18Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. van Vuuren H.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Wilson C.J. Chao D.M. Imbalzano A.N. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is likely that this reflects the different purification procedures used and that additional proteins found only in the second holoenzyme are more loosely associated with pol II in vivo. In any case, their absence from the first holoenzyme shows that they are not strictly required for regulated transcription in vitro. An attempt to further clarify the in vivo composition of the holopolymerase was recently made by Hahn and co-workers (20Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). They purified Mediator from yeast strains where Srb5, Srb6, or Rgr1 were epitope-tagged. This allows purification of the holopolymerase without the use of high ionic strength buffers and should, thus, better preserve its in vivo composition. Mediator was found to be present in two major forms of 1.9 and 0.55 MDa, respectively. The larger complex is identical to the holopolymerase described by Kornberg and coworkers (1Kim Y.J. Björklund S., Li, Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 14Flanagan P.M. Kelleher R.J.D. Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), except that it also contains the Srb8–11 module. The smaller complex is similar to free Mediator (9Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) in that it lacks the Srb8–11 module, but it also lacks Nut1, Gal11, Rgr1, Sin4, Med2, Pgd1, and Rox3. Notably, several of these proteins have been proposed to form a distinct activator binding tail module (21Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar), which may be more loosely associated with the rest of the holoenzyme. The Srb8–11 module, which contains the cyclin C-dependent kinase, has been implicated in negative control of gene expression. Thus, SRB8–11 appeared in several genetic screens for genes involved in repression (24Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because TUP1 andCYC8 also appeared in the same genetic screens, it has been suggested that Srb8–11 may be involved in transmitting repressive signals from the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor complex to pol II. However, other Mediator subunits such as Pgd1 and Srb7 (25Papamichos-Chronakis M. Conlan R.S. Gounalaki N. Copf T. Tzamarias D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8397-8403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Gromoller A. Lehming N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have also been proposed to be targets of Cyc8-Tup1. It should be emphasized that mutations in the Srb8–11 module have a complex phenotype that also includes reduced transcription of some highly expressed genes (6Li Y. Björklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J.

Fusions between general transcription factors and DNA binding domains can activate transcription from promoters that bind such fusion proteins. An activation-by-recruitment model, which suggests that physical recruitment of the basal RNA polymerase II machinery to a promoter may be sufficient to activate transcription, has therefore been proposed (27Farrell S. Simkovich N., Wu, Y. Barberis A. Ptashne M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2359-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol.

Srb2, Srb4, Srb5, and Srb6 can activate transcription as lexA fusions but depend on the promoter context for their ability to do so (30Gaudreau L. Keaveney M. Nevado J. Zaman Z. Bryant G.O. Struhl K. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2668-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A lexA-Srb11 fusion could activate transcription (32Kuchin S. Yeghiayan P. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4006-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas a lexA-Srb10 fusion required either overexpression of Srb11 or a mutation in the kinase active site (33Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Finally, we have found that lexA-Med1 is a cryptic activator that becomes active only in the absence of Srb11 or if it is overexpressed (10Balciunas D. Gälman C. Ronne H. Björklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we have used activation by recruitment as a tool to study functional interactions between different Mediator subunits. We find that the non-classical activators differ in their dependencies on other proteins. Thus, lexA-Med2 and lexA-Gal11 are strong activators that function in all mutants tested. lexA-Srb10 is a weak activator that is dependent on Srb11 and Srb8. lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7, finally, are cryptic activators that function only in the absence of either the Srb8–11 module or Sin4. The association of lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7 with Mediator was further investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. We found that both hybrid activators co-precipitate with Med4 and Med8, indicating that they are stably integrated into Mediator. Finally, we found that both Med4 and Med8 exist in two forms with different mobility. Only the low mobility form of Med4 associates with lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7. Both forms of Med8 associate with lexA-Srb7, whereas the low mobility form preferentially associates with lexA-Med1. All yeast strains used in this study (TableI) were W303 congenic (34Thomas B.J.

To create pDB326, the lexAHindIII-ApaI fragment of pDB198 was replaced by the HindIII-ApaI fragment of pGWwt (37Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J.

To create the lexA-Med2 fusion, the MED2 open reading frame from a baculovirus expression cassette (kindly provided by Claes Gustafsson) was cloned as anEcoRI-XhoI fragment intoEcoRI-XhoI-digested pEG202, thus producing pDB212. The whole lexA-Med2 expression cassette was then subcloned as an SphI fragment into pFL39 (38Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O., Li, G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F.

The lexA-Srb7, lexA-Srb10, and lexA-Gal11 fusion plasmids were all made by cloning BamHI-XhoI-digested PCR products intoBamHI-XhoI-digested pDB223.

To rule out PCR artifacts in the complementation experiments, at least four different PCR clones were tested for each fusion.

Yeast cells were grown to an A 600 of 1.2 in 100 ml of yeast nitrogen base containing 8% glucose and lacking uracil and tryptophan, harvested by centrifugation at 230 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed in water, and resuspended in 0.5 pellet volumes of 3× yeast lysis buffer (43Li Y. Björklund S. Kim Y.J. Kornberg R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 172-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by bead-beating at 4 °C (10 × 30 s) using 0.5-mm glass beads and a Mini-BeadbeaterTM (Biospec products, Bartlesville, OK). Whole cell extracts were isolated from the supernatant after centrifugation for 60 min at 21,000 × g and 4 °C. Total protein (40 μg) from the whole cell extracts of each strain was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for Med1, Med4, or Med8. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts corresponding to 1 mg of total protein were diluted to 500 μl in yeast lysis buffer and precleared with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Diagnostics) by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. One additional tube for each lysate containing 500 μl of yeast lysis buffer and 5 μl of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the DNA binding domain of lexA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-bound beads were then washed with 1 ml of yeast lysis buffer. The precleared lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 6000 × g, and the supernatants were added to the washed, antibody-bound beads. After a 2-h rotation at 4 °C, the tubes were centrifuged as above, and the beads were washed 3 times with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.8 m potassium acetate and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and once with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were dissolved in an equal volume of 2× SDS-loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots corresponding to 200 μg of total protein (before immunoprecipitation) were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against Med1, Med4, and Med8 have been previously described (9Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of purified holo-RNA polymerase II was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of calf intestine phosphatase (40 units). Holo-RNA polymerase II for dephosphorylation assays was purified from a yeast strain where the RGR1 gene encoding a Mediator subunit was fused to the tandem affinity purification tag (45Borggrefe T. Davis R. Bareket-Samish A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47150-47153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The purification was performed exactly as described previously (46Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described in Balciunas et al. (10Balciunas D. Gälman C. Ronne H. Björklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 8% synthetic glucose media with dropout selection for the appropriate markers in each case. We have previously shown that the Med1 protein becomes a cryptic activator when it is fused to the lexA DNA binding domain (10Balciunas D. Gälman C. Ronne H. Björklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test how general a phenomenon this is and to study functional interactions between different Mediator subunits, we have now made lexA fusions to Med2, Gal11, Srb7, and Srb10. As a first step in characterizing these new fusion proteins, we attempted to determine if they could complement deletions of the corresponding wild type genes. This is an important question because non-classical activators are thought to function by being incorporated into the holoenzyme in place of the wild type protein, thereby recruiting pol II to the target promoter. However, this has to the best of our knowledge never been proven experimentally. Complementation of a deletion mutation would provide strong evidence that a fusion protein can replace the wild type protein within the holoenzyme. We found that lexA-Med1, lexA-Med2, and lexA-Srb7 are all able to complement deletions of the corresponding genes (Fig. 1). In contrast, lexA-Gal11 and lexA-Srb10 failed to do so. It should be noted that whereas complementation provides evidence of functional replacement, lack of complementation does not necessarily mean that a fusion protein cannot be incorporated into the holoenzyme. It may also reflect steric hindrances that prevent the incorporated protein from functioning properly. We conclude that complementation supports the notion that lexA-Med1, lexA-Med2, and lexA-Srb7 are incorporated into the pol II holoenzyme, whereas the presence of lexA-Gal11 and lexA-Srb10 within the holoenzyme must be ascertained by other means. We proceeded to test the ability of lexA-Med1, lexA-Med2, lexA-Gal11, lexA-Srb7, and lexA-Srb10 to activate transcription both in wild type cells and in med1,med2, gal11, sin4, srb8,srb10, and srb11 deletion strains (TableII). We found that the lexA fusions fall into three distinct groups with respect to how they respond to mutations in other Mediator subunits. lexA-Med2 and lexA-Gal11 comprise the first group and behave similarly to the classical activator lexA-VP16, which we included as a control in these experiments. Thus, lexA-Med2 and lexA-Gal11 are strong activators comparable in strength to lexA-VP16 both in the wild type and in all mutant strains tested. One difference between the two activators is seen in thegal11 strain, where the activity of lexA-Gal11 is enhanced, whereas the activity of lexA-Med2 is unaffected. Conceivably, this could be due to increased incorporation of lexA-Gal11 into the Mediator in the absence of wild type Gal11 protein. In conclusion, our results show that both lexA-Med2 and lexA-Gal11 can function as activators in the absence of all other Mediator subunits tested. It should be noted that our finding that lexA-VP16 is independent of Med2, Gal11, and Sin4 was unexpected and is further discussed below.Table IITranscriptional activity of different lexA fusion proteins in wild type and mutant strainsPlasmidProteinWild typemed1srb8srb10srb11med2gal11sin4pDB185lexA-bicoid0.12 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.000.09 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.000.34 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.020.92 ± 0.05pDB198lexA-VP161238 ± 281505 ± 131821 ± 48792 ± 105513 ± 311394 ± 781912 ± 100921 ± 74pDB213lexA-Med21614 ± 283733 ± 361190 ± 871248 ± 263273 ± 1091160 ± 551562 ± 1802224 ± 69pDB247lexA-Gal11860 ± 722232 ± 151226 ± 221203 ± 821578 ± 67539 ± 801342 ± 691766 ± 84pDB181lexA-Med12.2 ± 0.32.3 ± 0.4123 ± 8140 ± 16170 ± 23.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.2113 ± 6pDB229lexA-Srb70.8 ± 0.118 ± 216 ± 317 ± 318 ± 11.7 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.446 ± 5pDB235lexA-Srb107.2 ± 0.710.0 ± 0.42.6 ± 0.15.5 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.16.9 ± 0.210.2 ± 1.18.6 ± 0.2pDB199lexA1–4-lacZ6.7 ± 0.426 ± 229 ± 128 ± 640 ± 230 ± 512 ± 360 ± 12Yeast strains W303–1A, H707, H844, H845, H713, DY1699, H965, and H905 (Table I) were transformed with the lexA-dependentlacZ reporter plasmid pSH18–34 and plasmids expressing different lexA fusion proteins.

The bottom row shows data obtained withlacZ itself expressed from the ADH1 promoter (as a fusion to the first four amino acids of lexA) instead of using a lexA-dependent reporter plasmid. The values shown are β-galactosidase units ± S.E. A second kind of result was obtained with the lexA-Srb10 fusion. We found that it is a weak activator in all strains except in thesrb11 mutant, where it is completely inactive, and in thesrb8 mutant, where its activity is reduced (Table II). These findings suggest that the integrity of the Srb8–11 module is important for the ability of lexA-Srb10 to recruit the holopolymerase. This may reflect the fact that cyclin-dependent kinases such as Srb10 usually depend on their cyclins (in this case Srb11) both for activity and for interaction with the correct target protein (47Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 48Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ability of Srb10 to activate by recruitment would suggest that it has at least one target within the pol II holoenzyme. The rather low level of activity for lexA-Srb10 compared with other fusions may result from a more loose association between the Srb8–11 module and Mediator. Alternatively, the inherent repressing activity of the Srb8–11 module interferes with the ability of lexA-Srb10 to activate transcription. A third type of result was obtained with lexA-Med1 and lexA-Srb7. We have previously shown that lexA-Med1 is a cryptic activator that has little or no activity in wild type cells but becomes active in srb11 cells (10Balciunas D. Gälman C. Ronne H. Björklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we show that deletions of SRB8, SRB10, orSIN4 have a similar effect (Table II). In contrast, deletions of MED1, GAL11, or MED2 have no effect on lexA-Med1, which remains inactive in these strains. We conclude that the cryptic activity of lexA-Med1 can be unmasked in at least three ways, by mutations in the cyclin C-dependent protein kinase complex (Srb8–11), by mutations in Sin4, and by overexpression of lexA-Med1 itself (10Balciunas D. Gälman C. Ronne H. Björklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggests a possible functional link between the cyclin C-dependent protein kinase and Sin4. Surprisingly, we found that lexA-Srb7 also is a cryptic activator that behaves similarly to lexA-Med1. Thus, it has no activity in the wild type, whereas deletions of SRB8, SRB10,SRB11, and SIN4 all cause it to become active (Table II). However, lexA-Srb7 differs from lexA-Med1 in th"

The mutation had no effect on transcription initiation site fidelity by either RNA polymerase II (pol II) or pol III. Moreover, the mutation did not cause differences in levels of U6 RNA, a pol III-dependent component of the splicing machinery, in mRNA splicing efficiency, in expression of housekeeping genes from either TATA-containing or TATA-less promoters, or in global gene expression. Our results indicated that general eukaryotic cell functions are unaffected by deletion of these vertebrate-specific sequences from TBP.

Gene expression is a fundamental property of all living systems. Archae bacteria use only a single RNA pol 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; RT, reverse transcriptase; SAGE, serial analysis of gene expression; EST, expressed sequence tag; g.d., gestational day; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TRF, TBP-related factor to transcribe mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA. Eukaryotes evolved three separate RNA pols with different specialties to perform these functions. TBP acts in promoter recognition for transcription initiation by the Archaea RNA pol as well as by all three eukaryotic RNA pols (1Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3025-3031Google Scholar, 2Takada S. Lis J.T. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 2000; 101: 459-469Google Scholar, 3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). In accordance with having such an important and conserved function, the 180-amino acid TBPcore from Archaea and from all eukaryotes share both a high degree of amino acid similarity and very similar crystal structures (3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar, 4Littlefield O. Korkhin Y. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13668-13673Google Scholar, 5Thomm M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 159-171Google Scholar). The differences in complexity observed between Archaea and eukaryotes, or between single-celled and higher eukaryotes, are coincident with differences both in genomic complexity and in the complexity of the gene expression machinery. Similarly, although the general role of TBP in transcription initiation has been conserved, this function has become more complex. In Archaea TBP appears to work as a single-subunit entity (6Qureshi S.A. Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2927-2936Google Scholar); in eukaryotes TBP is at the core of obligate large multiprotein complexes (3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). The complex SL1 functions in initiation by RNA pol I, TFIID is required for production of mRNA by RNA pol II, TFIIIB is used during transcription of tRNAs and some other small RNAs by RNA pol III. In mammals, TBP also interacts with SNAPc to direct production of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) by either pol II or pol III (3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). Attached to the TBPcore, vertebrate species share a large N-terminal domain that differs from TBP domains in all other phyla (3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar,7Hashimoto S.

Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Google Scholar). Kinetic studies indicate that the N-terminal domain influences TATA-binding and DNA-bending by TBP (15Zhao X. Herr W. Cell. 2002; 108: 615-627Google Scholar). Another study suggests that the N terminus plays a role in determining rates of cell proliferation (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar). Because these fundamental cellular functions are common to most eukaryotes, including non-vertebrate metazoans, they evolved long before the vertebrate TBP N terminus. 2A. A. Bondareva and E. E. Schmidt, submitted for publication. Therefore, we hypothesized that this domain must have, in addition to any general functions, a vertebrate-specific role. To test this, we created a line of mice in which the wild type tbp allele was replaced with a version, entitled tbpΔN, in which 111 of the 135 vertebrate-specific N-terminal amino acids were deleted (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). At gestational day (g.d.) 9.5,tbp ΔN/ΔN fetuses are generally normal (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). Over 90% of these mutant fetuses die between g.d. 10.5 and 12.5; loss results from a failure of their placenta to evade a maternal immune rejection response (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). Importantly, although less than 3% of the tbp ΔN/ΔN animals survive to weaning, these survivors are healthy and fertile (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). Even though the defects in homozygous mutant mice are manifested as a highly specific and restricted phenotype, it is untested whether the mutation actually compromises general cell functions in a sublethal manner. For example, one might hypothesize that all cells bearing this mutation would be physiologically compromised; however, only in the placenta are such defects critical to the function of the organ and the survival of the organism. To test this possibility, we analyzed fundamental properties of cells bearing this mutation. We show thattbp ΔN/+ andtbp ΔN/ΔN primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are normal in all measured general functions. Our data indicate that, if the TBP N terminus truly participates in any fundamental functions in vivo, these processes must be functionally redundant. The targeting and mouse production strategy for producing the TBP-ΔN mice has been reported elsewhere (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). The selectable neo cassette used for gene targeting was removed from the line by Cre/loxP, and for all samples in this article, the mutation had been back-crossed onto a C57Bl/6 background for ≥5 generations (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). For establishing primary fibroblast cell lines, whole uteri were harvested from females with timed pregnancies and were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol. Deciduae were opened and embryonic surface tissue was harvested and dissociated with trypsin. Explanted cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% newborn calf serum + 1× penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (BioWhittaker). Cultures were trypsinized and passed to fresh dishes when confluent, after 5–14 days. By this time under these conditions, fibroblasts had outgrown other surviving cell types to the point that only cells with fibroblastic morphology could be readily found under the microscope. These cultures were split in experiments. RNA harvests and RNase protection and primer extension assays were preformed as described previously (18Schmidt E.E. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21247-21256Google Scholar, 19Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 467-483Google Scholar). Probes for DHFR (18Schmidt E.E. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21247-21256Google Scholar), TFIIB, L7, GAPDH, Oct-1, and NF-Yb (19Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 467-483Google Scholar) have been described previously. For TBP-related factor-2 (TRF-2), a probe hybridizing to sequences between positions 705 and 833 of the mouse TRF-2 cDNA (20Ohbayashi T. Kishimoto T. Makino Y. Shimada M. Nakadai T. Aoki T. Kawata T. Niwa S. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 137-142Google Scholar) was transcribed from a clone that we isolated by RT-PCR on mouse testis RNA. 3E. E. Schmidt, unpublished data. A probe that hybridized to mouse U6 RNA sequences extending from the transcription initiation site to a position 92 bases downstream of the initiation site (21Das G. Henning D. Wright D. Reddy R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 503-512Google Scholar) was transcribed from a genomic clone that we isolated by PCR of mouse genomic DNA.3 For β-actin, mouse genomic sequence was not available. A mouse genomic fragment,3 extending from a position in exon 2 corresponding to base 89 of the mouse cDNA (22Tokunaga K. Taniguchi H. Yoda K. Shimizu M. Sakiyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2829Google Scholar) to a position 51 base pairs into intron 2, was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using one primer designed from mouse exon 2, and a second primer designed from the genomic sequence of rat intron 2 (23Nudel U. Katcoff D. Zakut R. Shani M. Carmon Y. Finer M. Czosnek H. Ginsburg I. Yaffe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2763-2767Google Scholar), and this fragment was cloned into a plasmid vector. The β-actin probe hybridizes to 146 bases of the mouse pre-mRNA and 95 bases of the mouse mRNA (Fig. 3 B). For TBP, a probe that was complementary to sequences extending from the BglII site in exon 2 (position 37 of the original published cDNA sequence) to position 168 in exon 3 (24Tamura T. Sumita K. Fujino I. Aoyama A. Horikoshi M. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Muramatsu M. Mikoshiba K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3861-3865Google Scholar) was transcribed from a subclone of the mouse TBP cDNA. This probe hybridized to 131 bases of wild-type TBP mRNA, and 81 bases of TBP-ΔN mRNA (Fig. 1 B). For primer extensions, the following primers were used: U6 primer, 5′-ATC GAA TTC ACG AAT TTG CTG GTC ATC C-3′; β-actin primer, 5′-TGG GGT ACT TCA GGG TCA GGA TAC-3′.Figure 1Primary structure and expression of TBP and TBP -ΔN in MEFs. A, alignment of wild-type TBP and TBP-ΔN, showing the universal C terminus (black box) and the vertebrate-specific N terminus (white box). The mutant version retains amino acids 1–24 and 136–316 of the wild-type allele, and contains two copies of the 9-amino acid FLAG (Kodak) epitope tag (gray box labeledE) (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). B, expression of TBP mRNA in MEFs. Total RNA (10 μg) from two cultures each oftbp +/+,tbp ΔN/+, andtbp ΔN/ΔN MEFs was analyzed by RNase protection using a probe that differentiates between wild-type and mutant TBP mRNA. All samples were supplemented to contain a total of 50 μg of RNA with yeast RNA. MEF genotypes are indicated attop. At right is indicated the positions of undigested probe and of the protected fragments for wild-type (TBP+) and mutant (TBPΔN) mRNA. Abbreviations: M, molecular size markers; P, 1:100 dilution of undigested probe; C, control containing probe hybridized to 50 μg of yeast RNA. C, Western blot of TBP and TBP-ΔN protein expression in MEFs. Whole cells of the indicated genotypes were harvested by scraping in 1% SDS, and lysates were sonicated and boiled. Nucleic acid content was estimated by reading the A 260 on each lysate, and 20 μg of nucleic acid equivalents was boiled with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer for each determination (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with commercial antibody against the C-terminal domain of human TBP (BD PharMingen), which shows 100% amino acid identity with this region of mouse TBP and was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For RT-PCR reactions, 2.5 μg of CsCl-purified DNA-free RNA (19Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 467-483Google Scholar) was used as template for oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcriptase reactions as described previously (25Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 138-149Google Scholar). PCR with primers spanning from exon 2 to exon 3 of the mouse β-actin gene confirmed that all cDNAs had uniform levels of β-actin cDNA and lacked detectable genomic DNA (data not shown). PCR was performed using 0.2% of each RT reaction per PCR reaction, as described in the figure legends, using mouse cdc25B-specific primers having the following sequences: 5′ primer, 5′-ATT CCA GCT CTG CCC AAG CTT TGG C-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TCC ACA AAT CCG TCA TCT TCT TCA-3′. The PCR product spans from positions 626 to 821 of the mouse cdc25B mRNA (GenBankTM XM_123867; translation initiation is at position 607), which contains a centrally located splice junction for a 621-base pair intron at position 712 (GenBankTM NW_000178). Thus, genomic DNA gives a 816-base pair band that is clearly discernable from the 195-base pair cDNA signal (data not shown). SAGE libraries were prepared as described previously (26Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1995; 270: 484-487Google Scholar). Clones of individual plasmids containing SAGE tag concatenates were screened by PCR and clones containing inserts of >500 bp (roughly 30 SAGE tags) were arbitrarily chosen for sequence analysis. Data were ordered by SAGE2000 software (www.sagenet.org). Data in the article represent all tags that appeared ≥10 times in the combined libraries and represent all 46 genes present at an average of ≥1.5 parts per thousand. Summation of tag frequencies indicated that 77% of all tags sequenced were represented by these 46. The identities of mRNAs represented by individual tags was determined using the tag-to-gene mapper program on the NCBI SAGEmap homepage (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/SAGEtag.cgi). The tbpΔN allele retains all known transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory signals of the wild-type tbp allele (25Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 138-149Google Scholar, 27Schmidt E.E. Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T. Schibler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5326-5334Google Scholar, 28Ohbayashi T. Schmidt E.E. Makino Y. Kishimoto T. Nabeshima Y. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 275-280Google Scholar), but it produces a version of TBP protein lacking 111 of 135 vertebrate-specific N-terminal amino acids (Fig.1 A, described in Ref. 11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). Retention of the first 24 amino acids was predicted to preserve thein vivo stability of the mutant protein (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar, 29Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Google Scholar). Thus, the allele is identical to the native tbp allele except that it encodes an epitope tag in place of amino acids 25–135 of the protein, and it contains a loxP-containing oligonucleotide insertion roughly 2.5-kb upstream of the gene (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular consequences of removing the N terminus of TBP on basal cellular functions, we produced primary MEFs from g.d. 8.5–11.5 embryos. RNase protection assays using a probe that spanned the site of the ΔN mutation were used to compare levels of wild-type and mutant TBP mRNA accumulation intbp +/+,tbp ΔN/+, andtbp ΔN/DN MEFs. Results showed that homozygous wild-type and homozygous mutant cells had similar levels of TBP or TBP-ΔN mRNA, respectively, and, in heterozygous cells, mRNA from each allele was equally represented (Fig. 1 B). Western blots using either whole cell (Fig. 1 C) or nuclear (data not shown) extracts indicated that MEFs of all three genotypes contained similar levels of total and nuclear TBP and TBP-ΔN protein; heterozygous MEFs exhibited similar amounts of both TBP and TBP-ΔN protein. Based on mRNA level, protein level, and subcellular distribution, TBP and TBP-ΔN proteins had no significant differences in synthesis/turnover rates or nuclear localization. Previously, a mammalian tbp-gene family member, namedTBP-like protein (TLP) (30Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 750-755Google Scholar) or TRF-2 (31Rabenstein M.D. Zhou S. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4791-4796Google Scholar, 32Teichmann M. Wang Z. Martinez E. Tjernberg A. Zhang D. Vollmer F. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13720-13725Google Scholar) was identified. The TRF-2core is far less closely related to the homologous region of mouse TBP (39% amino acid identity) than mouse TBPcore is to yeast TBPcore (81% identity; Fig.2, Ref. 30Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 750-755Google Scholar). Different annotations of the human genome suggest that this may be the only other tbpfamily member in mammals (33Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Google Scholar) or that there may be one other more distantly related protein in the genome (34Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Google Scholar). We measured TRF-2 mRNA levels in adult mouse tissues and in MEFs of all three genotypes. Results showed that TRF-2 mRNA is expressed in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 2). TRF-2 was also expressed in all wild-type somatic mouse tissues examined at levels about 4-fold higher than those of TBP mRNA in each tissue and, consistent with previously published reports (32Teichmann M. Wang Z. Martinez E. Tjernberg A. Zhang D. Vollmer F. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13720-13725Google Scholar), TRF-2 mRNA was particularly enriched in testis. TRF-2 mRNA levels were unaffected by the TBP-ΔN mutation in both the MEFs and in adult tissues (Fig. 2). Because TRF-2 contains only a short N-terminal region fused to the core (30Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 750-755Google Scholar), we consider it highly unlikely that TRF-2 compensated for deletion of the N-terminal region of TBP in tbp ΔN/ΔN fibroblasts or mice. Because we have shown that tbp ΔN/ΔNmutant animals occasionally survive to become healthy fertile adults (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar), it is unlikely that large global defects result from the mutation. However, previous studies had implicated this domain in basal processes (see the Introduction). These studies led us to ponder whether, rather than only functioning in a particular situation (pregnancy), the N terminus functioned ubiquitously, but defects resulting from its deletion were sublethal in most cell types. Therefore, we tested whether defects in basal functions could be detected in cells bearing the TBP-ΔN mutation. We first asked whether we could measure defects in SNAPc-dependent processes. In mammals, SNAPc is involved in transcription initiation on genes encoding snRNAs by pol III from TATA-containing promoters, and by pol II from TATA-less promoters (3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). A classic example is its role in transcription of the human U2 gene by RNA pol II, and the U6 gene by pol III (35Reddy R. Henning D. Das G. Harless M. Wright D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 75-81Google Scholar). RNase protection assays showed that U6 RNA levels in MEFs of the three genotypes were indistinguishable (Fig. 3 A). Splicing requires an elaborate ribonucleoprotein system that, in addition to U6 and U2, requires other snRNAs (36Sharp P.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1988; 260: 3035-3041Google Scholar, 37Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Google Scholar, 38Reed R. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Google Scholar, 39Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Google Scholar). As a potentially more global assay for whether any defects in snRNA expression resulted from the TBP-ΔN mutation, we examined the splicing efficiency of pre-mRNA encoding β-actin by RNase protection (Fig.3 B). Levels of correctly spliced cytoplasmic mRNA (95-base band) were unaffected by the mutation, and there was no evidence for increased nuclear accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA (146-base band in lanes designated Nu). This indicated that splicing efficiency was similar between MEFs of the three genotypes. We concluded that deletion of TBP amino acids 25–135 was inconsequential for U6 RNA expression and mRNA splicing in the MEFs. Previous studies have shown that the first 55 amino acids of human TBP are sufficient for SNAPc functions in vitro, including U6 transcription (40Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7031-7042Google Scholar). These data, in combination with our results, might suggest that SNAPc-dependent functions of the TBP N terminus reside entirely in the first 24 amino acids of the protein. Alternatively, it is possible that other compensatory interactions at the snRNA promoters stabilize SNAPc interactions in cells lacking the TBP N terminus (see “Discussion”). In one study, chicken DT40 cells that were heterozygous-null for TBP were shown to have lower proliferation rates than did the wild-type progenitor cell line, which correlates to reduced levels of mRNA and protein encoding cdc25B (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar). Upon stably transfecting these cells with vectors that express wild-type TBP, proliferation rates match the progenitor cells. However, clones transfected with vectors that express a mutant version of TBP lacking all except the first 24 amino acids of the N terminus exhibit an intermediate proliferation rate (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar). These results suggest that the N terminus is required for full proliferative potential of the cells. Importantly, all of the cells in the study by Um et al. (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar) contained one intact copy of the endogenous tbp gene including the entire N-terminal region, and thus, the anti-proliferative effect was manifested as a haploid-insufficiency. We established MEF cultures from 139 embryos of heterozygous crosses, but we were unable to detect any significant correlation between genotypes and proliferation rates by either growth curves or thymidine labeling (data not shown). Even in comparing homozygous mutant cells, where both copies of tbp lacked the N terminus, and homozygous wild-type cells, proliferation rates were indistinguishable. As a potentially more sensitive molecular assay of proliferation, levels of the mRNA encoding DHFR, which is transcribed only during S-phase of the cell cycle (18Schmidt E.E. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21247-21256Google Scholar, 41Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1598-1608Google Scholar, 42Farnham P.J. Schimke R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 365-371Google Scholar), were measured. MEFs of all three genotypes exhibited similar levels of DHFR mRNA (Fig.4 A). Previous studies have shown that cdc25B mRNA is expressed only during G2 phase of the cell cycle (43Hernandez S. Hernandez L. Bea S. Cazorla M. Fernandez P.L. Nadal A. Muntane J. Mallofre C. Montserrat E. Cardesa A. Campo E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1762-1767Google Scholar, 44Korner K. Jerome V. Schmidt T. Muller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9662-9669Google Scholar) and that expression of this mRNA may be particularly sensitive to mutations in the tbp gene (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar). Therefore, as another molecular marker of proliferation rates, we compared relative cdc25B mRNA levels intbp +/+,tbp ΔN/+, andtbp ΔN/ΔN MEFs, as well as in g.d. 10.5 fetuses and placentas of all three genotypes. Results showed that cdc25B mRNA levels were similar between MEFs of all three genotypes, between fetuses of all three genotypes, and between placentas of all three genotypes (Fig. 4 B). The genotype-independent reduced level of cdc25B mRNA in placentas as compared with those in MEFs and fetuses likely represents a lower overall rate of proliferation in this organ. These data suggest that the TBP N terminus does not play a significant role, either as a dominant (i.e. haploid-insufficient) or recessive trait, in determining proliferation rates in MEFs. Because our study examines a targeted mutation in a fundamental component of the basal transcription machinery in vivo, we examined whether the mutation had measurable effects on initiation site fidelity or RNA accumulation. Transcription initiation site fidelity was assessed by primer extension assays on MEFs of all three genotypes. Results indicated that our mutation had no quantitative or qualitative effects on initiation site fidelity of RNAs transcribed by either pol II (β-actin mRNA) or by pol III (U6 RNA)(Fig.5). Although TBP, TRF-2, U6, β-actin, DHFR, and cdc25B mRNA levels were unaffected by the ΔN mutation (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), we wished to determine whether there were effects on a broader range of mRNAs. Two additional highly abundant housekeeping mRNAs from genes with TATA-containing promoters, encoding ribosomal protein L7 and GAPDH, and three low abundance housekeeping mRNAs from TATA-less promoters, encoding TFIIB, Oct-1, and NF-Yb, were chosen for individual analysis (45Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Google Scholar, 46Suzuki N. Peter W. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P. Scholer H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 245-252Google Scholar, 47Tsuboi A. Conger K. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Arai N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3250Google Scholar). Expression of all of these mRNAs were unaffected by the TBP mutation (Fig. 6 A). As an unbiased representation of global gene expression, we used SAGE to estimate the relative abundance of all mRNAs in a sample based on the frequency that unique 3′-end sequence tags are present in a cDNA library made from that mRNA sample (26Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1995; 270: 484-487Google Scholar). SAGE libraries were created from +/+ and ΔN/ΔN MEFs and we sequenced 6890 tags, giving resolution of all mRNAs present at ≥1.5 parts per thousand in each sample (77% of all of the mRNA in the cells; Fig.6 B). The SAGE data were externally corroborated because two of the tags, nos. 21 and 22, represented mRNAs that we had independently assayed by quantitative RNase protection and primer extension assays (β-actin, Fig. 3 B, and GAPDH, Fig.6 A, respectively). None of the abundant tags showed a strong effect of the mutation (≥10-fold difference between cell types,dark shaded zones in Fig. 6 B) and only three differed by 3-fold or more (light shaded zones). These three mRNAs may have been differentially regulated as a direct consequence of our mutation; however, they may also have simply represented stochastic differences between the cell lines that were independent of the TBP mutation. Further study will be required to distinguish these possibilities. Importantly, the data indicated that overall gene expression was not different in the two cell lines. We conclude that the TBP-ΔN mutation does not affect basal gene expression, and we infer that any gene expression defects arising from this mutation must be highly cell type- and/or gene-specific. TBP is required by all eukaryotes for gene expression as well as for production of ribosomal RNAs and small RNAs. Consistent with this, the core of this protein is one of the most highly conserved proteins known. However, outside of this core, on the N-terminal side of the protein, different phylogenetic lineages exhibit vastly different embellishments (3Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). To test the function of the vertebrate-specific TBP N terminus, we developed a line of mice in which these sequences had been largely deleted (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). In this article, we show that this mutation had no measurable effects on basal functions in cultured primary fibroblasts. Previous biochemical and cellular studies on the function of the vertebrate-specific TBP N terminus have shown that this polypeptide domain has strong effects on DNA binding by TBP (15Zhao X. Herr W. Cell. 2002; 108: 615-627Google Scholar), on how TBP interacts with SNAPc and with certain transcription factors (13Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Google Scholar), and on the function of TBP in transcribing genes encoding RNA components of the splicing machinery (14Mittal V. Hernandez N.

In addition, one study has shown that the TBP N terminus can affect rates of cell proliferation (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar). By contrast, we show that MEFs lacking most of the TBP N terminus show no general defects in transcription, splicing, gene expression, or proliferation. Results presented here, indicating that removing most of the TBP N terminus has no basal physiological effects on fibroblasts, are corroborated by the observation that, even though few tbp ΔN/ΔN mice survive to weaning, survivors are healthy and fertile (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). Moreover, physiological processes that depend on proliferation are unaffected in survivors. For example, homozygous mutant fetuses grow and develop at normal rates in immune-compromised mothers (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar), and homozygous mutant adults are normal size, they exhibit normal peripheral blood leukocyte counts, normal hair growth, and normal male fertility even after over a year of continuous mating (data not shown). What might be the reasons that our in vivo results on TBP-ΔN mutant mice do not show defects in any of the processes in which this domain has been implicated by in vitro studies? One interesting property of living systems is that they are robust. In other words, they generally tolerate or rebound from perturbations of the system. Genetic studies and modeling experiments indicate that robustness can be accomplished by having parallel pathways that can independently accomplish the same task (51von Dassow G. Meir E. Munro E.M. Odell G.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 188-192Google Scholar, 52Meir E. von Dassow G. Munro E. Odell G.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 778-786Google Scholar). Conversely, fragments of biological systems, such as purified in vitro reactions, are generally optimized for a single reaction, and are relatively intolerant of perturbations. One might consider the possibility that the N terminus of TBP functions in a robust system. As examples, transcription factor Oct-1 may stabilize SNAPc on snRNA promoters (50Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Google Scholar) in the absence of the TBP N terminus, and the ability of the N terminus to affect DNA binding by the TBPcore (15Zhao X. Herr W. Cell. 2002; 108: 615-627Google Scholar) may be partially redundant with activities of other proteins assembling at promoters. Elimination of the N terminus may be compensated for by the other back-up proteins. One might envisage a model where the transcriptional assembly at a promoter forms a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle that does not necessarily fall apart or lose activity as a result of removing this single piece. By such a model, cells lacking the TBP N terminus may be physiologically normal, but might also be more prone to failure in the event that the back-up system fails. The previous study showing a role for the TBP N terminus in cell proliferation (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar) is harder to reconcile with our data because that study, like ours, was performed in living cells. Differences in experimental design are likely responsible for the different results. For example, whereas both studies required several generations ofin vitro culture to generate a line of cells bearing the respective targeted mutations, cells in our study were rejuvenated by turning them into viable mice, breeding the mutant animals, and then harvesting our experimental cells as primary cultures from the resultant fetuses. Moreover, all modified tbp alleles in our study were within the normal tbp locus, and none of our cells contained selectable marker genes or vector sequences that might have affected mutant cells (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). Conversely, event though thetbp-null allele in the study by Um et al. (16Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Google Scholar) was targeted into the tbp locus, it retained an expressed hygromycin resistance gene, and the rescuing expression cassettes were random insertions that brought with them vector sequences, including an expressed puromycin resistance gene. Our data strongly suggest that the N terminus of TBP can be deleted without measurably altering cell proliferation. Vertebrate and non-vertebrate metazoans universally share the basal properties that have been attributed to the vertebrate TBP N terminus in previous studies (see above). Thus, if this domain indeed participates in such fundamental processes in vivo, they are likely accomplished equally well by the N termini of nematodes, dipterans, lepidopterans, and echinoderms, even though the N terminus in each group shows neither similarity to the vertebrate N terminus nor to each other (NCBI/GenBankTM). The natural diversity in TBP N-terminal sequences between metazoan clades suggests that, in terms of accomplishing these general functions, this domain should exhibit large amino acid sequence plasticity. Conversely, we have found that natural selection has been particularly intolerant of mutations that would modify the amino acid sequence of TBP N terminus in vertebrates.2 Thus, we suspected that, whether or not this domain participates in any fundamental cellular functions, the vertebrate TBP N terminus must have a truly vertebrate-specific activity, and it is this function that has been so highly conserved by natural selection in vertebrates. In designing the TBP-ΔN mutation, we hypothesized that this function would be involved in a specific gene regulation process. Consistent with this, we have found that mice homozygous for this mutation suffer from a highly specific defect that compromises a β2-microglobulin-dependent component of the interaction between the placenta of the developing fetus and the mother's immune system (11Hobbs N.K. Bondareva A.A. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Schmidt E.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 43-54Google Scholar). In conclusion, we report that removing the TBP N terminus is inconsequential for general physiological properties of mouse fibroblasts. As such, it is unlikely that this mutation, alone, compromises any vital basal cellular functions in vivo, leading us to dismiss the possibility that the mutation results in sublethally sick cells. Rather, we posit that all activities of this polypeptide domain likely fall within two classes. Thus, all TBP N terminus-dependent functions must be either functionally redundant components of robust systems or they will be functionally restricted activities that are not manifested in primary embryonic fibroblast cultures.

https://openalex.org/W2068035339,"The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/MAPK pathway plays an important role in early Xenopus developmental processes, including mesoderm patterning. The activation of the MAPK pathway leads to induction of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra), which regulates the transcription of downstream mesoderm-specific genes in mesoderm patterning. However, the link between the FGF/MAPK pathway and the induction of Xbra has not been fully understood. Here we present evidence suggesting that Ets-2 is involved in the induction of Xbra and thus in the development of posterior mesoderm during early embryonic development. Overexpression of Ets-2 caused posteriorized embryos and led to the induction of mesoderm in ectodermal explants. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Ets-2 or injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against Ets-2 inhibited the formation of the trunk and tail structures. Overexpression of Ets-2 resulted in the induction of Xbra, and expression of the dominant-negative Ets-2 inhibited FGF- or constitutively active MEK-induced Xbra expression. Moreover, overexpression of Ets-2 up-regulated the transcription from Xbra promoter reporter gene constructs. Ets-2 bound to the Xbra promoter region in vitro.

One of the genes that are thought to be regulated directly by FGF via the MAPK signal transduction pathway is XenopusBrachyury (Xbra).

However, the link between the FGF/MAPK pathway and the induction of Xbra expression has not been fully defined.The ETS family of transcription factors, comprising more than 30 different members, has been found to play a crucial role in controlling transcription of a variety of genes involved in important cellular processes, such as proliferation and differentiation (19Yordy J.S. Muise-Helmericks R.C. Oncogene. 2000; 55: 6503-6513Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 827-837Crossref Scopus (810) Google Scholar). They share a unique DNA binding domain, the ETS domain, which interacts specifically with GGA(A/T)-based recognition sites (18Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). As targets of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, Ets transcription factors are phosphorylated by MAPK and function as critical nuclear integrators of ubiquitous signaling cascades. The ETS family is divided into subfamilies by sequence similarity based on the ETS domain or additional sequence motifs. Ets-2 is a member of the ETS subfamily, which consists of three members: Ets-1, Ets-2, andDrosophila Pointed (21Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Studies with mammalian cultured cells have shown that Ets-2 is activated by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 72 in an N-terminal regulatory domain (the Pointed domain) (21Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 23McCarthy S.A. Chen D.

Xenopus Ets-2 is maternally expressed in both the animal pole and the intermediate zone (24Wolff C.M. Stiegler P. Baltzinger M. Meyer D. Ghysdael J. Stehelin D. Befort N. Remy P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 9: 447-456Google Scholar, 25Meyer D. Durliat M. Senan F. Wolff M. Andre M. Hourdry J. Remy P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 607-620PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that Ets-2 relays the FGF/MAPK signaling and induces mesoderm by inducing Xbra gene transcription. In this study, we have presented several lines of evidence indicating that Ets-2 plays an essential role in mesodermal patterning, lying between the FGF/MAPK pathway and the Xbra transcription.DISCUSSIONIt is known that FGFs can induce mesoderm via the Ras/MAPK pathway in early Xenopus development (3Whitman M. Melton D.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that members of at least six subfamilies of ETS proteins (ETS, YAN, ELG, PEA3, ERF, TCF) are nuclear targets of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Elk-1 is a member of the ternary complex factor subfamily, and it is well known that phosphorylation of Elk-1 by MAPK enhances activities of Elk-1. However, the FGF-induced Xbra expression was not reduced by overexpression of dominant-negative Elk-1 in animal cap assay (38Panitz F. Krain B. Hollemann T. Nordheim A. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4414-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The other member of ETS family, ER81, which belongs to the PEA3 subfamily, was identified in Xenopus. Although XER81 has been reported to be a target of FGF signaling, XER81 alone did not induce Xbra expression in animal cap explants (39Chen Y. Hollemann T. Grunz H. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of XER81 did not change the expression pattern of Xbra transcript (40Münchberg S.R. Steinbeisser H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results here have demonstrated that Ets-2 induces Xbra expression and plays an essential role in mesoderm patterning downstream of the FGF/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Ets-2 caused posteriorized embryos. Similar phenotypes were reported to be induced by expressing Xcad3 that is required for posterior development downstream of FGF signaling (41Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3413-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both Ets-2 and Xcad3 appear to posteriorize anterior neural tissue. How Ets-2 cooperates with Xcad3 and the Hox gene pathway in posterior development remains to be studied (42Pownall M.E. Tucker A.S. Slack J.M. Isaacs H.V. Development. 1996; 122: 3881-3892PubMed Google Scholar).In Xenopus mesoderm patterning, no transcription factor that would relay the FGF signal at the Xbra promoter has been identified (43Tada M. O'Reilly M.A. Smith J.C. Development. 1997; 124: 2225-2234PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Ets-2 regulates the transcription of Xbra downstream of the FGF/MAPK pathway. Mullick et al. (44Mullick J. Anandatheerhavarada H.K. Amuthan G. Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Camasamudram V. Bhat N.K. Reddy S.E.P. Rao V. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18007-18017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have recently shown that Ets-2 protein binds to a “weak” Ets-like site of the cytochrome P-450c27 promoter. They provide new insights on the role of putative weak consensus Ets sites in transcription activation, possibly through synergistic interaction with other gene-specific transcription activators (44Mullick J. Anandatheerhavarada H.K. Amuthan G. Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Camasamudram V. Bhat N.K. Reddy S.E.P. Rao V. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18007-18017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the putative weak Ets consensus sites are widely distributed on the Xbra promoter, it is possible that interactions with several Ets-like sites synergistically regulate Xbra transcription. Furthermore, other transcription factors, such as AP-1, potentially participate in transcriptional regulation of Xbra (45Kim J. Lin J.J. Xu R.H. Kung H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1542-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is likely that other transcription factors in coordination with Ets-2 regulate Xbra transcription. Elucidation of the precise relationship of Ets-2 with other transcription factors will be a necessary step toward understanding the regulation of Xbra.Our results reported here strongly suggest that Ets-2 plays an essential role in mesoderm patterning. Previously, HpEts has been identified as a sea urchin homologue of Ets-2. Overexpression of HpEts in sea urchin embryos caused primary mesenchyme cells to extinguish cellular adhesion and to migrate (46Kurokawa D. Kitajima T. Mitsunaga-Nakatsubo K. Amemiya S. Shimada H. Akasaka K. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 47Kurokawa D. Kitajima T. Mitsunaga-Nakatsubo K. Amemiya S. Shimada H. Akasaka K. Zygote. 2000; 8: S33-S34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus, it is likely that Ets-2 is also involved in cellular adhesion and migratory cell guidance. We are currently investigating other roles of Ets-2 in Xenopus developmental processes.

Ets-2 is a member of the ETS subfamily, which consists of three members: Ets-1, Ets-2, andDrosophila Pointed (21Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Studies with mammalian cultured cells have shown that Ets-2 is activated by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 72 in an N-terminal regulatory domain (the Pointed domain) (21Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 23McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Garcia Ramirez J.J. Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Xenopus Ets-2 is maternally expressed in both the animal pole and the intermediate zone (24Wolff C.M. Stiegler P. Baltzinger M. Meyer D. Ghysdael J. Stehelin D. Befort N. Remy P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 9: 447-456Google Scholar, 25Meyer D. Durliat M. Senan F. Wolff M. Andre M. Hourdry J. Remy P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 607-620PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that Ets-2 relays the FGF/MAPK signaling and induces mesoderm by inducing Xbra gene transcription. In this study, we have presented several lines of evidence indicating that Ets-2 plays an essential role in mesodermal patterning, lying between the FGF/MAPK pathway and the Xbra transcription. DISCUSSIONIt is known that FGFs can induce mesoderm via the Ras/MAPK pathway in early Xenopus development (3Whitman M. Melton D.A.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that members of at least six subfamilies of ETS proteins (ETS, YAN, ELG, PEA3, ERF, TCF) are nuclear targets of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Elk-1 is a member of the ternary complex factor subfamily, and it is well known that phosphorylation of Elk-1 by MAPK enhances activities of Elk-1. However, the FGF-induced Xbra expression was not reduced by overexpression of dominant-negative Elk-1 in animal cap assay (38Panitz F. Krain B. Hollemann T. Nordheim A. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4414-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The other member of ETS family, ER81, which belongs to the PEA3 subfamily, was identified in Xenopus. Although XER81 has been reported to be a target of FGF signaling, XER81 alone did not induce Xbra expression in animal cap explants (39Chen Y. Hollemann T. Grunz H. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of XER81 did not change the expression pattern of Xbra transcript (40Münchberg S.R. Steinbeisser H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results here have demonstrated that Ets-2 induces Xbra expression and plays an essential role in mesoderm patterning downstream of the FGF/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Ets-2 caused posteriorized embryos. Similar phenotypes were reported to be induced by expressing Xcad3 that is required for posterior development downstream of FGF signaling (41Isaacs H.V. Pownall M.E. Slack J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3413-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both Ets-2 and Xcad3 appear to posteriorize anterior neural tissue. How Ets-2 cooperates with Xcad3 and the Hox gene pathway in posterior development remains to be studied (42Pownall M.E. Tucker A.S. Slack J.M. Isaacs H.V. Development. 1996; 122: 3881-3892PubMed Google Scholar).In Xenopus mesoderm patterning, no transcription factor that would relay the FGF signal at the Xbra promoter has been identified (43Tada M. O'Reilly M.A. Smith J.C. Development. 1997; 124: 2225-2234PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Ets-2 regulates the transcription of Xbra downstream of the FGF/MAPK pathway. Mullick et al.

They provide new insights on the role of putative weak consensus Ets sites in transcription activation, possibly through synergistic interaction with other gene-specific transcription activators (44Mullick J.

Because the putative weak Ets consensus sites are widely distributed on the Xbra promoter, it is possible that interactions with several Ets-like sites synergistically regulate Xbra transcription. Furthermore, other transcription factors, such as AP-1, potentially participate in transcriptional regulation of Xbra (45Kim J. Lin J.J. Xu R.H. Kung H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1542-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is likely that other transcription factors in coordination with Ets-2 regulate Xbra transcription. Elucidation of the precise relationship of Ets-2 with other transcription factors will be a necessary step toward understanding the regulation of Xbra.Our results reported here strongly suggest that Ets-2 plays an essential role in mesoderm patterning. Previously, HpEts has been identified as a sea urchin homologue of Ets-2. Overexpression of HpEts in sea urchin embryos caused primary mesenchyme cells to extinguish cellular adhesion and to migrate (46Kurokawa D. Kitajima T. Mitsunaga-Nakatsubo K. Amemiya S. Shimada H.

https://openalex.org/W2077095747,"The MoFe protein component of the complex metalloenzyme nitrogenase is an α2β2 tetramer encoded by the<i>nifD</i> and the <i>nifK</i> genes. In nitrogen fixing organisms, the α and β subunits are translated as separate polypeptides and then assembled into tetrameric MoFe protein complex that includes two types of metal centers, the P cluster and the FeMo cofactor. In <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i>, the NifEN complex, the site for biosynthesis of the FeMo cofactor, is an α2β2 tetramer that is structurally similar to the MoFe protein and encoded as two separate polypeptides by the <i>nifE</i> and the <i>nifN</i>genes. In <i>Anabaena variabilis</i> it was shown that a NifE-N fusion protein encoded by translationally fused <i>nifE</i> and<i>nifN</i> genes can support biological nitrogen fixation. The structural similarity between the MoFe protein and the NifEN complex prompted us to test whether the MoFe protein could also be functional when synthesized as a single protein encoded by <i>nifD-K</i>translational fusion. Here we report that the NifD-K fusion protein encoded by <i>nifD-K</i> translational fusion in <i>A. vinelandii</i> is a large protein (as determined by Western blot analysis) and is capable of supporting biological nitrogen fixation. These results imply that the MoFe protein is flexible in that it can accommodate major structural changes and remain functional."

Surprisingly, given their importance in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, hypoxia, and hypertrophy as well as frequent use of rat cardiomyocyte model systems, the rat α1aAR gene promoter has never been characterized. Therefore, we isolated 3.9 kb of rat α1aAR 5′-untranslated region and 5′-regulatory sequences and identified multiple transcription initiation sites. One proximal (P1) and several clustered upstream distal promoters (P2, P3, and P4) were delineated. Sequences surrounding both proximal and distal promoters lack typical TATA or CCAAT boxes but contain cis-elements for multiple myocardium-relevant nuclear regulators including Sp1, GATA, and CREB, findings consistent with enhanced cardiac basal α1aAR expression seen in Northern blots and reporter constructs. Promoter analysis using deletion reporter constructs reveals, in addition to a powerful upstream enhancer, a key region (–558/−542) important in regulating all α1aAR promoters with hypoxic stress. Gel shift analysis of this 14-bp region confirms a hypoxia-induced shift independent of direct hypoxia-inducible factor binding. Mutational analysis of this sequence identifies a novel 9-bp hypoxia response element, the loss of which severely attenuates hypoxia-mediated repression of α1aAR transcription.

To gain insight into transcriptional pathways governing α1AR expression, several laboratories have initiated cloning and characterization of α1AR subtype regulatory regions from different species, including the α1aAR (human (5Razik M.

Long C. Simpson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5839-5843Google Scholar). Modulation of α1aAR expression occurs during pathological states, such as myocardial hypertrophy (13Autelitano D.J.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 919-925Google Scholar), the latter usually secondary to ischemic injury. In hypertrophic models, classically performed in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, direct chronic α1aAR stimulation results in increased transcription of the α1aAR gene itself, providing a pathway for overall sustained α1AR signaling in the heart (13Autelitano D.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1515-1523Google Scholar, 14Rokosh D. Stewart A. Chang K. Bailey B. Karliner J. Camacho S. Long C. Simpson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5839-5843Google Scholar). In contrast, both in vitro cardiomyocyte and whole animal models of hypoxia (1% O2, 72 h) reveal decreased α1AR signaling, caused in part by reduced levels of α1aAR mRNA and protein (15Li H.-T. Long C.S. Rokosh G. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. Circulation. 1995; 92: 919-925Google Scholar). Interestingly, these studies also show that chronic hypoxia selectively attenuates α1AR-mediated hypertrophy (15Li H.-T. Long C.S. Rokosh G. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. Circulation. 1995; 92: 919-925Google Scholar), suggesting that hypertrophy secondary to ischemic injury occurs via distinct, uncharacterized mechanisms. A number of pathways have been implicated in regulation of α1AR signaling including protein kinase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, rho, ras, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and calcineurin-dependent pathways (4Michelotti G.A. Price D.T. Schwinn D.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 88: 281-309Google Scholar). How these signals are integrated to regulate α1aAR expression also remains unknown.Surprisingly, given the importance of α1aARs in myocardial pathology and the use of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes to study hypertrophy, the rat α1aAR promoter has been neither isolated nor characterized. Therefore, to facilitate our mechanistic studies of myocardial α1aAR regulation, we cloned and characterized rat α1aAR 5′-UTR and regulatory sequences, investigated cell-specific expression, and characterized basal transcription in the presence and absence of the physiologic stress of hypoxia. Our data indicate that the rat α1aAR gene is both similar and yet distinct from mouse and human α1aAR genes. The rat α1aAR gene is transcribed from multiple promoters; a proximal promoter (−131 bp relative to ATG) as well as several clustered upstream distal promoters (P2, P3, P4, centered −2.1 kb relative to ATG). Both proximal and distal promoters are TATA-less, containing consensus sequences for an initiator element as well as cis-elements for transcription factors Sp1, GATA, and CREB, shown to be important for cardiac gene transcription (16Muller F.U. Neumann J. Schmitz W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 212: 11-17Google Scholar, 17Flesch M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 3-6Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with enhanced cardiac basal α1aAR expression seen in Northern blots and reporter constructs. In addition to a powerful upstream enhancer, reporter gene and gel shift analysis reveals the presence of nuclear factor(s) able to associate with a 14-bp sequence of the rat α1aAR promoter in cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxic stress. Systematic mutation of sequences within this region identified a potent novel 9-bp hypoxia response element (HRE). These findings provide an important foundation for elucidating specific α1AR-mediated mechanistic pathways involved in distinct myocardial pathologies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLibrary ScreeningTo isolate the 5′-UTR sequence of the rat α1aAR gene, a rat genomic library (λDASH, average insert size 15 kb, Stratagene; La Jolla, CA) was screened using a liquid lysate approach. The α1aAR gene was isolated from phage DNA (18Lech K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1999: 1.13.17Google Scholar) using nested PCR amplification with two α1aAR-specific primers corresponding to residues 836–860 and 776–800 from the published cDNA sequence (19Stewart A.F. Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Karns L.R. Chang K.C. Long C.S. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 796-802Google Scholar) (GenBank NM017191). T7 primer specific for the λDASH vector polylinker was used as the opposing primer, creating a 4.2-kb PCR-generated genomic fragment. PCR fidelity was assured by subcloning and sequencing three independent amplification products.Creation of Rat α1aAR 5′-UTR Deletion and Mutant ConstructsTo determine the location of cis-elements important in conferring cell-specific and hypoxia-mediated regulation of the rat α1aAR gene, serial 5′-deletions of the full-length promoter fragment were made. A HindIII-NcoI digest of the 4.2-kb rat α1aAR fragment described above was cloned into SmaI-HindIII pGL2-Enhancer plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the full-length rat α1aAR reporter construct. Serial deletions of the 5′-UTR of the rat α1aAR gene were created using either convenient restriction sites or a PCR-based approach; all PCR-generated constructs were sequenced to ensure fidelity. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A 634-bpBamHI-NdeI fragment containing the desired mutation was sequenced and reintroduced into the original full-length reporter plasmid to ensure the integrity of all constructs.Isolation of Total RNATotal RNA was isolated by the Trizol method (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA contamination was removed by digestion of RNA samples with RNase-free DNase I (0.4 unit/μl of RNA sample) for 30 min at 37 °C, and degraded nucleic acid was removed using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen; Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, and samples were stored at −80 °C.Northern Blot AnalysisA rat multitissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA in each lane was purchased from RNway laboratories (Seoul, Korea). Membranes were hybridized with a32P-labeled α1aAR RNA probe and washed as described previously (20Price D. Chari R. Berkowitz D. Meyers W. Schwinn D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 221-226Google Scholar). The blot was stripped and reprobed with a 220-bp GAPDH probe specific for nucleotides 663–855 of the published cDNA. Quantification was performed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), normalized to GAPDH levels.RNase Protection Assay (RPA) MethodsTo identify the transcription initiation site of the rat α1aAR gene, RPAs were performed as described previously (5Razik M. Lee K. Price R.R. Williams M.R. Ongjoco R.R. Dole M. Rudner X. Kwatra M. Schwinn D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28237-28246Google Scholar) using 30 μg of total RNA isolated from postnatal day 8 rat heart and >20-fold excess of radiolabeled rat α1aAR probe (3 × 105 cpm/reaction). Nine RNase protection probes spanning the 3.9-kb 5′-UTR were generated and cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene): Probe 9, SpeI-PstI, corresponding to the −3013/−2378; Probe 8,NcoI-HincII, corresponding to −2314/−1819; Probe 7, PstI-PstI, corresponding to −2378/−2052; Probe 6, PflFI-NcoI, corresponding to −2100/−1819; Probe 5, PstI-ApaI, corresponding to −2052/−1628; Probe 4,ApaI-BamHI, corresponding to −1628/−1091; Probe 3, BamHI-NdeI, corresponding to −1091/−457; Probe 2, NdeI-NcoI, corresponding to −457/−2; Probe 1, BstBI-NcoI corresponding to −430/−2 (all relative to ATG). A rat cyclophilin probe (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as a positive control (5 × 104 cpm/10 μg of total RNA). Quantitation of α1aAR mRNA levels in different rat tissues was performed utilizing a previously described probe specific for nucleotides 556–860 of the rat α1aAR gene (20Price D. Chari R. Berkowitz D. Meyers W. Schwinn D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 221-226Google Scholar).Primer Extension AssayPrimer extension assays were used to corroborate the transcription initiation site results generated by RPAs. Primer extension oligonucleotide Primer 1 was made complementary to the region +32/+4, and Primer 2 corresponded to +75/+48, relative to the ATG. Oligonucleotides were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and primer extension assays were performed as described previously (21Triezenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1999: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar) using 30 μg of total RNA isolated from postnatal day 8 rat heart and isolated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Products from primer extension assays were size fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel; a sequencing reaction using Primer 1 was used as a bp marker.Quantitative Competitive RT-PCRCompetitor ConstructionHeterologous competitor DNA constructs were amplified from pGEM-7Zf plasmid vector (Promega) using chimeric primers containing both rat α1aAR cDNA and pGEM-7Zf plasmid sequence. Chimeric primers were as follows: forward, 5′-GTAGCCAAGAGAGAAAGCCGGACGCTCAAGTCA GAGGTGGCGAAACCCGA-3′, and reverse 5′-CAACCCACCACGATGCCCAGCTT CTAGTGTAGCCGTAGTTAGGCCACCAC-3′; bold sequences are specific for the rat α1aAR coding sequence (residues 663–682 and 874–855, respectively, from ATG (19Stewart A.F. Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Karns L.R. Chang K.C. Long C.S. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 796-802Google Scholar)) whereas non-bold sequences correspond to residues 601–630 and 971–1000 of pGEM-7Zf plasmid sequence, respectively (GenBank X65310). The resulting 440-bp PCR product was subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and competitor constructs verified by sequencing. Competitor cRNA for RT-PCRs was synthesized by in vitro transcription using commercially available reagents (Ambion). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically.RT-PCR and Quantitation of α1aAR mRNA LevelsBecause of the accuracy of competitive RT (cRT)-PCR over other RT-PCR methods and excellent target sensitivity, this method was used to quantitate α1aAR mRNA levels in several assays. Total RNA and competitor RNA were synchronously reverse transcribed and amplified using a commercially available kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Control reactions with no RT were performed to ensure absence of contaminating genomic DNA. Samples were amplified as described (22Hampel C. Dolber P.C. Smith M.P. Savic S.L. Thüroff J.W. Thor K.B. Schwinn D.A. J. Urol. 2002; 167: 1513-1521Google Scholar). GAPDH was used to normalize mRNA levels using primers corresponding to residues 120–137 and 338–320 of the published cDNA sequence, respectively. Final PCR products were size fractionated on a 1.5% Tris borate-agarose gel bands, and normalized net band intensities were transformed into an amplification ratio and plotted logarithmically versus competitor amount. The x axis of the linear regression (least squares method) reflects the equivalence point at which the competitor concentration equals the initial mRNA concentration. This method provides the absolute amount of target transcript in starting samples.General Cell CultureTo gain insight into mechanisms governing cell-specific α1aAR expression, rat1-fibroblasts, rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were used as model systems. Rat1-fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. PC12 cells (ATCC; Rockville, MD) were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated onto 30-mm culture plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well in the appropriate medium.Rat Myocyte Isolation and CulturePostnatal (1–2 days postbirth) rat pup hearts were enzymatically dissociated with 73 units/ml collagenase and 0.6 mg/ml pancreatin, and cardiomyocytes were purified by Percoll density centrifugation as described previously (23Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Google Scholar). Myocytes were enriched further by preplating cells for 15 min on standard tissue culture dishes (Costar; Cambridge, MA) to remove fibroblasts. Cells were plated onto 30-mm laminin-coated culture plates at a density of 500,000 cells/well and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and insulin/transferrin/selenium (Invitrogen) and exposed to 90% ambient air and 10% CO2. Typical myocyte yields were 2 × 106 cells/heart, with an average viability of >98% (determined by trypan blue exclusion).Transient Transfection of α1aAR Reporter Constructs into Cultured CellsTo examine α1aAR promoter activity in different cellular contexts, α1aAR reporter constructs were transiently expressed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, PC12 cells, and rat1-fibroblasts followed by measurement of luciferase reporter gene activity. 24 h after initial plating, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with fresh medium. Cultures were transfected with 1 pmol of double CsCl-banded reporter plasmid and 0.5 pmol of β-galactosidase normalization plasmid (Promega) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (23Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Google Scholar). 24 post-transfection, cells washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in appropriate medium for an additional 24 h. Transfected cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was assayed using the Dual-Light Assay System according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Tropix; Bedford, MA). Transfection efficiency was 5–10%, measured by visual β-galactosidase staining.Hypoxia ExposureMyocytes were placed in a hypoxia chamber and exposed to 88.5% N2, 10% CO2, and 1.5% O2 for the lengths of time indicated in figure legends. Oxygen levels were monitored by a Fyrite Gas Analyzer (Illinois Scientific).Preparation of Nuclear ExtractsNuclear cell extracts were prepared from cardiomyocytes as described previously (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar, 25Lo K. Smale S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 182: 13-22Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (Sigma). Cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in a solution containing 420 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 20% glycerol, supplemented with the protease mixture described above and incubated at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed twice against a solution of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)Oligonucleotide probe OL1, specific for region −573/−515, used for EMSA was 5′-GATC CTC CTC AAA TAT TTC AGA CCC ATG TCA CTT AGC CAG AAC TCC TAG ACG CTG GAG CTA GC-3′. The sense and antisense strands were annealed and end labeled with [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). To measure DNA-protein interaction, 20 fmol (2–5 × 104 cpm) of oligonucleotide probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract and 0.1 μg of sonicated, denatured salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol for 20 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was size fractionated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography for 16–48 h. For competition experiments, a 1,000-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction just before the addition of radiolabeled probe. Competitor oligonucleotides were 5′-CTCCTCAAATAT TTCAGA-3′, 5′-AGACCCATGTCACTTAG-3′, 5′-AGCCAGAACTCCTAGACG-3′, 5′-TAGACGCTGGAGCTAGC-3′, corresponding to sequential, overlapping 18-mers within the −573/−515 region, as described in the Fig. 6 B legend. For gel supershift analysis, 1 μl of monoclonal antibody against HIF-1α (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, B. C., Canada) was added after the initial 20-min incubation, and the solution was incubated further for 10 min at 4 °C before electrophoresis.Statistical AnalysisLinear regression analysis of cRT-PCR data was calculated by the least squares method. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t tests withp < 0.05 considered significant. Results are presented as the means ± S.E.DISCUSSIONStimulation of cardiac α1aARs has been shown to play an important role in myocardial hypertrophy (13Autelitano D.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1515-1523Google Scholar, 14Rokosh D. Stewart A. Chang K. Bailey B. Karliner J. Camacho S. Long C. Simpson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5839-5843Google Scholar), contractility (3Lin F. Owens W.A. Chen S. Stevens M.E. Kesteven S. Arthur J.F. Woodcock E.A. Feneley M.P. Graham R.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 343-350Google Scholar), arrhythmias (26Burashnikov A. Antzelevitch C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 901-908Google Scholar), and ischemic preconditioning (27Salvi S. Chest. 2001; 119: 1242-1249Google Scholar). In the present study, we report molecular cloning and functional characterization of the rat α1aAR gene, including identification of multiple transcription initiation sites, with transcription initiation sites located proximally at 131 bp and a distal (upstream) cluster located 1.9, 2.1, and 2.2 kb upstream from the ATG. In addition to identification of a powerful enhancer/control element ≈3.6 kb upstream from the ATG necessary for optimal basal gene expression, we have demonstrated cell-specific transcription of both the proximal and distal promoters. Promoter activity is highest in cardiomyocytes versus other cell types examined, consistent with enhanced cardiac expression of the endogenous gene. Further, we demonstrate a correlation between endogenous gene levels and promoter activity with hypoxic stress and identify specific regions of the rat α1aAR gene capable of modifying basal and hypoxia-induced regulation of heterologous reporter constructs. This region appears to modulate hypoxia-induced decreases in expression for all promoters. Results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments support in vitro binding data and reveal a novel 9-bp HRE located 555 bp upstream from the ATG as a potent regulator of α1aAR transcription with hypoxic stress. These new findings provide clues to mechanisms underlying modulation of myocardial gene expression with disease and stress.Northern blot analysis confirms that there are at least two transcripts in rat heart, with molecular weights of ∼3.5 and ∼1.7 kb. Using 5′-oriented probes, we saw no evidence of the higher molecular weight 9.5- and 11-kb transcripts reported previously to be expressed in rat heart (19Stewart A.F. Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Karns L.R. Chang K.C. Long C.S. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 796-802Google Scholar). Because the former study utilized a full-length cDNA probe, including 3′-UTR sequence, the higher molecular weight forms may represent 3′-UTR alternatively spliced variants. The smallest 1.7-kb transcript was not detected in the former study, perhaps because of the use of neonatal tissue in the current study versus adult tissues reported earlier, suggesting developmental regulation of this transcript. The difference in molecular weight of the two transcripts (Δ1.8 kb) correlates with the difference in length between the proximal and distal promoters. Thus, the distal P2–P4 promoter cluster initiated transcripts (which were not well resolved in our Northern analysis) likely correspond to the 3.5-kb transcript seen in Northern analysis with P1-initiated transcripts corresponding to the 1.7-kb product.Once the rat α1aAR transcription start points were determined, alignment with published mouse and human α1aAR regulatory sequences was performed to gain insight into possible species-specific differences. Comparison with human α1aAR 5′-regulatory sequence reveals that although overall nucleotide identity is only 61%, several of thecis-elements such as MCAT, GATA, and AP1 within regions of increased identity are conserved (Fig.9). Thus, although rat (and mouse) promoter sequence is quite divergent from human, the presence of similar putative cis-elements suggests that they can be transcribed under similar conditions. Indeed, unlike the murine promoter, the human α1aAR promoter is highly active in rat cardiomyocyte reporter gene assays (11-fold, Fig. 9). Interestingly, although rat and mouse promoters are highly similar with large stretches of identity (90%) and a number of conservedcis-elements, including CRE, GATA, MCAT, and Sp1, the two promoters display large differences in promoter strength in the myocardium (32-fold versus 2.3-fold for full-length reporter constructs, Fig. 9). Further examination reveals that the most significant region of divergence falls in the segment containing the powerful rat basal enhancer, which contains putative binding sites for MCAT, GATA, and AP1 (light blue box, Fig. 9). This region shares little similarity to known sequences and may play a key regulatory role in the observed species-specific differences in α1aAR gene expression. The absence of this enhancer region in the human α1aAR gene appears to be compensated for with multiple other enhancers because rat and human promoters result in very high overall expression, 32-fold and 11-fold over base line, respectively (compared with 2.3-fold for mouse).Figure 9Comparison of rat, mouse, and human α1aAR promoters.

Here we describe the synthesis and properties of methanethiosulfonyl (MTS) galactose or glucose derivatives with respect to a well studied membrane transport protein, the lactose permease ofEscherichia coli. The MTS-galactose derivatives behave as affinity inactivators of a functional mutant with Ala122→Cys in a background otherwise devoid of Cys residues. A proton electrochemical gradient (Δμ̄H+) markedly increases the rate of reaction between Cys122 and MTS-galactose derivatives; nonspecific labeling with the corresponding MTS-glucose derivatives is unaffected. When the Ala122→Cys mutation is combined with a mutation (Cys154→Gly) that blocks transport but increases binding affinity, discrimination between the MTS-galactose and -glucose derivatives is abolished, and Δμ̄H+ has no effect. The results provide strong confirmation that the non-galactosyl moiety of permease substrates abuts Ala122 in helix IV. In addition, the findings demonstrate that the MTS-galactose derivatives do not react with the Cys residue at position 122 upon binding per sebut at a subsequent step in the overall transport mechanism. Thus, these inactivators behave as unique suicide substrates. Affinity inactivators are useful for probing catalytic mechanisms.

Alkylation of single-Cys122 LacY (helix IV) with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) abolishes lactose transport as well as ligand binding. Moreover, lactose, melibiose, and β-d-galactopyranosyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (TDG) protect against NEM inactivation of lactose transport as well as labeling of Cys122 by [14C]NEM. Remarkably, however,d-galactose transport is essentially unaffected by NEM, and the monosaccharide affords no protection against inactivation of lactose transport or labeling of Cys122 by NEM. Consistently, competitive inhibition of galactose transport by lactose, melibiose, or TDG is drastically reduced after alkylation by NEM, whereas inhibition by unlabeled galactose is unaffected. Finally, replacement of Ala122 with Phe or Tyr has the same effect as alkylation of single-Cys mutant A122C with NEM. The results demonstrate that Ala122 is in close proximity to the nongalactosyl portion of ligand (24Guan L. Sahin-Tóth M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6613-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Affinity labeling is based upon specific recognition of an inactivating ligand at the binding site. Because Cys148 (helix V), which is in close proximity to Ala122, makes direct contact with the galactopyranosyl moiety of the substrate, numerous attempts to develop an affinity reagent specific for this side chain have failed. On the other hand, Ala122 abuts the non-galactosyl moiety of disaccharide substrates, and alkyation of a Cys residue at this position blocks binding of disaccharides with no effect on galactose transport or binding. Therefore, methanethiosulfonyl (MTS) galactoside with an ethylene linkage between the galactopyranoside ring and MTS and MTS-5-galactose with a carbamide linkage were synthesized as potential affinity reagents for the single-Cys A122C mutant in LacY with the corresponding glucosides as controls.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsMTS-galactoside and MTS-glucoside—MTS-galactoside and MTS-glucoside were synthesized as shown in the synthetic scheme (Scheme 1). Reagents and conditions were as follows: (i) bromoethanol 1.25 eq, BF3Et2O 5.1 eq, CH2Cl2, 0 °C → room temperature, 24 h, (53–61%); (ii) NaOMe 0.1 eq, MeOH, 4 h, and then Dowex 50-W (H+), NaSSO2CH3 (1.3 eq),N,N-dimethylformamide, 50 °C, 16 h (36–42%).Melting points were determined with a Boetius micro melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.

All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and the NaSSO2CH3 was synthesized as described by Mintel and Westley (26Mintel R. Westley J. J. Biol.

Qualitative TLC was carried out on commercially prepared plates (20 DC-Alufolien 5 × 7.5 cm) coated with Merck Kieselgel 60 F 254and visualization was achieved by heating the developed plate.2-(2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)ethyl Bromide (2a) and 2-(2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)ethyl Bromide (2b)To a stirred solution of β-d-galactose-pentaacetate (1a) or β-d-glucose-pentaacetate (1b) (3.9 g, 10.0 mmol) and bromoethanol (0.88 ml, 12.4 mmol), BF3·Et2O (6.5 ml, 51.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 ml) was added dropwise at 0 °C, and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 24 h. The mixture was poured over ice-water (20 ml) and separated, and the aqueous phase was washed with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 ml); the combined organic phase was washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (10 ml) and water (10 ml), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated; and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography (hexane/EtOAc) to give the title compounds 2a (2.77 g (61%), melting point 108–110 °C, Rf 0.35 (hexane/EtOAc, 2:1)) and2b (2.41 g (53%) 113–115 °C, Rf0.32 (hexane/EtOAc, 2:1)).2-(β-d-Galactopyranosyl)ethyl Methanethiosulfonate (3a) and 2-(β-d-Glucopyranosyl)ethyl Methanethiosulfonate (3b)To a stirred solution of compound 2a or 2b (455 mg, 1.0 mmol) in MeOH (10 ml), a freshly made 0.1 m NaOMe solution in MeOH (1 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for further 4 h. The reaction mixture was then passed through a Dowex 50-W (H+) (2.5 × 2-cm plug, eluant MeOH), and the solvent was removed in vacuo to give an oil 215 mg (74%) for 3a and 200 mg (69%) for 3b. This product was immediately dissolved inN,N-dimethylformamide (10 ml); NaSSO2CH3 (134 mg, 1.0 mmol) was added, and the mixture was heated at 50 °C for 15 h. Then,N,N-dimethylformamide was evaporated, and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography (EtOAc/MeOH) to give the title compounds as white thick oils that solidified upon cooling (3a, 133 mg (42%), Rf 0.38 (EtOAc/MeOH, 4:1); 3b, 114 mg (36%),Rf 0.48 (EtOAc/MeOH, 4:1)).MTS-5-galactose and -glucose—MTS-5-galactose was custom synthesized by Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), and MTS-5-glucose was purchased from the same source.Other Reagents[1-14C]Lactose was obtained from Amersham Biosciences.N-([14C]ethyl)Maleimide was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Overnight cultures were diluted 10-fold and allowed to grow for 2 h at 37 °C before induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After additional growth for 2–3 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation.Preparation of Right-Side-Out VesiclesRight-side-out (RSO) membrane vesicles were prepared by osmotic lysis as described (30Kaback H.R.

Reactions (0.25 ml, total volume) were quenched by the addition of 1.75 ml of ice-cold 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5)/10 mmMgSO4 at the indicated times and immediately centrifuged. The pellet was washed with 2.0 ml of the same buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in 0.25 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi(pH 7.5)/10 mm MgSO4.Transport AssaysLactose transport with [1-14C]lactose (10 mCi/mmol) at a final concentration of 0.4 mm was carried out in the presence of 20 mm ascorbate and 0.2 mm PMS under oxygen as described previously (33Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For mutant A122C/C148D, measurements of the rate of lactose transport were studied with vesicles washed in 100 mm potassium Pi/10 mm MgSO4 (pH 5.5), because this mutant exhibits a higher rate of transport at acidic pH (34Jung H.

[14C]NEM (40 mCi/mmol; 0.5 mm final concentration) was added for 30 min, and the reaction was quenched by adding 20 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were then treated as described (29Frillingos S.

Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONPrevious experiments (24Guan L. Sahin-Tóth M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6613-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with A122C LacY demonstrate that the galactopyranosyl moiety of disaccharide substrates of LacY is in close proximity to Cys148 in helix V, whereas the non-galactosyl moiety abuts Ala122. On the basis of these observations, we synthesized the MTS sugars described here, demonstrating that both MTS-galactoside and MTS-5-galactose inactivate mutant A122C at least 20 times more rapidly than the corresponding glucose derivatives. Furthermore, it is clear that inactivation of transport is due specifically to reaction of the inactivators with the Cys residue in place of Ala122. Thus, these results presented provide strong confirmation of the previous conclusion (Fig.7).Figure 7LacY binding site with MTS-galactoside as ligand. The galactopyranosyl ring, which contains all the determinants for specificity, is shown with an MTS group at the anomeric position. The C-4 OH is most important with respect to specificity (18Sahin-Tóth M. Lawrence M.C. Nishio T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 43: 13015-13019Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cys148 (helix V) interacts weakly and hydrophobically with the galactopyranosyl ring, and position 122 (helix IV; shown as Ala) is in close proximity to the reactive thiol of the MTS moiety (24Guan L. Sahin-Tóth M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6613-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although LacY with W151F or W151Y transports lactose almost as well as the wild type, the mutants exhibit a 20–50-fold decrease in affinity (45Guan L. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), indicating that the Trp151stacks with the hydrophobic face of the galactopyranosyl ring, placing it at a right angle with helix IV and abutting Cys148 near position 1. In this orientation, the C-4 OH can H-bond directly with either NH1 or NH2 of Arg144. Because the C-3 OH is close to Glu269 (helix VIII) but at an angle, it is reasonable to suggest that a water molecule may mediate this interaction (50Weinglass A.B. Whitelegge J.P. Hu Y. Verner G.E. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)One noteworthy aspect of the findings is the difference in potency between the two sets of MTS sugars. Clearly, the ethylene linkage in MTS-galactoside and -glucoside confers greater hydrophobicity than the carbamide linkage in the MTS-5-galactose and -glucose derivatives. The preferential reaction of LacY with hydrophobic thiol reagents (46Cohn D.E. Kaczorowski G.J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3308-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is a likely explanation for the differences observed. It may also be relevant that the distance of the reactive thiol in the MTS-5 sugars is significantly further from the C-1 position of the galactopyranosyl ring (Fig. 1).At first glance, MTS-galactoside and MTS-5-galactose appear to act as straightforward affinity reagents. Both compounds inactivate transport at concentrations at which the corresponding glucose derivatives have no effect. Moreover, when Cys148 is replaced with Ala, Ser, or Asp, there is a qualitative relationship between the respective affinities and the rates of transport and inactivation by MTS-galactoside. In contrast, transport in all three mutants is inactivated at the same rate by MTS-glucoside.Remarkably, the rate of inactivation by MTS-galactoside and MTS-5-galactose is increased by about 50- and 30-fold, respectively, in the presence of a Δμ̄H+ (interior negative), and there is no effect of Δμ̄H+ on inactivation by the corresponding glucose derivatives. There are at least three possible explanations for this finding: (i) Δμ̄H+ may drive accumulation of the galactose derivatives, thereby leading to an increase in local concentration; (ii) Δμ̄H+ may increase the accessibility/affinity of the binding site in LacY; or (iii) the galactose derivatives may not react immediately upon binding but at a subsequent step (e.g. a transition intermediate) in the overall transport mechanism induced by binding of the galactosyl analogues and accelerated by Δμ̄H+. This last interpretation is consistent with the major effect of Δμ̄H+ on the kinetics of LacY, which is a marked decrease in K m (47Robertson D.E. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5692-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Although it is possible that MTS-galactoside and MTS-5-galactose are actively transported by LacY, it is unlikely that the marked enhancement of inactivation rates by Δμ̄H+ is due to accumulation of the inactivators. Thus, at a concentration of 20 μm MTS-galactoside or 100 μmMTS-5-galactose, half-maximal inactivation is observed in less than 5 s (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas significant accumulation of most substrates requires considerably more time.It is also unlikely that Δμ̄H+ leads to an increase in accessibility/affinity of the binding site in LacY. Although the data have not been presented here, when the reaction of MTS-galactoside with mutant A122C/C148A is studied by blockade of NEM labeling in inside-out membrane vesicles as a function of MTS-galactoside concentration, there is little or no difference in the concentration of MTS-galactoside that reduces labeling by 50%, and Δμ̄H+ (interior positive and acid) has no demonstrable effect.Mutation C154G results in a phenotype that binds ligand but does little or no translocation of lactose across the membrane (42Menick D.R. Sarkar H.K. Poonian M.S. Kaback H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43van Iwaarden P.R. Driessen A.J. Lolkema J.S. Kaback H.R. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5419-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 44Smirnova I. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar), and the protein appears to be locked in an outwardly facing conformation (44Smirnova I. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). When this mutation is combined with the A122C/C148A mutations, LacY binds ligand with about 10 times greater affinity than mutant A122C/C148A but catalyzes essentially no lactose translocation. Furthermore, binding specificity is retained, because glucose or sucrose at high concentrations does not displace bound NPG. Surprisingly, however, as judged by NEM labeling (Fig. 4, Cand D), mutant A122C/C148A/C154G no longer discriminates between MTS-galactoside and MTS-glucoside, and as expected, there is no effect of Δμ̄H+. Therefore, it seems apparent that MTS-galactoside, as well as MTS-5-galactose do not react upon binding per se but at a step subsequent to binding. Possibly, a small decrease in distance between position 122 and the MTS moiety at the anomeric position of the galactopyranosyl ring induced by ligand and/or Δμ̄H+ occurs in order for reaction with the Cys residue at this position to occur (Fig.7). In any case, it is apparent that LacY turnover is a prerequisite for affinity labeling of the Cys residue at position 122. The lactose permease (LacY)1 of Escherichia coli transduces the free energy stored in an electrochemical H+ gradient into a concentration gradient ofd-galactopyranosides and vice versa (galactoside/H+ symport) (1Kaback H.R.

Alkylation of single-Cys122 LacY (helix IV) with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) abolishes lactose transport as well as ligand binding.

The resting [Ca2+]i level in densely cultured cells was 1.5 times higher than the [Ca2+]i level in sparsely cultured cells or in other cell types (mouse fibroblasts, rat vascular smooth muscle cells, and bovine endothelial cells). A high resting [Ca2+]i level may be specific for MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were stimulated with ATP (10 μm), caffeine (10 mm), thapsigargin (1 μm), or ionomycin (10 μm), and the effect on the [Ca2+]i level of MC3T3-E1 cells was studied. The percentage of responding cells and the degree of [Ca2+]i elevation were high in the sparsely cultured cells and low in densely cultured cells. The rank order for the percentage of responding cells and magnitude of the Ca2+ response to the stimuli was ionomycin > thapsigargin = ATP > caffeine and suggests the existence of differences among the various [Ca2+]i channels.

The calcium ion (Ca2+) acts as an intracellular messenger and regulates a diverse array of functions in many types of cells (1Putney J.W. Science. 1993; 29: 676-678Google Scholar).

There are two sources of [Ca2+]i in osteoblasts: 1) inflow from the extracellular space and 2) release from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum. The release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum is a ubiquitous signal in many cells including osteoblasts (3Ljunggren O. Johansson H. Ljunghall S. Fredholm B.B. Lerner U.H. J. Bone Miner.

We previously reported that the response of the Ca2+ level in vascular smooth muscle cells (5Shin W.S. Toyo-oka T. Masuo M. Okai Y. Fujita H. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 551-556Google Scholar) to various stimuli is heterogeneous and that it is dependent on the stage of cell growth (6Masuo M. Toyo-oka T. Shin W.S. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1327-1339Google Scholar). A heterogeneous Ca2+ response has also been reported in an osteosarcoma cell line stimulated by parathyroid hormone (7Wiltink A. van den Brink A.M. Herrmann-Erlee M.P. van der Meer J.M. van der Plas A. Willems P.H. Van Duijn B. Nijweide P.J. Ypey D.L. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 591-600Google Scholar) and among sub-cell lines of MC3T3-E1 cells treated with bradykinin (8Leis H.J. Hulla W. Gruber R. Huber E. Zach D. Gleispach H. Windischhofer W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 541-551Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of cell density and growth on [Ca2+]i-handling mechanisms in MC3T3-E1 cells using a two-dimensional fura-2 imaging system, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy, and we identified unique characteristics of these cells. We studied the effect of growth on [Ca2+]i-handling mechanisms in MC3T3-E1 cells by studying the Ca2+ dynamics in cells seeded in the sparse or dense condition. All reagents used were of analytical grade. Thapsigargin (TG; Sigma Chemical) and ionomycin (IM; Sigma Chemical) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and then diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1% (v/v) and had no action on the handling of [Ca2+]i in the MC3T3-E1 cells (data not shown). Caffeine and ATP were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Each reagent was administered by replacing half the volume of extracellular medium with medium containing 2-fold concentrated reagent (5Shin W.S. Toyo-oka T. Masuo M. Okai Y. Fujita H. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 551-556Google Scholar, 6Masuo M. Toyo-oka T. Shin W.S. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1327-1339Google Scholar). In a pilot study, we attempted to identify suitable reagents and their appropriate concentrations to analyze the transient [Ca2+]i currents. We used 10 mm caffeine, 10 μm ATP, 1 μmTG, and 10 μm ryanodine or IM in the present study. MC3T3-E1 mouse clonal osteogenic cells (a generous gift from Prof. S. Yamamoto, Ohu University, Koriyama, Japan) were seeded onto dishes (radius, 1 cm) made of fluorescence-free glass at a density of 1.0 × 104cells/dish (sparse condition) or 2.0 × 105 cells/dish (dense condition). The cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioserum, Victoria, Australia), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma Chemical). The medium was changed every 48 h after seeding. Caffeine, ATP, TG, or IM was added between 0 and 120 h after seeding, and the peak [Ca2+]i level upon stimulation was studied. The resting [Ca2+]i level in MC3T3-E1 cells seemed to be higher than that in other cells. We compared the [Ca2+]i level in MC3T3-E1 cells with that in endothelial cells (ECs) from the bovine aorta, cloned rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5), and cloned mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3), which have been used in studies on [Ca2+]i dynamics (5Shin W.S. Toyo-oka T. Masuo M. Okai Y. Fujita H. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 551-556Google Scholar, 6Masuo M. Toyo-oka T. Shin W.S. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1327-1339Google Scholar). In single-cell line cultures, each cell line was seeded at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/dish and cultured for 48 h. In cocultures, EC, A7r5, or NIH3T3 cells were seeded together with MC3T3-E1 cells at a density of each cell line of 1.0 × 104 cells/dish and cultured for 48 h. To examine the effect of cell-cell contact, MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded in dishes at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/dish (dense condition). After 24 h, 3 μm heptanol, a gap-junctional inhibitor (9Ilvesaro J. Vaananen K. Tuukkanen J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 919-926Google Scholar, 10Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Google Scholar), was added to the dishes and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. And then, ATP, TG, or IM was added, and the peak [Ca2+]i level upon stimulation was studied. The [Ca2+]i level within individual cells was analyzed as described previously (11Shin W.S. Sasaki T. Kato M. Hara K. Seko A. Yang W.D. Shimamoto N. Sugimoto T. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20377-20382Google Scholar, 12Civitelli R. Fujimori A. Bernier S.M. Warlow P.M. Goltzman D. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2392-2400Google Scholar, 13Chen J. Wang Y.P. Wang Y. Nakajima T. Iwasawa K. Hikiji H. Sunamoto M. Choi D. Yoshida Y. Sakaki Y. Toyo-Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28739-28749Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in PBS(+) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4. The Ca2+-free solution consisted of PBS in which CaCl2 was replaced by 1.0 mm EGTA. Cells were loaded with 4 μmfura-2/acetoxymethyl ester in the same buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBS(+), and then preincubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. The recorded fluorescence images were digitized using an on-line image processor (Olympus-Merlin, Tokyo, Japan; Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 B shows the change in the relative value of the 340- to 380-nm fluorescence ratio (F 340/F 380) in MC3T3-E1 cells upon treatment with ATP. Because of the difficulty in measuring the absolute [Ca2+]iconcentration caused by problems intrinsic to fura-2 fluoroscopy, the maximum amplitude of the [Ca2+]ielevation in response to each stimulant was expressed as the relative value of F 340/F 380 in relation to the value ofF 340/F 380 in the resting state (5Shin W.S. Toyo-oka T. Masuo M. Okai Y. Fujita H. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 551-556Google Scholar, 6Masuo M. Toyo-oka T. Shin W.S. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1327-1339Google Scholar). Caffeine transiently increased the [Ca2+]i level, in both the presence and the absence of extracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]o). The degree of [Ca2+]i elevation evoked by caffeine in the Ca2+-free solution became progressively smaller as the incubation time increased (data not shown). To avoid fluctuations in the response, we applied caffeine to cells in the presence of 1 mm[Ca2+]o. Ryanodine (10 μm; Wako Pure Chemicals) was also added to keep the CICR channels open (14Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1988; 152: 417-422Google Scholar) and to prevent the activation of additional CICR. All measurements were made 24 h after seeding to avoid the effects of trypsin, which was used in seeding, on the Ca2+channels. MC3T3-E1 cells incubated in plastic dishes (60 mm in diameter) were fixed with a mixture of equal volumes of ethanol and acetone. The nonspecific binding of antibody was blocked by goat serum, and then the cells were treated with anti-IP3 type-1 receptor (IP3-R1) polyclonal antibody or non-immunized rabbit IgG at room temperature for 1 h, followed by an LSAB2 kit/horseradish peroxidase (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA). The immunoproduct was visualized by treatment with amino-9-ethylcarbazol (DAKO) and micrographs were taken at 100× (AX-80; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For transmission electron microscopy, the MC3T3-E1 cells were detached from the culture dishes by treatment with trypsin and washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4. After fixing overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde plus 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, the cells were sedimented at 2000 rpm at room temperature for 5 min, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded alcohol, and then embedded in Epon (Epon 812; TAAB Lab, Berkshire, England) overnight at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under an electron microscope (H-7000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Treatment pairs were compared by Scheffé's F test. All differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. The [Ca2+]i level in MC3T3-E1 cells in the resting state that had been seeded in the sparse or dense condition was measured at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h after the first medium change (Fig. 2). The [Ca2+]i level of the densely seeded cells was 1.5 times higher than that of the sparsely seeded cells at 0 h (1.19 ± 0.01 versus 0.80 ± 0.02, p < 0.01). The [Ca2+]i level of the densely seeded cells increased slightly, although significantly, up through 120 h from 1.19 ± 0.01 to 1.33 ± 0.01 (p < 0.01). The [Ca2+]i level of the sparsely seeded cells increased significantly from 0.80 ± 0.02 to 1.30 ± 0.01 at 120 h (p < 0.01) and reached the same level as that of the densely seeded cells at 120 h (1.33 ± 0.01, densely seeded, versus 1.30 ± 0.01, sparsely seeded), with no significant change thereafter. These results indicate that the [Ca2+]ilevel of MC3T3-E1 cells increased as proliferation progressed. To confirm that densely seeded MC3T3-E1 cells in the resting state have a high [Ca2+]i level, we measured the [Ca2+]i level in both isocultures and cocultures with other cell lines, including mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3), rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5), and ECs from the bovine aorta. The resting state [Ca2+]i level of MC3T3-E1 cells was higher than that of the other cell lines both in the isocultures, in which one cell line each had been harvested (Fig.3 A), and in the cocultures at 48 h, in which two cell lines had been cultured in the same dish (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the high [Ca2+]i level in resting state MC3T3-E1 cells may exert a specific function in calcifying tissue. In the following experiments, MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated in PBS in which CaCl2 had been replaced with EGTA (1.0 mm) to prevent Ca2+ influx into cells and to selectively evaluate Ca2+ release from intracellular calcium stores. ATP (10 μm), which stimulates IICR (15Shimegi S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 58: 109-113Google Scholar, 16Kumagai H. Sakamoto H. Guggino S. Filburn C.R. Sacktor B. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 251-254Google Scholar), elevated the [Ca2+]i level in 84% of the sparsely seeded cells when it was applied at 24 h after seeding, in 100% of the cells when applied at 48 h, and in 98% of the cells when applied at 72 h (Fig.4 A). In contrast, ATP elevated the [Ca2+]i level in only 18–23% of the densely seeded cells when it was applied between 24 and 120 h. The relative value ofF 340/F 380 upon treatment with ATP at 24 and 48 h in each responder cell in the culture under the sparsely seeded condition was 1.675 ± 0.066 and 1.770 ± 0.068, respectively. Then, it sharply decreased to 1.279 ± 0.023 and 1.038 ± 0.003 when ATP was applied at 72 and 120 h, respectively, when the cell density, because of proliferation, reached that of the densely seeded cells (Fig.4 B). Caffeine, which stimulates CICR (14Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1988; 152: 417-422Google Scholar), increased the [Ca2+]i level in 61 and 79% of the sparsely seeded cells when it was applied at 24 and 48 h after seeding, respectively. When caffeine was applied at 72 or 120 h, only 0–3% of the sparsely seeded cells had an increased [Ca2+]i level (Fig.5 A). In the densely seeded cells, caffeine had no effect on the [Ca2+]i level when it was applied between 24 and 120 h after seeding. In sparsely seeded cells, the relative value ofF 340/F 380 was 1.115 ± 0.009 when caffeine was applied at 24 h, and it increased to 1.199 ± 0.028 when applied at 48 h (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that caffeine affected the [Ca2+]i level in MC3T3-E1 cells more heterogeneously than ATP and that the degree of heterogeneity upon treatment with caffeine or ATP was affected by the cell density. In the sparsely seeded condition, the relative value ofF 340/F 380 upon treatment with ATP in caffeine responding cell was larger than that upon treatment with ATP in caffeine non-responding cell at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 6). These results indicate that cells that responded to caffeine also responded to ATP and suggest that the source of [Ca2+]i release was the same smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (sER) via CICR or IICR, a finding that differs from that in vascular smooth muscle cells under the sparsely seeded condition (5Shin W.S. Toyo-oka T. Masuo M. Okai Y. Fujita H. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 551-556Google Scholar, 6Masuo M. Toyo-oka T. Shin W.S. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1327-1339Google Scholar). TG blocks the uptake of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the sER (17Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar). When TG was applied at 24, 48, or 72 h, the [Ca2+]i level increased in 97.5–100% of the sparsely seeded cells; however, upon application of TG at 120 h, none of the cells had an increased [Ca2+]i level (Fig.7 A). The percentage of densely seeded cells with elevated [Ca2+]iwas only 3–8% when TG was applied between 24 and 120 h after seeding. In sparsely seeded cells, the relative value ofF 340/F 380 in the responders was 1.445 ± 0.026, 1.375 ± 0.025, and 1.376 ± 0.023 when TG was applied at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively (Fig. 7 B). However, the relative value ofF 340/F 380 in sparsely seeded cells upon treatment with TG at 120 h and the relative values of F 340/F 380 in densely seeded cells that had been treated with TG at 24, 48, 72, or 120 h did not significantly differ. All Ca2+ ions in internal stores can be non-specifically released by the Ca2+ ionophore, IM (2Meszaros J.G. Karin H.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 704-710Google Scholar). IM elevated the [Ca2+]i level in 100% of the sparsely and densely seeded cells. In the sparsely seeded cells, the relative value ofF 340/F 380 upon treatment with IM at 24, 48, 72, or 120 h after seeding was 2.110 ± 0.067, 2.058 ± 0.078, 1.910 ± 0.042, and 1.421 ± 0.021, respectively (Fig. 8). When densely seeded cells were treated with IM, the [Ca2+]i level increased by a smaller degree. All data on the Ca2+ dynamics in the TG and IM experiments supported the dependence of the [Ca2+]i response on cell density. Furthermore, the Ca2+ response was smaller upon treatment with TG than upon treatment with IM at each time point. This may indicate that Ca2+ was released from other internal stores in addition to the sER. The relative value ofF 340/F 380 upon treatment with ATP, caffeine, TG, or IM in the responders was much lower throughout the experiment in the densely seeded cells than in the sparsely seeded cells (Figs. 4, 5, 7, 8). Heptanol, a gap-junctional inhibitor (9Ilvesaro J. Vaananen K. Tuukkanen J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 919-926Google Scholar, 10Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Google Scholar), was used to evaluate the effect of cell-cell contact in the densely seeded cells. When densely seeded cells were treated with 3 μm heptanol, the [Ca2+]i elevation and the relative value of F 340/F 380 upon treatment with ATP, TG, or IM recovered (Fig.9). These results suggest that cell-cell contact may inhibit the Ca2+ response of densely seeded cells to ATP, caffeine, TG, and IM. Ca2+ was released from CICR channels in response to caffeine only in sparsely seeded cells up to between 48 and 72 h. The Ca2+efflux from IICR channels was also closely related to the Ca2+ released from the sER. These results suggest that IICR may play a more significant role than CICR in calcium handling in osteoblasts. To date, three isoforms of the IP3 receptor have been cloned, and the type-1 receptor is believed to be ubiquitous. Using a specific antibody to IP3-R1, we investigated the expression of this receptor in sparsely and densely seeded cells to determine whether it is involved in the Ca2+ response. A high level of IP3-R1 protein was detected in sparsely seeded cells upon culture for 24 h (Fig.10 B), and a low level was detected upon culture for 120 h (Fig. 10 C). The level of immunostaining was low in densely seeded cells at both 24 and 120 h (Fig. 10, D and E). The level of IP3-R1 protein expression was associated with the amount of Ca2+ released from IICR channels. Transmission electron microscopy was used to ascertain the relationship between the [Ca2+]i level and the amount of sER in osteoblasts. Many organelles, including sER, were observed in the sparsely seeded cells at 24 h (Fig.11, A and B). However, at 120 h of culture, the sER had been reduced, and many rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticula and mitochondria were detected after cell proliferation (Fig. 11, C and D). Many rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticula and mitochondria were observed and reduced number of sER were seen in densely seeded cells that had been cultured for 24 (Fig. 11, E and F) or 120 h (Fig. 11, G and H). Thus, the reduced Ca2+ response of densely seeded cells to ATP, caffeine, TG, and IM can be explained by the reduced number of sER. These results suggest that the expression of sER is regulated by cell proliferation. Heterogeneity of the [Ca2+]ilevel among MC3T3-E1 cells was observed even before stimulation and was dependent on cell density (sparsely seeded or densely seeded). The [Ca2+]i level in cells in the resting state ranges from 50 to 400 nm and varies according to cell type and function (14Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1988; 152: 417-422Google Scholar). Because estimation of the absolute [Ca2+]i level by fura-2 fluorescence is inaccurate because of several problems intrinsic to fura-2 fluorescence (11Shin W.S. Sasaki T. Kato M. Hara K. Seko A. Yang W.D. Shimamoto N. Sugimoto T. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20377-20382Google Scholar, 12Civitelli R. Fujimori A. Bernier S.M. Warlow P.M. Goltzman D. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2392-2400Google Scholar, 13Chen J. Wang Y.P. Wang Y. Nakajima T. Iwasawa K. Hikiji H. Sunamoto M. Choi D. Yoshida Y. Sakaki Y. Toyo-Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28739-28749Google Scholar), the [Ca2+]i level in the resting state obtained in previous reports cannot be simply compared with that obtained in the present study. The relative value ofF 340/F 380 in reference toF 340/F 380 in the resting state (11Shin W.S. Sasaki T. Kato M. Hara K. Seko A. Yang W.D. Shimamoto N. Sugimoto T. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20377-20382Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the Ca2+ response. To compare the [Ca2+]i levels of various cells at the resting state, we usedF 340/F 380 in iso- and cocultures of MC3T3-E1 cells and other established cell lines (EC, A7r5, and NIH3T3). It is unclear why the [Ca2+]ilevel was higher in the densely seeded MC3T3-E1 cells than in the sparsely seeded cells or other cell lines. We consider that this characteristic is specific for bone-forming MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. In the densely seeded MC3T3-E1 cells, the number of sER was reduced, indicating a reduced amount of stored Ca2+. Consequently, it is suggested that in the resting state, the [Ca2+]i level increases. However, the [Ca2+]i level in densely seeded cells was about 1.5 times higher than that in the sparse condition or other cell lines, and the degree of the increase in [Ca2+]i level was not necessarily so high that it would be toxic for cells. The presence of an increased [Ca2+]i level in the resting state of MC3T3-E1 cells, especially in densely seeded cells, seems to be informative for estimating the physiological significance of bone-forming cells. We believe that the increased [Ca2+]i level may be advantageous for the release of Ca2+ during calcification from the point of view of ionic strength. We focused on the cell density- and growth-dependent changes in the [Ca2+]i response of osteoblast-like cells to various stimuli. There is a study that focused on the downstream signaling mechanism via Ca2+, not only from internal stores but also from extracellular Ca2+ in osteoblasts (18Goldwin S.L. Soltoff S.P. Bone. 2002; 30: 559-566Google Scholar). Whether the [Ca2+]i response of osteoblast-like cells to various stimuli creates cross-talk with extracellular Ca2+-sensing pathways is of much interest and requires further investigation (19Zach D. Windischhofer W. Leis H.J. Bone. 2001; 28: 595-602Google Scholar). Among the agonists employed in the present study, ATP, which stimulates IICR, caused [Ca2+]i elevation when applied between 24 and 120 h to both sparsely and densely seeded cells. In contrast, caffeine, which opens CICR channels, induced [Ca2+]i elevation in only the sparsely seeded condition. CICR may be inhibited more strongly than IICR in densely seeded cells. On the other hand, cells showing CICR channel function reacted to ATP, and the other cells that did not reveal an IICR channel response did not respond to caffeine either. Therefore, IICR channels mainly handle the calcium response in MC3T3-E1 cells. We previously showed that the expression of CICR and IICR channels, in addition to voltage-dependent Ca2+channels, is influenced by cell growth and enhanced by the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and that they are independently regulated from each other (5Shin W.S. Toyo-oka T. Masuo M. Okai Y. Fujita H. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 551-556Google Scholar, 6Masuo M. Toyo-oka T. Shin W.S. Sugimoto T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1327-1339Google Scholar). The percentage of responding cells and the magnitude of the Ca2+ response were much lower in sparsely seeded vascular smooth muscle cells than in densely seeded cells. Thus, [Ca2+]i handling in MC3T3-E1 cells differs from that in vascular smooth muscle cells. TG depletes Ca2+ from the sER and induces [Ca2+]i elevation via capacitative Ca2+ entry. A sufficient dose of IM, an ionophore that forms artificial [Ca2+]i channels in membranes and releases all Ca2+ from the sER, also increased the [Ca2+]i level even when Ca2+ entry did not occur in PBS(−). The rank order of the degree of [Ca2+]i increase was IM > TG = ATP > caffeine. These results indicate that there is a large amount of Ca2+ in the sER of sparsely seeded MC3T3-E1 cells and that IICR channels of the sER mainly control [Ca2+]i elevation in MC3T3-E1 cells. These findings are fundamentally compatible with the results of the study of Zach et al. (19Zach D. Windischhofer W. Leis H.J. Bone. 2001; 28: 595-602Google Scholar). In sparsely seeded MC3T3-E1 cells, the presence of a high level of IP3-R1and a large number of sER was morphologically confirmed by immunohistology and electron microscopy, respectively. The [Ca2+]i level in osteoblasts has been reported to be correlated with the seeded cell density, the cell line, morphology, and receptor distribution (7Wiltink A. van den Brink A.M. Herrmann-Erlee M.P. van der Meer J.M. van der Plas A. Willems P.H. Van Duijn B. Nijweide P.J. Ypey D.L. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 591-600Google Scholar, 8Leis H.J. Hulla W. Gruber R. Huber E. Zach D. Gleispach H. Windischhofer W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 541-551Google Scholar, 12Civitelli R. Fujimori A. Bernier S.M. Warlow P.M. Goltzman D. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2392-2400Google Scholar). Various factors influence the [Ca2+]ilevel in individual cells at rest and after agonist administration. A previous study suggested that gap junctions and gap-junctional intercellular communication play pivotal mechanotransduction mechanisms in bone (20Saunders M.M. You J. Trosko J.E. Yamasaki H. Li Z. Donahue H.J. Jacobs C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1917-C1925Google Scholar). In this study, the results of heptanol treatment revealed that gap-junctional cell-cell contact also contributes to the cell density-dependent, heterogeneous [Ca2+]i response to agonists. In the proliferating phase of osteoblasts, cells without cell-cell contact have both CICR and IICR channels or abundant sER. We previously showed that IP3-R1 may regulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (21Wang Y. Chen J. Wang Y. Taylor C.W. Hirata Y. Hagiwara H. Mkoshiba K. Toyo-oka T. Omata M. Sakai Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 202-209Google Scholar). During bone formation in physiological growth or pathological repair after a bone fracture, enhanced IP3-R1 expression may be required for the proliferation of osteoblasts. To elucidate the precise significance of IICR modulation, more specific and detailed studies should be conducted in the future."

Allosteric modulation of the ligand-binding domain by hormonal activators shifts the co-factor binding preference by defined structural changes in overlapping docking sites. We report here that mutations at conserved residues within the docking motif of the retinoic acid receptor α cause defects in dimerization, co-regulator association, and transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, although a minimal co-repressor receptor interaction domain is sufficient for receptor binding, flanking sequences appear to stabilize this interaction without interfering with ligand sensitivity. However, ligand sensitivity is changed by the K262A mutation, which requires much higher concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid to promote co-repressor dissociation. Consequently, K262A functions as a dominant-negative mutant at low concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid. As a result, transcriptional activation is mechanistically linked to co-repressor release.

Unliganded thyroid hormone (TR)1 and retinoid acid receptors (RAR) function as potent transcriptional repressors becoming activators upon hormone binding. The repression activity by unliganded RAR and TR is mediated through the recruitment of either the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) or nuclear receptor co-repressor complexes that include mSin3A and a variety of histone deacetylases (3Alland L.

DNA-binding domains bind hormone response elements and thus direct receptors to appropriate target genes. LBDs are required for nuclear localization, homodimerization and/or heterodimerization, co-regulator association (including co-repressors and co-activators), and most importantly, ligand binding. The LBDs are composed of 12 helices in which helices 3–5 are the most conserved among receptors and define the nuclear receptor LBD signature motif for co-regulator recruitment. The transcriptional switch of the receptors from repressors to activators involves a ligand-induced conformational change, resulting in an exchange of co-repressors and co-activators. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we and others have previously shown that helices 3–5 of TRβ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ play a pivotal role in binding co-regulators (15Hu X.

Reciprocally, SMRT and nuclear receptor co-repressor contain two short peptide motifs that are both necessary and sufficient for mediating co-repressor binding to unliganded RARs (15Hu X.

These two motifs, termed coreID I and coreID II (17 and 19 amino acids, respectively), are conserved in both position and in sequence between nuclear receptor co-repressor and SMRT. A third TRβ binding motif amino-terminal to those previously mapped in nuclear receptor co-repressor may also exist (21Webb P. Anderson C.M. Valentine C. Nguyen P. Marimuthu A. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1976-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Helices 3–5 also interact with co-activators through a LXXLL-containing signature motif. The p160 co-activator proteins contain three putative LXXLL motifs, but the affinity and specificity of the individual LXXLL motifs within p160 proteins toward different receptors are not well characterized. RARs and RXRs form heterodimers in solution and on response elements containing direct repeat spaced by one (DR1) or five base pairs (DR5) with the half-site sequence AGGTCA (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). Although the LBD three-dimensional structures of RXRs and RARs are very similar (22Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar,23Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), they exhibit distinct ligand binding properties toward stereoisomers. RXRs bind only to 9-cis-retinoic acid, whereas RARs can bind both 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-RA (AT-RA), albeit with different affinities. RXRs are thought to function as a silent partner whose ligands alone do not activate transcription activity of the RXR/RAR heterodimer. In contrast, RARs ligands alone are able to activate transcription. In an attempt to examine the molecular basis of co-regulator association with RARα, we have generated mutations within both conserved and diverged residues within RARα helices 3 and 4 and systematically analyzed the properties of these mutants. We have identified critical residues for RARα functions including dimerization, co-regulator association, and transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that the transcription activity of RARα depends primarily on its ability to dissociate from co-repressors. The plasmids pCMX, pCMX-Gal4, pCMX-Gal4-RARα, pCMX-RARα, pCMX-VP16-RXRα, pCMX-Gal4-RXRα (LBD), CMX-LacZ, and pMH100-TK-Luc have been described (24Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3807-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). GST-SMRT and GST-ACTR fusion constructs were generated by inserting SMRT and ACTR receptor interaction domain (ID) PCR fragments into the vector pGEX4T-1. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). All of the constructs were verified by double-stranded sequencing to confirm the identity and reading frame. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 7% CO2. For Gal4-RARα, CV-1 cells (60–70% confluence, 48-well plate) were co-transfected with 16.6–66.6 ng of pCMX-Gal4 and pCMX-VP16 (for mammalian two-hybrid assays) fusion constructs, 100 ng of pMH100-TK-Luc, and 100 ng of pCMX-LacZ in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum by theN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate-mediated procedure (7Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). For DR5-TK-Luc (see Fig. 5), the cells were transfected with 0.33 ng of pCMX-RARα, 100 ng of β-RARE-TK-Luc, and pCMX-LacZ. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of pCMX. The CV-1 cells were transferred to charcoal-stripped serum after adding DNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with or without all-trans-retinoic acid. The cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity 36–48 h after transfection. The luciferase activity was normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α strain and affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were eluted by 20 μm glutathione and dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline. RARα and RXRα synthesized in vitro (Promega) were incubated with a32P-labeled probe containing a DR5 element derived from the βRARE promoter containing the sense strand sequence 5′-GGT-AGG-GTT-CAC-CGA-AAG-TTC-ACT-C-3′ with or without 1 μm AT-RA. DNA-protein binding was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C, the purified GST-SMRT or GST-ACTR fusion proteins were added followed by an additional 30 min of incubation. The final reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide (29.2:0.8) nondenaturing gel followed by electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. To determine the residues that are critical for RARα function, we generated mutations on conserved and diverged residues within helices 3 and 4. Fig.1 A shows the nuclear receptor signature motif and the targets for site-specific mutations in this study. Primarily, alanine substitutions were generated and tested for their ability to dimerize with RXRα (Fig. 1 B). The ability of RARα mutants to dimerize with wild-type RXRα was evaluated by mammalian two hybrid (M2H) assays and electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) on a template containing a DR5. M2H assays were conducted using Gal4-RXRα and VP-RARα (LBD) along with a reporter construct (pMH100) containing multiple copies of Gal4-binding sites upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter fused with luciferase gene. Induction of the luciferase activity is an indicative of interaction of the partners. As a control, Gal4-RXRα with VP16 alone only gave a basal activity (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of VP16-RARα, the reporter activity is induced, suggesting an association between RXRα and RARα. In the absence of AT-RA, all of the mutants except F249A and Q257A retain at least 75% of wild-type activity. As expected, the addition of 1 μm AT-RA increased the reporter activity of the wild-type RARα, probably because of the recruitment of co-activators, which further increase transcriptional activation by Gal4-RXRα/RARα. Interestingly, most of the RARα mutants gave lower reporter activity than that of the wild type, indicating that these mutants have lower activation activity. This result suggests that these mutants might be defective in co-activator binding. Although unliganded F249A binds RXRα much less efficiently than wild type, the reporter activity of G4-RXRα/RARα (F249A) increased dramatically upon addition of 1 μm AT-RA. To test the heterodimerization ability of wild-type or mutant RARα with RXRα on DNA, in vitro synthesized RARα and RXRα were mixed with a radiolabeled DNA duplex containing a DR5 element derived from the promoter of βRARE gene. Consistent with M2H assays, F249A and Q257A failed to heterodimerize with RXRα productively on DR5 (data not shown; see below). A likely possibility is that these two mutants failed to form heterodimer efficiently. The ability of the unliganded RARα mutants to bind SMRT was tested by M2H assays. M2H assays were conducted using Gal4-SMRT ID I + II (amino acid 2064–2307 of mouse SMRT, a fragment containing both ID I and II) and VP-RARα (Fig.2 A). Our data indicate that unliganded mutants V240A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A dramatically lost their SMRT binding activity (lanes 3, 6, and8–10). In the presence of 100 nm AT-RA, RARα and SMRT interaction is completely abolished in all cases except mutant K262A (lane 11). We also tested whether these RARα mutants bind SMRT in EMSAs. Using the same SMRT ID I + II fragment used in M2H assays, we constructed pGEX-4T-1-SMRT ID I + II for bacterial expression and subsequently affinity-purified the GST-SMRT ID I + II fusion proteins. In vitro synthesized RARα and RXRα were mixed with a radiolabeled DNA duplex containing a DR5 element derived from the promoter of the human βRARE gene. EMSAs were performed with or without purified GST-SMRT ID I + II (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with M2H assays, RXRα/RARα heterodimers with RARα mutants V240A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A, significantly lost the ability to bind SMRT. The SMRT binding activity of mutants S232A, K244A, G248T, I254A, and K262A is moderately reduced. As with M2H assays, the addition of 100 nm AT-RA completely blocked SMRT ID association with RARα except for mutant K262A (data not shown). These data indicate that the LBD signature motif is critical for co-repressor binding. We also noted that F249A and Q257A failed to heterodimerize with RXRα productively on DNA. This result is consistent with M2H data. A likely possibility is that these two mutants failed to bind DNA because they do not form heterodimers efficiently. We next measured the association between RARα LBD mutants with coreID II (Fig. 2 C) and found that SMRT coreID II domain alone is highly sensitive to mutations within RARα LBD. Three patterns of association were identified. Most of the mutants, with the exception of I254A and K262A, failed to bind SMRT coreID II. In another group, S232A, K244A, and G248A bound ID I + II but not the coreID II alone. Finally, association of coreID II and ID I + II with RARα LBD was abrogated in a third group consisting of V240A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A. Based on these results, we conclude that these residues are critical for co-repressor association and that sequences flanking coreID II may play a role in the association with RARα LBD. Because helices 3 and 4 of TRβ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ have also been shown to be critical for co-activator association (18Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W.

Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar), we tested the interaction between RARα helices 3 and 4 mutants and p160 co-activator proteins. M2H assays were carried out to determine in vivo association of p160 co-activator proteins with RARα using Gal4-ACTR (SRC-1 or GRIP1) ID (receptor interaction domain) and VP16-RARα (LBD). Among the three known p160 family members, RARα bound ACTR/RAC3/PCIP the best, with SRC-1 less well and GRIP1 the least (Fig.3 A), whereas TRβ bound SRC-1 better than ACTR and GRIP1. M2H assays were used to determine in vivo association of ACTR and wild-type or mutant RARα. The data in Fig. 3 B show that the association between ACTR and RARα is severely compromised for mutants V240A, K244A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A. Furthermore, we found that the interactions between ACTR and RARα are ligand concentration-dependent (data not shown; see below). We then tested the effect of RARα mutations on ACTR binding by EMSA. EMSA was conducted as described in Fig. 2 with or without GST-ATCR in the presence of 100 nm AT-RA. We found that GST-ACTR RID was able to supershift DNA-bound wild-type heterodimers RXRα/RARα efficiently. However, ACTR binding activity is dramatically impaired for mutants V240A, K244A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A, indicating the loss of ACTR binding activity of these mutants. The ability of these RARα mutants to regulate transcription was examined by transient transfection assays. Wild-type and RARα mutants were fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain to generate Gal4-RARα expression plasmids. Transient transfection assays were conducted in the presence or absence of 100 nm of AT-RA. In the absence of AT-RA, the degree of transcriptional repression activity of RARα varies among these mutants. Notably, V240A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A lose more than 80% of their repression activity (Fig.4 A). The repression activity correlates with the ability of these mutants to interact with SMRT. Furthermore, the activation activity of mutants K244A, F249A, Q257A, L261A, and K262A was dramatically impaired at 100 nm AT-RA (Fig. 4 B). We noted that liganded V240A, I258A, and L261A bind ACTR less efficiently than the wild-type RARα, but their ligand-dependent transcriptional activation is only partially inhibited. We propose that this observation may reflect the loss of SMRT binding activity by V240A, I258A, and L261A. In addition, although K262A and wild type bound ACTR equally well in the presence of 100 nm, K262A only moderately activated transcription in transient transfection assays. We interpret this to mean that K262A is still associated with co-repressor complexes in the presence of 100 nm AT-RA, as shown in Fig. 2 (see “Discussion”). During our analyses for ligand concentration-dependent association/dissociation of RARα mutants and co-factors, we found that the association/dissociation profile of K262A with co-factors was distinct from those of other helices 3 and 4 mutations. Fig.5 A is an EMSA with wild-type RARα and mutant K262A in the presence of GST-SMRT with or without increasing concentration of AT-RA. Similar to other mutants, K262A acquires reduced SMRT association activity (Fig. 5 A, compared the ratio of SMRT-bound/unbound RARα). We noted that at 1 μm, residue SMRT still remains associated with DNA-bound RXRα/RARα heterodimer. M2H assays were also carried out to determine ligand-dependent dissociation between SMRT and wild-type RARα or K262A (Fig. 5 B). Consistently, M2H assays demonstrated that dissociation between SMRT and K262A requires at least 1 μm AT-RA as opposed to 100 nm for SMRT and wild type RARα. In contrast, heterodimer RXRα/RARα (K262A) binds ACTR in the absence of ligand in vitro (EMSA), indicating a better ACTR binding activity than that of the wild-type RARα (Fig. 5 C). However, in vivo association of K262A with ACTR requires the presence of AT-RA. Although K262A binds to ACTR equally as well as that of wild type at 100 nm AT-RA, K262A binds less tightly than wild type at 1 μm AT-RA in M2H assays (Fig. 5 D). Under the same conditions, F249A can only associate with ACTR in the presence of 1 μm AT-RA. To understand how co-regulator association correlates with the transcriptional activity of K262A, transient transfection assays were employed. Unliganded wild-type Gal4-RARα represses transcription efficiently (Fig. 5 E, lane 5), whereas K262A moderately repressed basal transcription (lane 13). The reduced repression activity is consistent with the reduced SMRT binding activity shown in Fig. 5 (A and B). In the presence of 10 nm AT-RA, wild-type RARα dramatically activated transcription (lane 6, 31.3-fold), whereas K262A only activated transcription 3-fold compared with basal (lane 14). Of note, transcriptional activation by K262A at 1 μm AT-RA was lower than that of the wild type at 10 nm AT-RA (lanes 6 and 16). Surprisingly, F249A strongly activates transcription at 1 μm AT-RA. This result is consistent with the observation that F249A acquires co-activator association at 1 μmAT-RA shown in Fig. 5 D. We further examine the activity of the mutants on a DR5-containing reporter construct (Fig. 5 F). In the presence of AT-RA, the expression of the reporter activity is induced in the absence of exogenous RARα. Presumably, this activity is derived from the endogenous RARs (lanes 2–4). Exogenous expression of the wild-type RARα further induced the expression of the reporter activity (lanes 6–8). Intriguingly, we found that although F249A binds ACTR weaker than the wild-type RARα at 1 μmAT-RA as shown in Fig. 5 D, the transcription activity of F249A is comparable with that of wild-type RARα. Furthermore, at lower AT-RA concentration, expression of K262A resulted in lower reporter activity than that in the absence of AT-RA (lanes 14 and 15 compared with lanes 2 and3), suggesting that K262A inhibits endogenous RAR activity and that K262A functions as a dominant-negative mutant of the wild-type RARα. Site directed mutagenesis was used to dissect the mechanistic links between co-repression, co-activation, and ligand binding. Our results indicate that residues within the receptor signature motif contribute in specific ways to both co-repressor and co-activator binding (Table I and Fig.6). One unusual mutation is K262A, which results in increased co-activator and reduced co-repressor binding but functionally acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This implies an altered co-repressor off rate leading to the suggestion that co-repressor release is dominant to co-activator binding. This in turn implies that the principle role of ligand is to induce co-repressor release, enabling the signature motif to attract the co-activator. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that transcriptional repression and activation are mechanistically linked.Table ISummary of RARα mutant propertiesHeterodimerizationSMRT associationACTR associationRepressionActivationWild type+++++++++++++++S232A++++++++/+++++/+++++/++V240A++++/−+++++/++K244A++++++/−++−G248T+++/+++++/+++++/+++++/+++++F249A+/−−+/−−+/−I254A++++++/++++++++/+++++/++Q257A−−−−−I258A++++/−+/−+++L261A++++/−+/−+/−++K262A++++++/+++++++++/−The results were summarized from M2H assays (co-regulator association) and transient transfection assays (transcriptional activity).

Recent structural studies have demonstrated that helices H7, H9, H10, and H11 of RARα are involved in heterodimerization with RXRα (Ref.26Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar and Fig. 6 A). Our results are consistent with their findings because helices 3 and 4 mutants possessed at least 60% of the heterodimerization activity in M2H assays of the wild-type RARα. The exceptions were F249A and Q257A, which are absolutely conserved within class II nuclear receptor (Fig. 1 A). We also note that both F249A and Q257A fail to bind SMRT. It is possible that the global structure of mutants F249A and Q257A is dramatically disturbed, so that they lose most of the LBD-associated activities. Gln257 is located at the middle of helix 4, and both of its amide groups can donate hydrogen bonds, whereas the carbonyls of Leu252, Thr250, and Phe249 can accept the hydrogen bond (not shown). Phe249 is positioned in the middle of the loop connecting helices H3 and H4. Thus, mutations of either Gln257 to Ala or Phe249 to Ala will abolish these hydrogen bonds and very likely destabilize helices 3 and 4 and the whole structure of the molecule. Both F249A and Q257A mutations create large cavities (Fig. 6, C–E), and as a consequence the protein structure may tend to relax. This could result in significant structural rearrangements, indirectly altering the dimerization interface involving helices H7, H9, H10, and H11. In addition, mutation of Phe249 to Ala would probably result in rotation of the Gln257 side chain as modeled by Swiss-PdbViewer (Fig. 6 E) and also very likely destabilize the loop connecting helices H3 and H4. One might speculate that Phe249 and Gln257 are part of the folding nucleus. Folding nuclei are known to include conserved amino acid residues (29Shakhnovich E. Abkevich V. Ptitsyn O. Nature. 1996; 379: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30Mirny L. Shakhnovich E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Ting K.L. Jernigan R.L. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutation of the residues critical for the formation of the nucleation core could also result in folding defects. However, the exact structural changes caused by Gln257 to Ala as well as Phe249 to Ala mutations have yet to be determined. Although M2H assays indicated that F249A did not interact with RXRα, EMSAs showed that F249A was able to associate with RXRα, albeit with much less affinity than that of wild type. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that RARα LBD was used in M2H assays, whereas full-length RARα was used for the EMSA assays. One possibility is that the RARα DNA-binding domain may contribute to heterodimerization with RXRα on DNA. We have previously shown that SMRT coreID association is highly sensitive to mutations within the LBD of TRβ (16Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). All of the TRβ mutants examined failed to bind SMRT ID. Our data show that most RARα helices 3 and 4 mutants, with the exception of I254A and K262A, failed to bind SMRT coreID II (Fig. 2 C). These results imply the existence of a common co-repressor-interacting surface between the LBD of RARα and TRβ. Intriguingly, we found that some of these mutants, such as S232A, K244A, and G248T, failed to bind coreID II and could still associate with SMRT ID I + II. These data suggest that the sequence flanking coreID II contacts these residues and stabilizes the interaction between SMRT and RARα. However, mutants including V240A, F249A, Q257A, I258A, and L261A failed to bind both SMRT coreID II or SMRT ID I + II. One common characteristic of these residues is that they are highly conserved among nuclear receptors. These data suggested that these conserved residues are absolutely essential for co-repressor interaction. Among all of the mutants analyzed, K262A displays characteristics that are distinct from others. First, K262A binds SMRT more poorly than wild-type RARα both in EMSA and M2H assays. Consistently, Gal4-RARα (K262A) repressed transcription to a lesser extent than the wild-type RARα. Second, K262A did not respond to ligand properly. Dissociation of K262A with SMRT required a high concentration of AT-RA (1 μm). This aberrant ligand responsiveness could be derived from a differential ligand binding affinity of K262A. However, previous studies on RARγ and RXRα suggested that ligand binding, dimerization, and DNA binding of this mutant were not affected (23Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar,27Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, unliganded K262A binds ACTR better than that of wild-type RARα in EMSA assays. Similar to the wild-type RARα, addition of ligand up to 100 nm enhanced the association of K262A with ACTR. However, at 1 μm of AT-RA, the association of K262A with ACTR was only slightly enhanced. These results suggest that Lys262 has a dual function, preventing ligand-independent association of the co-activators and promoting ligand-dependent dissociation of the co-repressors. The distinct co-regulator association profiles of K262A are also reflected in its ability to regulate transcription. In fact, K262A functions as a dominant-negative mutant at low concentrations (<100 nm) of AT-RA (Fig. 5 F, lanes 2, 3,14, and 16). At 1 μm AT-RA, K262A is able to activate transcription, although the level of activation is much lower that that of the wild-type RARα. It is apparent that loss of SMRT binding, as shown in M2H assays and EMSAs, correlates with loss of repression activity by F249A (Fig. 2). A similar observation has been reported for mutant F249R (28Leo C. Yang X. Liu J. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23127-23134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings, this mutant did not activate transcription at 50 nm AT-RA. However, our results indicate that even though ACTR association of F249A is not as strong as that of the wild-type RARα at 1 μm AT-RA (Figs. 3, B and C, and5 D), F249A activated transcription equally well, if not better (Fig. 5, E and F). This is likely due to the fact that F249A does not associate with a co-repressor whose dissociation is a prerequisite for co-activator association and that the overall transcriptional activation activity depends on both the dissociation of co-repressors and association of co-activators. Two additional results suggest that the limiting step for transcriptional activation by RARα is the dissociation of the co-repressor. First, although V240A, I258A, and L261A bind less efficiently to ACTR than the wild-type RARα, the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by these mutants is only partially inhibited. We propose that this observation is largely due to the loss of SMRT binding activity. Second, unliganded K262A binds ACTR better than wild type in EMSAs (Fig. 5 C), but unliganded K262A was unable to activate transcription in transient transfection assays (Fig. 5 E). We interpret this to mean that in M2H assays, K262A is strongly associated with co-repressor complexes in the absence of ligand. Indeed, at 100 nm, K262A still remained associated with SMRT (Fig. 5,A and B) and functioned as a dominant-negative mutant (Fig. 5 F). Although the co-regulator association property is not identical to that of PML-RARα, the transcription activity of K262A is reminiscent of PML-RARα at low concentrations of AT-RA. In summary, we conclude that helices 3 and 4 of the RARα LBD play a critical role in RARα functions and that co-repressor release is a prerequisite for co-activator association and consequently transcriptional activation.

The inhibitor was based on the peptide sequence of a cholecystokinin13–33 analog that yapsin 1 cleaved with an efficiency of 5.2 × 105m−1 s−1 (Olsen, V., Guruprasad, K., Cawley, N. X., Chen, H. C., Blundell, T. L., and Loh, Y. P. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 2768–2777). The apparent K i of Y1 for the inhibition of yapsin 1 was determined to be 64.5 nm, and the mechanism is competitive. Y2 was also developed as an analog of Y1 for coupling to agarose beads. The resulting inhibitor-coupled agarose beads were successfully used to purify yapsin 1 to apparent homogeneity from conditioned medium of a yeast expression system. Utilization of this new reagent greatly facilitates the purification of yapsin 1 and should also enable the identification of new yapsin-like enzymes from mammalian and nonmammalian sources. In this regard, Y1 also efficiently inhibited Sap9p, a secreted aspartyl protease from the human pathogen,Candida albicans, which has specificity for basic residues similar to yapsin 1 and might provide the basis for the prevention or control of its virulence. A single-step purification of Sap9p from conditioned medium was also accomplished with the inhibitor column. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis yielded two sequences indicating that Sap9p is composed of two subunits, designated here as α and β, similar to yapsin 1.

N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis yielded two sequences indicating that Sap9p is composed of two subunits, designated here as α and β, similar to yapsin 1. Yeast aspartyl protease 3 was the third aspartyl protease to be cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Egel-Mitani M. Flygenring H.P. Hansen M.T. Yeast. 1990; 6: 127-137Google Scholar) after saccharopepsin and barrierpepsin. It was cloned based on its ability to partially suppress the pro-α-mating factor processing defect in yeast mutants that lacked the normal processing enzyme, kex2p, a subtilisin-like serine protease (2Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 37: 1075-1089Google Scholar). The ability to correctly process the pro-α-mating factor demonstrated that this new aspartyl protease could cleave a prohormone at paired basic residue cleavage sites. This identified the new enzyme as a unique member of the aspartyl protease family of endoproteases whose specificity for basic residues was in direct contrast to all other aspartyl proteases whose classical specificity for hydrophobic residues was well documented (3Dunn B.M. Jimenez M. Parten B.F. Valler M.J. Rolph C.E. Kay J. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 899-906Google Scholar). Since its discovery, yeast aspartyl protease 3 has been renamed yapsin 1 (4Cawley N.X. Loh Y.P. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London2003Google Scholar) to represent it as the first cloned member of this novel subclass of aspartyl proteases. This subclass currently includes five members, yapsin 1, yapsin 2 (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Google Scholar), and yapsin 3 (6Olsen V. Cawley N.X. Brandt J. Egel-Mitani M. Loh Y.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 407-411Google Scholar) from S. cerevisiae, Sap9p from Candida albicans (7Monod M. Hube B. Hess D. Sanglard D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2731-2737Google Scholar), and the previously described pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme (now named yapsin A) (8Loh Y.P. Cawley N.X. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London2003Google Scholar) from bovine pituitary secretory granules (9Loh Y.P. Parish D.C. Tuteja R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7194-7205Google Scholar). Since the discovery of yapsin 1, a large body of work has emerged describing its nature with respect to its physical and chemical properties and has been comprehensively reviewed in the Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes (4Cawley N.X. Loh Y.P. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London2003Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of action of the enzyme, we have attempted to crystallize yapsin 1 but have been unsuccessful. Although purification of yapsin 1 by classical procedures has been accomplished (10Azaryan A.V. Wong M. Friedman T.C. Cawley N.X. Estivariz F.E. Chen H.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11968-11975Google Scholar, 11Cawley N.X. Olsen V. Zhang C.F. Chen H.C. Tan M. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 584-591Google Scholar), the presence of excessN-linked glycosylation on yapsin 1 interfered with the crystallization process. In addition, the deglycosylated yapsin 1 was unstable. For more traditional aspartyl proteases, inhibitor columns are often used to facilitate purification, and inhibitors are used to stabilize the protease during crystallization. However, pepstatin A, an aspartyl protease-specific inhibitor, is the only compound reported to inhibit yapsin 1 and shows only modest inhibition (K i APP = 0.4 μm (12Cawley N.X. Characterization of Yeast Aspartic Protease 3: A Novel Basic-Residue Specific Prohormone Processing Enzyme.Ph.D. Thesis. Biochemistry Department, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD1995Google Scholar). We therefore undertook to synthesize a more potent inhibitor that could be used to purify yapsin 1 and subsequently stabilize the deglycosylated form of yapsin 1 during crystallization. The development of new, more potent inhibitors for members of the yapsin subclass of aspartyl proteases is also relevant for the treatment of human disease. In this respect, the discovery that one of the secreted aspartyl proteases, Sap9p, of the opportunistic yeast, C. albicans, is a member of the yapsin family (7Monod M. Hube B. Hess D. Sanglard D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2731-2737Google Scholar) renders the use of a specific inhibitor of Sap9p potentially important in the control of its pathogenesis. Materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and employed without further purification unless otherwise stated. Dihydropyranyl resin was purchased from NovaBiochem (San Diego, CA). Anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) 1The abbreviations used are: DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidinone; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pro-Enk, proenkephalin; syn-Enk, syn-enkephalin; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; Sap9p, secreted aspartyl protease 9 andN-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) were purchased from Aldrich. The following solvents were distilled under N2 from specified drying agents: tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether from sodium/benzophenone ketyl and methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) and dichloroethane and pyridine from calcium hydride. For the general solid phase work-up procedure, excess reagent and the reaction solution were filtered away from support-bound material using polypropylene cartridges with 70-μ PE frits (Speed Accessories) attached to Teflon stopcocks. Cartridges and stopcocks were purchased from Applied Separations (Allentown, PA). Immobilized diaminodipropylamine gel and the polystyrene columns (1–5-ml bed volumes) for affinity column chromatography were purchased from Pierce. For a detailed description of the chemical reactions and compound characterization see the supplemental data. Compound 1 shown in the scheme in Fig. 1 is referred to as the inhibitor Y1. Compound 2, an analog ofY1 used for coupling to agarose beads, is shown in the scheme in Fig. 2 and is referred to as the inhibitor Y2.Figure 2Scheme of the synthesis of inhibitor-coupled agarose beads.

This substrate was previously developed (13Angliker H. Neumann U. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 409-412Google Scholar) as a substrate for furin, a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (14Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Takahashi S. Takada K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16094-16099Google Scholar); however, the Lys-Arg motif within this substrate is a well characterized yapsin 1 cleavage site (15Cawley N.X. Chen H.-C. Beinfeld M.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4168-4176Google Scholar). We first determined theK m and V max of yapsin 1 for this substrate as follows. Yapsin 1 was purified from a yeast expression system as described previously (11Cawley N.X. Olsen V. Zhang C.F. Chen H.C. Tan M. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 584-591Google Scholar). Purified yapsin 1 (∼7 nm; ∼37 ng) was incubated with 5–40 μm of the substrate at 37 °C in 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. 15-μl aliquots were removed at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min and added to 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to stop the enzymatic reaction. The samples were kept on ice until assayed for fluorescence in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 luminescence spectrometer (emission, 320 nm; excitation, 425 nm). A nonlinear regression fit to each time course allowed the calculation of the initial rate of enzymatic activity at each substrate concentration and a Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/V o versus1/[S] was generated to determine K m andV max. These experiments were performed three times. Preliminary experiments that included “recovery of activity” (16Bakker A.V. Jung S. Spencer R.W. Vinick F.J. Faraci W.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 559-562Google Scholar) and Lineweaver-Burk plots (data not shown) indicated that Y1was a reversible competitive inhibitor of yapsin 1. To determine theK i, purified yapsin 1 (∼7 nm) was incubated with dilutions of Y1 (ranging from 250 to 15.6 nm) in 98 μl 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, for 20 min at room temperature. 2 μl of 0.5 mm substrate (final substrate concentration, 10 μm) were then added, and the reactions were allowed to continue for 10 min at 37 °C. 15 μl were then assayed for fluorescence as described above. This experiment was performed three times. A Dixon plot of 1/V o versus [I] was generated from which K i was calculated using the derivation of the Lineweaver-Burk equation for competitive inhibition and theK m and V max parameters determined in the previous experiment. Inhibitor Y2 was prepared from support-bound tosylate 11 (Fig. 1) (100 mg, 48.8 μmol, 0.488 mmol/g) according to the solid phase synthesis methods to prepare inhibitor Y1 up through coupling Fmoc-Val (see the supplemental data). At this stage Fmoc-Arg (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl) was coupled using 0.3m Fmoc-Arg (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl), 0.3 mPyBOP, 0.3 m HOAt, and 0.9 m iPr2EtN in NMP with shaking overnight. The resin was washed with NMP (four times), tetrahydrofuran (twice), CH2Cl2 (three times), and ether (three times), and then the resin was treated with 20% piperidine in NMP solution for 30 min. The resin was then treated with 0.3 m4-carboxybenzaldehyde, 0.3 m PyBOP, 0.3 m HOAt, and 0.9 m iPr2EtN in NMP with shaking overnight. Inhibitor Y2 was cleaved from the solid support using 95:5 trifluoroacetic acid/H2O for 30 min followed by rinses with 95:5 trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (once) and CH2Cl2 (twice) and then concentration under reduced pressure. The mixture was purified by reverse phase HPLC as described for inhibitor Y1 (see the supplemental data), and the mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry. HPLC purification provided 17.6 mg (16.1 μmol) of inhibitorY2 (Fig. 2). High resolution mass spectrometry (fast atom bombardment) calculated for [M]+(C50H89N15O10S) was 1092.672650, and found was 1092.671582. Diaminodipropylamine gel (2 ml, ∼40 μmol) was packed into a 5-ml polystyrene column. The gel was allowed to settle for 30 min, and then the gel was equilibrated and drained with 5 column volumes of conjugation buffer. To the gel was added 2-[(N-fluorenemethyloxycarbonyl) aminooxy] acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide 15 (Fig. 2) (162 mg, 0.40mmol) in DMF (2.0 ml) and pH 4.7 buffer (100 μl). Mixing was then carried out by rotating the suspension at room temperature for 12 h. The gel was then washed with DMF (three times). The loading level of the gel was determined by Fmoc quantitation (gel total, 33.4 μmol, 0.0309 mequiv/g, 84% loading efficiency based on a 20 μequiv/ml loading level of diaminodipropylamine gel). The gel was treated with 20% piperidine in NMP for 3 h and then was washed with DMF (three times). To the resulting gel 16 (Fig. 2) was added inhibitorY2 (Fig. 2) (12.1 mg, 11.1 μmol) in a solution of DMF (1.0 ml) and pH 4.7 buffer (100 μl). Mixing was then carried out by rotating the suspension at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting inhibitor coupled agarose beads (Fig. 2, compound3) were then washed with DMF (three times) and pH 4.7 buffer (three times). The inhibitor-coupled agarose beads (Fig. 2, compound3) were equilibrated with equilibration buffer (0.1m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0). A C-terminally truncated form of yapsin 1, lacking its GPI membrane anchor, described previously (17Cawley N.X. Wong M. Pu L.-P. Tam W. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Google Scholar), was overexpressed and secreted into the culture medium from a yeast strain engineered to express this form of the enzyme. The culture supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 mTris/Cl and concentrated by batch application to DEAE-Sepharose beads. After washing, the bound protein was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl and aliquoted. A 0.9-ml aliquot of the concentrated medium enriched in yapsin 1 was adjusted to 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, and applied to the inhibitor column. After collecting the flow through, the column was washed with 6 × 0.9 ml of equilibration buffer followed by 6 × 0.9 ml of equilibration buffer containing 0.5m NaCl. The yapsin 1 was eluted with 9 × 0.9 ml of 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.5, containing 2 m LiBr. Yapsin 1 immunoreactivity was assayed by Western blot analysis. 10 μl of each sample were fractionated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–12% NuPAGE gels under reducing conditions using MES as running buffer (Invitrogen). After transferring the protein to nitrocellulose, the blots were probed with yapsin 1 antiserum MW283 (17Cawley N.X. Wong M. Pu L.-P. Tam W. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Google Scholar) at 1:10,000, and the signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Yapsin 1 enzymatic activity was assayed by incubating 1 μl of each fraction from the purification procedure with 25 μg of rat proenkephalin (pro-Enk) (5 mg/ml), purified as described previously (18Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 94-108Google Scholar), in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, for 12 h. The reaction volume was 100 μl. Yapsin 1 cleaves rat pro-Enk efficiently to release its N terminus, syn-enkephalin-Lys (pro- Enk1–74). 2N. X. Cawley, unpublished data. 20 μl of each reaction was analyzed by colloidal Coomassie Blue staining after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–12% NuPAGE gels under reducing conditions using MES as running buffer. Fractions containing pro-Enk cleaving activity and yapsin 1 immunoreactivity were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation through 30-kDa Filtron Nanosep membranes. An aliquot of the final sample (∼200 ng) was deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H as described previously (17Cawley N.X. Wong M. Pu L.-P. Tam W. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blot analysis and silver staining. 10 μg of the starting material was also analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Specific activity measurements were carried out on the starting material and on the final purified yapsin 1 using the quenched fluorescent substrate. Briefly, yapsin 1 enzymatic activity was assayed by incubating 2 μl from both samples with 10 μm of the quenched fluorescent substrate in 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, for 20min at 37 °C. 900 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were added to the reaction, and the fluorescence was determined as described above. The units of fluorescence were then corrected to units/μg/min. A C-terminally truncated form of secreted aspartyl protease 9 (Sap9p), lacking its GPI membrane anchor, was expressed in aPichia pastoris expression system. Sap9p was expressed and secreted into the culture medium after induction, and the culture supernatant was concentrated by centrifugation filtration through 30-kDa Filtron Macrosep membranes. The presence of Sap9p in the induced preparation was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of an induced protein of the expected size after SDS-PAGE and by the ability of the induced preparation alone to cleave adrenocorticotropin hormone1–39 with identical specificity to that of yapsin 1.2 To test the inhibitor against Sap9p, we used purified rat pro-Enk as a substrate. Aliquots of the conditioned medium containing Sap9p were preincubated with Y1 (1–100 μm) in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. for 20 min at room temperature, after which 25 μg of purified rat pro-Enk was added, and the reaction continued for 12 h at 37 °C. The reaction volume was 100 μl. The controls included omission of enzyme, omission of inhibitor, or addition of 2.5 mm pepstatin A, a specific inhibitor of aspartyl proteases. After incubation, 20 μl of each reaction was analyzed by colloidal Coomassie Blue staining after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–12% NuPAGE gels under reducing conditions using MES as running buffer (Invitrogen). 10 ml of conditioned medium containing Sap9p was adjusted to pH 4.0 with 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min to remove particulate matter, and the supernatant was applied to the inhibitor column (Fig. 2, compound 3). The flow through fraction was reapplied twice before continuing with the purification procedure exactly as described for the purification of yapsin 1. 1-μl aliquots from each fraction were assayed for pro-Enk processing activity. Fractions E2 and E3 were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation filtration through 30-kDa Nanosep filters, and an aliquot of the final sample was analyzed by Coomassie Blue. In addition, 5 μg of purified Sap9p were run on a denaturing 4–12% NuPAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and subjected to Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 470A protein sequencer with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. The inhibitor Y1 (Fig. 1,compound 1) was identified upon the preparation and screening of a focused library of 45 compounds based upon a known yapsin 1 substrate, RVSMIKNR. The key design feature was to replace the Lys-Asn dipeptide in the peptide substrate with the stable hydroxyethylamine peptide isostere incorporating a lysine side chain at the P1 position. The hydroxyethylamine isostere has been extensively used for the inhibition of the HIV-1 protease with several marketed AIDS drugs based upon this template. However, these isosteres incorporate hydrophobic side chains at the P1 position, and to our knowledge, the incorporation of basic side chains at the P1 position has not previously been reported. The preparation of Y1 is shown in Fig. 1 as compound1. Asymmetric Sharpless epoxidation of allylic alcohol4 (19Fernandez-Garcia C. McKervey M.A. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1995; 6: 2905-2906Google Scholar) provides epoxy alcohol 5 in 73% yield with >95% enantiomeric purity as measured by 1The abbreviations used are: DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidinone; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pro-Enk, proenkephalin; syn-Enk, syn-enkephalin; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; Sap9p, secreted aspartyl protease 9H NMR of the corresponding Mosher ester. Benzoyloxy diol 6 was then prepared by treating epoxy alcohol 5 with (i-PrO)2Ti(OBz)2. Acetalization with 2,2-dimethoxy propane andp-toluenesulfonic acid was followed by exchange of the phthalimide group for the Boc group under standard conditions to provide alcohol 7. Treatment of alcohol 7 with toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine provided the tosylate8. Azide displacement was followed by removal of the isopropylidene group to provide diol 9. Selective tosylation of the primary alcohol with toluenesulfonyl choride in pyridine provided intermediate 10 for loading onto the solid support. Intermediate 10 was then attached to the support using commercially available dihydropyranyl substituted resin (20Thompson L.A. Ellman A. Jonathan Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 9333-9336Google Scholar) to provide support-bound inhibitor 11. The synthesis of Y1was then performed according to previously developed solid phase synthesis methods (21Kick E.K. Ellman J.A. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1427-1430Google Scholar). Displacement of the primary tosylate with butylamine was followed by acylation of the amine with α-N-Boc-Arg to provide supported intermediate12. Reduction of the azide with SnCl2, PhSH, and Et3N provided amine 13, which was then coupled with N-Fmoc-Ile, N-Fmoc-Met,N-Fmoc-O-t-Bu-Ser, N-Fmoc-Val, andN-Boc-Arg using standard peptide synthesis methods to provide the support-bound inhibitor 14. Removal from support with concomitant side chain deprotection was accomplished by treatment with 95:5 trifluoroacetic acid/H2O to provideY1. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/V o versus 1/[S] yielded a straight line with the following equation, y = 0.87x + 0.036, r 2 = 0.98 (Fig.3 A). From this equation, theK m was calculated as 24.2 μm, andV max was calculated as 27.8 fluorescent units/min (or 751 units/μg/min). In the presence of Y1, yapsin 1 activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, and when plotted in the form of a Dixon plot, 1/V o versus [I], a straight line was obtained with the following equation, y = 0.0014x + 0.1274, r 2 = 0.99 (Fig.3 B). From the derivation of the Dixon plot, competitive inhibition predicts that y = 1/V max(1 + K m/[S]) = 0.123, when x = 0. Our data therefore fits well with that of a competitive inhibitor because y = 0.1274 whenx = 0. Also from the equation for competitive inhibition, when y = 0, x = −K i(1 + [S]/K m), from whichK i calculates as 64.5 nm. To prepare the affinity column for yapsin purification, the diaminodipropylamine (diaminodipropylamine) form of Sephadex was coupled with active ester15. Removal of the Fmoc group then provides the alkoxylamine derivatized agarose beads 16, which was then covalently linked to inhibitor Y2 by oxime bond formation (Fig. 2). Yapsin 1 was expressed and secreted into the culture medium of a yeast expression system, which has been described previously (11Cawley N.X. Olsen V. Zhang C.F. Chen H.C. Tan M. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 584-591Google Scholar, 17Cawley N.X. Wong M. Pu L.-P. Tam W. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Google Scholar). After concentration of the medium by anion exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sepharose beads, the sample was applied to the inhibitor column. All of the yapsin 1 that was present in the starting material (Fig.4 A, lane S) bound to the column as evidenced by the absence of any immunoreactive yapsin 1 in the flow through fraction (Fig. 4 A, lane FT) or any of the wash fractions. The yapsin 1 remained bound even during the stringent second wash containing 0.5 m NaCl (Fig.4 A, 2nd wash). The yapsin 1 was eluted from the inhibitor column by changing the pH from 4.0 to 8.5 and by including 2m LiBr in the eluant (Fig. 4 A, elution 1–9). Consistent with the elution profile of immunoreactive yapsin 1, yapsin 1 enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the eluate as seen by the generation of syn-Enk from pro-Enk (Fig. 4 B,elution 1–9). Note that in the absence of immunoreactive yapsin 1 in the flow through and first three wash fractions, pro-Enk was presumably degraded by other proteases present in the culture supernatant that did not bind to the column. Fractions 2–9 of the eluate were combined and concentrated. By Western blot analysis, the purified yapsin 1 gave two bands at ∼90 and 120–150 kDa, corresponding to glycosylated yapsin 1 (17Cawley N.X. Wong M. Pu L.-P. Tam W. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Google Scholar) (Fig.5 B, lane −). Upon deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H treatment, a single immunoreactive anti-yapsin 1 band is seen by Western blot (Fig. 5 B,lane +), and only one band is apparent by silver stain analysis (Fig. 5 C, lane +), indicating that the purity of the enzyme approached homogeneity. An aliquot of the starting material (∼10 μg) was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining in which yapsin 1 can be seen in addition to other proteins (Fig. 5 A,lane S). Using the quenched fluorescent substrate, specific activity assays for the starting material and the purified yapsin 1 yielded 95 and 752 units/μg/min, respectively, indicating a fold purification of ∼8. Sap9p was expressed and secreted into the culture medium of a P. pastoris expression system. Coomassie Blue staining (not shown) confirmed the presence of Sap9p in the induced medium and its absence in the uninduced medium, whereas activity assays using adrenocorticotropin hormone1–39 as a substrate confirmed that Sap9p can cleave at basic residue cleavage sites.2 Sap9p was shown here to process the prohormone, pro-Enk, to generate syn-Enk (Fig. 6,lane 1). This activity was inhibited by pepstatin A (Fig. 6,lane 5) as well as by Y1 in a dose-dependent manner. At 100 μm ofY1, almost complete inhibition of the Sap9p activity was observed (Fig. 6, lane 2), whereas at 10 μm, ∼50% inhibition was observed (Fig. 6, lane 3), and at 1 μm almost no inhibition was observed (Fig. 6, lane 4). Sap9p was purified from the conditioned medium of a P. pastorisexpression system. The enzyme specifically eluted from the column in fractions E2 and E3, as measured by the disappearance of pro-Enk substrate and the generation of syn-Enk product in the assay of these fractions (Fig. 7). The smaller band of syn-Enk observed in E2 is consistent with syn-Enk (1–74),i.e. syn-Enk-Lys, and the slightly bigger product band in E3 is consistent with a Met-enkephalin extended form of syn-Enk, syn-Enk (1–82), i.e.syn-Enk-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Lys-Arg 82. Products with similar mobility on SDS-PAGE were generated by purified yapsin 1 and identified by mass spectroscopy as syn-Enk (1–74) and syn-Enk (1–82).2 Coomassie stain analysis of the concentrated eluted Sap9p showed two major bands (Fig.8): one band at an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa and one band at an apparent molecular mass of ∼5 kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the upper band gave the following sequence beginning with Leu154, L-F-G-F-G-X-I-Y. The lower band gave the following sequence starting with Asp51, D-G-S-L-D-M-T-L-T-N-K-Q-T-F-Y. This demonstrated that Sap9p exists as a heterodimer and confirms the predicted pro-region processing site as Lys49-Arg50. The site where cleavage occurs to generate the two subunits in Sap9p is equivalent to the position where yapsin 1 is cleaved to generate its two subunits. However, because of the apparent size of the smaller band (∼5 kDa), it is likely that additional processing has occurred on its carboxyl end to generate a protein of this size instead of one of the expected size, ∼10 kDa (amino acids 51–153). We propose to call the Sap9p subunits α and β, in keeping with the similar nomenclature used for yapsin 1.Figure 8Analysis of purified of Sap9p. Fractions from the purification procedure of Sap9p described in the legend to Fig. 7 were pooled and concentrated, and an aliquot was analyzed by Coomassie Blue under denaturing/reducing conditions. Two bands stained strongly, both of which were identified as Sap9p related by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The upper band described here as the β-subunit started with Leu154 of Sap9p and has an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa. The lower band described as the α-subunit started with Asp51 of Sap9p and has an apparent molecular mass of 5 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Yapsin 1 is the model enzyme for the new subclass of aspartyl proteases tha"

The NF2 gene is mutated in patients affected by neurofibromatosis type 2, a syndrome associated with multiple tumors of the nervous system. Here we found that Sch, when its N-terminal FERM domain was misfolded by the pathogenetic mutation ΔF118, formed aggresomes, i.e.aggregates that cluster at the centrosome as a result of microtubule-dependent transport. Strikingly the related protein ezrin affected by the same mutation did not form aggresomes even though its FERM domain was similarly misfolded. By studying ezrin/Sch chimeras, we delineated a sequence of 61 amino acids in the C terminus of Sch that determined the formation of aggresomes. Aggresome formation by these chimeras was independent from their rate of degradation. Sch535–595 was sufficient to induce aggresomes of a green fluorescent fusion protein in vivoand aggregates of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that aggresome formation is controlled primarily by aggresome determinants, which are distinct from degradation determinants, or from misfolding, through which aggresome determinants might be exposed.

Neurofibromatosis 2 is an inherited disorder that predisposes the patient to the development of nervous system tumors such as schwannomas and meningiomas. The NF2 tumor suppressor gene responsible for this syndrome has been identified by positional cloning (1Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. MacCollin M. Jacoby L.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1423: 29-36Google Scholar). TheNF2 gene is also implicated in sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas as well as in mesotheliomas induced by asbestos. The product of the NF2 gene, schwannomin (Sch), 1The abbreviations used are: Sch, schwannomin; ERM, ezrin-radixin-moesin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; Ab, antibody; pAb, polyclonal Ab; mAb, monoclonal Ab; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid also known as merlin, is highly related to ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins (2Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Google Scholar). These proteins are about 600 amino acids long. They display a globular N-terminal domain of about 300 amino acids called the FERM domain. The highest homology between schwannomin and ERM proteins is in their FERM domain (63% identity). ERM proteins have a well established role as linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. Sch is a regulator of cell growth and a mediator of contact inhibition, probably through its ability to organize or sense the attachment of actin to the plasma membrane (3Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 104-109Google Scholar, 4Morrison H. Sherman L.S. Legg J. Banine F. Isacke C. Haipek C.A. Gutmann D.H. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Google Scholar). For both Sch and ERM proteins, the FERM domain is responsible for their localization at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (6Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Google Scholar, 7Deguen B. Merel P. Goutebroze L. Giovannini M. Reggio H. Arpin M. Thomas G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 217-226Google Scholar). The FERM domain interacts with membrane proteins and with filamentous actin (3Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 104-109Google Scholar, 8Brault E. Gautreau A. Lamarine M. Callebaut I. Thomas G. Goutebroze L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1901-1912Google Scholar). The crystal structures of FERM domains from ERM proteins and Sch have confirmed that they display a similar overall structure (9Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Google Scholar,10Shimizu T. Seto A. Maita N. Hamada K. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10332-10336Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of these molecules is not well conserved, except in the last 100 amino acids of the tail, which contains a FERM binding site (11Nguyen R. Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7621-7629Google Scholar). ERM proteins contain in addition a filamentous actin binding site in the tail. The interaction between the FERM domain and the tail occurs intramolecularly or intermolecularly, giving rise to closed monomers or oligomers, respectively (2Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Google Scholar). Oligomers also form between ERM proteins and Sch (12Gronholm M. Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904Google Scholar). The interaction between the FERM domain and the tail masks important functional sites for membrane partners and actin binding. The activation of Sch and ERM proteins, thus, involves a conformational change unmasking these sites. Here we studied the effect of a pathogenetic mutation in the FERM domain of schwannomin, SchΔF118. The deletion of the phenylalanine 118 codon has been described in two unrelated families affected by neurofibromatosis type 2 as well as in a sporadic meningioma (see references in Ref. 13Deguen B. Goutebroze L. Giovannini M. Boisson C. van der Neut R. Jaurand M.C. Thomas G. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 554-560Google Scholar). We recently found that the ΔF mutation impairs the proper folding of Sch FERM domain (8Brault E. Gautreau A. Lamarine M. Callebaut I. Thomas G. Goutebroze L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1901-1912Google Scholar). Because the phenylalanine affected by this deletion is conserved in ERM proteins, we introduced the equivalent ΔF102 deletion into ezrin. Strikingly, SchΔF, but not ezrinΔF, formed aggresomes upon transient transfection. We mapped the principal determinant of this behavior with ezrin/Sch chimeras. LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The following drugs were used at the indicated final concentration: nocodazole (10 μg/ml, Sigma), MG132 (50 μm, Calbiochem), clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (50 μm, Calbiochem), cycloheximide (10 μm, Sigma). The following antibodies were used: VSV G pAb (1 μg/ml), P5D4 VSV G mAb (1:2000), 20 S proteasome pAb (1:1000, Affiniti Research Products), GTU-88 γ-tubulin mAb (1:1000; Sigma), 7A3 vimentin mAb (1:100, gift of C. Maison, Institut Curie, Paris), N356 α-tubulin mAb (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences), GFP pAb (Clontech). The indicated concentrations were used for immunofluorescence. For immunoblotting, 1 μg/ml of primary antibodies was used. Ezrin/Sch chimeras were designed according to a multiple alignment of ERM members andNF2 gene products from Homo sapiens,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster to preserve the overall structure of this family of proteins. These ezrin/Sch chimeras were derived from the previously described EzrΔF and SchΔF constructs in pCB6 (7Deguen B. Merel P. Goutebroze L. Giovannini M. Reggio H. Arpin M. Thomas G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 217-226Google Scholar, 14Gautreau A. Manent J. Fiévet B. Louvard D. Giovannini M. Arpin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31279-31282Google Scholar) and contained at their C terminus the VSV G tag. Briefly, chimeras were obtained as described in Table Ieither by PCR amplification of one cDNA fragment bringing a restriction site for the insertion into the other cDNA or by PCR-mediated recombination in which the fusion of the two cDNAs is obtained during PCR with two primers overlapping by 20 nucleotides. GFP fusion proteins were constructed in pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Sch340–595 was inserted as a XhoI-EcoRI fragment. Sch535–595, Sch544–595, Sch535–580 were PCR-amplified and inserted asXhoI-BamHI fragments at the C terminus of GFP. GST fusion proteins were constructed in a modified pGEX 4T2 (AmershamBiosciences) in which the NotI site had been converted into an XbaI site. Untagged Sch340–595 was inserted as a XhoI-XbaI fragment. Sch535–595and Sch544–595 were excised as aBglII-BamHI fragments from the corresponding GFP plasmids and inserted into the BamHI site of pGEX 4T2. PCR-amplified fragments were fully sequenced to ensure that no unwanted mutations were introduced. pCW7-expressing Myc-tagged ubiquitin was previously described (15Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were analyzed 20 h after transfection. Nocodazole was applied for 15 h, 5 h after replating transfected cells. Pools of stable transfectants were selected by 2–3 weeks of culture in medium containing 0.7 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Pools of stable LLC-PK1 transfectants were passaged in 6-cm dishes so as to reach confluency the next morning. Metabolic labeling was achieved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without Met and Cys complemented with 250 μCi/ml 35S-labeled Met and Cys from Redivue Promix (Amersham Biosciences). For the chymotrypsin digestion experiment, cells were labeled for 1 h. For pulse-chase, cells were labeled for 15 min and chased in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, signals were quantified using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Only experiments where an exponential decay regression (y = ae −bx, where y is the percent of the t = 0 signal, and x is time in hours, calculated with Excel) giving a correlation coefficientR 2 > 0.95 were taken into account to calculate the half-life according to the formula t 12 = (ln 50 − ln a)/−b. This procedure gave less than 10% variation between experiments. To prepare total cellular lysates, cells were rinsed once with cold PBS, extracted with 100 μl of boiling 1× SDS loading buffer, and scraped. The lysates were then sonicated. For immunoprecipitations, cells were extracted with 1 ml of cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma) for 2 min at 4 °C. The extracts were then clarified in a microcentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Denatured lysates were obtained by adding 500 μl of boiling 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, pH 7.4, and scraping. The lysates were boiled for 2 min. RIPA was then reconstituted with 4.5 ml of cold 54.4 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 11 mmEDTA, 1.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.56% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. For immunoprecipitations from LLC-PK1 stable transfectants, lysates were incubated with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) and 2 μg VSV G pAb for 2 h (or overnight for volumes larger than 1 ml). Beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 2 min in 20 μl of 1.5× SDS loading buffer. For chymotryptic digestion, after 3 RIPA washes, beads were washed with 1 ml of digestion buffer (20 mm MES, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.7) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. Then, beads were incubated in 10 μl of digestion buffer with or without 0.1 μg of chymotrypsin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 3× SDS loading buffer and boiling for 2 min. The 35S signal was enhanced by incubating the gels in 1m salicylate for 20 min. Dried gels were exposed to films at −80 °C or to a phospho-screen from 1 day to 1 week. Cells on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, and rinsed twice with PBS and then once with PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were incubated in PBS/bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, once with PBS/bovine serum albumin, and then incubated for 20 min with appropriate Alexa488-conjugated or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ab (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml, Sigma). The GFP signals were also obtained after methanol fixation. After 4 washes in PBS, cells were mounted in Mowiol and photographed using a Leica microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) or a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope. Cells on coverslips were fixed in 80 mm cacodylate, 0.05% CaCl2, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4, for 1 h. After several washes in water, post-fixation was performed with 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanate in water for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed several times in water and then en bloc-stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 40% ethanol for 30 min. Dehydration was then achieved in a series of ethanol baths, and the coverslips were processed for flat embedding in Epon 812 resin (Taab Cie). Ultrathin sections were made using a Reichert Ultracut-FCS ultramicrotome (Leica). Sections were contrasted with ethanolic uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate solution before visualization at 80 kV in a Philips CM120 electron microscope. Precipitated GST proteins were diluted in PBS. A 10-μl sample was applied to carbon-coated grids and allowed to adsorb for a few minutes. The grids were washed four times with water. Grids were subsequently stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water for 2 min, rinsed once with water, air-dried, and viewed in the electron microscope. To compare the effects of the ΔF deletion on the tumor suppressor gene product and a related ERM protein, we transiently transfected ezrinΔF and SchΔF in LLC-PK1 cells. The two proteins were tagged at their C terminus with a VSV G epitope so we examined their localization by VSV G immunofluorescence. The localizations of SchΔF and ezrinΔF were drastically different even though their level of expression was similar (see below). In the majority of transfected cells, SchΔF accumulated in a juxtanuclear area, whereas ezrinΔF was diffusely distributed in the cytosol (Fig.1, a and b). The juxtanuclear accumulation of mutant Sch has been already noticed with other mutations of the FERM domain (7Deguen B. Merel P. Goutebroze L. Giovannini M. Reggio H. Arpin M. Thomas G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 217-226Google Scholar, 17Koga H. Araki N. Takeshima H. Nishi T. Hirota T. Kimura Y. Nakao M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 801-810Google Scholar). The two localizations of SchΔF and ezrinΔF were both clearly different from those of wild type ezrin and Sch, which are found at the plasma membrane (data not shown (18Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Google Scholar, 19Maeda M. Matsui T. Imamura M. Tsukita S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4788-4797Google Scholar)). The juxtanuclear accumulation of SchΔF was reminiscent of a recently described structure called the aggresome (20Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). The aggresome is a structure composed of clustered aggregates of misfolded proteins, when such proteins have been overexpressed or their degradation has been inhibited. Aggregates of SchΔF fulfilled the criteria of aggresomes as follows. (i) Aggregates of SchΔF accumulated at the centrosome, as revealed by γ-tubulin staining (Fig. 1 c). Furthermore, in some cells containing SchΔF aggregates, γ-tubulin staining of the centrosome was absent (data not shown), suggesting that the accumulation of misfolded material can impede access of γ-tubulin antibodies to the centrosome. (ii) The accumulation of SchΔF at the centrosome was dependent on the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Fig. 1, d and e). Most SchΔF-transfected cells formed aggresomes in control conditions, but only a few did in the presence of nocodazole, which depolymerizes microtubules. Dispersed aggregates of SchΔF were observed throughout the cytosol of nocodazole-treated cells. (iii) A cage-like structure of vimentin filaments surrounded the SchΔF aggresome (Fig.1 f). Aggresome-forming proteins are usually short-lived proteins. In line with this observation, we recently observed that mutant forms of Sch are efficiently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (14Gautreau A. Manent J. Fiévet B. Louvard D. Giovannini M. Arpin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31279-31282Google Scholar). Here we found that the SchΔF aggresome was composed of ubiquitinylated material, since it was stained with Myc antibodies when Myc-tagged ubiquitin was cotransfected with SchΔF (Fig. 1, g–i). Moreover, proteasomes, which are normally diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, were recruited to the aggresome (Fig. 1,j–l). Another pathogenetic mutant of Sch with a misfolded FERM domain, SchΔ39–121, formed similar aggresomes (data not shown). Aggresome formation by SchΔF, but not by ezrinΔF, was observed in many cell lines (HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary, NIH3T3, Cos7, A431, A549, CV1, baby hamster kidney cells, OK, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; data not shown). These results emphasize that in transient transfections aggresome formation is a robust behavior specific to mutant Sch when compared with mutant ezrin. To examine the ultrastructure of SchΔF aggresomes, we performed transmission electron microscopy. When SchΔF or ezrinΔF transiently transfected LLC-PK1 cells were examined, amorphous electron dense structures were found only in SchΔF-expressing cells (Fig.2). These structures, which were found in the vicinity of the nucleus and Golgi vesicles, were not enclosed by membranes, indicating that they indeed corresponded to aggregates. These aggregates of several hundreds of nm in size were presumably very dense since their periphery was stained more intensely with heavy metal salts than their center. The concentration of intermediate filaments around the aggregates at the ultrastructural level supported the reorganization of vimentin seen by immunofluorescence. Because aggresome formation is thought to be a general response to misfolded proteins, we reasoned that perhaps ezrin was not misfolded by the ΔF mutation. This would be surprising given that the crystallographic structures of the FERM domain of ERM proteins and Sch have revealed a very similar organization (9Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Google Scholar, 10Shimizu T. Seto A. Maita N. Hamada K. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10332-10336Google Scholar). We assessed experimentally the global folding of the FERM domain with chymotrypsin because the FERM domain of both ezrin and Sch is known to resist chymotryptic digestion (8Brault E. Gautreau A. Lamarine M. Callebaut I. Thomas G. Goutebroze L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1901-1912Google Scholar, 21Franck Z. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 219-231Google Scholar). For this purpose, we transfected LLC-PK1 cells with cDNAs encoding wild type or ΔF schwannomin or ezrin. Pools of stable transfectants were derived. In these stable transfectants, both mutant proteins were diffusely localized and soluble in RIPA buffer (data not shown). The 35S-labeled exogenous proteins were immunoprecipitated through the VSV G epitope, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were submitted to chymotrypsin. With both wild type ezrin and Sch a series of proteolytically resistant fragments were detected down to about 35 kDa, which is the molecular mass of the FERM domain (Fig. 3). In contrast, ezrinΔF and SchΔF were no longer resistant to chymotrypsin. Thus, the ΔF mutation impairs the proper folding of the FERM domain in both ezrin and Sch. To explain the different behaviors of ezrinΔF and SchΔF, we assumed there was a sequence determining aggresome formation. To identify this determinant, we constructed chimeras between ezrinΔF and SchΔF. We first swapped the misfolded FERM domains of ezrinΔF and SchΔF, giving rise to the chimeras SE and ES1 (Fig. 4). The two chimeras were able to form aggresomes, suggesting that there are at least two determinants in the Sch sequence. However, aggresomes formed by SE were smaller and looser than the ones formed by ES1. This indicated that the main determinant of aggresome formation by SchΔF was not the misfolded FERM domain but, rather, the C-terminal half of the molecule. Therefore, we focused on the C-terminal aggresome determinant. The chimera ES3 (Sch535–595) as well as the chimera ES2 (Sch444–595) formed aggresomes. Thus, the 61 amino acid sequence Sch535–595 contains the major C-terminal aggresome determinant. A further N-terminal deletion of this sequence by 26 amino acids in the chimera ES4 (Sch561–595) or by only 9 amino acids in the chimera ES5 (Sch544–595) abrogated its ability to induce aggresomes. The C terminus of ERM proteins and Sch contains a sequence that is able to bind to the FERM domain of both types of proteins. A second isoform of Sch with an alternatively spliced exon has a different C terminus that is unable to bind to the FERM domain (11Nguyen R. Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7621-7629Google Scholar, 22Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Google Scholar, 23Gutmann D.H. Haipek C.A. Lu K.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 706-716Google Scholar). We constructed a chimera ES3iso2 in which the Sch sequence starts at position 535 and ends with this alternate C terminus (580–590). ES3iso2 also formed aggresomes, suggesting that aggresome formation is independent from the ability of Sch C-terminal sequence to bind to the FERM domain. We next sought to examine the expression of these misfolded chimeras. We immunoprecipitated through the VSV G epitope the transfected proteins from denatured extracts to solubilize the aggregated material (see “Materials and Methods”). By VSV G immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates, we could detect all chimeras at their expected size or at a slightly higher size when they contained the stretch of 7 prolines of ezrin (amino-acids 469–475; Fig. 4 C). We noticed a ladder of conjugates of SchΔF, ES1, ES2, and to a smaller extent of ES3, ES3iso2, and SE. This ladder is likely due to ubiquitination, since SchΔF is efficiently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (14Gautreau A. Manent J. Fiévet B. Louvard D. Giovannini M. Arpin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31279-31282Google Scholar). These conjugates were at the limit of detection with ezrinΔF, ES4, and ES5, which did not form aggresomes. Thus, this correlation between aggresome formation and ubiquitination confirms the observation that the aggregated material is ubiquitinated (Fig. 1). The centrosome is associated with active proteasomes, suggesting that this location is a privileged site for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (24Fabunmi R.P. Wigley W.C. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 409-413Google Scholar, 25Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Google Scholar). In line with this, it can be envisioned that the microtubule-dependent transport of proteasomal substrates toward the centrosome, evidenced by the formation of aggresomes, is a way to ensure a high rate of degradation under normal conditions and that the aggresomes are the result of inhibition or overwhelming of this “centralized” degradation machinery. If this hypothesis is correct, it predicts that the ability for a misfolded protein to form aggresomes upon overexpression is related to a fast degradation rate when it does not aggregate. In fact, in stable LLC-PK1 transfectants of SchΔF and ezrinΔF, in which both proteins are soluble due to moderate overexpression, we recently found that SchΔF is degraded 3 times faster than ezrinΔF (1.7 versus 5.4 h of half-life (14Gautreau A. Manent J. Fiévet B. Louvard D. Giovannini M. Arpin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31279-31282Google Scholar)). We examined whether this correlation between aggresome formation in transient transfections and fast turnover of the misfolded proteins in stable transfectants holds true with our series of chimeras. We selected stable transfectants for each of them and measured their degradation rate by a pulse-chase analysis followed by VSV G immunoprecipitations from RIPA extracts (Fig.5). The chimeras had relatively short half-lives, from 0.9 to 1.8 h, closer to the one SchΔF than ezrinΔF. Importantly the aggresome-forming chimeras were not degraded faster than the others. For example, ES3 had a half-life of 1.7 h compared with 1.4 or 0.9 h for ES4 or ES5, respectively, 2 chimeras that do not form aggresomes. Even though in stable transfectants the most part of misfolded proteins was extracted by the RIPA buffer, it was still possible that some residual aggregated material was not analyzed by this method. So we also assayed the stability of the chimeras by immunoblotting total cellular lysates after different times of a cycloheximide treatment that prevents protein synthesis. This experiment confirmed that the rate of degradation of aggresome-forming chimeras was similar to the one of the other chimeras (Fig. 5). Because fast degradation and aggresome formation were uncoupled in this series of chimeras, these experiments unambiguously dismiss the hypothesis that accumulation of aggregated proteins at the centrosome relates to the efficiency of degradation. Having determined that the C terminus of Sch induced a chimera containing a misfolded FERM domain to form aggresomes, we next asked whether it would form aggresomes when fused to a folded protein. For this purpose, we constructed fusion proteins with GFP, which fluoresces in green when properly folded (Fig. 6). The green fluorescent signal was detected in large aggresomes upon transient transfections of LLC-PK1 cells with GFP-Sch340–595, indicating that the C terminus of Sch can aggregate, whereas the appended GFP moiety remains folded. Importantly, the 61-amino acid sequence Sch535–595 fused to GFP also formed aggresomes, although these were usually smaller than the one formed by GFP-Sch340–595. Consistent with the chimera analysis, GFP-Sch544–595 never formed an aggresome. GFP-Sch535–580, which contains the common part between the two isoforms of Sch, did not form an aggresome either. This might reflect a difference of sensitivity between the chimera and the GFP assays or a contribution of the alternative amino acids of Sch isoform 2 in the formation of aggresomes. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that the small Sch535–595 fragment is sufficient to induce a folded protein such as GFP to form aggresomes. We then assessed the stability of these GFP fusion proteins by a pulse-chase experiment. All GFP-Sch fusion proteins had a half-life of about 10 h, which was lower than the one of GFP alone (>48h) but longer than those of the misfolded ezrin/Sch chimeras. Importantly, the aggresome-forming proteins, GFP-Sch340–595 and GFP-Sch535–595, had a comparable turnover to GFP-Sch544–595 and GFP-Sch535–580 that did not form aggresomes. This result further confirmed that aggresome formation and degradation are independent processes. To study further the properties of the aggresome determinant, we purified from Escherichia coli GST proteins fused to Sch535–595 or to Sch544–595 as a negative control. Purified GST-Sch535–595 and GST-Sch544–595 in PBS/glycerol (50%) were first centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to ensure they were both soluble at the beginning of the experiment. When equal amounts of GST-Sch535–595 and GST-Sch544–595were then kept for 3 days at 4 °C, Sch535–595 but not Sch544–595 formed a visible precipitate. The precipitated material was pelleted by a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 ×g, washed in PBS, and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. The amount of protein present in the supernatant and in the pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Co"
https://openalex.org/W2040582188,"Formation of the eukaryotic ribosomal 5 S RNA-protein complex has been shown to be critical to ribosome biogenesis and has been speculated to contribute to a quality control mechanism that helps ensure that only normal precursors are processed and assembled into active ribosomes. To study the structural basis of these observations, the RNA-protein interface in the 5 S RNA-protein complex of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ribosome was examined based on a systematic introduction of targeted base substitutions in the RNA sequence. Most base substitutions had little or no effect on the efficiency of complex formation, but large effects were observed when changes disrupted helix I, the secondary structure formed between the interacting termini. Again, only modest effects were evident when the extended 3' end of the mature RNA molecule was altered, but essentially no complex was formed when the 5' end of the mature 5 S RNA sequence was artificially extended by one nucleotide. In vitro analyses demonstrated that this extension also dramatically altered the maturation of 5 S rRNA precursor molecules as well as the stability of the mature 5 S rRNA. Taken together, the results indicate that in the course of RNA maturation, the 5 S RNA-binding protein binds precisely over or caps the termini in a critical manner that protects the RNA from further degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2017657647,"Vertebrate striated muscle contraction is regulated in a Ca2+-dependent fashion by tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn). This regulation involves shifts in the position of Tm and Tn on actin filaments and may include conformational changes in actin that are then communicated to myosin subfragment 1 (S1). To determine whether subdomain 2 of actin plays a role in this regulation, the DNase-I loop 38–52 of this subdomain was cleaved by subtilisin between residues Met47and Gly48. Despite impaired unregulated function, the potentiation and regulation of cleaved actin movement in the in vitro motility assay was not significantly different from that of uncleaved actin. Stopped-flow measurements of ADP release from regulated and unregulated cleaved acto-S1 showed a marked increase in ADP release from acto-S1 in the presence of the regulatory complex. The enhancement of the actin affinity for S1 in the presence of regulatory proteins was greater for uncleaved than for cleaved F-actin. Finally, both cleaved and uncleaved actins protect myosin loop 1 from papain cleavage equally well. Our results suggest that the potentiation of actin function in the in vitro motility assay by regulatory proteins stems from changes in cross-bridge cycle kinetics. In addition, the unimpaired calcium-sensitive regulation of cleaved actin indicates that subdomain 2 conformation does not play an essential role in the regulation process.

Biophys J. 1999; 77: 985-992Google Scholar), subdomain 2 does not seem to have a marked role in interactions with regulatory proteins. However, Squire and Morris (12Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Google Scholar) raised the possibility that changes seen in the structural studies of regulated thin filaments may be due not only to shifts of the Tm/Tn complex, but also to subdomain 2 movements within each actin protomer. The observations that selected subdomain 2 alterations impair regulation by troponin-tropomyosin (13Miki M. Hozumi T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5625-5630Google Scholar, 14Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K.Y. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Google Scholar) and that the presence of Tm and Tm/Tn interferes with cross-linking between subdomain 2 and S1 (15Bonafe N. Mathieu M. Kassab R. Chaussepied P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2594-2603Google Scholar) are consistent with this hypothesis. Moreover, the recent paper of Luoet al. (16Luo Y. Leszyk J. Li B. Li Z. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 429-434Google Scholar), reporting the cross-linking of Tn-I to Met47 on subdomain 2 of actin, suggests that TnI interacts with this region of actin. A similar conclusion was reached in an electron microscopic study of thin filaments containing mutant tropomyosin, in which troponin density was found near Met47(although troponin more strongly contacted subdomain 1 than subdomain 2) (7Lehman W. Rosol M. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 739-744Google Scholar). Although previous work from our laboratory (17Gerson J.H. Kim E. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18442-18449Google Scholar) did not detect any subdomain 2 movements during regulation, all of our experiments used probes attached to Gln41 (in α-skeletal actin) or Cys41 and Cys51 (in mutant yeast actins). Because such probes may have altered the dynamics, if not the conformation, of an intrinsically dynamic subdomain 2, and because TnI cross-links to Met47 on actin, we tested for Tm/Tn interactions with this region using subtilisin-cleaved actin (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar,18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar). Subtilisin cleaves between Met47 and Gly48 in loop 38–52 of actin's subdomain 2 (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar). The resultant protein exhibits modified interprotomer interactions in F-actin and impaired function with myosin (i.e. myosin binding, acto-S1 ATPase, andin vitro motility) (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar, 18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar). Since these changes occur subsequent to subdomain 2 cleavage, the question addressed in this work is whether, and to what extent, the subtilisin-cleaved actin is still regulated by Tm/Tn. Alterations in regulation would indicate that subdomain 2 indeed has a direct or indirect role in regulation. Previous studies have shown that the presence of the Tm/Tn regulatory complex not only introduces Ca2+-based regulation to F-actin filaments but also potentiates their function, i.e.the in vitro motility of actin filaments and the force generated by actomyosin are enhanced (19Homsher E.

J. 1997; 72: 1295-1307Google Scholar, 22Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Google Scholar). Although several explanations for such actin speed increases can be considered, the most likely possibility is that of accelerated actomyosin detachment through faster ADP release and/or ATP binding. Because the stopped flow technique limits measurements of the kinetic rates of these processes to 500–700 s−1, the effect of Tm/Tn on these rates is not easily measured. Such measurements, however, are feasible using the cleaved actin, and they were carried out in this study. In the experiments described below, we investigated the effect of regulatory proteins on the in vitro motility of subtilisin-cleaved actin, the binding of S1 to such actin, and the rate of ADP release from S1 bound to actin. We compared the degree of protection of myosin loop 1, which is part of the myosin nucleotide binding cleft, afforded by cleaved and uncleaved actin. Our findings indicate a modulation of cross-bridge cycle kinetics by the Tm/Tn regulatory complex, while also supporting the conclusion that subdomain 2 conformation does not play an essential role in Tm/Tn-based regulation of actomyosin interactions. ATP, ADP, DTT, phalloidin, and PMSF were purchased from Sigma. N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Skeletal myosin and actin were prepared from rabbit back muscle according to Godfrey and Harrington (23Godfrey J.E. Harrington W.F. Biochemistry. 1970; : 886-893Google Scholar) and Spudich and Watt (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; : 4866-4871Google Scholar), respectively. S1 and heavy meromyosin (HMM) were prepared from myosin using the protocols of Weeds and Pope (25Weeds A.G. Pope B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 129-157Google Scholar) and Kron et al. (26Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Google Scholar), respectively. The cardiac troponin and tropomyosin were produced as previously described by Tobacman and Adelstein (27Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Google Scholar). Subtilisin was purchased from Sigma. The labeling of skeletal actin with pyrene maleimide was performed according to a previously described protocol (28Kim E. Reisler E. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 191-201Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was ∼100%. Actin was cleaved by adding subtilisin to skeletal G-actin in a 1:1000 weight ratio. The cleavage was carried out at room temperature for 15 min at 20 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of PMSF to 1.0 mm. The cleaved actin was then polymerized by raising the MgCl2 and KCl concentrations to 2.0 mm and 50 mm, respectively. The cleaved G-actin was run on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to verify the complete cleavage and was used in experiments within 24 h after the cleavage. The rates of HMM Mg-ATPase were determined at 25 °C under steady-state conditions, by monitoring the inorganic phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis as described before (18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar). Thin filaments were reconstituted using bovine cardiac troponin, rabbit skeletal tropomyosin, and the subtilisin-cleaved or intact skeletal actin. The assay solutions contained 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mmNaCl, 2.0 mm K+-EGTA, 3.0 mmMg2+-ATP. Protein concentrations were: 0–8 μm for HMM (0–16 μm S1 heads) and 0–40 μm actin (intact and cleaved). The binding of S1·ADP to subtilisin-cleaved and pyrene-labeled actins was monitored by measuring the quenching of pyrene fluorescence by S1 in samples containing 1.0 μm pyrene-labeled actin and comparing them with samples containing 1.0 μm pyrene-labeled actin and 5.0 μm subtilisin-cleaved actin with and without regulatory proteins (14Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K.Y. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Google Scholar). When present, the molar ratios of Tm and Tn to actin were 0.35:1.0. S1 was added to actin solutions in 0.25-μmincrements to a total concentration of 3.0 μm. To ensure that all binding was strong (in the absence of ATP), 5 units of hexokinase and 1.0 mm glucose were added to each sample to hydrolyze any contaminant ATP. The assay buffer also contained 2.0 mm ADP, phalloidin in equimolar concentrations with the actins, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.0 mm DTT. All measurements were recorded at 23 °C in Spex Fluorolog using excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Dissociation constants were determined using the program Nfit 1.0 (University of Texas, Galveston, TX) and fitting the data with the equation S0=(Kd,P*(F0−F)/(F−Fs))+(A0,P*(F0−F)/(F0−Fs))(Eq. 1) +(A0,S*Kd,P*(F0−F)/(Kd,S*(F−Fs)+Kd,P*(F0−F)))where S0 represents total S1 concentration,K d,P = dissociation constant for pyrene-labeled actin; F = fluorescence;F0 = maximum fluorescence, i.e. the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin before the addition of S1; A0,P = concentration of pyrene-labeled actin;F S = minimum fluorescence, after saturation with S1; A0,S = concentration of subtilisin-cleaved actin;K d,S = dissociation constant for subtilisin-cleaved actin. The above equation, connecting the measured fluorescence with the concentrations of the bound and free actins, was derived by algebraic manipulation of the following expressions, S0=S+APS+ASS(Eq. 2) where S0 represents total S1 concentration, S is the unbound S1, and APS and ASS represent S1 complexed with pyrene-labeled and subtilisin-cleaved actin, respectively. Each of these species is expressed in terms of a dissociation constant (K d), using the mass action law relationships Kd,P=AP*S/APS(Eq. 3) and Kd,S=AS*S/ASS(Eq. 4) and is related to the observed fluorescence (F) via the following equation. F=F0−(APS/A0,P)(F0−FS)(Eq. 5) The in vitro motility assays were performed according to a previously described protocol (29Miller C.J. Doyle T.C. Bobkova E. Botstein D. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3670-3676Google Scholar). Tm and Tn, when present, were added to the assay system at the concentration of 0.1 μm; Tm alone was present at 0.4 μm in these assays. Movement was initiated by applying an assay buffer (2.0 mmK+-EGTA/Ca2+-K+-EGTA (with the ratio varying depending on the pCa desired), 20 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.3; total ionic strength, 50 mm) containing 1.0 mmMg2+-ATP and an oxygen scavenging system (30Umemoto S. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14864-14869Google Scholar) at 25 °C. An ExpertVision System (Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa, CA) was used to quantify the sliding speeds of individual filaments. Actin speeds (mean ± S.D.) were determined from measurements of motion of 150–250 filaments. Individual filaments were judged to be moving smoothly and were used for statistical analysis if the standard deviation of their sliding speeds was less than one-half of their average speed (31Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Google Scholar). Filament speeds at differentpCa values were fitted to a Hill equation in the form, V=V0/(1+10n(pCa50−pCa))(Eq. 6) where V is the measured mean speed of actin filaments, V0 is the mean filament speed at pCa = 5.0 (maximal speed), pCa50 is the calcium concentration at which V = 0.5 V0, and n is the Hill coefficient. Significance was determined using Student'st-test, and the confidence level was set atp < 0.05. The stopped-flow measurements were carried out at 20 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.3, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm Ca2+-K+-EGTA, 2.0 mm DTT, and 1.0 mm PMSF. The final concentration of S1, F-actin (whether cleaved or uncleaved), and ADP (when present) were 2.0, 3.0, and 100 μm, respectively. Phalloidin was added at an equimolar concentration to actin for filament stabilization. When applicable, rabbit skeletal Tm and bovine cardiac Tn were each present at a concentration of 0.75 μm. The final concentration of Mg·ATP, after mixing, was 5.0 mm. The rate-limiting dissociation of ADP from acto-S1 was followed via a decrease in light scattered at 90 ° to the exciting light that accompanied the subsequent ATP-induced dissociation of the acto-S1 complex. Excitation and emission wavelengths were both 345 nm. Papain was activated by dissolving it in a solution containing 50 μm DTT, 1.5 mmEDTA, and 5.5 mm cysteine, pH 6.0, and incubating for 30 min on ice before use. The digestions were performed at room temperature, at S1 concentration of 8.7 μm and, where applicable, F-actin concentration of 17.4 μm. Papain was added to each sample to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the digestions were terminated by adding 10 mm iodoacetic acid. The extent of S1 digestions lasting 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 40 min was estimated from scans of SDS-PAGE gels. As documented earlier (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar, 18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar), our limited digestion of actin by subtilisin yielded homogenous preparations with virtually no uncleaved or farther degraded actin. As also reported before (18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar), the in vitro motility of subtilisin-cleaved actin was strikingly impaired. The results of these measurements are listed in Table I. The in vitro motility speeds for the cleaved and uncleaved actins without regulatory proteins were 1.9 ± 1.1 and 4.1 ± 0.7 μm/sec, respectively. We found that in the presence of Ca2+, at pCa = 5.0, the regulatory complex increased the sliding speed of the subtilisin-cleaved and uncleaved actin filaments by about 2-fold, to 3.57 ± 1.2 and 7.45 ± 1.1 μm/s, respectively (Table I). The presence of the regulatory proteins also increased the percentage of smoothly moving cleaved actin filaments ∼2.5-fold, from 34.4% to 88.5%. Tm alone had a much smaller effect than Tm/Tn on the motility of the cleaved and intact actin (Table I). In the presence of Tm the speeds of actin increased by up to 20% (± 10%).Table 1In vitro motility speeds of intact and subtilisin-cleaved actin in presence and absence of regulatory proteinsActinSpeeds in μm/secNo regulatory proteinsTm addedTm/Tn addedIntact4.1 ± 0.74.9 ± 0.77.45 ± 1.1Cleaved1.9 ± 1.12.2 ± 1.03.57 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab Measurements of the sliding speeds of regulated actin versus pCa revealed similar dependence on Ca2+ for the cleaved and intact actin (Fig. 1,inset). This is easily seen after normalizing the actin filament speeds to 100% at pCa = 5.0 (Fig. 1). Thus, the regulatory mechanism seems little affected by the cleavage; both the cleaved and uncleaved actins have similarpCa50 and Hill coefficients (Fig. 1). The affinity of S1 to pyrene-labeled skeletal actin and subtilisin-cleaved actin in both the presence and absence of Tm/Tn was measured in binding competition assays. The goal of these measurements was to determine the effect of the regulatory proteins on the affinity of cleaved actin for S1 and to assess the possibility that Tm/Tn might “restore” their binding to that of intact actin and S1. The presence of the regulatory complex increases the affinity of the S1 for the pyrene-labeled actin by about 5-fold, with theK d decreasing from 0.18 ± 0.003 to 0.037 ± 0.003 μm (mean ± S.E.) in the absence and presence of Tm/Tn, respectively (Fig. 2). A similar effect of Tm/Tn on the affinity of S1 to pyrene-labeled actin was reported by Korman et al. (14Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K.Y. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Google Scholar). The cleaved and unlabeled actin bound S1 less well than the intact labeled actin, with a K d of 0.39 ± 0.006 μm. Taking into account the ∼5-fold increase in the K d value of S1 and actin due to pyrene labeling of actin (14Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K.Y. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Google Scholar), our measurements show about a 10-fold lower binding constant of S1 to cleaved than to intact actin. This result is consistent with prior measurements of the effect of subtilisin cleavage of actin on S1 binding (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar). In the presence of regulatory proteins, the affinity of S1 to cleaved actin increased by 2-fold, with a K d of 0.22 ± 0.004 μm. This improvement in binding is less than the 5-fold effect of troponin-tropomyosin measured using the uncleaved labeled actin. Thus, even in the presence of Tm/Tn the cleaved actin binds S1 less strongly than intact actin in the absence of regulatory proteins. Besides decreasing the affinity of S1 binding, subtilisin cleavage of actin also decreases weak acto-S1 interactions as evidenced by its increase of the K m (from 33 to 200 μm) value of the actomyosin ATPase reaction (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar, 18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar). We verified in acto-HMM ATPase measurements that the difference between theK m values of cleaved and intact actin in such assays is retained in the presence of Tm/Tn (at pCa = 5.0; data not shown). Taken together, the small effect of Tm alone on the motility of cleaved actin, and the S1 binding and acto-HMM ATPase results indicate that the regulatory proteins do not offset the cleavage damage to the interaction with myosin. Stopped-flow measurements of the ATP-dependent rate of dissociation of rigor acto-S1 complex at 20 °C did not reveal any major slowing of this process when using cleaved actin. The rates of dissociation of S1 from both cleaved and uncleaved actin were linear with the [Mg·ATP] and were >800 s−1 at 5 mm ATP (the highest rate we could reliably measure). Such fast rates preclude the measurement of any possible effect of regulatory proteins on acto-S1 dissociation. Although lowering the temperature of the solution would slow acto-S1 dissociation, this strategy is not useful because regulatory proteins loose their ability to potentiate thin filament sliding speeds at low temperatures (<12 °C). 2E. Homsher, personal communication. Stopped-flow measurements of ADP release from S1 at 20 °C in the presence of both regulated and unregulated subtilisin-cleaved actin filaments were fitted using a single exponential equation. The results reveal an almost 8-fold increase in the rate of ADP release by the regulated compared with the unregulated cleaved actin, with release rates of >900 s−1 and 125 ± 12 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3). We were unable to reliably measure the release rates of ADP from uncleaved acto-S1 as these rates were beyond instrument resolution, even without regulatory proteins (>850 s−1). The nucleotide release rates can be decreased considerably by using the ADP analog εADP inlieu of ADP in such experiments. The results of such measurements showed that the rates of εADP release from S1 are about the same in the presence of unregulated and regulated actin (32Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11920-11929Google Scholar, 33Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9994-9999Google Scholar). Our in vitro motility experiments using εATP instead of ATP also did not reveal any effect of Tm/Tn on actin speeds. In the presence of εATP unregulated and regulated intact actin moved at 1.37 ± 0.45 and 1.29 ± 0.41 μm/s speeds (mean ± S.D.), respectively. Modification of loop 1 of S1 has been shown to affect the rate of nucleotide release from acto-S1 (34Sweeney H.L. Holzbaur E.L. Annu Rev Physiol. 1996; 58: 751-792Google Scholar, 35Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Google Scholar, 36Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Google Scholar). In addition, despite the fact that actin does not directly contact this area of S1, it protects S1 loop 1 from digestion by papain (37Applegate D. Reisler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7109-7112Google Scholar). By comparing the degree of protection afforded by cleavedversus uncleaved actin, we sought to determine whether the actin cleavage by subtilisin affected the ability of actin to modulate this site. However, the degree of protection from papain proteolysis afforded S1 by the cleaved actin was virtually the same as that by uncleaved actin (Fig. 4). This shows that actin cleavage alters ADP release from acto-S1 by weakening the impact of actin on structural elements of S1 other than loop 1. Recently, Luo et al. (16Luo Y. Leszyk J. Li B. Li Z. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 429-434Google Scholar) reported on the photocross-linking of residues 104 and 133 on mutant troponin I (TnI) to Met47 on actin in reconstituted thin filaments in the absence of Ca2+. On this basis, Luo et al. (16Luo Y. Leszyk J. Li B. Li Z. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 429-434Google Scholar) suggested that TnI binds to actin in the vicinity of Met47, probably to the adjacent segment 50–58. Binding of this actin region to TnI may form a Tm interaction site, which can stabilize the latter protein at the outer domain of actin i.e. in the blocked state. In the presence of Ca2+, the release of TnI from its binding region on actin would allow the movement of Tm to its thermodynamically preferred position between the outer and inner domains of actin, i.e. to the closed state position (16Luo Y. Leszyk J. Li B. Li Z. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 429-434Google Scholar). This regulation model does not evoke any companion dynamic changes on actin and, therefore, is not in conflict with the apparent absence of subdomain 2 motions during actin regulation (17Gerson J.H. Kim E. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18442-18449Google Scholar). The proposed location of the TnI binding site on actin (segment 50–58) and the easy availability of actin specifically cleaved by subtilisin between Met47 and Gly48 (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar, 18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar) suggested that such material could be used to examine the dependence of regulation on subdomain 2 interprotomer contacts, the conformational changes in this region, and the role of subdomain 2 in transmission of regulatory allosteric changes to other parts of actin. Several aspects of actin structure and function are impaired by its subtilisin cleavage. These include the previously described (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar, 18Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar) and confirmed above degradation of interactions with myosin, increased critical concentration for polymerization (3Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar), and decreased inter-strand interactions (38Orlova A. Chen X. Rubenstein P.A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 235-243Google Scholar). The cleaved actin filaments are also more susceptible to tryptic proteolysis (at Lys61 and Lys68), indicating a more open conformation of actin (39Khaitlina S.Y. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 321-334Google Scholar) and/or greater mobility of its subdomain 2 within the polymer. It is possible that the decreased interactions of cleaved actin with myosin are due to either a change in the binding site for myosin (if it includes residues 38–52) or to a severed communication pathway in actin by the cleavage between Met47 and Gly48. Despite changed interprotomer interactions in F-actin and the functional impact of DNase-I binding loop cleavage, the regulatory mechanism was not impaired in the cleaved actin. When compared with normal thin filaments, the degree of Tm/Tn-induced potentiation remained the same, with no significant shift in pCa dependence of the regulation of cleaved actin (Fig. 1). This indicates that the propagation of allosteric regulatory changes in actin occurs despite impaired interprotomer interactions and that these effects may be propagated through the regulatory proteins themselves. Thus, subdomain 2 does not seem to play an active role in the regulation of actomyosin interactions. If TnI binds to segment 50–58 on actin (16Luo Y. Leszyk J. Li B. Li Z. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 429-434Google Scholar), it may act as a mechanical latch for Tm rather than allosteric modulator of subdomain 2 and its dynamics. This conclusion is in line with the results of our previous study in which we used probes attached to actin's subdomain 2 to monitor its conformational transitions during the regulatory process. The steric-blocking model of actomyosin regulation does not provide a simple explanation for the Tm/Tn-induced potentiation of actin speed and force production in the in vitro motility assay (19Homsher E. Lee D.M. Morris C. Pavlov D. Tobacman L.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 233-243Google Scholar). Variations in filament speed and force generation are generally attributed to changes in the kinetics of ADP release and recruitment of myosin heads by the thin filament. Since previous studies (19Homsher E. Lee D.M. Morris C. Pavlov D. Tobacman L.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 233-243Google Scholar, 20Bing W. Fraser I.D. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Google Scholar, 21Gordon A.M. LaMadrid M.A. Chen Y. Luo Z. Chase P.B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1295-1307Google Scholar, 22Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Google Scholar) have indicated increases in both force and speed in the presence of Tm/Tn, it appears that the presence of regulatory proteins affects both myosin head recruitment and nucleotide release through direct interactions between the regulatory proteins and myosin, interactions mediated by actin, or both. An increase in myosin recruitment, which would increase force generation because of a greater number of heads attached at a given time, is suggested by the increased binding of S1 to actin in the presence of Tm/Tn (27Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Google Scholar, 40Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Google Scholar, 41Geeves M.A. Halsall D.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 229: 85-95Google Scholar, 42Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2770-2774Google Scholar). However, under conditions of HMM saturation in the in vitro motility assay, increases in unloaded filament sliding speed can not be produced by increases in myosin head recruitment (43Pate E. Cooke R. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1989; 10: 181-196Google Scholar). Instead, filament sliding speed increases are more likely produced by increased cross-bridge cycle turnover rate or faster ADP release. This scenario is supported by a recent study of Homsher et al. (19Homsher E. Lee D.M. Morris C. Pavlov D. Tobacman L.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 233-243Google Scholar), showing that the enhancement of actin speed by Tm/Tn is progressively lost by increasing the [Mg·ADP]. We showed in our binding competition assays that the presence of regulatory proteins increases the affinity of S1 to the thin filament reconstituted with intact actin ∼5-fold (Fig. 2). For thin filaments containing cleaved actin, the increase in affinity is less than 2-fold. These results indicate that the difference in the binding of myosin heads by the two types of actin is not decreased in the reconstituted thin filaments. Despite this difference, both types of regulated thin filaments display 2-fold increases in the in vitro motility speeds. This confirms the contention that increases in speed are not tied to increases in recruitment, but are most likely due to increases in the rate of ADP release. Consistent with this, when such acceleration in ADP release does not occur, as in the case of εADP (32Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11920-11929Google Scholar, 33Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9994-9999Google Scholar), we have measured similar actin speeds with and without Tm/Tn. Due to the extremely rapid ADP release rate from acto-S1 at room temperature, we were unable to determine the effect of Tm/Tn on the ADP off rates from uncleaved actin/S1. Using lower temperatures to slow the kinetics of this reaction was not an option as below 12 °C Tm/Tn cause a decrease in the in vitro motility performance instead of the potentiation that is seen at room temperature.2 However, given the performance of the regulated subtilisin-cleaved actin filaments in the in vitromotility assay, this system provided a convenient model for the study of ADP release from the acto-S1 complex. As reported above, S1 in the presence of unregulated cleaved actin filaments released ADP at a much slower rate than in the presence of their uncleaved counterparts, but this rate was increased severalfold upon the addition of Tm/Tn. Thus, our finding provides an experimental link between the in vitro motility speed increases in the presence of the regulatory complex and the increase in the rate of ADP release from myosin. The improved binding of S1 to cleaved actin in the presence of Tm/Tn, which increases the S1 affinity to actin by less than 2-fold, cannot account fully for the acceleration of ADP release. It appears that while the cleaved actin fails to open the nucleotide cleft on S1 to the same extent as the intact actin does, Tm/Tn restores that ability to the cleaved protein. At present, it is unclear whether this effect is due to direct Tm-S1 interactions or allosteric changes on actin (induced by Tm/Tn) that potentiate its effect on the nucleotide cleft on S1. To test one possible structure-function relationship behind the effect of actin on ADP release from S1, we compared the ability of intact and cleaved actins to protect loop 1, which spans the 25/50-kDa junction of S1, from papain cleavage. Despite the fact that actin does not directly contact this site, the binding of actin to S1 causes a conformational change in loop 1, which inhibits its cleavage by papain. Loop 1 is located over the nucleotide binding cleft, and various studies have shown that modifying it affects nucleotide binding. Rovneret al. (36Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Google Scholar) have shown a marked increase in the in vitro motility of actin and suggested a concomitant increase in ADP release when this loop is altered through mutations. In line with this, Sweeney and Holzbaur (34Sweeney H.L. Holzbaur E.L. Annu Rev Physiol. 1996; 58: 751-792Google Scholar) also demonstrated the postulated rate increases in ADP release. Additional studies by the same laboratory showed that the rate of ADP release is correlated to the length and flexibility of loop 1 (35Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Google Scholar). Thus, given the reported effect of loop 1 on ADP release and our own results, which showed changes in motility consistent with shifts in ADP release, we investigated the possibility that subtilisin-cleaved actin had a different effect on loop 1 than the intact actin. Our results indicate no changes in the degree of protection provided by the cleaved actin. Thus, the mechanism involved in the shift in ADP release brought about by the cleaved actin does not involve changes in actin impact on loop 1 of S1. In summary, our work shows that the presence of regulatory proteins increases the speed of cleaved actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay, and this effect is correlated with the increase in the rate of ADP release from myosin. Despite the functional differences between the modified and unmodified actins, actin regulation and the effect of the regulatory complex on speed is unchanged; it is unaffected by the impairment of interprotomer actin interactions. While the cleavage in actin subdomain 2 does affect interactions between actin and S1, these changes do not appear to include the influence of actin on loop 1 in S1. Therefore, the mechanism that alters the rate of ADP release must be due to other changes in acto-S1 interactions. We acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Mahta Nili."
