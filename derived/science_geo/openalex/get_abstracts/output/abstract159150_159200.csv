https://openalex.org/W2074623822,"In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), the vasculotrophic factor, angiotensin II (AngII) activates three major MAPKs via the Gq-coupled AT1 receptor. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by AngII requires Ca2+-dependent “transactivation” of the EGF receptor that may involve a metalloprotease to stimulate processing of an EGF receptor ligand from its precursor. Whether EGF receptor transactivation also contributes to activation of other members of MAPKs such as p38MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by AngII remains unclear. In the present study, we have examined the effects of a synthetic metalloprotease inhibitor BB2116, and the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1478 on AngII-induced activation of MAPKs in cultured VSMC. BB2116 markedly inhibited ERK activation induced by AngII or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 without affecting the activation by EGF or PDGF. BB2116 as well as HB-EGF neutralizing antibody inhibited the EGF receptor transactivation by AngII, suggesting a critical role of HB-EGF in the metalloprotease-dependent EGF receptor transactivation. In addition to the ERK activation, activation of p38MAPK and JNK by AngII was inhibited by an AT1 receptor antagonist, RNH6270.A23187 and EGF markedly activate p38MAPK, whereas A23187 but not EGF markedly activates JNK, indicating the possible contribution of the EGF receptor transactivation to the p38MAPK activation. The findings that both BB2116 and AG1478 specifically inhibited activation of p38MAPK but not JNK by AngII support this hypothesis. From these data, we conclude that ERK and p38MAPK activation by AngII requires the metalloprotease-dependent EGF receptor transactivation, whereas the JNK activation is regulated without involvement of EGF receptor transactivation.

In addition to the anti-hypertensive effects, both AngII-converting enzyme inhibitors and AngII type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonists appear to exert tissue-protective effects against these diseases. Therefore, the growth-stimulating activity of the AT1receptor likely contributes to the progression of cardiovascular remodeling (1Goodfriend T.L. Elliott M.E. Catt K.J. N. Engl. J.

We have reported that Ca2+-dependent transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) through the AT1receptor is essential for the activation of downstream Ser/Thr kinases (ERK, Akt/protein kinase B, and p70 S6 kinase), and subsequent c-Fos induction and protein synthesis by AngII in cultured rat VSMC (14Eguchi S.

This new concept of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, originally reported in Rat1 fibroblasts (17Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), is now supported by a similar transactivation of the EGFR by a variety of GPCRs in many cells (18Zwick E. Hackel P.O.

Several mechanisms involving an upstream tyrosine kinase, reactive oxygen species, and metalloprotease(s) have been proposed for the transactivation of EGFR by GPCRs (7Eguchi S. Inagami T. Regul.

Although it has proven difficult to detect GPCR-induced release of endogenous EGFR ligands (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H.

Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) is an attractive mechanism of the EGFR transactivation in VSMC. This is because HB-EGF is a major EGF-like growth factor synthesized in VSMC, is a potent mitogenic and chemotactic factor for VSMC, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and restenosis following balloon injury (24Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are members of MAPKs that are preferentially stimulated by environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. Like ERK, these stress-activated MAPKs phosphorylate specific subsets of transcriptional factors, thereby regulating cellular processes of inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and/or survival (25Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 26Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

They also are likely to play critical roles in cardiovascular disease (27New L. Han J. Trends. Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Force T. Pombo C.M. Avruch J.A. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, AngII has recently been shown to activate both p38MAPK (29Ushio F.M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and JNK (30Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in cultured VSMC. The p38MAPK may positively regulate VSMC growth induced by AngII (29Ushio F.M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), whereas JNK was activated in a balloon-injured artery that could be inhibited by an AT1 antagonist (31Kim S. Izumi Y. Yano M. Hamaguchi A. Miura K. Yamanaka S. Miyazaki H. Iwao H. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, there is considerable interest in defining the signal transduction pathways by which AngII activates these stress-activated MAPKs. In the present study, we have examined the hypothesis that a metalloprotease-dependent EGFR transactivation regulates p38MAPK and/or JNK activation by AngII in VSMC. Here we report several lines of evidence indicating that, in addition to ERK, AngII-induced p38MAPK activation requires the metalloprotease-dependent EGFR transactivation, which may involve HB-EGF processing, whereas JNK activation is not mediated by the metalloprotease-dependent system. AngII and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. AG1478, PD158780, A23187, and anisomycin were obtained from Calbiochem. The metalloprotease inhibitors BB2116 and BB94 were kindly provided by Dr. Helen Mills (British Biotech). RNH-6270 (32Mizuno M. Sada T. Ikeda M. Fukuda N. Miyamoto M. Yanagisawa H. Koike H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 285: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the active form of a prodrug type AT1 antagonist CS-866, was a gift from Sankyo Co., Ltd. EGF, PDGF-BB, and antibodies to phosphotyrosine and JAK2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The antibodies directed to Tyr204-phosphorylated ERK1/2, ERK2, JNK2 p38MAPK, and EGFR were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody directed to Thr180/Tyr182-dually phosphorylated p38MAPK was obtained from New England BioLabs. The antibody directed to Thr183/Tyr185-dually phosphorylated JNK was obtained from Promega Inc. The antibody directed to Tyr1007/Tyr1008-dually phosphorylated JAK2 was obtained from BIOSOURCE International. Anti-PYK2 antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. A neutralizing antibody to human HB-EGF was obtained from R & D Systems Inc. The anti-human HB-EGF antibody for immunoblotting was kindly provided by Dr. Judith A. Abraham (Scios Inc). VSMC were prepared from the thoracic aorta of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by the explant method and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as previously described (33Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Imai T. Kanno K. Marumo F. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In all experiments, subcultured VSMC from passages 3–10 were used and showed >99% positive immunostaining of smooth muscle α-actin antibody. The expression of AT1 but not AT2 was confirmed as previously described (34Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cultured human aortic VSMC were obtained from Clonetics, and subcultured according to the manufacture's manual. Cells at ∼80% confluence in culture wells were made quiescent by serum deprivation for 3 days prior to treatment. After stimulation, cells were lysed with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm2-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the antibody and protein A/G-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C as described previously (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Cell lysates or immunocomplex lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Fura-2 was used to monitor changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration using a previously described procedure (35Yamakawa T. Eguchi S. Yamakawa Y. Motley E.D. Numaguchi K. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After incubation in serum-free medium for 48 h, cells were trypsinized, incubated with 4 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer HEPES solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and resuspended to 2 × 106 cells/ml. Measurements of fluorescence were made at 37 °C using a SPEX dual wavelength fluorometer (excitation at 340 and 380 nm; emission at 510 nm). After cell-surface proteins of human VSMC were biotinylated by 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution, VSMC were rinsed and incubated in the cultured medium for 30 min at 37 °C and stimulated with or without AngII. Culture medium was collected and precipitated with immobilized streptavidin-agarose (Pierce), and immunoblotted with anti-human-HB-EGF antibody. Unless stated otherwise, results are representative of at least three experiments giving similar results. A recent study indicates that the transactivation of EGFR by several GPCR agonists requires pro-HB-EGF processing that can be blocked by a synthetic metalloprotease inhibitor, BB94 (22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). We have shown that AngII mainly activates ERK through the EGFR transactivation in VSMC (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To determine whether this cascade involves metalloprotease activation, the effect of two hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors BB2116 and BB94 on AngII-induced ERK activation was examined in cultured rat VSMC. As shown in Fig. 1 (A andB), BB2116 markedly and concentration-dependently inhibited AngII-induced ERK1/2 activation as assessed by their phosphorylation. By contrast, BB2116 had no effect on ERK activation induced by EGF or PDGF-BB (Fig.1 B). BB94 also inhibited AngII-induced ERK activation in VSMC to a similar extent as BB2116 (Fig. 1 C). The EGFR transactivation and subsequent ERK activation by AngII require intracellular Ca2+ elevation through the Gq-coupled AT1 receptor but not protein kinase C (PKC) (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous observations (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), ERK activation by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was markedly inhibited by BB2116, whereas PMA-induced ERK activation was minimally affected (Fig. 2 A). BB2116 did not alter AngII-induced intracellular Ca2+ elevation (Fig.2 B), indicating that the metalloprotease inhibitor had no effect on AngII binding to the AT1 receptor or subsequent Gq activation. In addition, BB2116 had no effect on AngII-induced nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activation as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 or JAK2 (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig.3 A, AngII-induced EGFR transactivation was markedly inhibited by BB2116 in rat VSMC. To determine whether HB-EGF shedding is involved in the transactivation, the effect of a HB-EGF neutralizing antibody (human specific) was examined. Pretreatment with the antibody almost completely inhibited AngII-induced EGFR transactivation in cultured human VSMC (Fig.3 B). We next examined the AngII-induced release of endogenous HB-EGF from VSMC using cell surface biotinylation assay. However, it proved difficult to detect the release of soluble HB-EGF from VSMC (data not shown). The inability to biochemically detect soluble HB-EGF may be due to the low endogenous expression levels of the ligand, and this may be further exacerbated in the presence of functional EGFRs, which bind and internalize the ligand (36Dempsey P. Coffey R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could be due to cleaved HB-EGF remaining associated with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan matrix, preventing the immediate release of the mature growth factor into the conditioned medium. Taken together, these data suggest that processing of HB-EGF as a cell-associated ligand by a BB2116-sensitive metalloprotease may be an essential component for the EGFR transactivation and subsequent ERK activation induced by AngII. Cultured rat VSMC is an interesting model where a GPCR agonist, AngII, can activate three major MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38MAPK) (29Ushio F.M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 30Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We measured the activation of these MAPKs by immunoblotting with their phospho-specific antibodies. This method allows us to assess activation of these different MAPKs on the same membrane. AngII stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation starting at 5 min, and it peaked at 10 min, which resembled its time course of ERK activation in VSMC. AngII also activated JNK. It peaked at 30 min as assessed by p54 JNK phosphorylation (Fig.4 A). For longer exposure of the membrane, we observed a similar phosphorylation pattern of p46 JNK (data not shown). These data are comparable with previous publications in which MAPKs activation by AngII in VSMC was measured by kinase activities (37Kusuhara M. Takahashi E. Peterson T.E. Abe J. Ishida M. Han J. Ulevitch R. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). VSMC normally express Gq-coupled AT1 receptors but not AT2 receptors. As expected, AngII-induced activation of these MAPKs is completely inhibited by the selective AT1 receptor antagonist RNH6270 (32Mizuno M. Sada T. Ikeda M. Fukuda N. Miyamoto M. Yanagisawa H. Koike H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 285: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, Band C), indicating that AngII activates these MAPKs solely through the AT1 receptor in VSMC. To define the signaling relay leading to p38MAPK and JNK activation by AngII, we compared the respective time courses of their activation by AngII with those by PMA, A23187, PDGF, or EGF. PMA preferentially activated ERK, whereas A23187 markedly activated all three MAPKs (Fig. 5 A). PDGF and EGF markedly activated p38MAPK and ERK, whereas JNK was markedly activated by PDGF but not by EGF (Fig. 5 B). These differences may be due to different effects of PDGF and EGF on intracellular Ca2+ concentration, because PDGF, but not EGF, elevated Ca2+ concentration in VSMC (Fig.5 C). These data suggest that the Ca2+-dependent EGFR transactivation by AngII could also signal to p38MAPK as well as ERK. In contrast, JNK activation by AngII may require a distinct Ca2+ effector other than the EGFR. To define whether the metalloprotease-dependent EGFR transactivation participates in AngII-induced p38MAPK activation, effects of BB2116, BB94, and the selective EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 on AngII-induced activation of p38MAPK and JNK were studied. As shown in Fig.6 (A and B), BB2116 markedly inhibited AngII-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation, whereas it had no effect on the JNK phosphorylation. AngII-induced p38MAPK activation was similarly inhibited by pretreatment with BB94 (Fig.6 C). The HB-EGF neutralizing antibody also markedly inhibited AngII-induced p38MAPK activation in cultured human VSMC (Fig.6 D). Moreover, two different EGFR kinase inhibitors, AG1478 as well as PD158780, markedly inhibited both AngII- and EGF-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation, whereas they had no significant effect on the activation by the well-known p38MAPK agonist, anisomycin (Fig.7 A). Consistent with our previous publications (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), AngII-induced ERK activation was also markedly inhibited by AG1478. By contrast, AngII-induced JNK activation was not affected by the EGFR inhibitor (Fig. 7 B). These data strongly indicate that, in addition to ERK activation, the metalloprotease-dependent EGFR transactivation involving HB-EGF shedding mediates the p38MAPK activation by AngII in VSMC.Figure 7Involvement of EGFR in AngII-induced p38MAPK activation in VSMC. A, VSMC were pretreated with or without AG1478 (250 nm) or PD158780 (100 nm) for 30 min, and stimulated with AngII (100 nm), EGF (100 ng/ml), or anisomycin (20 μg/ml) for 10 min. B, VSMC were pretreated with AG1478 (250 nm) or its solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.1%) for 30 min and stimulated with AngII (100 nm) for indicated durations. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated by repeated reprobing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major finding of the present study is that AngII-stimulated ERK and p38MAPK activation requires metalloprotease-dependent EGFR transactivation in cultured VSMC, whereas JNK activation does not. In addition, studies using a neutralizing HB-EGF antibody suggest that processing of HB-EGF by the AngII-induced metalloprotease activation is involved in the EGFR transactivation. These data will provide new insight into the signaling mechanism by which AngII orchestrates several transcriptional events that contribute to vascular remodeling as illustrated in Fig.8. The transactivation of the EGFR by GPCRs is an important mechanism that may explain cell growth promotion by GPCRs (7Eguchi S. Inagami T. Regul.

Recently, the metalloprotease-dependent generation of HB-EGF has been reported to mediate the EGFR transactivation (22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) and ERK activation (38Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) by certain GPCRs. In COS-7 cells, insulin-like growth factor 1 also induces HB-EGF-dependent EGFR transactivation through a metalloprotease activation (39Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22583-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that a synthetic metalloprotease inhibitor BB2116 as well as the HB-EGF neutralizing antibody attenuated EGFR transactivation by AngII. The metalloprotease inhibitor BB2116 as well as BB94 also inhibited ERK activation by AngII. The specificity of BB2116 as a synthetic hydroxamate metalloprotease inhibitor that can inhibit processing of membrane-anchored proteins (40Gearing A.J. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 44Dong J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), has been previously published by several researchers, including ourselves. In addition, we have shown that BB2116 had no nonspecific effect on the growth factor receptor signaling (Fig.1 B), the AngII receptor-Gq coupling (Fig.2 B), or AngII-induced nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activation such as PYK2 or JAK2 (Fig. 2 C) further supporting the specificity of BB2116. Taken together, we submit that the metalloprotease-dependent processing of pro-HB-EGF is a point of convergence by which several growth-promoting factors activate ERK by the transactivated EGFR from their respective receptors that cannot directly couple to the ERK cascade. We and others have previously failed to detect the release of endogenous EGFR ligand in response to GPCR agonists (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 22Prenzel N. Zwick E.

EMBO J. 1997; 15: 4597-4605Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we could not detect the release of soluble HB-EGF by AngII in the present study. In general, detection of cell surface processing of endogenous EGFR ligands has proven difficult due to their low levels of expression and the lack of sensitive assays to measure the release of soluble ligands. In the case of GPCR-induced soluble HB-EGF generation, the lack of detection may also be due to cleaved HB-EGF remaining associated with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan matrix, which prevents the immediate release of the growth factor into the conditioned medium. Additionally, AngII-induced EGFR transactivation requires the presence of functional EGFRs, which may immediately bind and internalize the soluble ligand upon its release and therefore greatly decrease the concentration of soluble ligand (36Dempsey P. Coffey R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the inability to detect HB-EGF, our data together with recent findings of GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation reported by other groups (22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 38Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) suggest that pro-HB-EGF processing occurs in response to GPCR activation at the cell surface. The activation mechanism and identity of the metalloprotease mediating the cleavage of pro-HB-EGF leading to the transactivation of EGFR by AngII remains uncertain. The ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) family of metalloproteases is believed to mediate proteolysis of the EGFR ligands precursors (45Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 46Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Among the family, ADAM17/TACE and ADAM9/MDC9 can be inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors (47Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F.

ADAM17/TACE has been shown to cleave pro-transforming growth factor α (50Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ADAM17/TACE knockout mice have a phenotype very similar to that observed in EGFR knockout mice, indicating its possible role in the processing of other EGFR ligands (50Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Recently, ADAM9/MDC9 was shown to mediate PKC-dependent cleavage of pro-HB-EGF (51Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, the PKC-dependent metalloprotease does not contribute to the EGFR transactivation by GPCRs (22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), and our present data showed that BB2116 preferentially inhibited Ca2+-induced but not PMA-stimulated ERK activation. Additionally, Ca2+ influx was shown to stimulate HB-EGF release independent from PKC that was specifically inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitors (52Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with our previous observation and by others that AngII-induced EGFR transactivation is independent of PKC (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

The identification and characterization of the putative Ca2+-sensitive metalloprotease that is indispensable for the EGFR transactivation by AngII must await further investigation. Recently, much progress has been accomplished in defining the signal transduction pathway(s) by which GPCRs activate ERK. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of activation of other MAPKs by GPCRs (19Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 54Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The present results strongly indicate that the metalloprotease-dependent EGFR activation through HB-EGF generation also contributes to p38MAPK activation in the Gq-coupled AT1 receptor cascade in VSMC. A recent publication implicated an Src family tyrosine kinase in p38MAPK activation by Gq (56Nagao M. Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22892-22898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Additionally, p38MAPK activation by AngII in VSMC was shown to involve generation of reactive oxygen species (29Ushio F.M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Because we have previously shown the inducible association of EGFR and c-Src by AngII (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and that c-Src is activated by reactive oxygen species (57Abe J. Berk B.C. Trends. Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), c-Src could be a possible link that connects the transactivated EGFR to p38MAPK in response to AngII in VSMC. Although we showed that PDGF activates JNK, and AngII has been shown to transactivate PDGF receptor (13Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), the involvement of PDGF receptor in AngII-induced JNK activation is unlikely, because AngII failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptor in our VSMC (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

A recent study indicated that a Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinase mediates the JNK activation by AngII in cultured VSMC (30Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the present study showed that intracellular Ca2+ elevation by AngII is sufficient to activate JNK. Thus, a Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinase other than the EGFR (8Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. Herman B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 inhibited VSMC migration and DNA synthesis after arterial injury (58Zempo N.

We and others recently reported that not only AngII (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J.

We have previously demonstrated the existence of a specific AM-binding protein (AMBP-1) in human plasma. In the present study, we developed a nonradioactive ligand blotting assay, which, together with high pressure liquid chromatography/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purification techniques, allowed us to isolate AMBP-1 to homogeneity. The purified protein was identified as human complement factor H. We show that AM/factor H interaction interferes with the established methodology for quantification of circulating AM. Our data suggest that this routine procedure does not take into account the AM bound to its binding protein. In addition, we show that factor H affects AM in vitro functions. It enhances AM-mediated induction of cAMP in fibroblasts, augments the AM-mediated growth of a cancer cell line, and suppresses the bactericidal capability of AM on Escherichia coli. Reciprocally, AM influences the complement regulatory function of factor H by enhancing the cleavage of C3b via factor I. In summary, we report on a potentially new regulatory mechanism of AM biology, the influence of factor H on radioimmunoassay quantification of AM, and the possible involvement of AM as a regulator of the complement cascade.

In summary, we report on a potentially new regulatory mechanism of AM biology, the influence of factor H on radioimmunoassay quantification of AM, and the possible involvement of AM as a regulator of the complement cascade. Human adrenomedullin (AM)1 is a 52-amino acid peptide originally isolated from a human pheochromocytoma and identified as a molecule capable of elevating rat platelet cAMP (1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1993; 192: 553-560Google Scholar). AM belongs to the calcitonin gene peptide superfamily based on its slight homology with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and amylin (1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1993; 192: 553-560Google Scholar). The human mRNA is 1.6 kilobases long and encodes for a predicted 185-amino acid precursor from which two amidated peptides are generated: AM and a second peptide denoted as proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP) (2Kitamura K. Sakata J. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1993; 194: 720-725Google Scholar). The expression of AM has been demonstrated in many tissues and biological fluids such as plasma (3Ichiki Y. Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Matsuo H. Eto T. FEBS Lett... 1994; 338: 6-10Google Scholar), cerebrospinal fluid (4Takahashi K. Sone M. Satoh F. Murakami O. Totsune K. Tanji H. Sato N. Ito H. Mouri T.

Endocrinology.. 1997; 138: 5597-5604Google Scholar), amniotic fluid (6Macri C.J. Martı́nez A. Moody T.W. Gray K.D. Miller M.J. Gallagher M. Cuttitta F. Am. J. Obstet.

Cuttitta F. Peptides.. 2000; 21: 1859-1863Google Scholar). AM has been implicated in the modulation of numerous physiological functions, which include cardiovascular tone, central brain activity, bronchodilation, renal function, hormone secretion, cell growth, differentiation, and immune response (9Martı́nez A. Cuttitta F. Adrenomedullin.IOS Press/Ohmsha. 1998; Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that plasma proteins from several species can specifically bind AM (10Elsasser T.H. Kahl S. Martı́nez A. Montuenga L.M. Pı́o R. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1999; 140: 4908-4911Google Scholar). The existence of these binding proteins was established using a radioligand blotting technique based on a method originally described for the detection of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (11Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem... 1986; 154: 138-143Google Scholar). Most of the species analyzed, including humans, had an AM-binding protein (AMBP) with aM r of 120,000 under nonreducing conditions. Interestingly, the plasma from ruminant species (calf, goat, and sheep) had an additional band of M r 140,000. Whether these proteins are different or represent two glycosylation patterns from the same protein remains to be determined. An analysis of plasma from calves undergoing an acute phase response to a parasitic infection revealed a decrease in the expression of AMBP as compared with uninfected calves (10Elsasser T.H. Kahl S. Martı́nez A. Montuenga L.M. Pı́o R. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1999; 140: 4908-4911Google Scholar), whereas AM levels increased (12Elsasser T.H. Sartin J.L. Martı́nez A. Kahl S. Montuenga L. Pı́o R. Fayer R. Miller M.J. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1999; 140: 5402-5411Google Scholar). The presence of a protein that specifically binds AM and the regulation of its expression in pathological situations may have a critical impact on AM physiology. In this study, we isolate and characterize the human AMBP (AMBP-1) from plasma as complement factor H. We also describe how factor H may interfere with the quantification of AM by conventional radioimmunoassay (RIA) and how both binding partner proteins may modulate their respective biological activities. Nonradioactive labeling was accomplished by conjugation of synthetic AM-(1–52) (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) with fluorescein-5-EX succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Briefly, 100 μg of AM were dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and the succinimidyl ester was added to a final molar concentration ratio of 10:1 (linker:AM). The mixture was incubated with slow agitation for 1 h at room temperature, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, followed by another incubation of 1 h. Labeled AM was mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% alkali-treated casein (ATC) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, and extracted using reverse phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) with 80% acidic isopropyl alcohol as the elution buffer. The extract was lyophilized and reconstituted in 1 ml of TBS containing 0.1% ATC, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Fluorescein-labeled AM was stored at 4 °C for as long as 3 months without significant loss of activity. Proteins from human plasma (2 μl) were electrophoretically fractionated on 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) under nonreducing conditions and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed with 1% Nonidet P-40, blocked with 0.1% ATC in TBS, and incubated with 50 nm fluorescein-labeled AM for 16 h at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. Binding was detected with a primary rabbit anti-fluorescein IgG (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Inc.), a secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:2000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the color-substrate solution. For competition studies with unlabeled peptides, the membrane was preincubated with 5 μm unlabeled ligands at 4 °C for 6 h. Then labeled AM was added, and the membrane was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. AM fragments, PAMP, and CGRP were purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Belmont, CA). Preparative reverse phase HPLC was performed using a Delta Pak C18 300-Å column (30 mm × 30 cm; Waters, Tokyo, Japan) and the “System Gold” modular system (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA). 2.5 ml of human plasma were mixed with an equal volume of 10% acetonitrile with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, processed through a 0.2-μm filter, and loaded onto the column. After 5 min with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 5% acetonitrile, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid from 5 to 60% at a flow rate of 12 ml/min over 60 min. Each fraction (12 ml) was collected, freeze-dried, and dissolved in 0.3 ml of TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Fractions were tested for the presence of AMBP-1 using the nonradioactive ligand blotting technique. Amino acid analysis was performed by The Protein/DNA Technology Center at the Rockefeller University, New York. HPLC (NovaPak C18 30-cm column) with the Waters PicoTag Work station and a two-pump gradient system (model 510) equipped with a model 490 UV multiwavelength detector were used as previously described (13Gharahdaghi F. Atherton D. DeMott M. Mische S.M. Hogue Angeletti R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III.Academic Press, Inc. 1992; : 249-260Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence analysis was performed by the Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Protein Sequencing and Peptide Synthesis Facility (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The sample was subjected to automated Edman degradation using a PE Biosystems Procise 494 Protein Sequencer and a PE Biosystems cLC Microblotter 173, using standard cycles and reagents (14Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem... 1967; 1: 80-91Google Scholar, 15Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer W.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol... 1983; 91: 399-413Google Scholar). After fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (5% β-mercaptoethanol), the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the AMBP-1 band was excised. In-gel protein digestion and peptide extraction were performed as previously described (16Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem... 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). One-tenth of the extracted protein digest was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) prior to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The instrument was operated in reflector mode with the accelerating voltage set to 20,000, the laser energy to 2350, the guide wire voltage to 0.05%, and the grid voltage to 95%. The mirror ratio was set to 1:110. The remainder of the extracted protein digest was injected onto a 0.3 × 100-mm, 5-μm BetaBasic C18 column (Keystone Scientific, Bellafonte, PA), which had been equilibrated with 10% buffer B in buffer A (A: water with 0.1% formic acid; B: acetonitrile with 10% 1-propanol and 0.1% formic acid). Peptide elution was carried out using a linear gradient progressing from 10 to 60% buffer B over 60 min (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments LC10AD/VP pumps and LC10A controller). The eluting peptides were detected by a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest; Finnigan MAT Division, Piscataway, NJ). Peptide sequence data were obtained from the eluting peptides by MS/MS on those ions exceeding a preset threshold of 5 × 104 ions. The operating parameters were as follows: sheath gas flow, = 32, auxiliary gas flow = 1, spray voltage = 4.5 kV, capillary temperature = 200 °C, capillary voltage = 8.0 V, and tube lens offset = −20 V. Proteins were electrophoretically fractionated on a 3–8% Tris acetate (for factor H) or a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (for AM) under nonreducing conditions, transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Afterward, the membrane was incubated with 1:2000 anti-factor H rabbit antibody (Quidel, San Diego, CA) or 1:4000 anti-AM rabbit antibody (17Martı́nez A. Weaver C. López J. Bhathena S.J. Elsasser T.H. Miller M.J. Moody T.W. Unsworth E.J. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1996; 137: 2626-2632Google Scholar) and developed using the ECL Plus Western Blot Detection System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 96-well polyvinyl chloride plate was coated with factor H (5 ng/well; Sigma). The plate was blocked (TBS, 0.1% ATC, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the unlabeled peptides for 2 h. Fluorescein-labeled AM (50 nm) was added, and after a 2-h incubation the assay was developed using an anti-fluorescein polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Inc.) and 125I-Protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. 3 ml of sample were mixed with 1 ml of Protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing a 1 μm final concentration of each of the following protease inhibitors: pefabloc (Centerchem Inc., Stamford, CT), bestatin, and phosphoramidon (Sigma). After 1 h at 4 °C, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was divided and further incubated with 80 μl of rabbit anti-AM (17Martı́nez A. Weaver C. López J. Bhathena S.J. Elsasser T.H. Miller M.J. Moody T.W. Unsworth E.J. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1996; 137: 2626-2632Google Scholar) or rabbit preimmune serum for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose (80 μl) was then added to the mix. After a 30-min incubation, the immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was extensively washed with TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. The final pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of LDS sample buffer (Novex) and boiled before the Western blot analysis. Extraction was performed using reverse-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters) as previously reported (18Lewis L.K. Smith M.W. Yandle T.G. Richards A.M. Nicholls M.G. Clin. Chem... 1998; 44: 571-577Google Scholar, 19Martı́nez A. Elsasser T.H. Bhathena S.J. Pı́o R. Buchanan T.A. Macri C.J. Cuttitta F. Peptides.. 1999; 20: 1471-1478Google Scholar). Briefly, cartridges were activated with 80% methanol and washed with 0.9% NaCl. Plasma samples were mixed with an equal volume of PBS containing 0.1% ATC and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Samples were applied to the columns, and, after washing twice with 0.9% NaCl, AM was eluted with 80% isopropyl alcohol containing 125 mm HCl. Extracts were freeze-dried to remove the organic solvent. Concentrations of AM in the extracts were measured by radioimmunoassay as previously described (19Martı́nez A. Elsasser T.H. Bhathena S.J. Pı́o R. Buchanan T.A. Macri C.J. Cuttitta F. Peptides.. 1999; 20: 1471-1478Google Scholar). Rat-2 fibroblasts were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well and incubated 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Before the assay, cells were incubated in TIS medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 50 nm sodium selenite) for 15 min. Then cells were treated for 5 min with AM (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) and/or factor H (Sigma) in 250 μl of TIS medium containing 1% BSA, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, and 100 μmisobutylmethylxanthine. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol. cAMP was measured using the Biotrac cAMP RIA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding of rat 125I-AM (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) to Rat-2 cells was determined as previously reported (20Coppock H.A. Owji A.A. Austin C. Upton P.D. Jackson M.L. Gardiner J.V. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. Biochem. J... 1999; 338: 15-22Google Scholar). In brief, Rat-2 cells were plated out at 2 × 104 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Confluent cells were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μmphosphoramidon, 0.25 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin) containing 100 pm rat 125I-AM. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer and then dissolved in 1 m NaOH for counting. Nonspecific binding was measured by incubating the cells with a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled AM. The breast cancer cell line T-47D (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). The MTT Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was carried out in serum-free conditions as previously reported (21Iwai N. Martı́nez A. Miller M.J. Vos M. Mulshine J.L. Treston A.M. Lung Cancer.. 1999; 23: 209-222Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1–2 × 104 cells/well, and appropriate concentrations of the indicated compounds were added. After 5 days of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humid incubator, the MTT colorimetric assay was carried out following the instructions from the manufacturer. The plate was read at a wavelength of 540 nm. Eight independent wells per treatment were averaged. The antimicrobial activity was measured using Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218, Gaithersburg, MD) and a radial diffusion assay as previously described (22Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods.. 1991; 137: 167-173Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were incorporated into a thin underlay gel that contained 1% agarose, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.3 mg/ml of trypticase soy broth powder. After polymerization, small wells of 10 μl of capacity were carved in the agar. Test substances were added and allowed to diffuse for 3 h at 37 °C. A 10-ml overlay gel composed of 1% agarose and 6% trypticase soy broth powder was poured on top of the previous gel, and the plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The diameters of the inhibition halos were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm and, after subtracting the diameter of the well, were expressed in inhibition units (10 units = 1 mm). We estimated the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by performing a linear regression and determining the x intercepts. C3b (28 pmol) was incubated with factor I (0.16 pmol) and factor H (0.16 pmol) in the presence or absence of AM and related peptides for 24 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 50 μl of PBS. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–12% Tris-Bis gels (Novex) under reducing conditions and Coomassie Blue staining. C3b and factor I were purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). The MTT assay values and the MIC values were analyzed by the Student's t test. cAMP values were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test.p < 0.05 was considered significant. Using the radioligand blotting technique originally described by Hossenlopp et al. (11Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem... 1986; 154: 138-143Google Scholar), we have previously demonstrated that human plasma contains at least one adrenomedullin-binding protein (AMBP-1) with M r120,000 under nonreducing conditions (10Elsasser T.H. Kahl S. Martı́nez A. Montuenga L.M. Pı́o R. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1999; 140: 4908-4911Google Scholar). In the present study, we have developed a nonradioactive ligand blotting assay. Our initial approach included the labeling of AM with three different reporters: biotin, fluorescein, or dinitrophenyl. With all of these tracers, we were able to detect AMBP-1 in human plasma (data not shown). We discarded the use of the biotinylated AM reagent due to the possible interference with avidin- or biotin-like proteins present in plasma; this problem has already been described in the development of a nonradioactive ligand blotting assay for insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) using biotinylated insulin-like growth factor I (23Grulich-Henn J. Spiess S. Heinrich U. Schonberg D. Bettendorf M. Horm. Res... 1998; 49: 1-7Google Scholar). The procedure using fluorescein-labeled AM gave a better signal/noise ratio than the dinitrophenyl tag and was used for the evaluation of AMBP-1 expression. Fig.1 A compares the radioligand blotting using 125I-AM or fluorescein-labeled AM. One band with M r 120,000 was visualized in both systems; however, the nonradioactive technique resulted in sharper band definition. To demonstrate the specificity of the assay, fluorescein-labeled AM was incubated with 5 μm AM, the gene-related peptide PAMP, and the structurally related peptide CGRP (Fig. 1 B). Only AM was able to displace the nonradioactive tracer. When the competition was carried out with different fragments of AM, only the intact AM molecule reduced the binding (Fig.1 C). Human plasma (2.5 ml) was fractionated by reverse phase HPLC (Fig.2 A). Each fraction was tested for the presence of AMBP-1 using the nonradioactive ligand blotting technique. AMBP-1 was revealed in fractions 48–51 (Fig.2 C). Glycoprotein staining of AMBP-1 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed that AMBP-1 was glycosylated (Fig.3 A). Isoelectric focusing showed a pI 6 for the protein (Fig. 3 B). For the identification of purified AMBP-1, we used three different techniques: total amino acid analysis, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. Table I shows the amino acid composition of AMBP-1. A data base search revealed complement factor H as the protein with the highest degree of similarity to this composition profile. The amino acid composition of factor H is also shown in TableI. The percentage of methionine was lower than expected; however, the recovery of methionine in the case of bovine serum albumin, used as a control protein, was approximately half of the expected value. The analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of AMBP-1 yielded a mix of at least two main N-terminal sequences; the data base search gave us again factor H as the protein with highest homology. The sequence of the 15 amino acids analyzed was identical to the N-terminal sequence of factor H with the exception of the threonine in position 12. Furthermore, a new search with the amino acids obtained from the segment peptide that did not correspond to the N terminus of factor H showed a 65% homology with an internal sequence of factor H (residues 578–592), suggesting that this secondary sequence could correspond to factor H fragmentation. Finally, the peptide masses obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry after tryptic digestion of AMBP-1 corresponded unequivocally to the tryptic digestion of factor H, with the detected peptides covering 21.8% of the total factor H sequence. MS/MS applied to the ion with a molecular mass of 1396.62 Da yielded the sequence, confirmed by both the b and the yseries, of 10 out of the 12 amino acids from the fragment 737–748 in the factor H molecule.Figure 3Biochemical characterization of AMBP-1 as human factor H.

Open table in a new tab The amino acid composition of factor H was obtained from the protein sequence database SWISS-PROT (accession number: P08603). To further confirm that AMBP-1 was in fact factor H, we analyzed the ability of anti-factor H antibody to recognize AMBP-1 by Western blot detection. AMBP-1 was immunoreactive for this antibody, giving a band of M r 120,000 under nonreducing conditions, an identical size to that of commercially available human factor H (Fig.3 C). Moreover, with nonradioactive ligand blotting using fluorescein-labeled AM, we demonstrated that factor H binds to AM (Fig.3 D). Under reducing conditions, AMBP-1 had aM r of 150,000 (Fig. 3 A), which corresponds to the M r reported for factor H in such conditions (24Whaley K. Ruddy S. J. Exp. Med... 1976; 144: 1147-1163Google Scholar). The reduction of the disulfur bonds prevented the binding of AMBP-1 to the fluorescein-labeled AM (Fig.3 E). Finally, we carried out binding assays of fluorescein-labeled AM to immobilized factor H. Fig. 3 F shows the competitive displacement with unlabeled AM that could not be achieved with either CGRP or PAMP. We previously reported that the C18 reverse-phase separation technique used to prepare plasma for AM RIA analysis effectively eliminates AMBP-1 from the extract (10Elsasser T.H. Kahl S. Martı́nez A. Montuenga L.M. Pı́o R. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology.. 1999; 140: 4908-4911Google Scholar). In the present work, we confirmed this observation by analyzing the presence of factor H in plasma before and after the C18 extraction. When plasma is processed through the C18 column, factor H is obtained in the unbound portion of the sample and not in the fraction used for AM quantification (Fig.4 A). Based on this observation, we tested the possibility that a certain amount of AM may pass through the column bound to factor H. For that purpose, 1 ml of human plasma was processed through the column, and both the bound and unbound extracts were recovered. We immunoprecipitated AM from the extracts and determined its presence by Western blotting. AM was detected in both the unbound and the bound fractions (Fig.4 B), suggesting that the traditional procedure used for peptide purification does not recover the total amount of AM present in plasma. Western blot after immunoprecipitation in the absence of extract did not yield any band, excluding the possibility that AM comes from the rabbit anti-AM serum (data not shown). Disruption of AM/factor H interaction demonstrated a second source of AM in the plasma that was not routinely accounted for by traditional C18 purification procedures prior to RIA determination. A ligand blotting was performed with purified AMBP-1. After incubation with fluorescein-labeled AM, we tested several conditions for the dissociation of the binding between AM and factor H. For that purpose, the membrane was cut in strips and washed six times for 10 min each under the different conditions. Finally, the strips were equilibrated again in the assay buffer, and the ligand blotting was developed (Fig.5 A). Extreme conditions such as acidic pH and high salt concentration did not dissociate the interaction of factor H with AM. However, the incubation of the blot with labeled AM in those conditions effectively avoided the interaction (data not shown). One of the treatments that disrupted the binding was basic pH; however, further experiments indicated that this effect could in fact correspond to an artifact, since this extreme pH alters the structure of the fluorescein and doing so negates its affinity for the anti-fluorescein antibody (data not shown). Using the binding assay in a 96-well plate, we further analyzed the dissociating ability of the chaotropic agent sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN)."

Recently, we have identified lipid raft association as a novel mechanism for the subcellular sorting of specific voltage-gated K+channels to regions of the membrane rich in signaling complexes. Here, we demonstrate isoform-specific targeting of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels to distinct lipid raft populations with the finding that Kv1.5 specifically targets to caveolae. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 exist in distinct raft domains: 1) channel/raft association shows differential sensitivity to increasing concentrations of Triton X-100; 2) unlike Kv2.1, Kv1.5 colocalizes with caveolin on the cell surface and redistributes with caveolin following microtubule disruption; and 3) immunoisolation of caveolae copurifies Kv1.5 channel. Both depletion of cellular cholesterol and inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis alter Kv1.5 channel function by inducing a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. The differential targeting of Kv channel subtypes to caveolar and noncaveolar rafts within a single membrane represents a unique mechanism of compartmentalization, which may permit isoform-specific modulation of K+ channel function.

Voltage-gated K+(Kv)1 channels play an important role in setting the resting membrane potential and determining repolarization in these functionally diverse systems. In addition, Kv channels are involved in the regulation of membrane potential in both T-lymphocytes and pancreatic β cells (1Roe M.W. Worley III, J.F. Mittal A.A. Kuznetsov A. DasGupta S. Mertz R.J. Witherspoon III, S.M. Blair N. Lancaster M.E. McIntyre M.S. Shehee W.R. Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Given their diverse role, it is not surprising that Kv channels comprise the largest and most diverse class of ion channels. Multiple Kv channel gene families (Kv1–Kv9) have been identified that give rise to more than 40 mammalian isoforms. Most tissues, and even single cells, express multiple channel types belonging to one or more subfamilies. Importantly, the subcellular localization of these different channel isoforms is often necessary for proper cell function and signaling. Although progress has been made in identifying elements involved in channel targeting, clustering, and anchoring, it is not yet clear how the number and location of channel complexes within the plane of the membrane are determined or how this compartmentalization affects channel function. Historically, K+ channel targeting and localization is believed to primarily involve protein-protein interactions between channels and PDZ domain containing scaffolding proteins or the actin cytoskeleton (3Sheng M. Kim E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Johnson B.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 203-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Kv channels differentially target to specialized microdomains, termed lipid rafts, within the plane of the plasma membrane, suggesting that protein-lipid interactions should be considered as a mechanism of Kv channel localization (5Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The term “lipid raft” is used to describe membrane microdomains rich in tightly packed cholesterol and sphingolipids. Two defining characteristics of these lipid microdomains are resistance to detergent solubilization and a low buoyant density (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Biochemical isolation of raft domains has demonstrated that certain proteins target to these subcellular compartments, whereas others are excluded. The presence or absence of proteins is used to define different types of lipid rafts (7Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Caveolae represent one well studied subpopulation of lipid rafts that contain the scaffolding protein, caveolin. Caveolin can bind, organize, and sometimes functionally regulate proteins within the lipid raft complex (8Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 9Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The emerging picture of the coexistence of multiple raft populations, containing diverse proteins or different ratios of similar proteins, within a single membrane provides a unique mechanism of functional regulation based on spatial organization. Here, we demonstrate isoform-specific localization of voltage-gated K+ channels to distinct lipid raft populations with the finding that Kv1.5 specifically targets to caveolae. The polyclonal anti-Kv2.1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-caveolin polyclonal, which recognizes caveolin isoforms 1, 2, and 3, was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit antiserum against the NH2-terminal region of Kv1.5 was produced in the Tamkun laboratory using a glutathione transferase fusion protein containing 112 amino acids of the NH2-terminal Kv1.5 channel sequence (10Mays D.J.

Low density, Triton-insoluble complexes were isolated as described by Lisanti and co-workers (12Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) from mouse L-cells stably expressing either rat Kv1.5 or Kv2.1 channels under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter (13Hulme J.T. Coppock E.A. Felipe A. Martens J.R. Tamkun M.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Snyders D.J. Knoth K.M. Roberds S.L. Tamkun M.M. Mol. Pharm. 1992; 41: 322-330PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from ten 100-mm near-confluent culture dishes were homogenized in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, and sucrose was added to a final concentration of 40%. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was layered on top of this detergent extract followed by ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm) for 18–20 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Gradient fractions (600 μl) were collected from the top and analyzed by Western blot. Sucrose gradient fractions were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was incubated with the Kv1.5, Kv2.1, or caveolin antibodies (1:500, 1:500, and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively). Bound primary antibody was detected with a 1:3,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and the Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent according to manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immune purification of caveolae was performed as previously described with a few modifications (15Badizadegan K. Dickinson B.L. Wheeler H.E. Blumberg R.S. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G895-G904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton X-100 was used to solubilize Kv1.5-containing rafts from stably expressing L-cells. Following sucrose gradient sedimentation, floating membranes were collected and pooled. Sample was diluted with Mes-buffered saline (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15m NaCl) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and precleared with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were then removed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The sample was then incubated overnight with anti-caveolin antibodies (5 ng/ml) at 4 °C with gently mixing. 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose were then added to each sample for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then removed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Immunostaining of cells was performed using Kv1.5 antiserum and/or anti-caveolin antibodies as described previously (10Mays D.J. Foose J.M. Philipson L.H. Tamkun M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on gelatin-coated coverslips were fixed with methanol and incubated with primary antibody followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The bound Kv1.5 antibody was detected with BODIPY-conjugated streptavidin, and the anti-caveolin antibody was detected with CY3-conjugated streptavidin. Fluorescent signals were collected using a Nikon E800 microscope equipped with standard epifluorescence and a Princeton Instruments CCD camera. Demecolcine (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma) was dissolved in the culture medium. For antibody-induced patching experiments, gelatin-coated coverslips with nonfixed cells were incubated in their culture dishes with the S1-S2 Kv1.5 antiserum (diluted 1:1000 in HEPES-based culture medium) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were taken through three 2-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 1.5 h with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:500 in culture medium. Another series of washes with phosphate-buffered saline was followed by incubation for 30 min with CY3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:500 in culture medium. Following three 2-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and stained with monoclonal caveolin-1 antibodies. A BODIPY-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used for visualization. Electrophysiological recordings and data analysis were made as described previously using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (13Hulme J.T. Coppock E.A. Felipe A. Martens J.R. Tamkun M.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The steady-state inactivation was measured using a 10-s conditioning pulse to various potentials followed by 250-ms test steps to +50 mV. Because Kv1.5 shows incomplete inactivation, data were normalized after subtraction of the non-inactivating fraction at the test potential (16Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 513-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Additional details are presented in the figure legends. A defining characteristic of lipid rafts is their resistance to solubilization in nonionic detergents and relative buoyancy because of an enriched lipid content (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). We isolated low density, Triton X-100-insoluble complexes from mouse Ltk− cells (L-cells) stably expressing Kv1.5 channel protein. Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient fractions probed with anti-Kv1.5 antibodies demonstrates that Kv1.5 floats in a low density, 1% Triton-insoluble fraction together with caveolin (Fig.1 A). As previously reported, this is also true for L-cells stably expressing Kv2.1, a member of theShab family of voltage-gated K+ channels (5Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To facilitate comparison, these data have been reproduced in thelower two panels of Fig. 1 A. Although cells stably expressed channel protein, the extent of cell surface expression varied between individual cells. In the case of the Kv1.5 cell line, channel expression was often very high and resulted in the intracellular accumulation of protein (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The percentage of channel in the nonraft fractions at the bottom of the gradient most likely represents overexpressed intracellular protein. The percentage of nonraft channel varied between clonal cell lines and induction times and correlates with the amount of intracellular protein as determined by immunostaining (Fig.1 B, top panels). However, cell surface channel expression was easily detectable, and nanoampere currents could be recorded from both the Kv1.5- and Kv2.1-expressing cell lines (Fig.1 B, bottom panels). The localization of Kv1.5 and caveolin to light membrane fractions was also confirmed using a detergent-free method of raft isolation (data not shown and Ref.17Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The detergent-to-protein ratio affects recovery of raft-localized proteins (18Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and has been exploited to describe the nature of raft association (19Parkin E.T. Hussain I. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2179-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of increasing Triton X-100 concentrations on Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 raft association. As shown in Fig.1 C, Kv1.5 remains raft-associated together with caveolin following extraction with 2.5% Triton X-100. Even though the signals were detected in a greater number of floating fractions, the two protein peaks were symmetrical within the sucrose gradient. In contrast, the Kv2.1 channel protein is partially solubilized by the increased detergent concentration and no longer cofractionates with caveolin (Fig. 1, compare A and C). The differential sensitivity to detergent extraction suggests that the two proteins may exist in different raft populations. We recently reported that Kv2.1 associates with a noncaveolar lipid raft (5Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In that report, it was shown that Kv2.1 channel protein does not internalize with caveolin after microtubule disruption. In Fig. 2, we show that Kv1.5 channel protein redistributes together with caveolin after treatment with colcemide (100 ng/ml). Fig. 2 C shows a DIC image of morphologically altered L-cells following disruption of the microtubules. In these cells, the Kv1.5 was retracted from the cell surface (Fig. 2 D). This was also true for the caveolin protein (Fig. 2 H) in which colcemide treatment disrupted the normal cell surface distribution and resulted in internalization of the protein. Although this experiment suggests an association of Kv1.5 and caveolae, it may simply reflect a dependence of both proteins on microtubule organization. Therefore, additional experiments were performed to demonstrate association. Overexpression of channel protein often results in a uniform distribution of cell surface protein, which is often difficult to resolve with conventional microscopic techniques. To improve resolution, we performed antibody-induced patching experiments using an antibody directed against an extracellular epitope of the Kv1.5 channel. L-cells stably expressing Kv1.5 channel protein were incubated at room temperature with polyclonal anti-Kv1.5 antibody directed against the S1-S2 linker region for 1 h. Cross-linking was performed using biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and detected with fluorophor-conjugated streptavidin. Punctate cell surface patches of Kv1.5 protein were observed (Fig.3 B). The cells were then fixed and immunostained with monoclonal anti-caveolin antibodies (Fig.3 C). An overlay of the two images (Fig. 3 D) shows complete overlap of Kv1.5 and caveolin. The enlarged area displayed in Fig. 3 E shows the extent of colocalization of the two proteins (yellow). Immunoprecipitation experiments using membranes from stably transfected L-cells solubilized with n-octyl-glucoside failed to demonstrate direct protein-protein interaction between Kv1.5 and caveolin (data not shown). This is not surprising because Kv1.5 lacks a caveolin-binding motif (20Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitations under nonsolubulizing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) with anti-caveolin antibodies as described by other investigators (21Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 23Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Raft-containing gradient fractions from L-cells stably expressing Kv1.5 protein were pooled and incubated with polyclonal anti-caveolin antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then used to isolate caveolar rafts. After extensive washing, bound material was eluted with SDS sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed for Kv1.5 content via Western blot analysis. Western analysis of membranes probed with Kv1.5 antiserum from nontransfected and stably transfected L-cells (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 2) were used as controls for the Kv1.5 signal. Lane 3 of Fig. 4 shows the presence of Kv1.5 in the starting raft fraction from which immunoisolation was performed, and lane 4 shows Kv1.5 immunoprecipitation with the caveolin antibody. The arrow points to bands representing Kv1.5. Lipid rafts containing Kv1.5 did not nonspecifically bind to the beads as indicated in lane 5, where the anti-caveolin antibody was omitted. In addition, the caveolin antibodies specifically detected raft-associated caveolin protein (data not shown). Note the absence of the high molecular weight band in the starting material. This was characteristic of all experiments performed and suggests that post-translational processing of the channel protein in the fibroblasts affects caveolae association. These results suggest that although there does not exist a direct protein-protein interaction between Kv1.5 and caveolin, the channel protein does immunoisolate with protein-lipid complexes that contain caveolin. This result raises the issue initially put forth by Johnson (4Johnson B.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 203-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed here experimentally that what are now considered direct protein interactions should be assumed to include the possibility of a lipid intermediary where direct binding has not been clearly demonstrated. The structure of lipid rafts is dependent on the tight packing of cholesterol and sphingolipids (24Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Agents that bind and/or extract raft lipids have been shown to alter the function of raft-associated proteins (24Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). We have shown that depletion of cellular cholesterol modifies noncaveolar, raft-associated Kv2.1 channel function but does not affect Kv4.2, which is not localized to lipid rafts (5Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether disruption of raft lipids affects caveolar-associated Kv1.5 function. Treatment of cells stably expressing Kv1.5 with 2% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-modifying agent, for 2 h altered the steady-state activation and inactivation properties of Kv1.5 (Fig. 5). Although current density was not affected, the activation and inactivation curves were shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction. TheV 12for activation (−17.8 ± 1.3 mV,k = 11.4 ± 1.1) and inactivation (−27.8 ± 0.8 mV, k = −9.1 ± 0.7) under control conditions were shifted by ∼10 mV (−27.8 ± 1.1 mV, k = 8.0 ± 0.9, and 37.2 ± 0.5 mV, k = −6.0 ± 0.4, respectively) following cyclodextrin treatment. Treatment with fumonisin B, which inhibits steps in the biosynthetic pathway of sphingomyelin, has been used to deplete sphingolipids (25Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells for 72 h with 25 μm fumonisin B produced results similar to those observed with cholesterol depletion (Fig. 5). The V 12for steady-state activation was shifted from −16.2 ± 1.3 mV, k = 11.9 ± 1.1 to −26.9 ± 1.1 mV, k = 8.7 ± 1.0 after treatment with fumonisin B. Similarly, the steady-state inactivation curve was also shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction fromV 12equal to −28.3 ± 0.7 mV,k = −8.8 ± 0.6 to −40.4 ± 0.4 mV,k = −5.4 ± 0.3 with depletion of sphingolipids. Acute application of either cyclodextrin or fumonisin B in the bath solution did not affect channel function. In addition, neither intervention affected the properties of Kv4.2, a nonraft associated channel (data not shown). These data show that altering raft structure affects the function of caveolae-associated Kv channels. A role for the Kv channel COOH terminus in functional cell surface expression has been suggested (26Bentley G.N. Brooks M.A. O'Neill C.A. Findlay J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1418: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, a COOH-terminal motif that influences processing and cell surface expression of Kv1.5 was identified at residues 593–598 (27Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We tested the importance of the Kv1.5 COOH terminus in lipid raft association using a deletion mutant in which the last 57 COOH-terminal amino acids were removed. Thus, this mutant lacks both the PDZ binding motif and the motif at residues 593–596. Stable expression of the Δ57 Kv1.5 mutant in mouse L-cells produced nanoampere currents with wild-type kinetics and amplitude (28Uebele V.N. Yeola S.W. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As predicted, the electrophoretic mobility of this truncation mutant (Fig.6 A, lane 1) is altered compared with wild-type Kv1.5 (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). Importantly, the COOH-terminal truncation did not affect lipid raft association (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the signal for Kv1.5 raft association does not reside in the COOH terminus of the channel. Previously, we demonstrated that Kv2.1, a member of theShab family of voltage-gated K+ channels, targeted to noncaveolar lipid rafts, whereas Kv4.2 is not raft associated in mouse L-cells. Here we report for the first time that a member of the mammalian Shaker family, Kv1.5, targets to caveolar rafts in this same cell type. Biochemical and immunohistochemical evidence demonstrate that Kv1.5 is localized in caveolae in the transfected fibroblasts. Kv1.5 cofractionates with caveolin in low density Triton X-100 insoluble raft fractions, but unlike Kv2.1 expressed in the same cell system, the symmetrical peak of Kv1.5 and caveolin proteins is maintained with increased stringency of membrane solubilization. In addition, Kv1.5 colocalizes with caveolin on the cell surface and redistributes with caveolin following microtubule disruption. Finally, immunoisolation of caveolae using caveolin antibodies demonstrates that Kv1.5 channel protein copurifies with intact caveolae. Our results suggest that within a single cell type there exist mechanisms for the differential sorting of Kv channel isoforms to unique lipid microdomains. Given that the protein content of a lipid raft is currently used to distinguish between raft subtypes, it follows that protein-protein interactions may be a mechanism of isoform-specific recruiting of proteins to distinct raft populations. Caveolin, for example, is a scaffolding protein that can bind and assemble multiple signaling molecules in a large complex (9Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). One recent example is the caveolin-mediated association of Ca2+-signaling proteins and the human Trp1 channel (29Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has demonstrated that caveolin binding is a prerequisite for lipid raft association. Regardless, the results of our immunoisolation experiments indicate that Kv1.5 is associated with intact caveolae, but we cannot demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between caveolin and channel protein (see “Results”). In addition, Kv1.5 sequence does not contain any known caveolin binding motifs (20Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that the caveolin protein is responsible for targeting Kv1.5 to caveolae. Much of the past work on the spatial organization of ion channels has focused on interactions between ion channels and scaffolding proteins. Great emphasis has been placed on the role of PDZ domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK), such as PSD-95, in the targeting and localization of ion channels (30Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that palmitoylated PSD-95 and PSD-93 may function as a lipid raft scaffolding protein, similar to caveolin (31El Husseini A.E. Topinka J.R. Lehrer-Graiwer J.E. Firestein B.L. Craven S.E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23904-23910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fact that Kv1.5 sequence contains a consensus PDZ binding domain, but the Kv2.1 channel does not, makes the possibility of channel binding to endogenous PDZ proteins an attractive candidate for the isoform-specific localization of the two channels to different lipid microdomains. However, the Kv1.5 COOH-terminal truncation shown in Fig. 6 removes the only known PDZ-binding site on the channel but does not affect lipid raft association. Therefore, PDZ proteins are not likely to be responsible for raft localization. In addition, this truncation removes the 5-amino acid COOH-terminal motif identified in Kv1 subunits that reportedly influences membrane localization (27Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the mechanism of lipid raft association is independent of this amino acid sequence. The phosphorylation of ion channels is thought to be one of the key regulatory mechanisms of membrane excitability. Not surprisingly, channel complexes are basally and transiently phosphorylated/dephosphorylated by a variety of modulatory enzymes (32Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because rafts localize a number of signaling proteins such as protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, nitrogen-oxide synthase, Ha-Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and G-proteins (33Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar), channel/raft association could serve primarily to cluster signaling molecules with their K+ channel substrates. The isoform-specific targeting of Kv channels to distinct lipid raft subpopulations, with unique protein compositions, would allow for differential regulation while preventing cross-talk between competing pathways. Several recent reports emphasize the importance of compartmentalization of ion channels and signaling molecules (34An R. Heath B.M. Higgins J.P. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Kass R.S. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 516: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Nakata H. Schaack J. Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For example, An et al. (34An R. Heath B.M. Higgins J.P. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Kass R.S. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 516: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have reported that in developing cardiac muscle, the electrophysiological consequences of β2-adrenergic receptor-induced stimulation of cAMP is dependent on compartmentalization with L-type Ca2+ channels. Although not yet shown for the cardiac Ca2+ channel, both β2-adrenergic receptors and adenylyl cyclase localize to caveolae in cardiac myocytes (36Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Clearly, the partitioning of K+ channels and regulatory signaling elements within the same subcellular microdomains provides for efficient coupling and rapid signaling. It is possible that the functional effects of raft disruption reported here are a consequence of altered signaling,i.e. kinase/phosphatase disruption. Although fumonisin B has been used in the raft literature to deplete sphingolipids, its mechanism of action is to inhibit ceramide synthase. Lipid rafts/caveolae are believed to be highly localized sites for the initiation of ceramide signaling pathways (37Dobrowsky R.T. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been reported that in fibroblasts ∼50% of cellular ceramide is localized in caveolae fractions (38Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ceramide has been shown to decrease Kv1.3 channel current in T-lymphocytes (39Gulbins E. Szabo I. Baltzer K. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7661-7666Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the observed functional effects on Kv1.5 are mediated through caveolae-associated ceramide signaling pathways. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase signaling cascades are also believed to initiate from lipid raft domains (37Dobrowsky R.T. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Kv1.5 channel activity is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in heterologous expression systems and cultured Schwann cells (40Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R.B. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41Sobko A. Peretz A. Attali B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4723-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the functional changes illustrated in Fig. 5 could be due to direct effects of altered lipid on channel activity, for charged lipids produce a surface potential. Disruption of raft lipid via cholesterol depletion or inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis could in theory alter the surface charge and affect channel function. However, the magnitude of an effect of altered bilayer charge on potential-dependent channel parameters remains unknown. Given that the Debye length for electrostatic interactions under physiological conditions (estimated at 9 Å) is shorter than the predicted dimensions of the channel protein (42Elinder F. Liu Y. Arhem P. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 43Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5747) Google Scholar), the gating charges of the channel appear to be partially insulated from surrounding bilayer charge. Therefore, the channel may not sense the full value of the surface potential in the charged lipid. According to Arhem, a pure surface charge effect predicts that thet 12(V), time to half-maximum currentversus potential, and the G(V), conductance versus potential, curves shift equally (44Elinder F. Madeja M. Arhem P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This was not the case for the effects of cyclodextrin on Kv1.5 (data not shown). Regardless of the mechanism, the effects are raft-specific, for neither cyclodextrin nor fumonisin B had functional effects on Kv4.2, which is not raft-localized. Future experiments will address the mechanism of lipid disruption on the function of raft-associated channels. In conclusion, we show for the first time localization of a voltage-dependent K+ channel, Kv1.5, to caveolar membranes. These results, together with our previous published work (5Martens J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2012594643,"The Btk family kinases represent new members of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which include Btk/Atk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx/Etk, and Tec. They are characterized by having four structural modules: PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, SH2 (Src homology 2) domain and kinase (Src homology 1) domain. Increasing evidence suggests that, like Src-family kinases, Btk family kinases play central but diverse modulatory roles in various cellular processes. They participate in signal transduction in response to virtually all types of extracellular stimuli which are transmitted by growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, antigen-receptors and integrins. They are regulated by many non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src, Jak, Syk and FAK family kinases. In turn, they regulate many of major signaling pathways including those of PI3K, PLCγ and PKC. Both genetic and biochemical approaches have been used to dissect the signaling pathways and elucidate their roles in growth, differentiation and apoptosis. An emerging new role of this family of kinases is cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility. The physiological importance of these kinases was amply demonstrated by their link to the development of immunodeficiency diseases, due to germ-line mutations. The present article attempts to review the structure and functions of Btk family kinases by summarizing our current knowledge on the interacting partners associated with the different modules of the kinases and the diverse signaling pathways in which they are involved."

The expression pattern ofmeltrin β during mouse development coincided well with that of neuregulin-1 (NRG), a member of the epidermal growth factor family. Then we examined whether meltrin β participates in the proteolytic processing of membrane-anchored NRGs. When NRG-β1 was expressed in mouse L929 cells, its extracellular domain was constitutively processed and released into the culture medium. This basal processing activity was remarkably potentiated by overexpression of wild-type meltrin β, which lead to the significant decrease in the cell surface exposure of extracellular domains of NRG-β1. Furthermore, expression of protease-deficient mutants of meltrin β exerted dominant negative effects on the basal processing of NRG-β1. These results indicate that meltrin β participates in the processing of NRG-β1. Since meltrin β affected the processing of NRG-β4 but not that of NRG-α2, meltrin β was considered to have a preference for β-type NRGs as substrate.

The actions of these molecules are regulated not only by transcriptional and translational controls but also by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylations and proteolytic processings. Numerous membrane-anchored signaling molecules are subjected to proteolytic processing to release their extracellular domains. Such modifications may cause qualitative and irreversible changes in the functions of these molecules.

These findings strongly suggest potential roles of ADAM metalloproteases in the proteolytic processing of various membrane-anchored proteins. Previously, our group and C. P.

Meltrin β consists of multiple domains including prodomain, metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, cysteine-rich domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail. During mouse embryogenesis,meltrin β mRNA is markedly expressed in craniofacial and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and ventral horns of the spinal cord, where peripheral neuronal cell lineages differentiate (16Kurisaki T. Masuda A. Osumi N. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and intestine also express meltrinβ mRNA transiently (16Kurisaki T. Masuda A. Osumi N. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These expression patterns of meltrin β coincide well with that of neuregulin-1 (NRG) (17Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S.

NRGs (also known as acetylcholine receptor inducing activity, glial growth factor, heregulin or neu differentiation factor) are a group of growth factors that are members of the EGF family. NRGs mediate an array of biological effects, including the synthesis of acetylcholine receptors in skeletal muscle (19Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and the stimulation of Schwann cell growth (17Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O.

Gene disruption studies indicate that NRGs are essential for early heart and central nervous system development (22Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 378: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). A variety of different protein isoforms are produced from the single NRG gene via alternative splicing mechanisms. All isoforms contain an EGF-like domain sufficient for biological activity. Although alternatively spliced transcripts also generate some secreted isoforms (17Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M. McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), most soluble NRGs are derived from membrane-anchored precursor proteins via proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular region including EGF-like domain. It has been reported that this processing occurs in intracellular organellas (23Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the processing enzyme remains elusive. In this study, we examined whether meltrin β participates in the processing of membrane-anchored NRGs. First, both meltrin β and NRG proteins were expressed in DRG neurons at the same stages of mouse embryogenesis. Next, overexpression of wild-type meltrin β significantly increased the release of soluble NRGs in culture medium and decreased the cell surface expression of the extracellular domains of NRG-β1. Furthermore, the processing of NRGs was abrogated by expression of protease-deficient mutants of meltrin β. Finally, the enhanced processing of NRGs by meltrin β was blocked by the treatment with brefeldin A but not by monensin, which suggested the action of meltrin β in the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, we concluded that meltrin β (or similar ADAM proteases) participates in the cleavage of membrane-anchored NRGs. Anti-meltrin β antiserum used in this study was raised in rabbits against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide (PEYRSQRVGAIISSKI) corresponding to the extreme C-terminal sequence of meltrin β. E12.5 mouse embryos were dissected, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated in PBS containing 20% sucrose at 4 °C overnight, and embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Miles Inc.) on a dry ice block. Cryosections (6 μm in thickness) on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides were prepared and fixed for 5 min in acetone at −20 °C. Antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber in PBS containing 10% heat-inactivated normal goat serum at the following dilutions: anti-meltrin β antiserum, 1:300; anti-NRG Ab-3 (NeoMarker), 1:300, and anti-neurofilament 160 (NF160, Sigma), 1:500. The slides were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), then incubated in secondary antibodies in PBS containing 10% heat-inactivated normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times in PBST and mounted with PERMAFLOUR (Immunotech). The anti-meltrin β and anti-NRG immunoreactivities were amplified using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 or 1:1000 dilution, Vector Laboratories) and streptavidine-Cy3 (1:500 or 1:1000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for the anti-NF160 immunoreactivity. Imaging was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE inverted confocal microscope using ×10 and ×40 objectives (Leica) and TCS-NT software (Leica). P19 rat embryonic carcinoma cells were cultured in minimum essential medium α medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse L929 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. To induce differentiation, P19 cells were cultured on bacterial grade dishes to form aggregates for 4 days in the presence of 1 μm retinoic acid (Sigma) and then replated on tissue culture grade dishes in growing medium. mRNA was extracted from P19 cells using Micro-FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Two ng of mRNA was subjected to one RT-PCR reaction. Reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR reactions were performed using an annealing temperature of 50 °C for 20 cycles (NRG and meltrin β) or 55 °C for 15 cycles (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Signals are roughly proportional to the amount of cDNA under these conditions. The following primer pairs were used: 5′-ACATCAACATCCACGACTGGGACCAGCCATCT-3′ and 5′-GCAGTAGGCCACCACACACATGATGCC-3′ (NRG), 5′-GCGGAATTCGGAGGCCGGAGGTGTGGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GGCGTCGACGGTGCCATCCATCTGATAATA-3′ (meltrin β), 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The full-length mouse NRG cDNAs were isolated using the primers corresponding to the nucleotide sequences (5′-GGCTCTAGACATGTCTGAGCGCAAAGAAGGCAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCTAGATTATACAGCAATAGGGTCTTGGTTAGC-3′) from murine neonatal muscle and E12.5 mouse embryo trunk cDNAs. The mouse NRG cDNAs were fused with a synthetic DNA cassette coding for the hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tag (MYPYDVPDYA) and subcloned into pEF-BOS, which has the promoter region of the human EF-1α chromosomal gene (24Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar), to obtain pEF-BOS-HA-NRGs. A couple of protease-deficient (E347Q and H346A,H350A) meltrin β cDNAs and a metalloprotease domain-deleted (ΔMP) meltrin β cDNA were constructed by mutagenesis based on a PCR technique using mutated primers. In E347Q mutant meltrin β, glutamine is substituted for the conserved glutamic acid at position 347. In H346A,H350A mutant meltrin β, alanines are substituted for the conserved histidines at positions 346 and 350. In ΔMP meltrin β, amino acid residues 208–430 are deleted. The nucleotide sequences of the mutants were confirmed by direct sequencing. The cDNAs of wild-type and mutant meltrin β were subcloned into pEF-BOS. Wild-type meltrin γ was also subcloned into pEF-BOS (12Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). pBIE plasmid was generated by deletion of the human cytomegalovirus promoter region of pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH) and replaced by the promoter region of pEF-BOS. Wild-type and ΔMP meltrin β cDNAs were subcloned into pBIE to generate pBIE-meltrin β and pBIE-ΔMP meltrin β, respectively. These plasmids were transfected by the LipofectAMINE PLUS method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies Inc.). Before harvesting the conditioned medium, the cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing CaCl2 (110 μg/ml) for 12 h. The conditioned medium was initially filtered through a sterile filter unit (pore size: 0.2 μm, Millipore) and then concentrated up to 100-fold by centrifugation using a Centriplus 10 (Amicon) concentrator. Cells were extracted in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) containing CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Approximately 20 μg of protein was loaded into each well. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon (Millipore). Anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (1:40 dilution; 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-meltrin β rabbit antiserum (1:500 dilution), and anti-C terminus of NRG rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; sc-348, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. After incubation with primary antibody, the blots were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:5000 dilution, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were developed using the ECL plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prestained protein molecular weight marker was from Bio-Rad. The cells transfected with pEF-BOS-HA-NRG-β1 together with pBIE, pBIE-meltrin β, or pBIE-ΔMP meltrin β were incubated with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; 16B12, Babco) at 4 °C for 30 min, and then washed four times with ice-cold PBS. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, the cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG (1:400 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 25 °C for 30 min. Imaging was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE inverted confocal microscope using a ×63 oil objective (Leica) and TCS-NT software (Leica). Cells were starved in medium lacking methionine and cysteine (ICN) for 1 h and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine (EASYTAG express protein labeling mixture, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 0.1 mCi/ml. After a 1-h pulse, cells were either extracted in extraction buffer containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture or chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, the secretory pathway inhibitors, brefeldin A (10 μg/ml, Wako) and monensin (2 μm, Wako), were added during the chase period. After a 5-h chase, cells were extracted in extraction buffer. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (16B12, Babco) for 30 min on ice. After the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads, the extracts were incubated for 1 h on ice. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times with extraction buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. We previously reported the expression pattern of meltrin β mRNA during mouse embryogenesis (16Kurisaki T. Masuda A. Osumi N. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Meltrin β mRNA is markedly expressed in the regions where peripheral neuronal cell lineages differentiate including craniofacial and DRG and ventral horns of the spinal cord. In addition, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and intestine express meltrin β mRNA transiently. This expression pattern of meltrin β coincides well with that of an EGF family growth factor,NRGs (17Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M. McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D.

In this study, we further investigated the precise expression sites of NRGs and meltrin β proteins in the developing mouse nervous system. Adjacent transverse sections through mouse E12.5 embryo were coimmunostained with antibodies against neuronal marker, neurofilament 160 (NF160), and C-terminal domain of meltrin β (Fig. 1, A-C), or EGF-like domain of NRGs (Fig. 1, D-F). As reported previously, high levels of NRG protein were expressed in DRG that give rise to sensory neurons (Ref. 17Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M. McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, Fig. 1 E) and the ventral horns of the spinal cord that produce motor neurons (data not shown). Similarly, strong and specific immunoreactivity for meltrin β was observed in the DRG (Fig. 1 B) and the ventral horns of the spinal cord (data not shown). This result indicates that meltrin β protein is expressed in the regions where peripheral neuronal cell lineages differentiate during embryogenesis. In addition, immunostainings of both meltrin β and NRGs were detected in most NF160-positive cells in the DRG region (Fig. 1, C andF). These results clearly demonstrate that the majority of NF160-positive neuronal cell lineages in DRG express both meltrin β and NRGs simultaneously. The mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cell is a multipotential stem cell, which differentiates into a variety of cell types including neuron and glia. Since this cell line is used as an in vitro model for differentiation of the nervous system, we examined the expression ofmeltrin β and NRGs in this cell line during differentiation. Differentiation was induced by aggregating P19 cells in the presence of 1 μm retinoic acid for 4 days and then the cells were dissociated and plated in the absence of retinoic acid. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, and the cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies against the markers of neurons (microtubule-associated protein-2), glial cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and smooth muscle cells (smooth muscle actin). The expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 was increased at day 6 and then decreased gradually (data not shown). On the other hand, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein was increased during the differentiation period (data not shown). To examine the expression level of NRGs and meltrinβ mRNAs, total mRNAs were prepared from cells at the indicated times, and subjected to RT-PCR (Fig.2). NRGs andmeltrin β mRNAs were both expressed at very low levels at day 0. The transcripts of these genes began to appear at day 6, then reached a maximum level at day 8. This similarity in the transcriptional profiles indicates a plausible interaction between meltrin β and NRGs. Many NRGs are derived from membrane-anchored precursor proteins via proteolytic cleavage. We therefore investigated whether the metalloprotease activity of meltrin β is involved in the processing of NRGs. Alternative splicing of a single gene gives rise to multiple isoforms of NRG. Many of these encode transmembrane, glycosylated precursors of soluble NRGs. In this study, we used three transmembrane isoforms of NRG (α2, β1, and β4) and the domain structure of the NRGs used here is shown schematically in Fig. 3 A. The extracellular portion of these NRGs contains an immunoglobulin motif (Ig), a glycosylated spacer domain (Glyco.), and an EGF-like domain (EGF) (25Peles E. Yarden Y. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The two major classes of NRGs diverge in the C terminus of the EGF-like domain giving rise to the α- and β-isoforms. Additional variation is seen in the juxtamembrane region following the EGF domain by the insertion of one of three different sequences (numbered 1, 2, or 4). To detect the ectodomains of NRGs released into the culture medium, the N terminus of NRGs was tagged with HA epitope. Since DRG neurons express meltrin β and NRG simultaneously (Fig. 1), we first examined the processing of a neuronal type of NRG, NRG-β1. In this study, we used mouse L929 fibroblast which expresses a low level of endogenous meltrin β (data not shown). L929 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding NRG-β1 and then the conditioned medium (CM) was subjected to Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Released soluble NRG-β1 (∼46 kDa) was detected in the CM of NRG-β1 expressing cells (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). This released polypeptide could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and -3 when added to differentiated muscle cells, C2C12 (data not shown), which shows that this 46-kDa polypeptide is a functionally mature NRG-β1. The broad appearance of processed NRG-β1 band might represent the variety of multiple N-linked andO-linked glycosylation in its spacer region (26Lu H.S. Hara S. Wong L.W.I. Jones M.D. Katta V. Trail G. Zou A. Brankow D. Cole S. Hu S. Wen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4775-4783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We further investigated whether coexpression of meltrin β affects the release of mature NRG-β1. Overexpression of wild-type meltrin β considerably increased the release of mature NRG-β1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Western blotting of cell extracts using the anti-C terminus of NRGs antibody showed that overexpression of wild-type meltrin β increased the ratio of processed cytoplasmic tail of NRG-β1 (74 kDa, open triangle) and decreased the ratio of full-length NRG-β1 (120 kDa, filled triangle) (Fig. 3 C, upper panel, lane 3). These results strongly suggest that meltrin β could potentiate the basal processing activity of NRG-β1. To investigate whether the meltrin β protease activity is necessary for the processing of NRG-β1, several mutants of meltrin β were constructed. In E347Q and H346A,H350A meltrin β, glutamine, and alanine residues were substituted for the glutamic acid and histidine residues, respectively, which are essential for the metalloprotease activity. In ΔMP meltrin β, metalloprotease domain is completely deleted. Western blotting using anti-meltrin β antibody revealed two immunoreactive species with apparent molecular masses of 125 and 100 kDa in the cell expressing E347Q meltrin β as shown in the cell expressing wild-type meltrin β (Fig. 3 C, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). The 100-kDa form is considered to be generated by removal of the prodomain from the 125-kDa form, probably by a furin-like pro-protein convertase, which cleaves ADAMs at the sequence motif RXKR in a late Golgi compartment (27Lum L.

Previously, we hypothesized that glycolysis is organized in the fibrous sheath of the flagellum to provide ATP to dynein ATPases that generate motility and to protein kinases that regulate motility. Although a recent report suggested that glucose is not essential for murine sperm capacitation, we demonstrated that glucose (but not lactate or pyruvate) was necessary and sufficient to support the protein tyrosine phosphorylation events associated with capacitation. The effect of glucose on this signaling pathway was downstream of cAMP, and appeared to arise indirectly as a consequence of metabolism as opposed to a direct signaling effect. Moreover, the phosphorylation events were not affected by uncouplers of oxidative respiration, inhibitors of electron transfer, or by a lack of substrates for oxidative respiration in the medium. Further experiments aimed at identifying potential regulators of sperm glycolysis focused on a germ cell-specific isoform of hexokinase, HK1-SC, which localizes to the fibrous sheath. HK1-SC activity and biochemical localization did not change during sperm capacitation, suggesting that glycolysis in sperm is regulated either at the level of substrate availability or by downstream enzymes. These data support the hypothesis that ATP specifically produced by a compartmentalized glycolytic pathway in the principal piece of the flagellum, as opposed to ATP generated by mitochondria in the mid-piece, is strictly required for protein tyrosine phosphorylation events that take place during sperm capacitation.

For example, the sperm head has evolved to interact with the egg's extracellular matrix and plasma membrane, and contains the paternal genetic material, whereas the sperm flagellum acts to provide motility for these cells. In regard to this polarization of function, sperm have two major constraints. First, they have little cytoplasm, and therefore have a reduced ability to translocate metabolic intermediates or substrates from one region to another. In addition, they are transcriptionally inactive, and therefore cannot make new proteins in response to changing needs. To overcome these constraints, we, along with others, have hypothesized that sperm possess compartmentalized metabolic and signaling pathways in specific regions of the cell poised to function in a localized fashion (1Gonse P.H. Bishop D.W. Spermatozoan Motility. American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D. C.1962: 99-132Google Scholar, 2Storey B.T. Kayne F.J. Fertil.

Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The most obvious example of metabolic compartmentalization in spermatozoa is that of oxidative respiration. This pathway is restricted to the mid-piece of the flagellum, because mitochondria are located solely in this region. Oxidative respiration provides the most efficient generation of ATP, yet the major sites of ATP consumption in sperm are the dynein ATPases found associated with the axoneme throughout the entire length of the flagellum (5Storey B.T. Kayne F.J. J. Exp. Zool. 1980; 211: 7-361Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In some species such as the sea urchin, a phosphorylcreatine shuttle has been observed to transfer high-energy phosphate from the mitochondria to the principal piece (6Tombes R.M. Shapiro B.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, in most mammalian species, this system either is poorly developed or is absent entirely (see Kaldis et al. (7Kaldis P. Kamp G. Piendl T. Wallimann T. Adv. Dev. Biol. 1997; 5: 275-312Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) for a review). How then do the principal piece and end-piece of the flagellum meet their energy needs? We, along with others, have hypothesized that glycolysis is compartmentalized in a cytoskeletal element in the principal piece of the flagellum known as the “fibrous sheath” (FS).1 This structure would then be able to provide localized ATP production to the dynein ATPases along the entire length of the principal piece of the flagellum (3Westhoff D. Kamp G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1821-1829PubMed Google Scholar, 4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol.

Dev. 1998; 49: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This theory was first suggested following observations that the enzymes of glycolysis downstream from aldolase are all associated with a cytoskeletal structure of the rabbit sperm flagellum (2Storey B.T. Kayne F.J. Fertil. Steril. 1975; 26: 1257-1265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was later demonstrated that one of these enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), localizes to the FS in several mammalian species (3Westhoff D. Kamp G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1821-1829PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bunch D.O. Welch J.E. Magyar P.L. Eddy E.M. O'Brien D.A. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Concurrently, a germ cell-specific isoform of type 1 hexokinase (HK1-SC), the first enzyme in glycolysis, was also found to target to the FS (4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Mori C. Nakamura N. Welch J.E. Gotoh H. Goulding E.H. Fujioka M. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This localization demonstrated for the first time that the proximal portion of the glycolytic pathway was also associated with the FS. In addition to tethering enzymes of glycolysis, the FS can also act as a scaffold for signaling molecules involved in the control of motility. A major component of the FS has been identified as anA-kinase anchoringprotein (AKAP) (10Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This protein, AKAP4, has been shown to bind protein kinase A (10Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which plays a role in many of the phosphorylation events postulated to govern motility (11Tash J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, glycolysis organized in the FS could be used not only to provide motility by generating ATP for the dynein ATPases, but also to help regulate motility by providing ATP to protein kinases (4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Changes in sperm motility occur not only within the epididymis as sperm acquire motility, but also within the female reproductive tract as sperm mature functionally and become competent to fertilize an egg. This process, known as “capacitation,” is associated with the activation of a novel signal transduction cascade that includes the efflux of cholesterol from membranes, alterations in membrane phospholipid content, alterations in intracellular calcium and bicarbonate ions, alterations in membrane potential, and elevations in cAMP that ultimately result in the downstream phosphorylation of a number of proteins on tyrosine residues (see Kopf et al. (12Kopf G.S. Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Adv. Dev. Biochem. 1999; 5: 83-107Crossref Google Scholar) for a review). It has long been recognized that capacitated sperm display increased energy demands (13Mounib M.S. Chang M.C. Nature. 1964; 201: 943Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), presumably to effect these changes in sperm signaling and function. However, the relationship between the signaling events associated with capacitation and changes in sperm energy metabolism is poorly understood, despite the co-compartmentalization of these pathways in regions such as the FS. Several studies using different model systems have been published on the role of glucose in sperm capacitation and fertilization. In some species (e.g. the mouse and human), glucose is necessary for capacitation, the onset of hyperactivated motility, and acrosomal exocytosis (14Hoppe P.C. Biol. Reprod. 1976; 15: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Fraser L.R. Quinn P.J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1981; 61: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Cooper T.G. Gamete Res. 1984; 9: 55-74Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Rogers B.J. Perreault S.D. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Contrary to the stimulatory role seen in the mouse and human, glucose inhibits capacitation in the bull (18Parrish J.J. Susko-Parrish J.L. First N.L. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 41: 683-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and guinea pig (19Rogers B.J. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 13: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These species differences might be related to the fact that glucose can have other effects on sperm unrelated to the generation of ATP. For example, glycolysis might affect sperm function by regulating intracellular pH (18Parrish J.J. Susko-Parrish J.L. First N.L. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 41: 683-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Alternatively, glucose might function as a signaling molecule by acting on regulatory enzymes such as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (20Han P. Werber J. Surana M. Fleischer N. Michaeli T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22337-22344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, glucose might be used in alternative metabolic pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). A possible role for the PPP in capacitation/fertilization is pertinent to a discussion of metabolic compartmentalization in sperm in that we have hypothesized that this pathway might be localized to the mid-piece and/or sperm head (4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although GAPDH is found in the FS, it and most other glycolytic enzymes have not been found elsewhere in the sperm. Yet the same germ cell-specific HK found in the FS, HK1-SC, is also found in the mid-piece and head (4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of HK in compartments lacking GAPDH suggests that HK might be supplying glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) to a pathway other than glycolysis, such as the PPP, in these regions. In the first step unique to this pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) produces an alternative type of energy, reducing power in the form of NADPH. Of interest, reducing power produced from glucose metabolism has been implicated in several steps of fertilization including fusion of the sperm with the egg and sperm head decondensation (21Urner F. Sakkas D. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Urner F. Sakkas D. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Urner F. Sakkas D. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A prime candidate to regulate glucose metabolism in sperm is HK1-SC. HK1 enzymatic activity is altered during male germ cell development in the rat (24Bajpai M. Gupta G. Setty B.S. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and during epididymal maturation in the bull (25Hoskins D.D. Munsterman D. Hall M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 12: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because HK functions to generate Glu-6-P, and this intermediate can be used by both glycolysis and the PPP, HK1-SC is in an ideal position to regulate two pathways of glucose metabolism. Such regulation during sperm capacitation might occur at several levels. For example, enzyme activities might vary absolutely, or shift in subcellular or biochemical localization (e.g. shift from a particulate to a soluble phase). Alternatively, substrate availability might be altered, or pathway inhibition might be regulated by the consumption/removal of end products. The highly differentiated structure of sperm, the co-localization of metabolic and signaling pathways to specific structures, and the importance of these pathways in sperm function, make these cells a potentially valuable model for studying the cross-talk between metabolic and signaling pathways. In the present report, we have therefore investigated the functional relationships between metabolic and signaling pathways during murine sperm capacitation.

Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (α-PY, clone 4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and used at a 1:10,000 dilution for immunoblots. A polyclonal antiserum against the germ cell-specific domain of HK1-SC (α-qcs) had been generated previously and was used as described by Travis et al. (4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A modified Whitten's medium (ModW) (22 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm pyruvic acid, 4.8 mm lactic acid hemi-calcium salt, pH 7.3) was used for most assays involving mature spermatozoa, except where noted. This medium was designed to support sperm functions yet not interfere with spectrophotometric assays. Cauda epididymal sperm were collected from retired breeder CD1 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) by a swim-out procedure in 2 ml of ModW at 37 °C. Epididymal tissue was removed, and the sperm washed at 100 ×g for 1 min in a clinical centrifuge to remove any gross tissue debris. The sperm were resuspended in a final volume of 3–8 ml of ModW, and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 8 min in a round-bottomed tube. The resultant “fluffy” pellet was counted, assessed for motility, and diluted for use. In all cases, large-bore plastic transfer pipettes or large-orifice pipette tips were used to minimize damage to the sperm membranes. After collection and washing, sperm were incubated under noncapacitating (ModW medium alone) or capacitating conditions (ModW with 10 mm NaHCO3, and either 3 mm2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2-OH-β-CD) or 1.0 mmdibutyryl-cAMP and 0.1 mm IBMX) for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath at a final concentration of 2 × 106sperm/300 μl. In place of bovine serum albumin, 2-OH-β-CD was used as a cholesterol acceptor so as to use a completely defined medium (27Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3235-3242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Depending upon the experiment, the sperm were incubated with varying concentrations of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) as metabolic substrates. Uncouplers of oxidative respiration and inhibitors of electron transfer were used at or above concentrations used in previously published experiments with spermatozoa (28Storey B.T. Kayne F.J. Biol. Reprod. 1977; 16: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar, 29Storey B.T. Arch. Androl. 1978; 1: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Storey B.T. J. Exp. Zool. 1980; 212: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For experiments in which protein tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed, sperm were concentrated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and then washed in 1 ml of ModW containing 0.2 mm Na3VO4 to inhibit phosphatase activity during extraction. Protein extracts from spermatozoa were prepared by boiling the cells in sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (31Laemmli U.K. Nature, U. S. A. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar), and then centrifuging at 10,000 ×g to yield a supernatant fraction. Cardiac tissue was obtained from male CD1 mice, minced with dissecting scissors, and homogenized in a Teflon/glass homogenizer 20 times on ice. Sample buffer was added to the extract, which was sonicated on ice prior to boiling and centrifugation to yield a soluble fraction. Proteins were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide gels (31Laemmli U.K. Nature, U. S. A. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar), and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blocking, immunoblotting, and detection of the immunoreactive proteins by chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) were performed as described in Travis et al. (4Travis A.J. Foster J.A. Rosenbaum N.A. Visconti P.E. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under noncapacitating or capacitating conditions as described above. After incubation, they were split into 4 treatment groups for different methods of solubilization or permeabilization, with each sample ultimately being resuspended in a final volume of 800 μl of either ModW or ModW + 10 mm NaHCO3 depending upon the capacitation status. Pellet and supernatant fractions were obtained for each treatment group. The first group was solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in ModW (± NaHCO3) for 15 min at room temperature with occasional hand vortexing. The sperm were centrifuged for 2 min at 5000 ×g, and the supernatant collected. The pellet was resuspended and centrifuged again to remove any trace amounts of supernatant, and then resuspended. The second group was referred to as “intact” sperm, because they were merely washed by centrifugation and split into supernatant and pellet fractions. These sperm were not truly intact, because centrifugation has been shown to induce sublethal membrane damage in human (32Alvarez J.G. Lasso J.L. Blasco L. Nunez R.C. Heyner S. Caballero P.P. Storey B.T. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 8: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and murine 2A. J. Travis, S. B. Moss, and G. S. Kopf, unpublished observations. sperm. In the third group, sperm were concentrated by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 1 min and then resuspended in 790 μl of reagent-grade water (Milli-Q, Millipore water purification system). These “hypotonically-treated” sperm were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with occasional hand vortexing, prior to separation into pellet and supernatant fractions. The last group was permeabilized with streptolysin-O (SLO) (33Johnson L.R. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Murex Diagnostics Limited, Dartford, United Kingdom) in ModW (± NaHCO3) at a final concentration of 0.6 IU/106 sperm. These “SLO-treated” sperm were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Again, supernatant and pellet fractions were obtained by centrifugation. After treatment, all of the resuspended pellet and supernatant fractions were loaded into individual cuvettes for spectrophotometric determination of hexokinase (HK) activity. HK activity was measured by means of a coupled enzyme reaction pathway that led to the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The rate of this reduction was measured as a change in absorbance at 365 and 395 nm using an American Instrument Co. (AMINCO) dual wavelength spectrophotometer (Travenol Laboratories, Inc., Silver Springs, MD). The coupled reactions were as follows: glucose + ATP → Glu-6-P + ADP and Glu-6-P + NADP+ → NADPH + 6-phospho-glucono-δ-lactone, with the first reaction catalyzed by endogenous HK, and the second catalyzed by exogenous G6PDH. These reactions were carried out using an ATP-regenerating system of creatine phosphate (CP) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Exogenous reagents (with accompanying final concentrations in parentheses) were added in the following order: glucose (5 mm), CP (20 mm), CPK (20 IU/ml), NADP+ (0.1 mm), G6PDH (7 IU/ml), and ATP (1 mm). Measurements of activity were determined from slopes taken from within the linear range, and were recorded using two different gain settings to provide optimal resolution. After recording enzyme activity, the samples not treated with Triton X-100 had this detergent added to a final concentration of 0.5%, to effect complete solubilization of the HK and obtain a maximal reading from each sample. This procedure was used as an internal control for equal loading of extracts into the cuvettes. In addition, this step demonstrated whether identical amounts of HK were either solubilized or retained in the particulate fraction under noncapacitating and capacitating conditions. The K m and V max with respect to glucose for the germ cell-specific HK1-SC were deduced by quantifying HK activity at various concentrations of glucose, and fitting the data to a hyperbolic function. Measurements of endogenous G6PDH activity were performed in a manner similar to the above methods, except that only a single reaction, not a coupled reaction pathway, was utilized. Exogenous NADP+ and varying concentrations of Glu-6-P were added to the sperm extracts (Triton X-100 treatment was utilized to provide maximal solubilization) and reduction of the NADP+ was quantified. Unlike earlier measurements of HK activity, additional glucose, CP, and CPK were excluded to reduce de novo generation of Glu-6-P within the cuvette. The K m and V max with respect to Glu-6-P for G6PDH were deduced by quantifying G6PDH activity at various concentrations of Glu-6-P, and fitting the data to a hyperbolic function. Despite an extensive literature on sperm metabolism, the basic question of which metabolic substrates are required to support the maturational process of capacitation remains a matter of controversy. Species-specific differences have further complicated the issue, but even within the murine model system there is some disagreement over the role of glucose. To determine potential roles for glucose in supporting capacitation, we first determined whether glucose was required for protein tyrosine phosphorylation events associated with capacitation. Epididymal sperm were washed free of glucose and then incubated under conditions that support capacitation, with the inclusion of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate, alone or in combination (Fig. 1). Using these substrates at concentrations typically present in media supporting capacitation, only glucose was found to be both necessary and sufficient to support the full pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation associated with capacitation (34Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next investigated the concentration of glucose required to support this signaling pathway by incubating sperm with varying concentrations of glucose (Fig. 2). Two different methods of capacitation were employed to test whether glucose was acting either upstream in the signaling pathway at the level of cholesterol efflux (incubation with 2-OH-β-CD) (27Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3235-3242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), or downstream at the level of the second messenger cAMP (incubation with the cell-permeable dibutyryl-cAMP and IBMX) (35Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the method of capacitation, a glucose concentration between 10 and 100 μm was sufficient to support the same degree of protein tyrosine phosphorylation as that seen with 5 mm glucose in ModW. Similar findings were observed using sperm from both CD-1 and B6SJLF1/J males, showing that the phenomenon was not strain-specific (data not shown). These results suggested an absolute requirement for glucose in supporting the protein tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathway associated with capacitation. Yet they did not indicate whether the effect of glucose was by a direct action on a signaling molecule, or whether the effect was mediated by some product of glucose metabolism. To resolve this distinction, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions in the absence of glucose, but in the presence of various concentrations of a nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 2-DG (Fig.3). This analog is phosphorylated by HK, but will not enter glycolysis or the PPP. If 2-DG stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation to the same degree as glucose, then the effect on signaling would result from cross-talk between the signaling pathway leading to protein tyrosine phosphorylation and 1) the transporters bringing 2-DG into the sperm, 2) HK which phosphorylates the 2-DG, or 3) the 2-DG itself. Any of these possibilities would suggest that glucose might directly regulate signaling leading to protein tyrosine phosphorylation. If the 2-DG did not stimulate the increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, then the effect of glucose on signaling would most likely result from some product or intermediate of glucose metabolism. Spermatozoa incubated with increasing concentrations of 2-DG did not show an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3), suggesting that the effect of glucose on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in murine sperm probably resulted from a product of glucose metabolism. Moreover, with concentrations of 2-DG >10 μm, a decrease in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed, even below that seen in sperm incubated in the absence of 2-DG. This finding suggested that 2-DG could function as a “phosphorylation sink,” and that the phosphorylation events associated with capacitation were not terminal. If these events had been terminal, there would not have been a decrease in protein tyrosine phosphorylation below that seen in the uncapacitated state. Thus the protein substrates appeared to be alternately phosphorylated and dephosphorylated during capacitation. The failure of lactate and/or pyruvate to support signaling events associated with capacitation suggested a minimal role for ATP produced by the oxidation of these compounds in this cascade. However, these experiments did not completely rule out input from oxidative respiration, as ATP may also be derived from other endogenou"

In this study on photoactivated rhodopsin (R*) and the rod G protein, Gt, we have used kinetic light scattering, backed by direct biochemical assays, to follow G protein activation. Our protocol includes the following: (i) to measure initial rates on the background of rapid depletion of the GtGDP substrate; (ii) to titrate GtGDP, GTP, and GDP; and (iii) to apply a double displacement reaction scheme to describe the results. All data are simultaneously fitted by one and the same set of parameters. We obtain values of K m = 2200 Gt/μm2 for GtGDP andK m = 230 μm for GTP; dissociation constants are K d = 530 Gt/μm2 for R*-GtGDP dissociation and K d = 270 μm for GDP release from R*GtGDP, once formed. Maximal catalytic rates per photoexcited rhodopsin are 600 Gt/s at 22 °C and 1300 Gt/s at 34 °C. The analysis provides a tool to allocate and quantify better the effects of chemical or mutational protein modifications to individual steps in signal transduction."

The level of PTTG expression is increased in rapidly proliferating cells and is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking in mitosis (8Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTTG may play a role in control of cell proliferation.PTTG encodes a protein of 30 kDa without homology to other known protein (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that PTTG is a mammalian securin that acts as a sister-chromatid separation inhibitor (9Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). PTTG protein is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm with partial nuclear localization (3Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, nuclear translocation of PTTG can be facilitated either by interaction with PTTG binding factor (10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19422-19427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or by activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).A role for PTTG as a transcriptional activator has been proposed. The C-terminal region of PTTG mediates transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (3Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Transient cotransfection of PTTG and PTTG binding factor expression constructs leads to transcriptional activation the basic fibroblast growth factor promoter (10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19422-19427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In a recent study, I demonstrated that activation of the MAP kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor or an expression vector for a constitutively active form of the MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) led to stimulation of PTTG transactivation activity (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PTTG is phosphorylated in vitro on Ser162 by MAP kinase and is linked to the MAP kinase cascade by direct interaction with MEK1 through a putative SH3-domain binding site located between amino acids 51 and 54 (11). Both the MAP kinase phosphorylation and the MEK1-binding sites play an essential role in PTTG transactivation function (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).These previous studies indicate that PTTG plays a potentially important role in regulation of transcription. However, target genes whose expression is definitively regulated by PTTG remain unknown. To address the functional properties of PTTG and to examine its effect on endogenous target genes, I developed cell lines in whichPTTG expression is tightly regulated by an inducible promoter (12Grossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar, 13Blau H.M. Rossi F.M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). DNA array-based gene expression profiling revealed a small number of genes exhibiting altered expression afterPTTG induction. Among these candidate targets, the most dramatic induction was the c-myc oncogene. The c-myc gene has a critical role in the control of cellular proliferation. Deregulated c-myc is associated with a variety of tumors. Overexpression of c-Myc protein stimulates cell cycle progression, causes transformation, blocks differentiation, and induces apoptosis in low serum (14Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). I observed that induction of c-myc expression by overexpression of PTTG resulted in increased cell proliferation and colony formation, supporting the role of PTTG in regulation of cell growth.It has been established that the C-terminal portion of PTTG contains a transcriptional activation domain (3Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether PTTG directly binds to DNA, and the DNA-binding site has not been identified. I have therefore used c-myc promoter to characterize PTTG interaction with DNA. Here I show that PTTG binds to c-myc promoter near the transcription start site and forms a complex with the ubiquitous transcription activator USF1. I have mapped PTTG DNA binding domain to a region between amino acids 60 and 118. In addition I demonstrate that transcriptional activation of c-myc gene by PTTG requires its DNA binding activity.DISCUSSIONPTTG has been implicated in many types of human neoplasm. However, the mechanisms involved in PTTG cellular transformation and tumorigenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, by generating cell lines with tightly regulated inducible expression of PTTG and expression profiling using DNA arrays (24Marshall A. Hodgson J. Nature Biotechnology. 1998; 16: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 25Lockhart D. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar), I have identified a down-stream target that is likely to contribute to the function of PTTG as a oncogene. Induction of PTTG expression in HeLaS3 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation and colony formation. This effect involves induction of another oncogene c-myc.The product of the c-myc proto-oncogene is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation (26Heikkila R. Schwab G. Wickstrom E. Loke S.L. Pluznik D.H. Watt R. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Myc contributes to the transformation of primary fibroblasts in culture (27Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar) as well as development of neoplasia in a wide variety of tissues (28Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Petal A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Myc protein exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding when dimerized with its partner Max (29Berberich S. Hyde-DeRuyscher N. Espenshade P. Cole M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

The interaction with Max is necessary for most of the physiological effects of c-Myc (32Amati B. Brooks M.W. Levy N. Littlewood T.D. Evans G.I. Land H. Cell. 1993; 72: 233-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). c-Myc has been implicated in both activation and repression of transcription (33Amati B. Dalton S. Brooks M.W. Littlewood T.D. Evans G.I. Land H. Nature. 1992; 359: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 34Inghirami G. Grignani F. Sternas L. Lombardi L. Knowles D.M. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1990; 250: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Kretzner L. Blackwood E. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1992; 359: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The expression of the c-myc gene is closely correlated with proliferation. c-myc expression is absent in quiescent cells but is rapidly induced upon the addition of growth factor (36Penn L.J.Z. Brook M.W. Laufer E.M. Land H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 37Cole M.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 38Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern of c-myc is similar to that of PTTG, which is also induced by mitogenic treatment such as serum (8Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R. Multon M-C. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Identification of c-myc as a target for PTTG is therefore consistent with the potential role PTTG plays in controlling cell proliferation. In my previous study, I have shown that PTTG is phosphorylated by MAP kinase and that activation of this signal transduction pathway by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor enhances PTTG transactivation function (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). c-Myc is also a target of MAP kinase cascade and is phosphorylated on Ser62 by MAP kinase (39Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzales F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this site is associated with enhanced transactivation function of c-Myc (40Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Seth A. Alvarez E. Gupta S. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In this study, I have identified MEK1 as another potential PTTG target. Taken together, these results suggest a functional pathway that includes MAP kinase cascade and c-Myc for PTTG-mediated effects on cell proliferation.The identification of c-myc as an endogenous gene that is rapidly induced after PTTG expression provides a physiological target to study the potential role of PTTG in transcriptional regulation. Our results showed that transient transfection of a PTTG expression plasmid led to activation of the proximal c-myc promoter, whereas expression of a transactivation-defective PTTG mutant had no effect on c-myc promoter activity. In addition, in the cell line that expresses transactivation-defective PTTG, c-myc expression was not induced after induction of mutant PTTG expression. These results indicate that activation of c-myc expression requires PTTG transactivation function.I have provided evidence that PTTG transactivates c-myc by directly interacting with its promoter. DNaseI protection assays showed that nuclear proteins from HeLaS3 cell overexpressing PTTG interact with the c-myc gene between −20 and +28. Results from gel mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides containing various mutations of this region indicated that the DNA-protein complexes contain at least two proteins. One of these proteins is the ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor USF1 that binds to the initiator element between −4 and +7 (InrA). Although USF was shown to bind to Inr of the AdMLP and activates transcription through specific cooperation with TFII I (20Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), the data presented here show for the first time that USF1 also binds to the Inr in c-myc promoter. The DNA-binding site for PTTG was located between +4 and −20, and the nucleotides important for PTTG binding include the residues between −3 and −5 as well as between −15 and −20. Importantly, mutations within these nucleotides not only prevented PTTG from binding DNA but also abolished PTTG-mediated transcriptional activation of the c-myc gene. It is possible that binding of PTTG and USF to adjacent sites on c-mycpromoter could result in cooperative binding of both factors to DNA, or alternatively, transcriptional synergy may occur by the two transcriptional activators contacting the general transcriptional machinery simultaneously. These exciting possibilities will be explored in the future studies.A typical transcription activator protein is a modular protein composed of DNA binding and activation domains (43Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). PTTG does not contain any common DNA binding motifs such as homeodomain, zinc fingers, basic leucine zipper (bZIP), and basic helix-loop-helix (44Luisi B. DNA-Protein: Structure Interactions. 7. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). Combining mutagenesis with gel mobility assay, I have mapped the DNA binding domain of PTTG to a region between amino acids 61 and 118 adjacent to the transactivation domain (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence in this region is rich in basic residues containing 12 lysines and arginines. PTTG DNA binding domain may represent a new motif for DNA-binding proteins. Our results showed that the DNA binding domain is required for PTTG transactivation, for mutant-containing deletion of this domain was unable to bind to DNA and activate c-myc promoter. Interestingly, the DNA binding domain deletion mutant inhibited transcriptional activation by wild type PTTG. This inhibition may occur through sequestration of general transcription factors by the mutant protein.In summary, the data presented in this study have established the important role of PTTG in the regulation of transcription. Although the definitive requirement for PTTG in c-myc activation will need to be confirmed once PTTG-null cells are available, the data presented here clearly indicate that c-myc is likely a physiological target for PTTG and, thus, links PTTG to a functional pathway involved in cellular proliferation and transformation.

Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). PTTG protein is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm with partial nuclear localization (3Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, nuclear translocation of PTTG can be facilitated either by interaction with PTTG binding factor (10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19422-19427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or by activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A role for PTTG as a transcriptional activator has been proposed. The C-terminal region of PTTG mediates transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (3Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Transient cotransfection of PTTG and PTTG binding factor expression constructs leads to transcriptional activation the basic fibroblast growth factor promoter (10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19422-19427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In a recent study, I demonstrated that activation of the MAP kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor or an expression vector for a constitutively active form of the MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) led to stimulation of PTTG transactivation activity (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PTTG is phosphorylated in vitro on Ser162 by MAP kinase and is linked to the MAP kinase cascade by direct interaction with MEK1 through a putative SH3-domain binding site located between amino acids 51 and 54 (11). Both the MAP kinase phosphorylation and the MEK1-binding sites play an essential role in PTTG transactivation function (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These previous studies indicate that PTTG plays a potentially important role in regulation of transcription. However, target genes whose expression is definitively regulated by PTTG remain unknown. To address the functional properties of PTTG and to examine its effect on endogenous target genes, I developed cell lines in whichPTTG expression is tightly regulated by an inducible promoter (12Grossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar, 13Blau H.M. Rossi F.M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). DNA array-based gene expression profiling revealed a small number of genes exhibiting altered expression afterPTTG induction. Among these candidate targets, the most dramatic induction was the c-myc oncogene. The c-myc gene has a critical role in the control of cellular proliferation. Deregulated c-myc is associated with a variety of tumors. Overexpression of c-Myc protein stimulates cell cycle progression, causes transformation, blocks differentiation, and induces apoptosis in low serum (14Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). I observed that induction of c-myc expression by overexpression of PTTG resulted in increased cell proliferation and colony formation, supporting the role of PTTG in regulation of cell growth. It has been established that the C-terminal portion of PTTG contains a transcriptional activation domain (3Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether PTTG directly binds to DNA, and the DNA-binding site has not been identified. I have therefore used c-myc promoter to characterize PTTG interaction with DNA. Here I show that PTTG binds to c-myc promoter near the transcription start site and forms a complex with the ubiquitous transcription activator USF1. I have mapped PTTG DNA binding domain to a region between amino acids 60 and 118. In addition I demonstrate that transcriptional activation of c-myc gene by PTTG requires its DNA binding activity. DISCUSSIONPTTG has been implicated in many types of human neoplasm. However, the mechanisms involved in PTTG cellular transformation and tumorigenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, by generating cell lines with tightly regulated inducible expression of PTTG and expression profiling using DNA arrays (24Marshall A. Hodgson J. Nature Biotechnology. 1998; 16: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 25Lockhart D. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar), I have identified a down-stream target that is likely to contribute to the function of PTTG as a oncogene. Induction of PTTG expression in HeLaS3 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation and colony formation. This effect involves induction of another oncogene c-myc.The product of the c-myc proto-oncogene is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation (26Heikkila R. Schwab G. Wickstrom E. Loke S.L. Pluznik D.H. Watt R. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Myc contributes to the transformation of primary fibroblasts in culture (27Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar) as well as development of neoplasia in a wide variety of tissues (28Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Petal A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Myc protein exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding when dimerized with its partner Max (29Berberich S. Hyde-DeRuyscher N. Espenshade P. Cole M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

The interaction with Max is necessary for most of the physiological effects of c-Myc (32Amati B. Brooks M.W. Levy N. Littlewood T.D. Evans G.I. Land H. Cell. 1993; 72: 233-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). c-Myc has been implicated in both activation and repression of transcription (33Amati B. Dalton S. Brooks M.W. Littlewood T.D. Evans G.I. Land H. Nature. 1992; 359: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 34Inghirami G. Grignani F. Sternas L. Lombardi L. Knowles D.M. Dalla-Favera R.

The expression of the c-myc gene is closely correlated with proliferation. c-myc expression is absent in quiescent cells but is rapidly induced upon the addition of growth factor (36Penn L.J.Z. Brook M.W. Laufer E.M. Land H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 37Cole M.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 38Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern of c-myc is similar to that of PTTG, which is also induced by mitogenic treatment such as serum (8Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R. Multon M-C. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Identification of c-myc as a target for PTTG is therefore consistent with the potential role PTTG plays in controlling cell proliferation. In my previous study, I have shown that PTTG is phosphorylated by MAP kinase and that activation of this signal transduction pathway by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor enhances PTTG transactivation function (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). c-Myc is also a target of MAP kinase cascade and is phosphorylated on Ser62 by MAP kinase (39Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzales F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this site is associated with enhanced transactivation function of c-Myc (40Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Seth A. Alvarez E. Gupta S. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Taken together, these results suggest a functional pathway that includes MAP kinase cascade and c-Myc for PTTG-mediated effects on cell proliferation.The identification of c-myc as an endogenous gene that is rapidly induced after PTTG expression provides a physiological target to study the potential role of PTTG in transcriptional regulation. Our results showed that transient transfection of a PTTG expression plasmid led to activation of the proximal c-myc promoter, whereas expression of a transactivation-defective PTTG mutant had no effect on c-myc promoter activity. In addition, in the cell line that expresses transactivation-defective PTTG, c-myc expression was not induced after induction of mutant PTTG expression. These results indicate that activation of c-myc expression requires PTTG transactivation function.I have provided evidence that PTTG transactivates c-myc by directly interacting with its promoter. DNaseI protection assays showed that nuclear proteins from HeLaS3 cell overexpressing PTTG interact with the c-myc gene between −20 and +28. Results from gel mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides containing various mutations of this region indicated that the DNA-protein complexes contain at least two proteins. One of these proteins is the ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor USF1 that binds to the initiator element between −4 and +7 (InrA). Although USF was shown to bind to Inr of the AdMLP and activates transcription through specific cooperation with TFII I (20Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), the data presented here show for the first time that USF1 also binds to the Inr in c-myc promoter. The DNA-binding site for PTTG was located between +4 and −20, and the nucleotides important for PTTG binding include the residues between −3 and −5 as well as between −15 and −20. Importantly, mutations within these nucleotides not only prevented PTTG from binding DNA but also abolished PTTG-mediated transcriptional activation of the c-myc gene. It is possible that binding of PTTG and USF to adjacent sites on c-mycpromoter could result in cooperative binding of both factors to DNA, or alternatively, transcriptional synergy may occur by the two transcriptional activators contacting the general transcriptional machinery simultaneously. These exciting possibilities will be explored in the future studies.A typical transcription activator protein is a modular protein composed of DNA binding and activation domains (43Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). PTTG does not contain any common DNA binding motifs such as homeodomain, zinc fingers, basic leucine zipper (bZIP), and basic helix-loop-helix (44Luisi B. DNA-Protein: Structure Interactions. 7. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). Combining mutagenesis with gel mobility assay, I have mapped the DNA binding domain of PTTG to a region between amino acids 61 and 118 adjacent to the transactivation domain (11Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence in this region is rich in basic residues containing 12 lysines and arginines. PTTG DNA binding domain may represent a new motif for DNA-binding proteins. Our results showed that the DNA binding domain is required for PTTG transactivation, for mutant-containing deletion of this domain was unable to bind to DNA and activate c-myc promoter. Interestingly, the DNA binding domain deletion mutant inhibited transcriptional activation by wild type PTTG. This inhibition may occur through sequestration of general transcription factors by the mutant protein.In summary, the data presented in this study have established the important role of PTTG in the regulation of transcription. Although the definitive requirement for PTTG in c-myc activation will need to be confirmed once PTTG-null cells are available, the data presented here clearly indicate that c-myc is likely a physiological target for PTTG and, thus, links PTTG to a functional pathway involved in cellular proliferation and transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2149814771,"The identification of upstream pathways that signal to TP73 is crucial for understanding the biological role of this gene. Since some evidence suggests thatTP73 might play a role in tumorigenesis, we asked whether oncogenes can induce and activate endogenous TP73. Here, we show that endogenous p73 α and β proteins are up-regulated in p53-deficient tumor cells in response to overexpressed E2F1, c-Myc, and E1A. E2F1, c-Myc, and E1A-mediated p73 up-regulation leads to activation of the p73 transcription function, as shown by p73-responsive reporter activity and by induction of known endogenous p73 target gene products such as p21 and HDM2. Importantly, E2F1-, c-Myc-, and E1A-mediated activation of endogenous p73 induces apoptosis in SaOs-2 cells. Conversely, inactivation of p73 by a dominant negative p73 inhibitor (p73DD), but not by a mutant p73DD, inhibits oncogene-induced apoptosis. These data show that oncogenes can signal to TP73 in vivo. Moreover, in the absence of p53, oncogenes may enlist p73 to induce apoptosis in tumor cells.

In contrast to TP53, human TP73 produces six C-terminal splice variants (p73 α–Φ) (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P.

In addition, mouse TP73 has an alternative promoter in intron 3, which encodes a p73 protein that lacks the transactivation domain (ΔN p73) and acts as a dominant negative suppressor of p73 α (7Yang A.

When ectopically overexpressed in cell culture, p73 α and β closely mimic p53 activities. Ectopic p73 β, and to a lesser extent p73 α, transactivate many p53-responsive promoters, although relative efficiency differences on a given promoter are observed (8Jost C.A. Marin M.C.

Ectopic p73 also promotes apoptosis irrespective of the p53 status (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F.

Despite this experimental evidence, the role of TP73 in tumorigenesis is as yet unclear. Current genetic data have ruled out that TP73 is a Knudson-type tumor suppressor. AlthoughTP73 maps to chromosome 1p36.3, which undergoes frequent loss of heterozygosity in breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and several other cancers (12Schwab M. Praml C. Amler L.C. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996; 16: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), mutations in the TP73 gene are extremely rare in human tumors. Initially, imprinting of theTP73 locus was thought to be an explanation to satisfy the two-hit hypothesis in tumors with loss of heterozygosity but no mutations. However, imprinting is highly variable from patient to patient and tissue to tissue (6Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kovalev S.

In fact, in lung, esophageal, gastric, and renal carcinoma, the second TP73 allele is specifically activated in the tumor compared with the normal tissue of origin (loss of imprinting) (16Mai M.

Furthermore, p73-deficient mice lack a spontaneous tumor phenotype but have neurological and immunological defects (7Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C.

Both differences and similarities to p53 are found with respect to p73 inactivation by viral oncoproteins. SV40 T antigen, adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein, and HPV E6, which all target and inactivate p53 during host cell transformation, do not target the p73 protein physically or functionally (20Marin M.C.

Indeed, ectopic p73, but not p53, induces apoptosis in E6-transformed cells, highlightingTP73's potential for gene therapy in HPV-mediated cancers (23Prabhu N.S. Somasundaram K. Satyamoorthy K. Herlyn M. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Oncology. 1998; 13: 5-9PubMed Google Scholar). However, the adenovirus E4orf6 oncoprotein specifically represses p73 but not p53 transactivation in some experimental systems (22Higashino F. Pipas J.M. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stable transfectants of a human rhabdoid tumor cell line expressing E1A or adenovirus 5 large E1B showed increased p73 levels, although functional activation of the protein was not tested (24Steegenga W.T. Shvarts A. Riteco N. Bos J.L. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3885-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Tax protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 represses the transactivation function of p73 α and β via a p300-dependent mechanism (25Kaida A. Ariumi Y. Ueda Y. Lin J.Y. Hijikata M. Ikawa S. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, analogous to p53, Mdm2 suppresses p73 transactivation function via a negative feedback loop (26Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A,. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr, W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H.

However, in contrast to p53, cellular Mdm2 and the HPV E6 protein do not mediate degradation of exogenous p73 (26Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A,. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr, W.G. Oren M. Chen J.

In all normal human tissues studied, p73 is expressed at very low levels (13Kovalev S. Marchenko N. Swendeman S. LaQuaglia M. Moll U.M.

In contrast, multiple primary tumor types and tumor cell lines overexpress p73. Work by us and others showed that the most common cancer-specific alteration is an overexpression of p73 rather than a loss. To date, p73 overexpression has been found in tumors of breast, neuroblastoma, lung, esophagus, stomach, colon, bladder, ovary, ependymoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and myeloid leukemia (CML blast crisis and acute myeloid leukemia) (6Zaika A.I.

For example, using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we found overexpression (5–25-fold) of TP73mRNA in 38% of 77 invasive breast cancers and in 5 of 7 breast cancer cell lines (13–73-fold) but not in normal breast (6Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, we found that TP73 mRNA is overexpressed in a subset of neuroblastoma and related embryonal tumors (8–80-fold) and in 12 of 14 neuroblastoma cell lines (8–90-fold) (13Kovalev S. Marchenko N. Swendeman S. LaQuaglia M. Moll U.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 897-903PubMed Google Scholar). The cause of p73 overexpression is unknown. Unlike p53 protein, which becomes stabilized and activated in response to a very broad spectrum of cellular stresses, little is known about the upstream signals that induce a p73 response. p73 is not activated by UV, actinomycin D, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), all of which stabilize and activate p53. However, recently it has been shown that endogenous p73 is activated for apoptosis in response to cisplatin and γ-ionizing irradiation in a pathway that depends on the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl (38Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 39Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y.

Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). This DNA-damage-dependent up-regulation of p73 by c-Abl may be partly responsible for p53-independent apoptosis. What is already evident is that TP73, at least qualitatively, utilizes the same or very similar effector pathways as TP53. Complete identification of all upstream signals of TP73 that operate physiologically will be very important in elucidating its normal function and role, if any, in tumorigenesis. We therefore asked whether deregulated oncogenes, which are a preeminent signal for triggering p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis, also induce and activate p73 function. We report that overexpression of cellular and viral oncogenes do up-regulate endogenous p73 proteins and activate their transactivation function. Moreover, E2F1-, c-Myc-, and E1A-mediated activation of endogenous p73 induces apoptosis in p53-deficient tumor cells. Disruption of p73 function by a dominant negative p73 inhibitor (p73DD), but not by a mutant version thereof, inhibited oncogene-induced apoptosis. These data show that oncogenes can signal to TP73 in vivo. The human lung carcinoma line H1299 and the human osteosarcoma line SaOs-2 each carry a homozygous deletion for TP53 and were used for transfection. Other cell lines were SK-N-AS (human neuroblastoma), MRC5 (human diploid fibroblasts), and COS (monkey kidney cells). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma. The following mammalian expression plasmids were used: pE1A, expressing E1A 12 S protein driven by the natural adenovirus E1A enhancer/promoter (41Whyte P. Ruley H.E. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 257-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); pCMXM45 E2F1, expressing human E2F1 (42O'Connor R.J. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6848-6862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); pmc-Myc, expressing mouse c-Myc protein (gift from M. Cole, Princeton University); pC53-C1N3 expressing human wild type p53; and pcDNA3-p73 α and pcDNA3-p73 β expressing HA1-tagged human p73 α and β (5De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-p73DD and pcDNA3-mtp73DD were gifts of Dr. William Kaelin and are described in detail in Ref. 43Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar. Briefly, pcDNA3-p73DD expresses T7-tagged amino acids 327–636 of human p73 α and acts as a dominant negative p73 in vivo. The corresponding loss-of-function mutant named mtp73DD, which contains a L371P point mutation, is inactive as inhibitor. Green fluorescent protein expression plasmid (CLONTECH) was cotransfected in transient transfections to verify relative transfection efficiency. The p53/p73-responsive reporter construct PG13-Luc and its mutant counterpart MG15-Luc (gift of B. Vogelstein) were used for luciferase assays. p73 β exhibited 80% of the activity of p53 (on a molar basis) in transactivating the PG13-Luc reporter and no activity with the MG15-Luc reporter (data not shown). Cell lysates were prepared as described (45Zaika A. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27474-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes. Immunoblots were visualized by ECL (Pierce). Antibodies to p73 were the monoclonal GC15 (AB-3 from Oncogene Science; recognizes amino acids 380–499 of human p73 β), the polyclonal p73N (raised in rabbit against the N-terminal peptide FHLEGMTTSVMAQF), and the polyclonal p73 α (raised in rabbit against a C-terminal α-specific peptide; gift of K. Vousden). Oncogene expression was confirmed with antibodies against E1A (clone 13S-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), E2F-1 (clones C20 and KH95; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and c-Myc (Ab-3; Oncogene Science). Antibodies against p53 (clone DO-1), HDM2 (clone IF2), and p21 (Ab-1) were from Oncogene Science. For normalization of protein loading, blots were reprobed with antibodies specific for vimentin (BioGenex). H1299 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown overnight to 80% confluence. For transient transfections, 2 βg of expression plasmid or empty vector was cotransfected with 200 ng of green fluorescent protein-encoding plasmid using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were collected after 24 h. Stable transformants were seeded into P100 plates (1 × 107 cells) and selected for 21 days in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies), ring-cloned, and expanded into single cell clones. For the SaOs-2 experiments (see Fig.5 D), transformants were pooled after 3 weeks of G418 selection and transiently transfected with c-Myc prior to parallel TUNEL assays and immunofluorescence staining 24 h later. For luciferase assays, cells were seeded into 24-well plates and transfected with an expression vector or empty vector (400 ng) together with the p53-responsive PG13-Luc from firefly (80 ng) and pRL-TKRenilla luciferase cDNA (8 ng). To test the effect of the dominant negative inhibitor and its mutant, each well was transfected with 100 ng of expression vector plus 300 ng of empty vector, with 100 ng of expression vector plus 300 ng of p73DD, or with 100 ng of expression vector plus 300 ng of mtp73DD, together with the reporter constructs as above. Luciferase activity was measured after 24 h by the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega), and transfection efficiency was standardized against Renillaluciferase. For apoptosis, SaOs-2 cells were seeded in duplicates into eight-well chambers 48 h prior to transfection. At about 70% confluence, cells in duplicate wells were transfected with expression plasmid (150 ng) plus empty vector (350 ng) or expression plasmid (150 ng) plus p73DD (350 ng) or expression plasmid (150 ng) plus mtp73DD (350 ng). After 24 h, cells were fixed and processed in parallel for the TUNEL assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and for immunofluorescence using the appropriate antibodies against p73, E2F1, c-Myc, or E1A. Expression was reproducibly about 30%, similar among all constructs and evenly distributed throughout the wells. For each construct, TUNEL-positive cells (494 fields at 40×) and transfected cells (30 fields at 40×; around 200 cells) from duplicate chambers were counted, and the percentage of apoptosis of transfected cells was determined after correction for background with vector alone (500 ng per well). Experiments were performed 3–6 times, depending on the construct. The great majority of functional and regulatory p73 studies to date have used ectopically expressed p73 proteins. To reliably detect endogenous p73 proteins, we used three different p73-specific antibodies. They comprised a p73 β-specific monoclonal (GC15), a p73 α-specific polyclonal raised against a C-terminal peptide (poly-p73α) and a pan-p73 polyclonal raised against an N-terminal peptide (poly-p73N). The antibodies detected endogenous full-length p73 α and β in several tumor cell lines including the p53-deficient human H1299 line (Fig.1). H1299 cells express a basal level of p73 α (lane 1) and β (lane 9). Simian COS cells express the highest level of p73 α (lane 4) and p73 β (lanes 5 and 8). In contrast, SK-N-AS cells express no detectable p73 α (lane 3) or p73 β (lane 6), consistent with previous reports (20Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Next we tested whether viral and cellular oncogenes, which are major upstream signals for TP53 activation, are also physiologically relevant for triggering the induction of endogenous TP73. To this end, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with various oncogene-encoding plasmids. Their expression was verified by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies (Fig.2 A). Both p73 α and β proteins were markedly induced after expression of E2F1, c-Myc, and adenoviral E1A when compared with empty vector. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2, B and C. By molecular weight standards and reactivity with the polyclonal p73N antibody, only full-length proteins were observed, with p73 α migrating at about 83 kDa and p73 β at about 75 kDa. The equal loading of immunoblots was confirmed by reblotting the membranes with an antibody specific for vimentin. Since transfection efficiency in these transient assays ranged between 30 and 40% (judged by coexpressed green fluorescent protein), the actual degree of induction is higher than the one detected here by immunoblots, since this assay is subject to dilution by untransfected cells. Significant induction of endogenous TP73 was also seen after oncogene transfection in SaOs-2 cells (see Fig. 5 B). Since transient overexpression of oncogenes induces the accumulation of p73 α and β (Fig. 2), we next asked if stable oncogene overexpression similarly would lead to long term up-regulation of p73. To this end, vector control and c-Myc-transfected H1299 cells were selected in G418 for 3 weeks. Of the surviving c-Myc foci, seven were randomly picked, ring-cloned, and successfully expanded into stable sublines. As shown in Fig.3, all seven clones overexpressed c-Myc, albeit to various degrees compared with vector control. Clones 1, 2, and 4 showed the highest c-Myc expression. Cell extracts were then probed for p73 protein levels. As already seen with transient c-Myc transfections, p73 α and β were found to be induced above base line in all seven subclones (Fig. 3). p73 β induction appeared proportional to the level of c-Myc expression in the individual clones, with clones 1, 2, and 4 showing the highest p73 β accumulation. Interestingly, for reasons that remain to be elucidated, p73 α reproducibly behaved inversely to β (i.e. whenever β was high, α was low, and vice versa). Taken together, this result indicates that stable deregulation of the c-Myc oncogene recapitulates the p73 overexpression already seen with transient deregulation of c-Myc. We then tested whether the oncogene-mediated up-regulation of endogenous p73 translates into activation of p73 transcriptional function. To this end, we carried out luciferase reporter assays in transiently transfected H1299 cells using the p53/p73-responsive PG13-Luc reporter. As shown in Fig.4 A, all three oncogenes were able to activate p73 reporter activity. E2F1 exhibited a 16.5-fold, c-Myc a 10.3-fold, and E1A a 13.9-fold induction of the p73-responsive reporter compared with vector controls. These data indicate that oncogenes induce the transcriptional activation of endogenous p73. TP73 shares many response genes with TP53 in vivo. This has been shown in several cell systems using transient or inducible expression of ectopic p73 (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M.

Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). To further support our previous results, we tested whether oncogene-mediated accumulation of endogenous p73 leads to the induction of TP73 target gene products. When p53-deficient H1299 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for E2F1, c-Myc, and E1A, endogenous p73 β protein was again up-regulated (Fig. 4 B, top panel,lanes 2–4, compare with empty vector inlane 1). Oncogene expression was confirmed by immunoblots (data not shown). The p73 up-regulation was accompanied by the induction of the TP73 response gene products Waf1p21 and HDM2 (Fig. 4 B, middle panels,lanes 2–4; compare with empty vector inlane 1). Lanes 5 and6 are positive controls after direct transfection of p73 α and β expression plasmids. Although the induction is modest, it could be due to the fact that we are relying on endogenous rather than ectopic p73. Furthermore, since transfection efficiency was only between 30 and 40%, the actual induction is probably higher than the one detected here by immunoblots, due to the dilutional effect by the untransfected majority of cells. E2F1 reproducibly caused a stronger transactivation of the p21 and HDM2 genes than c-Myc and E1A. Previous studies have shown that Waf1p21 and HDM2 are direct in vivotargets of ectopic p73, as demonstrated by detecting their products in response to inducibly expressed p73 α and β in EJ (mutant p53) and p53-deficient H1299 cells (9Zhu J.

In p53-expressing cells, transactivation of HDM2 in response to a broad spectrum of overexpressed oncogenes including the panel used here has been shown to be indirect and strictly dependent on p53 (for a review, see Ref. 47Gartel A.L.

Transactivation of p21 by c-Myc and E1A is also p53-dependent, although E2F1, in addition to activating the p21 promoter through p53, can transactivate p21 directly (47Gartel A.L. Goufman E.

So named because of the phenotypes conferred by their animal prototypes, many MRPs are MgATP-energized pumps active in the transport of glutathione (GS) conjugates and other bulky amphipathic anions across membranes. Here we show that <i>Arabidopsis</i> MRP2 (AtMRP2) localizes to the vacuolar membrane fraction from seedlings and is not only competent in the transport of GS conjugates but also glucuronate conjugates after heterologous expression in yeast. Based on the stimulatory action of the model GS conjugate 2,4-dinitrophenyl-GS (DNP-GS) on uptake of the model glucuronide 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E<sub>2</sub>17βG) and <i>vice versa</i>, double-label experiments demonstrating that the two substrates are subject to simultaneous transport by AtMRP2 and preloading experiments suggesting that the effects seen result from <i>cis</i>, not<i>trans</i>, interactions, it is inferred that some GS conjugates and some glucuronides reciprocally activate each other's transport<i>via</i> distinct but coupled binding sites. The results of parallel experiments on AtMRP1 and representative yeast and mammalian MRPs indicate that these properties are specific to AtMRP2. The effects exerted by DNP-GS on AtMRP2 are not, however, common to all GS conjugates and not simulated by oxidized glutathione or reduced glutathione. Decyl-GS, metolachlor-GS, and oxidized glutathione, although competitive with DNP-GS, do not promote E<sub>2</sub>17βG uptake by AtMRP2. Reduced glutathione, although subject to transport by AtMRP2 and able to markedly promote E<sub>2</sub>17βG uptake, neither competes with DNP-GS for uptake nor is subject to E<sub>2</sub>17βG-promoted uptake. A multisite model comprising three or four semi-autonomous transport pathways plus distinct but tightly coupled binding sites is invoked for AtMRP2."

FDB is caused by a mutation (R3500Q) that changes the conformation of apolipoprotein (apo) B100 near the receptor-binding site. We previously showed that arginine, not simply a positive charge, at residue 3500 is essential for normal receptor binding and that the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 is necessary for mutations affecting arginine 3500 to disrupt LDL receptor binding. Thus, normal receptor binding involves an interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369 in the carboxyl tail of apoB100. W4369Y LDL and R3500Q LDL isolated from transgenic mice had identically defective LDL binding and a higher affinity for the monoclonal antibody MB47, which has an epitope flanking residue 3500. We conclude that arginine 3500 interacts with tryptophan 4369 and facilitates the conformation of apoB100 required for normal receptor binding of LDL. From our findings, we developed a model that explains how the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 interacts with the backbone of apoB100 that enwraps the LDL particle.

However, the ability of apoB100 to interact with the LDL receptor depends not only on sequence, but also on conformation, because apoB100 binds to the LDL receptor only after the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to smaller cholesterol-rich LDL (1Goldstein J.L.

Estimated to occur in 1/500 to 1/700 people in several Caucasian populations in North America and Europe, FDB is one of the most common single-gene defects known to cause an inherited abnormality (6Rauh G.

Both of these mutations are located outside of the LDL receptor-binding site in apoB100 (residues 3359–3369).Immunoelectronmicroscopy studies have shown that the first 89% of apoB100 enwraps the LDL particle like a belt and that the COOH-terminal 11% constitutes a bow that crosses over the belt, bringing the COOH-terminal portion of apoB100 close to amino acid 3500 (11Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not certain where the carboxyl tail crosses over the belt, but the shortest path between the epitopes for residues 4154–4189 and 4507–4513 in the three-dimensional map of apoB100 created by Chatterton et al. (11Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) puts the crossover point somewhere around residues 4275–4400. This evidence is suggestive only, as no intervening epitopes on apoB were placed between residues 4154 and 4513 (11Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We recently reported that the COOH-terminal bow functions as a negative modulator of receptor binding and inhibits binding of VLDL to the LDL receptor (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We also showed that arginine, and not simply a positive charge, at residue 3500 is critical for normal receptor binding and that the carboxyl terminus is necessary for the R3500Q mutation to disrupt LDL receptor binding (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine, at the molecular level, how arginine 3500 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of apoB100.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of arginine 3500 with the carboxyl terminus of apoB100. Our results showed that recombinant W4369Y LDL and R3500Q FDB LDL were equally defective in binding to LDL receptors and, perhaps more significantly, had the same conformational change around the receptor-binding domain, as detected by increased affinity for the antibody MB47. The MB47 epitope lies ∼850 residues away from tryptophan 4369 (26Young S.G. Koduri R.K. Austin R.K. Bonnet D.J. Smith R.S. Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 399-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the W4369Y and R3500Q mutations have the same phenotype is a powerful argument for the importance of the R3500-W4369 interaction in facilitating the proper conformation of apoB100 for normal receptor binding of LDL. An interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369 also explains why the naturally occurring R3500W mutation causes somewhat less defective LDL receptor binding than the R3500Q mutation (7Fisher E. Scharnagl H. Hoffmann M.M. Klusterer K. Wittmann D. Wieland H. Gross W. März W. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1026-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan 3500 can interact weakly with tryptophan 4369, whereas this interaction is entirely disrupted by a glutamine at position 3500 (7Fisher E. Scharnagl H. Hoffmann M.M. Klusterer K. Wittmann D. Wieland H. Gross W. März W. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1026-1038PubMed Google Scholar).We developed a model of how the COOH-terminal bow interacts with the backbone of apoB100 that enwraps the LDL particle (Fig.5). Our model predicts that arginine 3500 interacts with tryptophan 4369 and that this interaction is essential for correct conformation of the COOH-terminal tail of apoB100. The disruption of this interaction results in a conformational change, disrupted receptor binding, and the clinical disorder FDB. LDL containing apoB95 lack the carboxyl tail that crosses over the belt and therefore have enhanced receptor binding; in contrast, apoB97 LDL contain tryptophan 4369 and bind normally (Fig. 5). Morphological support for the model was recently presented by Gantz et al.(27Gantz D.L. Walsh M.T. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1464-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that a proportion of sodium deoxycholate-solubilized apoB100 LDL contained loops of a size that correlates with the dimensions of a COOH-terminal loop stabilized by an interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369.Our model further implies that tryptophan 4369 interacts with arginines in addition to arginine 3500 in apoB100 during the conversion of VLDL to LDL. Only four naturally occurring mutations in apoB100 have been unequivocally linked to defective LDL receptor binding and hypercholesterolemia: R3500Q (28Soria L.F. Ludwig E.H. Clarke H.R.G. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. McCarthy B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), R3500W (9Gaffney D. Reid J.M. Cameron I.M. Vass K. Caslake M.J. Shepherd J. Packard C.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), R3531C (10Pullinger C.R. Hennessy L.K. Chatterton J.E. Liu W. Love J.A. Mendel C.M. Frost P.H. Malloy M.J. Schumaker V.N. Kane J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and R3480W (the novel mutation characterized in this study). All four mutations are located within a stretch of 51 amino acids and result in the loss of an arginine.How does the disrupted interaction between any of these arginines and tryptophan 4369 give rise to defective LDL receptor binding? The key observation is that FDB LDL have an altered conformation in the region around the receptor-binding domain, as demonstrated by both MB47 antibody studies and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (16Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Newhouse Y.M. Young S.G. Arnold K.S. Krauss R.M. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2701-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding that FDB LDL bind normally to proteoglycans rules out the possibility that the COOH-terminal bow interferes with the LDL receptor-binding site directly, since the principal proteoglycan-binding site of apoB100 coincides with the LDL receptor-binding site (30Borén J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T. Innerarity T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).We propose that arginine-tryptophan interactions are crucial during the conversion of VLDL to LDL for positioning apoB100's carboxyl tail, which functions as a modulator element that inhibits VLDL from interacting with the LDL receptor (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), to permit apoB100 on LDL to bind normally to the receptor. A disturbed refolding process gives rise to the two characteristics of FDB: a defective conformation of apoB100 and hypercholesterolemia due to ligand-binding-defective apoB100. Interestingly, Milne and co-workers (31Wang X. Pease R. Bertinato J. Milne R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) recently showed that two specific regions located near the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 (between residues 4342 and 4536) and close to the LDL receptor binding site undergo a major conformational change as VLDL are converted to small LDL.The finding that tryptophan 4369 is crucial for the correct conformation of apoB100 is interesting in light of recent findings regarding the oxidation of tryptophans in apoB. Tryptophan oxidation has been assumed to be an early event, possibly an elementary reaction, in the initiation of LDL oxidation (32Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L.

Oxidation may affect the structure and the biological properties of the tryptophans, and it is reasonable to speculate that oxidation of tryptophan 4369 could disrupt the binding of LDL to its receptor.

Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not certain where the carboxyl tail crosses over the belt, but the shortest path between the epitopes for residues 4154–4189 and 4507–4513 in the three-dimensional map of apoB100 created by Chatterton et al. (11Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) puts the crossover point somewhere around residues 4275–4400. This evidence is suggestive only, as no intervening epitopes on apoB were placed between residues 4154 and 4513 (11Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that the COOH-terminal bow functions as a negative modulator of receptor binding and inhibits binding of VLDL to the LDL receptor (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We also showed that arginine, and not simply a positive charge, at residue 3500 is critical for normal receptor binding and that the carboxyl terminus is necessary for the R3500Q mutation to disrupt LDL receptor binding (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine, at the molecular level, how arginine 3500 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of apoB100. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of arginine 3500 with the carboxyl terminus of apoB100. Our results showed that recombinant W4369Y LDL and R3500Q FDB LDL were equally defective in binding to LDL receptors and, perhaps more significantly, had the same conformational change around the receptor-binding domain, as detected by increased affinity for the antibody MB47. The MB47 epitope lies ∼850 residues away from tryptophan 4369 (26Young S.G. Koduri R.K. Austin R.K. Bonnet D.J. Smith R.S. Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 399-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the W4369Y and R3500Q mutations have the same phenotype is a powerful argument for the importance of the R3500-W4369 interaction in facilitating the proper conformation of apoB100 for normal receptor binding of LDL. An interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369 also explains why the naturally occurring R3500W mutation causes somewhat less defective LDL receptor binding than the R3500Q mutation (7Fisher E. Scharnagl H. Hoffmann M.M. Klusterer K. Wittmann D. Wieland H. Gross W. März W. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1026-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan 3500 can interact weakly with tryptophan 4369, whereas this interaction is entirely disrupted by a glutamine at position 3500 (7Fisher E. Scharnagl H. Hoffmann M.M. Klusterer K. Wittmann D. Wieland H. Gross W. März W. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1026-1038PubMed Google Scholar).We developed a model of how the COOH-terminal bow interacts with the backbone of apoB100 that enwraps the LDL particle (Fig.5). Our model predicts that arginine 3500 interacts with tryptophan 4369 and that this interaction is essential for correct conformation of the COOH-terminal tail of apoB100. The disruption of this interaction results in a conformational change, disrupted receptor binding, and the clinical disorder FDB. LDL containing apoB95 lack the carboxyl tail that crosses over the belt and therefore have enhanced receptor binding; in contrast, apoB97 LDL contain tryptophan 4369 and bind normally (Fig. 5). Morphological support for the model was recently presented by Gantz et al.(27Gantz D.L. Walsh M.T. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1464-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that a proportion of sodium deoxycholate-solubilized apoB100 LDL contained loops of a size that correlates with the dimensions of a COOH-terminal loop stabilized by an interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369.Our model further implies that tryptophan 4369 interacts with arginines in addition to arginine 3500 in apoB100 during the conversion of VLDL to LDL. Only four naturally occurring mutations in apoB100 have been unequivocally linked to defective LDL receptor binding and hypercholesterolemia: R3500Q (28Soria L.F. Ludwig E.H. Clarke H.R.G. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. McCarthy B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), R3500W (9Gaffney D. Reid J.M. Cameron I.M. Vass K. Caslake M.J. Shepherd J. Packard C.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), R3531C (10Pullinger C.R. Hennessy L.K. Chatterton J.E. Liu W. Love J.A. Mendel C.M. Frost P.H. Malloy M.J. Schumaker V.N. Kane J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and R3480W (the novel mutation characterized in this study). All four mutations are located within a stretch of 51 amino acids and result in the loss of an arginine.How does the disrupted interaction between any of these arginines and tryptophan 4369 give rise to defective LDL receptor binding? The key observation is that FDB LDL have an altered conformation in the region around the receptor-binding domain, as demonstrated by both MB47 antibody studies and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (16Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Newhouse Y.M. Young S.G. Arnold K.S. Krauss R.M. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2701-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding that FDB LDL bind normally to proteoglycans rules out the possibility that the COOH-terminal bow interferes with the LDL receptor-binding site directly, since the principal proteoglycan-binding site of apoB100 coincides with the LDL receptor-binding site (30Borén J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T. Innerarity T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).We propose that arginine-tryptophan interactions are crucial during the conversion of VLDL to LDL for positioning apoB100's carboxyl tail, which functions as a modulator element that inhibits VLDL from interacting with the LDL receptor (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), to permit apoB100 on LDL to bind normally to the receptor. A disturbed refolding process gives rise to the two characteristics of FDB: a defective conformation of apoB100 and hypercholesterolemia due to ligand-binding-defective apoB100. Interestingly, Milne and co-workers (31Wang X. Pease R. Bertinato J. Milne R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) recently showed that two specific regions located near the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 (between residues 4342 and 4536) and close to the LDL receptor binding site undergo a major conformational change as VLDL are converted to small LDL.The finding that tryptophan 4369 is crucial for the correct conformation of apoB100 is interesting in light of recent findings regarding the oxidation of tryptophans in apoB. Tryptophan oxidation has been assumed to be an early event, possibly an elementary reaction, in the initiation of LDL oxidation (32Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L.

Oxidation may affect the structure and the biological properties of the tryptophans, and it is reasonable to speculate that oxidation of tryptophan 4369 could disrupt the binding of LDL to its receptor.

However, in disease states this process can promote hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is associated with increased NADH levels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle and with intracellular Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores. Because cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) regulates ryanodine receptors and is synthesized from β-NAD+, we investigated the regulation by β-NADH of cADPR synthesis and metabolism and the role of cADPR in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Significantly higher rates of cADPR synthesis occurred in smooth muscle homogenates of pulmonary arteries, compared with homogenates of systemic arteries. When the β-NAD+:β-NADH ratio was reduced, the net amount of cADPR accumulated increased. This was due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cADPR hydrolase by β-NADH. Furthermore, hypoxia induced a 10-fold increase in cADPR levels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle, and a membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist, 8-bromo-cADPR, abolished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pulmonary artery rings. We propose that the cellular redox state may be coupled via an increase in β-NADH levels to enhanced cADPR synthesis, activation of ryanodine receptors, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release.

This redox-sensing pathway may offer new therapeutic targets for hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction sarcoplasmic reticulum cyclic ADP-ribose ryanodine receptor Since it was first described over 50 years ago, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV)1 has been recognized as the critical and distinguishing characteristic of the blood vessels of the lung (1Von Euler U.S. Liljestrand G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1946; 12: 301-320Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Thus, in marked contrast to systemic arteries, which dilate in response to hypoxia, pulmonary arteries constrict. Physiologically, HPV contributes to the matching of lung perfusion and ventilation. However, when alveolar hypoxia is global, as it is in disease states such as cystic fibrosis, emphysema, and mountain sickness, it results in pulmonary hypertension, which can ultimately lead to right heart failure. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms that underpin HPV remain to be identified, and current therapies for hypoxic pulmonary hypertension are poor. Certain key characteristics of HPV have been described. In isolated pulmonary arteries, HPV is biphasic. An initial transient constriction (phase 1) is followed by a slowly developing, sustained phase of constriction (phase 2). It is widely thought that the first phase of constriction is initiated by a reduction in membrane K+conductance in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (2Post J. Hume J. Archer S. Weir E. Am. J.

Phase 2 of the constriction is tonic and may depend on the release of a vasoconstrictor from the endothelium, which sensitizes the contractile apparatus to Ca2+ (9Kovitz K.L. Aleskowitch J.T.

Our recent findings (11Dipp M. Nye P.C.G. Evans A.M. J. Physiol. 2000; 526: S26PGoogle Scholar) do not support the above hypothesis. They suggest that hypoxia may, by activating a mechanism intrinsic to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, induce intracellular Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores in the absence of transmembrane Ca2+ influx. This proposal is also supported by the findings of others (12Jabr R.I. Toland H. Gelband C.H. Wang X.X. Hume J.R. Br. J.

Also, we have established that the hypoxia-induced SR Ca2+ release initiates and maintains acute HPV (11Dipp M. Nye P.C.G. Evans A.M. J. Physiol. 2000; 526: S26PGoogle Scholar).

We have investigated the role of the β-NAD+:β-NADH ratio in regulating cADPR synthesis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle because of the fact that (a) the cellular redox couple β-NAD+ is the recognized substrate for cADPR synthesis; (b) the redox state of O2-sensing cells is uniquely sensitive to changes in the level of O2 (20Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar); (c) hypoxia has been shown to reduce the NAD(P): NAD(P)H ratio in all O2-sensing cells studied to date, including carotid body type I cells (20Duchen M.R.

We report that the enzyme activities for cADPR synthesis and metabolism are particularly high in pulmonary artery smooth muscle, as opposed to systemic artery smooth muscle. We show that hypoxia, by increasing β-NADH levels, inhibits cADPR hydrolase, which in turn promotes an increase in cADPR levels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle. Furthermore, we show that a membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist, 8-bromo-cADPR, abolishes the second, sustained phase of HPV. The role of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase as a redox sensor is discussed. Male New Zealand White rabbits (1–2 Kg) were stunned and killed by cervical dislocation. Heart and lungs were removed and placed in PSSA (124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 15 mm NaH2CO3, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mmKH2PO4, 15 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 95% air, 5% CO2). Pulmonary arteries, mesenteric arteries, and aorta were dissected free and cleaned. The endothelium was removed by rubbing the luminal surface with a cotton bud, and 2-mm artery strips were cut and placed in 1 ml of Ca2+-free sucrose-HEPES buffer (250 mm and 20 mm, respectively, pH 7.2). The preparation was homogenized by 2× 5-s bursts using an ultra-turrex homogenizer; 2× 5 strokes using a glass Dounce homogenizer (pestle D). Homogenates were centrifuged for 12 min at 2,000 × gand 4 °C to remove debris and nuclei. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C. Production of cADPR from 2.5 mmβ-NAD+ and metabolism of 5–10 μm cADPR, respectively, was assessed in 10–50-μl samples of smooth muscle homogenate at 37 °C. Test samples (5 μl) were assayed for cADPR using a Ca2+ release bioassay (see below). Smooth muscle cells were isolated as previously described (24Clapp L.H. Gurney A.M. Exp. Physiol. 1991; 76: 677-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Prior to enzyme assays only, cells were washed in sucrose-HEPES buffer, centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended, and washed once in (a) phosphate-buffered saline (120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer salts; pH 7.4), (b) phosphate-buffered saline plus 1 mm EGTA, or (c) 100–300 μl of sucrose-HEPES buffer. Buffers contained protease inhibitors: 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were permeabilized with saponin (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 24 °C. Permeabilization was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Homogenates were prepared and “calcium-loaded” in an intracellular medium (250 mm potassium gluconate, 250 mm N-methyl-glucamine, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 10 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.2) as described previously (25Sethi J.K.

J. 1997; 319: 613-617Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Intracellular medium also contained protease inhibitors (25 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor) and mitochondrial inhibitors (1 μg/ml oligomycin, 1 μg/ml antimycin, and 1 mm sodium azide). Fluo-3 (3 mm) was used as a Ca2+indicator (excitation = 490 nm, emission = 535 nm). Changes in free Ca2+ induced by 5-μl test samples were measured at 17 °C using 500 μl of sea urchin egg homogenate in a PerkinElmer LS-50B fluorimeter. cADPR was identified by homologous desensitization of ryanodine receptors (27Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by interpolation with standard concentration-response curves (28Wilson H.L. Galione A. Biochemical J. 1998; 331: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The substrate was NGD+ (250 μm). Autofluorescence of the product, cyclic GDP-ribose, was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 300 and 410 nm, respectively (29Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixture (500 μl) contained test homogenate diluted 1 in 10 with sucrose-HEPES buffer. Homogenates were separated by differential centrifugation: P1, nuclear and whole cell debris (1,000 × g); P2, plasma membrane (8,000 ×g); P3, microsomal membranes (SR and mitochondria; 100,000 × g); S3, cytosolic fraction (30Evans W.H. Evans W.H. Biological Membranes. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 1-35Google Scholar). Estimated using the BCA protein assay (Sigma). Membrane potential recordings in isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were made at 22 °C, under current clamp (I = 0) and using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, as described previously (31Evans A.M. Osipenko O.N. Gurney A.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 496.2: 407-420Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Data were acquired and analyzed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP 6.0 data acquisition and analysis software (Axon Instruments). The pipette solution was 140 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution was 130 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm glucose, 10 mmHEPES, 1.7 mm CaCl2, and 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.45. Vessels were always obtained from the same anatomical position within the lung, i.e. third order branches of the pulmonary arterial tree (inner diameter, 300–400 μm). Vessels (2–3 mm in length) were mounted on to the jaws of an automated myograph (AM10, Cambustion Biological, Cambridge, UK) using 50-μm tungsten wire. Initial tension was set to be equivalent to typical pulmonary arterial pressure. The detailed technique, protocol, and theory have been described previously (32Halpern W. Mulvany M.J. J. Physiol. 1987; 265: 21P-23PGoogle Scholar). Vessels were bathed in PSS B (constituents as for PSS A, but with 24 mm NaHCO3 and no HEPES) at 37 ± 1 °C and in a bath volume of 4 ml. The solution was bubbled with 75% N2, 20% O2, 5% CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. All arteries were first subjected to four exposures of high K+ (75 mm) to test their responsiveness and stability. Resting tension was taken to be zero. The bath chambers containing PSS B were individually sealed and bubbled with either normoxic (154–160 Torr; 75% N2, 20% O2, 5% CO2) or hypoxic (16–21 Torr; 93% N2, 2% O2, 5% CO2) gas, supplied via a gas-mixing flowmeter (Cameron Instruments Ltd., Port Aransas, TX). The desired PaO2 was confirmed using an Oxel O2 electrode and meter (World Precision Instruments). All drugs were applied to the bath directly. All solutions were warmed to 37 °C before adding them to the bath. When required, the endothelium of the arteries was removed by rubbing the inner surface with braided silk surgical thread. Removal of the endothelium was assessed by the ability of 100 μmacetylcholine to relax constrictions induced by 1 μmprostaglandin F2α. Second and third order branches of the pulmonary artery were placed in chambers containing PSS B that were individually sealed and bubbled with either normoxic (154–160 Torr; 75% N2, 20% O2, 5% CO2) or hypoxic (16–21 Torr; 93% N2, 2% O2, 5% CO2) gas as described above (see small vessel myography). Vessels were quickly removed from the experimental chambers and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Acid extraction of nucleotides/cADPR was carried out using a variation of a method described previously (33Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2276-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the frozen tissue was powdered, added to ice-cold 3 m perchloric acid (1:1 w/v) and sonicated for 20 s. After sonication the samples were left in an ice-salt bath (−5 °C) for 30 min to allow for extraction of nucleotides. Precipitated protein was then removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 2 mKHCO3. The potassium perchlorate precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. To remove contaminating nucleotides that weakly interfere with [32P]cADPR binding, the neutralized acid extracts were treated with NADase (0.25 unit/ml), nucleotide pyrophosphatase (1.75 units/ml), alkaline phosphatase (50 units/ml), and apyrase (5 units/ml) for 4 h, as previously described (15Walseth T. Aarhus R. Zeleznikar R. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The concentration of cADPR in acid extracts was assessed by comparing inhibitory effects on the [32P]cADPR binding assay, with a standard curve constructed using authentic cADPR. As a control each sample was heat treated at 85 °C for 45 min, to hydrolyze cADPR to ADPR. The inhibitory effect on [32P]cADPR binding of all samples was abolished by heat treatment. The recovery of cADPR, monitored by recovery of [32P]cADPR added prior to acid extraction, was 69.9 ± 5.2% (n = 3). Correction was introduced for recovery of cADPR. Enzymatic synthesis of [32P]cADPR and determination of specific [32P]cADPR binding to sea urchin egg homogenate were performed using methods described previously (35Galione A. Cancela J-M.

Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Lytechinus pictus sea urchins were from Marinus Inc. (Long Beach, CA). Chemicals were from Sigma, except Fluo-3, which was from Molecular Probes, and [32P]β-NAD+, which was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance and assumed if p < 0.05. Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. for nanimals tested unless stated. In biochemical assays each sample was assayed in triplicate. Fig.1 A illustrates the time course of cADPR synthesis from 2.5 mm β-NAD+ in smooth muscle homogenates from third order branches of the pulmonary arterial tree, as determined by the sea urchin homogenate bioassay. The synthesis was complete after 45 min, when 18 ± 1.7 nmol of cADPR were synthesized per mg of protein (n = 5 animals). Homogenates showed a similar time-dependent hydrolysis of 5 μm cADPR, assessed by bioassay. This was complete at 60 min, when 10 ± 0.6 nmol of cADPR had been metabolized per mg of protein (n = 4 animals; Fig. 1 B). Theinset in Fig. 1 A shows that 250 μmNGD+, an alternative substrate for ADP-ribosyl cyclase, yielded a fluorecent cyclic product (cyclic GDP-ribose) when NGD+ was added to smooth muscle homogenates of third order branches of the pulmonary artery. When NGD+ was excluded, no change in fluorescence was observed with time (trace 1). Upon addition of NGD+ a significant increase in the fluorescence was observed with time (trace 2). The increase in fluorescence was clearly dependent on cyclic GDP-ribose formation and therefore ADP-ribosyl cyclase, because it was inhibited by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase antagonist nicotinamide (10 mm;trace 3; see also Refs. 25Sethi J.K. Empson R.M. Bailey V.C. Potter B.V. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16358-16363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 26Sethi J.K. Empson R.M. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1997; 319: 613-617Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because both ecto-enzymes and intracellular enzymes with ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities have been reported (37Howard H.M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), it was important to show whether or not cADPR could be synthesized intracellularly, because this would probably be more relevant to an intracellular signaling role. To achieve this we studied the enzyme activities in the cellular fractions obtained from differential centrifugation of smooth muscle homogenates from third order branches of the pulmonary artery. Fig.2 A shows that the synthesis of cADPR was detected in each of the membrane fractions. However, the rate of synthesis was highest in the P3 (microsomal; SR and mitochondria) fraction at 9.5 ± 1.1 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 3 animals), compared with 2.5 ± 0.7 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 3 animals) in the P2 fraction (plasma membrane), 0.25 ± 0.01 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 3 animals) in the P1 fraction (nuclear and whole cell debris), and 0.01 ± 0.1 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 3 animals) in the S3 fraction (cytosolic). Fig. 2 B shows a similar distribution for cADPR metabolism. The rate of metabolism was highest in the P3 (microsomal; SR and mitochondria) fraction at 2.6 ± 0.3 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 3 animals), compared with 0.92 ± 0.02 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 3 animals) in the P2 fraction (plasma membrane). In contrast, the hydrolase activity in the P1 fraction (nuclear and whole cell debris; n = 3 animals) and in the S3 fraction (cytosolic; n = 3 animals), respectively, was undetectable. Fig. 2 C shows the distribution of a 5′ nucleotidase reaction used to estimate the relative level of plasma membrane associated protein in all four fractions. The highest level of 5′ nucleotidase activity was 129 ± 19 units/liter for the P2 (plasma membrane) fraction (n = 3 animals), compared with 86 ± 5.5 U/liter (n = 3 animals) for the P3 (microsomal) fraction and 56 ± 2.2 U/liter (n = 3 animals) for the P1 (nuclear and whole cell debris) fraction. Clearly, the P2 fraction had a much lower level of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activity than the P3 pellet. The ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activity did not, therefore, follow the plasma membrane contamination. Fig. 2 D shows cADPR synthesis using whole and saponin (50 μg/ml) permeabilized pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells isolated from the large extrapulmonary artery. A significantly greater level of synthesis was detected in permeabilized smooth muscle cells. Thus, after a 120-min incubation with 2.5 mm β-NAD+the production of cADPR measured 0.51 ± 0.07 nmol/mg protein (n = 3 animals) in whole cells and 1.5 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein (n = 3 animals) in paired and time-matched permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 D). A clear separation in the level of cADPR synthesis in whole versuspermeabilized pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, respectively, was not, however, observed at the 60-min time point. This apparent nonlinearity may be a product of (a) the sensitivity of the Ca2+ release bioassay to cADPR and (b) the time required for sufficient quantities of the newly synthesized cADPR to accumulate in the samples tested. Note that the saponin concentration used was found to have no effect on the Ca2+ release bio-assay (see methods). Fig. 2 D (inset) shows a picture of an isolated and saponin permeabilized pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell in suspension. Fig.3 A compares the level of cADPR synthesis by homogenates of pulmonary and systemic arterial smooth muscle following a 1-h incubation with 2.5 mmβ-NAD+. The quantity of cADPR produced was high in smooth muscle homogenates from all sections of the pulmonary arterial tree, whereas no significant production could be detected in homogenates of either the aorta or mesenteric artery. Moreover, the level of cADPR synthesis was inversely related to pulmonary artery diameter, measuring 1.0 ± 0.4 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 4 animals) in homogenates of the large conduit or extrapulmonary artery, 9.1 ± 2.8 nmol/mg protein/h (n = 5 animals) in the second order branches of the pulmonary artery (intrapulmonary artery) and 18 ± 1.7 nmol/mg protein/h (n = 6 animals) in the third order branches. Fig. 3 B shows that the rate of hydrolysis of 5 μm cADPR in the same series of artery homogenates followed a similar pattern, measuring 11 ± 1.5 nmol/mg protein/h (n = 4 animals) in smooth muscle homogenates of the third order branches, 5.7 ± 2.3 nmol/mg protein/h (n = 5 animals) in second order branches, and 2.3 ± 2.2 nmol/mg protein/h (n = 4 animals) in homogenates of the extrapulmonary artery. In contrast to cADPR synthesis, a small amount of cADPR hydrolysis was detected in homogenates of both the aorta (0.6 ± 0.3 nmol/mg protein/h;n = 3 animals) and the near-resistance sized mesenteric arteries (200–1000 μm external diameter; 0.4 ± 0.2 nmol/mg protein/h, n = 3 animals). These findings suggest that ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR may play an important role in the regulation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell function. Fig.4 A compares the rate of synthesis of cADPR from a maximally effective concentration (2.5 mm) of β-NAD+ to the rate of synthesis of cADPR from 25 mm β-NADH (n = 4 animals). From these data β-NADH can be seen to be a poor substrate for ADP-ribosyl cyclase in pulmonary artery smooth muscle. However, addition of β-NADH in combination with β-NAD+ could produce up to a 3-fold increase in cADPR synthesis when compared with the time-matched synthesis obtained in the presence of β-NAD+ alone. Fig. 4 B shows the effect of β-NADH (1–10 mm) on the synthesis of cADPR from a maximally effective concentration of β-NAD+ (2.5 mm) in smooth muscle homogenates from third order branches of the pulmonary artery. β-NADH increased the rate of synthesis of cADPR from β-NAD+ in a concentration-dependent manner. The rate of synthesis of cADPR increased from 13.52 ± 1.5 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 4 animals) in the absence of β-NADH to a maximum of ∼30 nmol/mg of protein/h (n = 4 animals) in the presence of 4–10 mm β-NADH. The fact that β-NADH increased cADPR synthesis from a maximally effective concentration of β-NAD+ raised the possibility that β-NADH may mediate this effect via the inhibition of cADPR hydrolase. Fig. 4 C, shows that 4 mm β-NADH inhibited the hydrolysis of cADPR (10 μm) in pulmonary artery smooth muscle homogenates. In smooth muscle homogenates of third order branches of the pulmonary artery, 3.63 ± 0.49 nmol of cADPR were metabolized/mg protein/h (n = 3 animals) in the absence of β-NADH. This fell to 0.61 ± 0.37 nmol/mg protein/h (n = 3 animals) in the presence of 2 mm β-NADH and was undetectable in the presence of 4 mm β-NADH. Taken together these findings suggest that net amount of cADPR accumulated from β-NAD+ may be increased by β-NADH in a nonadditive and synergistic manner. This may be due, at least in part, to the inhibition by β-NADH of cADPR hydrolase. Note that the small amount of cADPR synthesis observed with 25 mm β-NADH may be due, in part, to the 0.5% β-NAD+ contamination. We used a sea urchin egg homogenate [32P]cADPR receptor binding assay to compare the cADPR content of pulmonary artery smooth muscle under normoxic (151–160 Torr) and hypoxic (16–21 Torr) conditions. Fig.5 shows that the level of cADPR in second order branches of the pulmonary artery increased ∼2-fold in the presence of hypoxia from 1.5 ± 0.4 pmol/mg protein to 3.6 ± 0.5 pmol/mg protein (n = 3 animals). Significantly, the increase in cADPR induced by hypoxia was greater still in third order branches of the pulmonary artery, in which we measured a 10-fold increase in cADPR from 1.5 ± 0.6 pmol/mg protein to 19.7 ± 1.1 pmol/mg protein (n = 3 animals). We examined the sensitivity of pulmonary artery smooth muscle Ca2+ stores to cADPR. This was achieved by applying cADPR intracellularly from a patch pipette in the whole cell configuration and in current clamp mode (I = 0). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were monitored by recording changes in the membrane potential mediated via the activation of large conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (BKCa) in smooth muscle cells isolated from second and third order branches of the pulmonary artery. In the absence of cADPR the membrane potential was stable at approximately −45 ± 5 mV (n = 3 cells), in agreement with the findings of others (38Bae Y.M. Park M.K. Lee S.H. Ho W.K. Earm Y.E. J. Physiol. 1999; 514.2: 747-758Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, Fig.6 A shows the effect of intracellular dialysis of 30 μm cADPR from the patch pipette; dialysis began immediately after breaking the membrane patch under the pipette tip, i.e. at the start of the record shown. Clearly, cADPR induced a pronounced hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. The hyperpolarization reached a maximum after ∼1–2 min, at which point pronounced oscillations in the membrane potential were observed. When the oscillations in membrane potential commenced the smooth muscle cells began to contract, and it proved impossible to hold the smooth muscle cells in a tight whole cell configuration for any length of time. On average (mean ± S.E.;n = 5 cells), the membrane potential hyperpolarized from −48.6 ± 5.3 mV (recorded immediately after entering the whole cell configuration) to −73 ± 2.4 mV. The hyperpolarization, oscillations in membrane potential, and cell contraction were not observed after the ryanodine-sensitive SR stores had been depleted by prior application of 10 μm ryanodine and 10 mm caffeine (Fig. 6 B). Under these conditions the membrane potential remained stable at −55 ± 3 mV (n = 4 cells) for the duration of the experiment (≤20 min). The activation of BKCa channels was confirmed by the fact that the hyperpolarization was not observed in the presence of TEA (10 mm; not shown) or iberiotoxin (100 nm; not shown). These data suggest that cADPR can induce Ca2+release from ryanodine-sensitive SR stores in pulmon"
https://openalex.org/W2045610845,"The ClC-5 chloride channel resides mainly in vesicles of the endocytotic pathway and contributes to their acidification. Its disruption in mice entails a broad defect in renal endocytosis and causes secondary changes in calciotropic hormone levels. Inactivating mutations in Dent's disease lead to proteinuria and kidney stones. Possibly by recycling, a small fraction of ClC-5 also reaches the plasma membrane. Here we identify a carboxyl-terminal internalization motif in ClC-5. It resembles the PY motif, which is crucial for the endocytosis and degradation of epithelial Na+ channels. Mutating this motif increases surface expression and currents about 2-fold. This is probably because of interactions with WW domains, because dominant negative mutants of the ubiquitin-protein ligase WWP2 increased surface expression and currents of ClC-5 only when its PY motif was intact. Stimulating endocytosis by expressing rab5 or its GTPase-deficient Q79L mutant decreased WT ClC-5 currents but did not affect channels with mutated motifs. Similarly, decreasing endocytosis by expressing the inactive S34N mutant of rab5 increased ClC-5 currents only if its PY-like motif was intact. Thus, the endocytosis of ClC-5, which itself is crucial for the endocytosis of other proteins, depends on the interaction of a carboxyl-terminal internalization signal with ubiquitin-protein ligases containing WW domains.

CLC chloride channels form a gene family of chloride channels that has at least nine members in mammals (1Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Based on homology, it can be divided into three branches. Channels of the first branch perform their physiological function in the plasma membrane. In some instances, this conclusion is also supported by inherited disease. Mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel cause myotonia (2Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch H. Gründer S. Jentsch T.J.

Mutations in the human ClC-Kb kidney chloride channel are a cause of Bartter's syndrome (4Simon D.B. Bindra R.S. Mansfield T.A. Nelson-Williams C. Mendonca E. Stone R. Schurman S. Nayir A. Alpay H.

Hayama A. Morimoto T. Liu W. Arisawa M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Both findings indicate that these channels are involved in the transport of salt and fluid across different nephron segments. In contrast, members of the two remaining branches of the CLC gene family probably function primarily in intracellular compartments (1Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Again, an inherited disease has shed light on one of these channels. ClC-5, which belongs to the branch also comprising ClC-3 and ClC-4, is mutated in Dent's disease (6Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A.

This X-linked disorder is characterized by the urinary loss of low molecular weight proteins, calcium, and phosphate, and leads to the clinically important symptoms of kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. The selective loss of low molecular weight proteins points to a defect of the renal proximal tubule of the kidney, where filtered proteins are normally reabsorbed by endocytosis. Indeed, ClC-5 is located in subapical endosomes of the proximal tubule where it colocalizes with the V-type H+-ATPase and with reabsorbed protein (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A.

In transfected cells, besides some labeling of the plasma membrane, ClC-5 was mainly found in intracellular vesicles, where it colocalizes with endocytosed protein (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Mice with a disrupted ClC-5 gene indeed had a broad defect in proximal tubular endocytosis (9Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Fluid-phase endocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the endocytotic removal of plasma membrane proteins were markedly inhibited but not totally abolished. Because several hormones or their precursors are endocytosed from the primary urine, this led to secondary changes in calciotropic hormones and changes in phosphate excretion (9Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). ClC-5 probably provides an electric shunt for the acidification of endosomes (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, preliminary experiments revealed that renal endosomes isolated from ClC-5 knockout mice were acidified at slower rates (9Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). When ClC-5 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (10Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it induced strongly rectifying chloride currents that were detectable only at voltages more positive than +20 mV. Point mutations that changed the voltage dependence, ion selectivity, and rectification demonstrated that ClC-5 directly mediates plasma membrane chloride currents (10Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with the immunocytochemistry of transfected cells (7Günther W.

A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), a small fraction of ClC-5 also resides in the plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of ClC-5 contains between its two conserved CBS 1The abbreviations used are:CBScystathionine-β synthaseENaCamiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channelHECThomologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminusHAhemagglutininWTwild typeBSAbovine serum albuminBFAbrefeldin AI-Vcurrent-voltage domains (12Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) a proline-rich stretch of amino acids (PPLPPY). A similar sequence is not found in the otherwise highly related ClC-3 and ClC-4 channels. This sequence bears resemblance to the PY motif that was recognized in the human epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) (13Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Each of the three different subunits (α, β, and γ) of this heteromeric channel contains a carboxyl-terminal motif with the consensus sequence PPXY. The motifs on the β- and γ-subunits can interact with Nedd4, a ubiquitin-protein ligase, by binding to WW domains of the latter protein (14Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). This interaction leads to the ubiquitination of ENaC (15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and to its internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and to its degradation. This process is physiologically important, because the distal tubular Na+ reabsorption mediated by ENaC needs to be tightly regulated. Mutations that truncate or disrupt the PY motif in the carboxyl termini of β or γ ENaC subunits lead to increased channel activity primarily due to a markedly prolonged surface retention time. This explains the gain of sodium channel activity observed in Liddle's syndrome, a rare and very severe form of human inherited hypertension (15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K.

Mutational analysis revealed that the tyrosine residue of the PY motif is critical for the recognition and endocytotic retrieval of ENaC from the plasma membrane (16Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). cystathionine-β synthase amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus hemagglutinin wild type bovine serum albumin brefeldin A current-voltage A peptide corresponding to the PY motif of ClC-5 was shown to bind to several WW domains within the proteins WWP1, WWP2, and WWP3 (18Pirozzi G.

WW domains are conserved protein motifs comprising ∼35 amino acids. They are characterized by two highly conserved tryptophan residues, a central core of aromatic and hydrophobic residues, and a proline located three residues downstream from the second tryptophan (19Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). WWP2 (and probably the other, partially characterized proteins as well) belongs to the same protein class as Nedd4 (20Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with which it shares several domains: a C2 (Ca2+/lipid binding) domain, multiple (three or four) WW domains, and a carboxyl-terminal ubiquitin-protein ligase (HECT) domain. Given the pivotal role of ClC-5 in renal endocytosis (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), it is of great interest to identify signals that are involved in ClC-5 trafficking. We therefore investigated whether the PY motif on ClC-5 plays a role in endocytosis of the channel protein. Indeed, disrupting this motif by site-directed mutagenesis led to increased surface retention and to higher currents. Coexpression with mutants of rab5 and WWP2 indicate that the PY motif is in fact important for endocytosis, a process probably depending on interactions with proteins of the Nedd4 family. Thus, we have identified a motif that is important for the endocytosis of ClC-5, which itself plays an important role in endocytotic processes (9Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were cloned into pTLN (21Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), a vector containing Xenopus globin untranslated sequences and which is optimized for protein expression inXenopus oocytes. This cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pFrog3 derived from pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) by flanking the multiple cloning site with the 5′ and 3′ untranslated region from the Xenopus globin gene (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). rab5 constructs were amino-terminally tagged with the Myc epitope (MEQKLISEEDLQS) (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by recombinant polymerase chain reaction. All polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments were entirely sequenced. Capped cRNA was transcribed from constructs linearized by MluI using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) and SP6 polymerase (for constructs in pTLN) or T7 polymerase (pFrog3 constructs). A total amount of 10 ng of cRNA was injected into defolliculated oocytes,i.e. 5 ng of cRNA each in coexpression studies. Oocytes were kept at 17 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KCl, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml tetracyclin, 20 μg/ml gentamycin, pH 7.6). Standard two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed at room temperature 2–3 days after injection using Turbotec 05 or 10C amplifiers (NPI Instruments, Tamm, Germany) and pClamp 5.5 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data are given as means ± S.E. Currents were recorded in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Surface expression of the ClC-5 protein was determined by the method of Zerangue et al. (22Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). An HA epitope was inserted by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis into the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains D1 and D2 of wild type (WT) ClC-5 and mutants. After 3 days at 17 °C, oocytes were placed for 30 min in ND96 with 1% BSA at 4 °C to block unspecific binding, incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, in 1% BSA/ND96), washed at 4 °C, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat Fab fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch, in 1% BSA for 30–60 min at 4 °C). Oocytes were washed thoroughly (1% BSA, 4 °C, 60 min) and transferred to frog Ringer solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 50 μl of Power Signal Elisa solution (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). The oocytes used to measure the surface expression of channel subunits were subsequently pooled and stored at −20 °C. After homogenization of the pooled oocytes in an ice-cold solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a protease inhibitor mix (Complete®, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), yolk platelets were removed by three low speed centrifugation steps (500 × g, 2 min). The resulting supernatant was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, and the protein equivalent to one oocyte was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide). After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 5% milk powder and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Primary (rat anti-HA monoclonal 3F10; 200 ng/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and secondary (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG; 1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline blocking solution. Washes were in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Reacting proteins were detected by using the Renaissance reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and photographic films (Kodak). A human multiple tissue Northern blot of polyadenylated RNA (2 μg/tissue; CLONTECH) was hybridized under high stringency conditions with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe encompassing the entire open reading frame of human WWP2 using standard conditions. Autoradiography used a phosphoimager (Fuji Bas-1500) or photographic films. The carboxyl terminus of ClC-5 carries a proline-rich stretch of amino acids that shows similarity to a PY motif and that is not present in the highly related ClC-3 and ClC-4 proteins (Fig.1A). We mutated several prolines and the tyrosine residue within the motif (Fig. 1B) and measured the effect of these mutations on currents in theXenopus oocyte expression system. There was no change in their macroscopic biophysical properties, like rectification (Fig.1C) or ion selectivity (data not shown). However, these mutations consistently yielded approximately 2-fold higher currents (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether mutations in the PY motif enhance currents by increasing the surface expression of the channel protein, we inserted an HA epitope into the extracellular loop between D1-D2 of WT and the two ClC-5 mutants. The tagged constructs yielded currents that were indistinguishable from wild type (data not shown). The amount of HA epitopes at the cell surface was quantified by incubating nonpermeabilized oocytes with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, followed by an enzymatic amplification procedure that uses chemiluminescence as the final step (22Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2A, the surface expression correlated well with the current amplitudes measured inXenopus oocytes. To rule out effects on translation efficiency or overall protein stability, the total amount of ClC-5 was determined by Western blotting extracts of the same oocytes used for the surface expression assay. The ClC-5(AAE_A) mutant is expressed to the same overall amount in oocytes as WT ClC-5 (Fig. 2B). The effect of the ClC-5(AAE_A) mutants could be due to the replacement of tyrosine by the negatively charged glutamate. This might mimic a tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore compared currents of the ClC-5(Y672E) mutant with those of ClC-5(Y672A) but could not detect any differences (data not shown), making this explanation unlikely. We next investigated the influence of the PY motif on the surface retention time of ClC-5 under conditions in which the insertion of newly synthesized channels into the plasma membrane is inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA). BFA blocks the anterograde vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and causes a redistribution of Golgi cisternae to the endoplasmic reticulum (23Pelham H.R. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although BFA has multiple targets in vesicular transport, it does not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the plasma membrane (24Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is known that BFA is also efficient in Xenopus oocytes (16Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 25Mulner-Lorillon O. Belle R. Cormier P. Drewing S. Minella O. Poulhe R. Schmalzing G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of BFA plasma membrane currents reflect the half-lives of plasma membrane resident channels, without complications arising from newly synthesized proteins. However, BFA treatment does not exclude the possibility that endocytosed channels are recycled back to the surface. Oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding WT and AAE_A mutant ClC-5. When currents had reached steady-state levels after 3 days, BFA was added to oocytes, and currents were determined over a period of 22 h. Wild type currents decreased with a half-time of about 23 h. In contrast, the decay of currents from the AAE_A mutant was dramatically slowed (Fig. 3). Thus, mutating the PY motif in ClC-5 markedly increases its stability in the plasma membrane. ClC-5 was colocalized with markers of early endosomes (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Devuyst O. Christie P.T. Courtoy P.J. Beauwens R. Thakker R.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and was present in the large vesicles created by overexpressing the GTPase-deficient Q79L mutant of rab5 (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). rab5 is an important regulator of endocytosis. Overexpression in Xenopus oocytes of rab5 or its Q79L mutant increases fluid phase endocytosis, whereas the opposite is true for the dominant negative S34N mutant (26Mukhopadhyay A. Barbieri A.M. Funato K. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test whether global changes in endocytosis affect ClC-5 currents, we coexpressed WT and mutant ClC-5 with several rab5 constructs inXenopus oocytes. Currents were markedly decreased when WT ClC-5 was coexpressed with either WT or rab5(Q79L) (Fig.4A). Conversely, currents were increased upon expression of rab5(S34N), indicating that constitutively occurring endocytosis decreases the steady-state level of ClC-5 in the plasma membrane. Both effects depended on an intact PY motif, because there was no appreciable effect of any of these rab5 constructs on the ClC-5(AAE_A) mutant (Fig. 4B). We next investigated whether the surface expression and currents of ClC-5 can be modulated by coexpressing a Nedd4-related protein. We chose WWP2 because its fourth WW domain interacted strongly with a synthetic peptide encompassing the PY motif of ClC-5 (18Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Like Nedd4, WWP2 comprises an amino-terminal C2 domain, four WW domains, and a carboxyl-terminal HECT domain with a predicted ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Northern analysis revealed that WWP2 is expressed in all tissues examined (Fig. 5A). This includes kidney, suggesting that interaction with ClC-5 might occur under physiological conditions. Xenopus oocytes have endogenous Nedd4-like activities, sometimes obscuring effects of overexpressing Nedd4 (27Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Therefore several nonfunctional WWP2 constructs were generated that might antagonize the effect of oocyte homologs (Fig. 5B). In the first construct, the HECT domain was deleted by truncation (termed WWΔHECT). The next construct consisted only of WW domains 3 and 4 (termed WW3–4), and the third mutant carried a Cys to Ala point mutation in the HECT domain at a site that is necessary for ubiquitin binding (termed WWP2CA) (28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 29Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). When WT WWP2 was coexpressed with ClC-5, no effects on the current were observed. However, coexpression with any of the three nonfunctional WWP2 constructs led to an approximately 2-fold increase of currents (Fig. 5C). No such effect was found for the ClC-5(AAE_A) mutant (Fig. 5D). Thus, WWP2 mutants probably antagonize effects of an endogenous Nedd4-like protein that normally down-regulates ClC-5 currents. This interaction depends on an intact PY motif in ClC-5. Furthermore, these experiments strongly suggest that an intact HECT domain on the WW-containing protein is necessary for the down-regulation of ClC-5 plasma membrane expression. Additional experiments (data not shown) demonstrated that the increase in currents elicited by the WWP2 mutants correlated again with an increased surface expression of ClC-5. ClC-5 is the first chloride channel with a proven role in endocytosis. It is located predominantly in the membranes of vesicles of the (early) endocytotic pathway (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F.

At least upon heterologous expression, a fraction of ClC-5 also resides in the plasma membrane (7Günther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work, we have identified an internalization signal in the carboxyl terminus of ClC-5, which, most likely by interacting with ubiquitin-protein ligases, limits its stability in the plasma membrane. This motif and its function closely resembles the PY motif identified in the ENaC (13Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C.

This process is exquisitely regulated by aldosterone and requires a short half-life of the channel in the plasma membrane. All three different subunits (α, β, and γ) carry proline-rich PY motifs in their carboxyl termini. These motifs are important for the ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation of the channel. The physiological importance of these motifs is impressively illustrated by the fact that human mutations that either delete or mutate PY motifs in Liddle's syndrome (13Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I.

This is a consequence of enhanced renal sodium reabsorption resulting from an increased surface expression of ENaC. However, an increase in open probability was also reported (31Firsov D. Schild L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The finding that ClC-5 carries a signal resembling the ENaC PY motif in its carboxyl terminus prompted us to investigate whether it performs a similar role in this largely endosomal chloride channel. Indeed, similar to the findings with ENaC, currents of ClC-5 were increased when the PY motif was mutated. This roughly 2-fold increase in currents correlated with an increased protein level in the plasma membrane, whereas the overall amount of the channel protein was unaffected. This strongly suggested that changes in trafficking, probably in the endocytotic removal from the plasma membrane, underlie the current increase. Indeed, in experiments in which the plasma membrane insertion of newly synthesized channels was prevented by brefeldin A, the apparent half-time of ClC-5 plasma membrane residence was drastically increased by mutations in the PY motif. The half-time of WT ClC-5 in the plasma membrane (20–24 h) was much longer than the 1–3.5 h described for ENaC (15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 16Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, ENaC may be a special case because it needs to be tightly and rapidly regulated in response to changes in salt and fluid balance. Because brefeldin A does not prevent the recycling of endocytosed ClC-5 back into the plasma membrane, the increased half-life of the PY motif mutant at the surface could also be interpreted in terms of an altered trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes. In this model, the mutants would undergo endocytosis at a rate comparable with WT, but the lack of ubiquitin conjugation allows them to evade targeting to the lysosomes. Channels lacking a functional PY motif could then be recycled back to the plasma membrane. The notion that the PY motif in ClC-5 plays a role in endocytosis is strongly supported by experiments investigating the effects of rab5. Stimulating endocytosis by coexpressed WT or rab5(Q79L) or inhibiting endocytosis by rab5(S34N) decreased or increased ClC-5 currents, respectively. Importantly, this effect was virtually abolished when the PY motif on ClC-5 was inactivated. This suggests that rab5-dependent endocytosis of ClC-5 does not occur via an unspecific retrieval of membranes containing ClC-5 but depends on specific interactions with the PY motif. Using a homology screen, Pirozzi et al. (18Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) have previously isolated several cDNAs encoding proteins with multiple WW domains. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing these domains were tested in vitro for binding to synthetic peptides containing PY-like motifs from several proteins, including ClC-5. The strongest binding to the ClC-5 peptide occurred with the fourth WW domain of a protein dubbed WWP2. WW domains of the other two WWP proteins also displayed some binding. In contrast, at least the first WW domain of rat Nedd4 was unable to bind to a synthetic peptide encompassing the PY motif of ClC-5 (32Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), showing the specificity of the interaction between WW domains and PY motifs. We have shown here that the most strongly interacting protein, i.e. WWP2, is coexpressed with ClC-5 in kidney. Therefore we chose this protein for our studies. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that ClC-5 shows physiologically more important interactions with other proteins containing WW domains. Similar to Nedd4, WWP2 has an amino-terminal C2 domain that is thought to mediate Ca-dependent lipid binding, four WW domains, and an amino-terminal HECT domain that is predicted to function in ubiquitin conjugation. Coexpressing the WT form of WWP2 with ClC-5 in Xenopusoocytes had no discernible effects on chloride currents. This may be due to the fact that Xenopus oocytes express a Nedd4 homolog (33Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. DNA Seq. 1998; 9: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and that its activity on ClC-5 is already near maximal. This contrasts with the recent observation (27Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) that overexpressing Nedd4 reduced ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes. The reason for this difference is currently unclear and may reflecte.g. different binding affinities. On the other hand, the stimulation of ClC-5 currents and surface expression by bona fide inactive WWP2 mutants strongly suggest that WW domain proteins interact with the PY motif of ClC-5 and that the mutants act by competing with endogenous Xenopus oocyte homologs. Mutants lacking an HECT domain or carrying a point mutation that interferes with ubiquitin binding (28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 29Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) increased currents in the presence of an intact PY motif on ClC-5. This strongly suggests that ubiquitination plays a role in the PY motif-dependent endocytosis of ClC-5. Similar experiments also suggested that ENaC is ubiquitinated by Nedd4 (14Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and this could also be shown directly (15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Despite many attempts, however, we were unable to show that ClC-5 is ubiquitinated. Ubiquitinated ClC-5 may be short-lived and may therefore have escaped detection, a problem compounded by the fact that many proteins targeted for endocytosis carry only a single ubiquitin moiety (34Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, ubiquitination may occur on a third protein that might be associated with ClC-5. The unexpected voltage dependence of its currents has previously led to speculations that there may be an additional, as yet unknown, subunit that modifies its voltage dependence (10Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 11Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that a PY motif in the carboxyl terminus of ClC-5 modulates its retention in the plasma membrane. Similar to Nedd4-mediated endocytosis of ENaC, this very likely involves the interaction with the WW domain of a ubiquitin-protein ligase. Because ClC-5 is mainly present in endosomal compartments where it is essential for endocytotic trafficking, its partial presence in the plasma membrane may be a side effect of recycling. It will be important to determine whether the interaction of its PY motif with WW domain-containing proteins is important for its cellular function, namely its crucial role in both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis (9Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and whether this interaction determines sorting processes further downstream in the endosomal pathway as well. We thank Willy Günther for constructing the ClC-5(AAE_A) mutant."

Although previous studies have shown that the activated EGFR can induce NF-κB, the mechanism of this activation remains unknown. In this study, we identify components of the signalosome formed by the activated EGFR required to activate NF-κB and show that, although the activated EGFR uses mechanisms similar to the TNFR, it recruits a distinct signalosome.

Our studies also suggest that a high level of EGFR expression, a frequent occurrence in human tumors, is optimal for epidermal growth factor-induced NF-κB activation.

FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein The engagement of the epidermal growth factor receptor by its cognate ligand results in the generation of a number of intracellular signals (1Carpenter G. Cohen S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 193-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial changes induced by ligand binding are receptor dimerization, activation of the kinase activity of the receptor, and autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues (2Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 3van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the receptor results in the creation of docking sites for a number of secondary signaling proteins bearing specific protein interaction domains such as the Src homology 2 domain, which interact specifically with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this interaction, these secondary signaling proteins may themselves become activated and trigger a number of downstream signals. These signaling cascades result in the activation of a number of transcription factors such as AP-1 and STATS (5Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The NF-κB1 family of transcription factors plays an important role in inflammatory responses (6Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar). A diverse number of stimuli including cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1, UV irradiation, and lipopolysaccharide are known to activate NF-κB. In unstimulated cells NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the IκB family of proteins (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). Binding of IκB to NF-κB masks nuclear localization signals on NF-κB and prevents its translocation to the nucleus (8Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with a diverse array of stimuli results in phosphorylation of IκBα on both serines 32 and 36. This results in the ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (9DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A.

Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of how the TNF receptor activates NF-κB. The 55-kDa TNFR1 is thought to be the more important receptor type in the activation of NF-κB. Binding of TNF to the TNFR1 results in trimerization of the receptor and the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as TRADD to the receptor (13Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). TRADD in turn recruits receptor interacting protein (RIP) and TRAF2 to the receptor (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 15Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). TRAF2 binds to the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (16Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). This results in the activation of NIK, although the mechanism of this activation remains unclear. NIK phosphorylates and activates the IKKs (17Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which appear to exist in a large multiprotein complex termed the signalosome (18Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A.

The IKKs in turn phosphorylate IκBα on serines 32 and 36. NIK appears to selectively target IKKα (20Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 21Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), whereas MEKK1 and atypical protein kinase Cs may activate both IKKα and IKKβ (19Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Protein kinase B/Akt also appears to be involved in NF-κB activation induced by PDGF and TNFα. Activation of Akt requires the phosphorylation of Akt on residues Ser-473 and Thr-308 (23Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by both TNFα and PDGF. Recent studies have indicated NF-κB activation induced by these cytokines is inhibited by both wortmannin (a PI 3-kinase inhibitor) and by a kinase inactive Akt mutant, while expression of a constitutively activated myristylated Akt mutant was sufficient for NF-κB activation (24Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 25Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Akt has been shown to enhance the degradation of IκBs (26Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated Akt can associate with the IKK complex and may activate IKKα by phosphorylating it at Thr-23 (24Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 25Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor receptor has also been shown to activate NF-κB. EGF has been shown to activate NF-κB in smooth muscle cells, in A431 cells, in fibroblasts, and in several estrogen receptor-negative EGF-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (27Obata H. Biro S. Arima N. Kaieda H. Kihara T. Eto H. Miyata M. Tanaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Sun L. Carpenter G.

A. 2000; 97: 8542-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that EGF stimulation of A431 cells leads to degradation of IκBα (28Sun L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This study also showed that wild type IκBα transfected into COS cells undergoes degradation upon treatment with EGF, whereas an IκBα S32/36 mutant fails to undergo degradation, suggesting that activation of the EGFR leads to phosphorylation of IκBα on serines 32 and 36 and subsequent activation of NF-κB in a manner similar to the TNF receptor. A requirement for intracellular free calcium was also noted in this study. However, the proximal signals generated by the EGFR that lead to the activation of NF-κB remain unknown. In this study we present evidence showing that the EGFR activates NF-κB by mechanisms similar to but not identical with the TNF receptor. We identify components of the signalosome involved in EGFR-induced NF-κB activation and suggest a mechanism of NF-κB activation at the level of protein-protein interaction. We show that the EGFR-induced NF-κB activation involves some of the proteins previously identified as key proximal elements in the TNFR pathway of NF-κB activation, but unlike for the TNFR we find that the protein kinase Akt is not involved in EGFR-mediated activation of NF-κB in the cell types we have studied.

The beads were subsequently washed and solubilized in SDS sample buffer and then boiled and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blots were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In experiments where cell lysates were examined directly, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (32Murphy S. Lin H.L. Park S.K. Glia. 1995; 15: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).

At the end of the incubation, 10× DNA loading buffer was added and the sample was electrophoresed in a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel at a constant voltage (10 V/cm). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens overnight at −80 °C. 1 × 105 R1hER cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method.

Cell Res. 1994; 214: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB in the various cell types may be a consequence of high level of EGF receptor expression. To determine whether the level of EGF receptor expression influences the activation of NF-κB, we used Rat-1 fibroblasts and compared them to R1hER cells, which are Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing a high level of the EGFR. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that EGF stimulation failed to activate NF-κB in Rat-1 cells (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, exposure of R1hER cells to EGF resulted in a robust activation of NF-κB (Fig. 1 A,lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, in R1hER cells we also detected constitutive activation of NF-κB compared with untransfected Rat-1 cells. R1hER cells express about 7.5 × 105 EGF receptors, which is a nearly 7-fold increase over untransfected cells (34Wasilenko W.J. Payne D.M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is constitutive phosphorylation of the EGFR in R1hER cells, suggesting that the receptor is active in these cells even in the absence of ligand. Interestingly, the increase in the level of EGF receptor expression leads to a selective rather than a general amplification of intracellular signaling pathways. For example, ERK activation in response to EGF (100 ng/ml) was not increased in R1hER cells compared with Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 D). This observation also holds true at lower EGF concentrations (ranging from 0.1 to 1 ng/ml), which result in submaximal levels of ERK activation in both cell lines (data not shown). We did not detect an increase in ERK activation in R1hER cells compared with Rat-1 cells at any EGF concentration tested. To determine whether the relationship between EGFR levels and NF-κB activation was a consistent finding between cell types, we studied EGF-mediated NF-κB activation in two breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of the EGFR. The MDA-MB-468 cell lines expresses a high level of EGF receptors (1–3 × 106), while the MCF7 cell line expresses a lower level of EGFR, about 2.4 × 103 (35Davidson N.E. Gelmann E.P. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). EGF stimulation failed to induce a significant activation of NF-κB in MCF7 cells, whereas a robust activation of NF-κB was observed in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.1 B). On the other hand, activation of ERKs in response to EGF was similar in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells (data not shown). Thus, our data suggest that, in the cell types used, a high level of EGFR expression is optimal for the activation of NF-κB. The NF-κB family is composed of several subunits including, p50, p65, c-Rel, and Rel B. Supershift experiments were performed on MDA-MB-468 cells to identify which NF-κB subunits were induced by EGF. In agreement with previous studies (28Sun L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we found that NF-κB in MDA-MB-468 cells stimulated with EGF consists of p65 and p50 (Fig.1 C). NF-κB is regulated by its interaction with a group of cytoplasmic inhibitory proteins termed IκB. The major species of this family of proteins is designated IκBα. Phosphorylation of IκBα on serines 32 and 36 targets it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This releases NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. It has been shown previously that EGF stimulation of cells results in the degradation of IκBα. To test whether an IκBα mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser-32/36 would block EGFR-induced NF-κB activation, we stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells with this mutant in a plasmid expression vector. Mass populations of zeocin-resistant cells were pooled and tested for expression of the HA-tagged IκBα mutant by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 A). Having established that these cells expressed the transfected mutant, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed and compared with MDA-MB-468 cells expressing the empty vector. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, expression of a dominant negative IκBα mutant blocks EGFR-induced NF-κB activation, demonstrating that the EGFR utilizes elements of the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. The activation of NF-κB by TNF is mediated by a specific signalosome composed of distinct proteins. TRADD is an adaptor protein, which associates with the TNFR when the receptor is activated (13Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). It has a domain of about 80 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus, which is termed the death domain. The death domain of TRADD binds to a similar death domain on the TNFR. TRADD then recruits RIP and also TRAF2 to the TNFR (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 15Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). RIP may also bind directly to the TNFR, but this has been reported to be a weak interaction. To identify the proteins constituting the receptor tyrosine kinase signalosome at the EGF receptor, we transfected EGFR cDNA in a plasmid expression vector along with Myc-tagged TRADD into 293 EBNA cells to determine whether the two proteins would associate into a physical complex. Cells transfected with the two plasmids were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an EGFR antibody followed by immunoblotting with a Myc antibody. We failed to detect Myc-TRADD in EGFR immunoprecipitates in repeated experiments (Fig. 3 A). We also failed to detect an interaction between the EGFR and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), another protein that interacts with the TNFR and Fas receptors and is involved in apoptosis (data not shown). However, when we cotransfected the EGFR with Myc-tagged RIP, which is a key protein in TNFR-induced NF-κB activation, we detected a physical association between the two proteins. This interaction was detected by immunoprecipitating with an EGFR antibody and immunoblotting with Myc antibodies (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). We estimate that 5–10% of the transfected RIP becomes associated with the EGFR in these cells as shown in Fig. 3 C. The association can also be detected by immunoprecipitating with a Myc antibody and immunoblotting with the EGFR antibody (Fig. 3 D). The kinase activity of the EGFR is required for association with RIP since a kinase-inactive EGFR mutant fails to bind RIP (Fig. 3 D). Also, addition of tyrphostin AG 1478, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR kinase, blocks the association between wild type EGFR and RIP (Fig. 3 D). 293 EBNA cells express very low levels of endogenous EGFR, and we did not detect EGF-induced ERK activation in these cells (data not shown). We found that the endogenous level of EGFR expression in 293 EBNA cells is not sufficient to mediate a detectable association with RIP. However, when we transfected increasing amounts of EGFR DNA into these cells along with a constant amount of RIP, an interaction between the two proteins can be detected with increasing levels of EGFR expression (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that RIP may play a role in EGF-mediated NF-kB activation since RIP is known to be a key component of TNFR-NF-κB signaling, and also correlates with our observation that in certain cell types a high level of EGFR expression is required to activate NF-κB. It should be noted that addition of EGF to cells did not increase the EGFR-RIP interaction in these cells. This is because ectopic expression of the EGFR leads to a substantial constitutive increase in the level of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in 293 EBNA cells as shown in Fig. 3 F, where addition of EGF did not result in any further increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR. This suggests maximal activation of the receptor in these cells even in the absence of ligand. This phenomenon has also been noted previously in 293T cells (36Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A physical association between the EGFR and endogenous RIP in untransfected MDA-MB-468 cells can also be detected. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a EGFR antibody and immunoblotted with a RIP antibody. As can be seen in Fig.4 A, RIP coimmunoprecipitates with the EGFR in these cells. It should be noted that MDA-MB-468 cells express high levels of the EGFR and that there is considerable basal activation of the receptor in these cells even in the absence of exogenous EGF. This is shown in Fig. 4 B, which demonstrates a significant autophosphorylation of the receptor in the absence of EGF. Although we do not see an increase in EGFR-RIP association when these cells are exposed to EGF (data not shown), consistent with our earlier observation in 293 cells, treating the cells with tyrphostin AG 1478 reverses the association between the two proteins (Fig.4 A). Taken together, this indicates that the protein complex responsible for signaling by the two receptors, namely, TNFR and the EGFR, are distinct. We next addressed the issue of whether NIK coimmunoprecipitates with the EGFR in vivo since NIK appears to be downstream of RIP in the TNFR NF-κB pathway and a dominant negative NIK mutant blocks RIP-induced NF-κB activation (16Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). 293 EBNA cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged NIK cDNA along with the EGFR. Concurrent with our observation with RIP, NIK associated with the EGFR with increasing levels of EGFR expression (Fig. 5 A). This interaction was detected by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with an EGFR antibody and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5 A,middle panel), and also by immunoprecipitating with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotting with an EGFR antibody (Fig.5 B). The relationship between increasing level of EGFR expression and association with NF-κB-inducing protein seems to be more linear with Nik than with RIP. Similar to RIP, addition of EGF did not increase the EGFR-NIK association in these cells. In the absence of exogenous EGFR, we did not detect coprecipitation of the two proteins suggesting that the endogenous level of EGFR expression is too low in 293 EBNA cells to allow a significant interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 5, A and B). It is increasingly apparent that signal transduction involves the physical assembly of individual components of a pathway into multiprotein complexes. In the case of NF-κB, a number of proteins such as NIK, IKKs, and IκBα exist in a complex termed the signalosome. To investigate the formation of complex formation between the EGFR, RIP, and NIK, we cotransfected Myc-tagged RIP, Flag-tagged NIK, and the EGFR along with appropriate controls into 293 EBNA cells. The data shown in Fig. 6 suggest that multiprotein complexes may form among the three proteins. This was demonstrated by immunoprecipitating with an EGFR antibody and immunoblotting with a Myc antibody to detect the presence of RIP (Fig. 6 A). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG antibodies to detect the presence of NIK (Fig. 6 C). Similarly, in another independent experiment, anti-FLAG antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the complex which was analyzed by immunoblotting with an EGFR antibody (Fig. 6 B). This blot was later stripped and reprobed with a Myc antibody (Fig. 6 D) to identify the presence of RIP. Thus, we detect both Rip and Nik in EGFR immunoprecipitates and also find both E"

To test the hypothesis that inhibition of phospholamban activity may rescue some of these phenotypic alterations, the calsequestrin overexpressing mice were cross-bred with phospholamban-knockout mice. Phospholamban ablation in calsequestrin overexpressing mice led to reversal of the depressed cardiac contractile parameters in Langendorff-perfused hearts or in vivo. This was associated with increases of SR Ca2+ storage, assessed by caffeine-induced Na+-Ca2+ exchanger currents. The inactivation time of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa), which has an inverse correlation with Ca2+-induced SR Ca2+ release, and the relation between the peak current density and half-inactivation time were also normalized, indicating a restoration in the ability ofICa to trigger SR Ca2+ release. The prolonged action potentials in calsequestrin overexpressing cardiomyocytes also reversed to normal upon phospholamban ablation. Furthermore, ablation of phospholamban restored the expression levels of atrial natriuretic factor and α-skeletal actin mRNA as well as ventricular myocyte size.

Lancet. 2000; 355: 58-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The increase in heart mass has been implicated to normalize cardiac function by decreasing wall stress. However, a sustained imbalance between workload and muscle contractility may lead to progressive thinning of the left ventricular wall and chamber dilation associated with decompensated hypertrophy and heart failure (2Levy D.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), it is not clear yet whether the abnormal SR Ca2+ handling per se contributes to the generation, maintenance, and characteristics of cardiac hypertrophyin vivo. Furthermore, it is unknown whether reversal of the SR Ca2+ handling defects can mediate functional benefits in myocardial hypertrophy. The SR plays a key role in the regulation of Ca2+homeostasis and contractility in cardiac muscle. During relaxation, Ca2+ is transported from the cytosol into the lumen of the SR by a Ca2+-ATPase. Subsequently, in response to Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, the Ca2+ loaded in the SR is released through the ryanodine receptors for the initiation of muscle contraction. The activity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase is regulated by phospholamban, a 52-amino acid phosphoprotein (13Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Decreases in the levels of phospholamban or increases in its phosphorylation status result in an increase in the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase, and augment cardiac contractile parameters. The mechanisms underlying these regulatory effects of phospholamban have been suggested to reflect facilitation of SR Ca2+ transport, Ca2+loading, and Ca2+ release (13Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ.

The SR Ca2+ load and subsequent Ca2+ release are regulated by calsequestrin, a luminal SR protein, with high capacity and low affinity for Ca2+ (20Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin has been reported to form a stable complex with the ryanodine receptor, junctin, and triadin (21Zhang L. Kelley J.

Recent transgenic approaches have shown that increased expression of calsequestrin in the heart was associated with increased SR Ca2+ storage capacity, but this SR Ca2+ was not available for release during excitation-contraction coupling, leading to depressed Ca2+transients and contractile parameters (22Jones L.R.

Trafford A.W. Diaz M.E. Overend C.L. O'Neill S.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Whole cell L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa) were recorded by applying depolarization pulses every 10 s from a holding potential of −50 mV (26Sako H. Green S.A. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1666-C1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mitarai S. Reed T.D. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H139-H148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain relations between peak current density and inactivation kinetics, ICa was measured in a series of external Ca2+ concentrations (1.0–20 mm). Action potentials were recorded, as previously described (27Mitarai S. Reed T.D. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H139-H148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and quantitative immunoblotting of cardiac ventricular homogenates were performed as described previously (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Dot-blot analysis of total RNA from cardiac ventricles was performed as described previously (25D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons across groups were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the p value was less than 0.05, Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) procedure was employed to discriminate which means differed from the others. To determine whether enhanced SR Ca2+transport activity may modify the time course of cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy, we generated transgenic mice, which overexpress calsequestrin and are deficient in phospholamban. To achieve this, CSQOE mice, which exhibit depressed function and hypertrophy (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), were mated with phospholamban knockout mice, which demonstrated enhanced SR Ca2+ transport and hyperdynamic function (15Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). F2 littermates with WT, CSQOE, and CSQOE/PLBKO genotypes were characterized in parallel to eliminate any potential effects of the genetic background. There were no phenotypic alterations at the gross morphological level between the three models up to 7 months of age. Furthermore, ablation of phospholamban did not alter the levels of calsequestrin overexpression (Fig. 1 A), which was increased by 18 ± 4 (n = 8) in CSQOE and 19 ± 4-fold (n = 8) in CSQOE/PLBKO ventricles, compared with WT littermates. Phospholamban was undetectable in CSQOE/PLBKO, whereas it was increased by 37% in CSQOE, compared with WTs, consistent with previous findings (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of phospholamban ablation on the subcellular localization of overexpressed calsequestrin, immunostaining and confocal microscopy were performed. Cryostat sections from both CSQOE and CSQOE/PLBKO transgenic hearts exhibited similar striated staining patterns as WTs (Fig. 1 B). The increased staining in CSQOE and CSQOE/PLBKOtissue was consistent with the immunoblotting data. Further examination of sections from the CSQOE and CSQOE/PLBKO littermates revealed that the staining patterns of transverse striations were predominant. No obvious morphological deterioration, such as abnormal striations, fibrosis, and necrosis, was observed in these sections. An important question is whether the depressed cardiac contractile parameters associated with calsequestrin overexpression may be restored in CSQOE/PLBKO mice. Thus, cardiac catheterization was performed in 2-month-old intact anesthetized animals and their hemodynamic function was evaluated. The intrinsic heart rate was not different between groups. However, the maximal rates of left ventricular pressure development (+dP/dt) and decline (−dP/dt), which were significantly attenuated in the CSQOE mice (6,677 ± 199 and 6,244 ± 546 mm Hg/s, respectively), exhibited values that were similar between CSQOE/PLBKO(10,807 ± 906 and 10,552 ± 942 mm Hg/s, respectively) and WT mice (10,333 ± 1,054 and 12,483 ± 1,363 mm Hg/s, respectively), indicating restoration of cardiac function in vivo. These studies were extended to the organ level, and isolated mouse hearts from 2-month-old littermates were perfused in parallel, using the Langendorff mode (Fig. 2). Hearts from CSQOE mice exhibited depressed +dP/dt values, similar to previous observations in the CSQOE mouse of the FVB/N genetic background (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the rates of left ventricular relaxation, which were attenuated in the original model (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), did not reveal any statistical differences from their WT littermates (FVB/N + 129SvJ/CF-1). This apparent discrepancy may be due to the differences in the genetic background (FVB/N versus FVB/N+129SvJ/CF-1), which is known to play a major role in determining the cardiac phenotype of mice (30Alonso S. Garner I. Vandekerckhove J. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Hewett T.E. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the contractile parameters in CSQOE hearts did not deteriorate upon aging to 7 months, in contrast to the progressive deterioration of cardiac function and morbidity of a transgenic mouse model with 10-fold overexpression of dog cardiac calsequestrin (24Cho M.C. Rapacciuolo A. Koch W.J. Kobayashi Y. Jones L.R. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22251-22256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Knollmann B.C. Knollmann-Ritschel B.E. Weissman N.J. Jones L.R. Morad M. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 483-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Upon ablation of phospholamban, both +dP/dt and −dP/dt values of calsequestrin overexpressing hearts were significantly increased to levels even higher than those in the WT littermates. Similar effects were observed in older (7 month) mice, suggesting the functional benefit of phospholamban ablation over the long term. Furthermore, there was no difference in the intrinsic heart rate across the three groups with different ages. Another important question is whether β-adrenergic agonists can stimulate the contractile parameters of the CSQOE/PLBKO hearts, as phospholamban is postulated to be a major player in β-adrenergic responses (13Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Kiriazis H. Kranias E.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 321-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effects of isoproterenol stimulation in Langendorff-perfused hearts (Fig. 2 B). The positive chronotropic effects of isoproterenol were similar among WT, CSQOE, and CSQOE/PLBKO groups. β-Agonist stimulation also increased the +dP/dt and −dP/dt values in all three groups, including the hyperdynamic CSQOE/PLBKO (33Pan B.S. Hannon J.D. Wiedmann R. Potter J.D. Kranias E.G. Shen Y.T. Johnson Jr., R.G. Housmans P.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 159-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, administration of isoproterenol (30–300 nm) was associated with induction of pulsus alternans in CSQOE hearts, presumably due to the positive chronotropic effect (34Schmidt A.G. Kadambi V.J. Ball N. Sato Y. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Hoit B.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1735-1744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CSQOE/PLBKO littermates did not display such mechanical abnormalities, and the maximally stimulated ±dP/dt parameters as well as their EC50 values for isoproterenol stimulation were similar between WT and CSQOE/PLBKO. Stable Ca2+ tolerant cardiomyocytes could be achieved with voltage clamping and manipulating the intracellular ionic environment (17Masaki H. Sato Y. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H606-H612PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sako H. Green S.A. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1666-C1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mitarai S. Reed T.D. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H139-H148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since caffeine-induced SR Ca2+ release fully saturates the fluorescent dye signal in calsequestrin overexpressing myocytes (35Wang W. Cleemann L. Jones L.R. Morad M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 399-414Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the INCX current was used to estimate the SR Ca2+ content. When INCX was measured in the absence of caffeine by replacing external Na+ with Li+, the average values of outwardINCX current densities were 0.99 ± 0.06 pA/pF (n = 31), 0.90 ± 0.06 pA/pF (n = 32), 0.91 ± 0.06 pA/pF (n = 13), in WT, CSQOE, and CSQOE/PLBKO, respectively. This suggests that the functional activity of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger was not significantly altered in CSQOE or CSQOE/PLBKO, compared with WT myocytes. In subsequent studies, caffeine (5 mm) was added to the external solution in the presence of Na+ to examine whether phospholamban ablation increased the SR Ca2+ content in myocytes overexpressing calsequestrin. Rapid application of caffeine elicited inwardINCX currents by sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange (Fig.3 A). The peak current density of caffeine-induced INCX currents was increased in CSQOE myocytes, indicating high SR Ca2+storage, as previously described (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phospholamban ablation resulted in further increases in the SR Ca2+ storage, as evidenced by the higher caffeine-induced INCX current density of CSQOE/PLBKO, compared with the CSQOE myocytes (Fig. 3 B). To gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying the rescue effects of phospholamban ablation, whole cellICa measurements were performed in the three models (Fig. 4 A). The current-voltage relations of CSQOE and CSQOE/PLBKO were similar to WT (data not shown). However, the current density of peak L-type Ca2+current (ICa) at 2 mm external Ca2+ concentration was significantly reduced in CSQOE myocytes, consistent with previous observations in the FVB/N genetic background (23Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phospholamban ablation resulted in significant increases in the current density of peakICa, although these values were lower than WT (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the inactivation kinetics ofICa, which was significantly slower in CSQOE myocytes, was restored upon phospholamban ablation (Fig. 4 B). We have previously shown that ICa inactivation in mouse myocytes correlates with the local increase in Ca2+ released from the SR, which promotes Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Thus, the inactivation kinetics of ICa can be used to evaluate the efficiency of ICa-induced SR Ca2+ release (17Masaki H. Sato Y. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H606-H612PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sako H. Green S.A. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1666-C1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional coupling of L-type Ca2+ channels and the SR Ca2+release, the correlations between densities and inactivation time courses of ICa were examined by varying the external Ca2+ concentration (1–20 mm). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the relation between the peak current density and the half-inactivation time was shifted upward in CSQOE, reflecting an inability ofICa to trigger SR Ca2+ release. In contrast, CSQOE/PLBKO and WT myocytes exhibited similar relations between the maximal ICadensity and the half-inactivation time, suggesting that phospholamban ablation restored the ability of ICa to trigger SR Ca2+ release. To examine the stimulatory effects of β-adrenergic agonists onICa, 5 mm EGTA in the pipette solution was replaced with 10 mm BAPTA, a more rapid Ca2+ chelator. This replacement negates the enhancedICa inactivation induced by SR Ca2+release (17Masaki H. Sato Y. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H606-H612PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sako H. Green S.A. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1666-C1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mitarai S. Reed T.D. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H139-H148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peak ICa densities in WT, CSQOE, and CSQOE/PLBKO myocytes were 12.5 ± 0.5 pA/pF (n = 51), 6.0 ± 0.3 pA/pF (n = 38), and 11.6 ± 1.1 pA/pF (n = 43), respectively. Potentiation ofICa was then examined in the presence of various concentrations of isoproterenol, and in the absence or presence of isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX: 100 μm), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Fig.5 A). Perfusion with isoproterenol increased the current amplitude in all groups and the EC50 values of peak ICa were similar among them (Fig. 5 B). Although the relative increase of current amplitude was more prominent in CSQOE cells, theirICa density was significantly smaller in the presence of isoproterenol (1 μm), compared with WT or CSQOE/PLBKO cells. Additional application of IBMX enhanced isoproterenol-promoted ICa in all groups, although the current density in CSQOE myocytes remained smaller, compared with WT or CSQOE/PLBKO myocytes (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, overexpression of murine calsequestrin or subsequent ablation of phospholamban did not lead to low responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation and/or high phosphodiestera"
https://openalex.org/W1976426030,"We investigated the role of phase II (conjugation) and phase III (efflux) detoxification of the anticancer drugs melphalan (MLP) and chlorambucil (CHB). Although both drugs are substrates of Alpha-class glutathioneS-transferases (GST) and the monoglutathionyl conjugates formed in these enzymatic reactions are transported by MRP1, we found that GSTA1-1 and MRP1 acted in synergy to confer resistance to CHB but not to MLP (Morrow, C. S., Smitherman, P. K., Diah, S. K., Schneider, E., and Townsend, A. J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 20114–20120). To explain this selectivity of MRP1/GST-mediated resistance, we report results of side-by-side experiments comparing the kinetics of MLP- versusCHB-glutathione conjugate: formation, product inhibition of GSTA1-1 catalysis, and transport by MRP1. The monoglutathionyl conjugate of CHB, CHB-SG, is a very strong competitive inhibitor of GSTA1-1 (K i 0.14 μm) that is >30-fold more potent than that of the corresponding conjugate of MLP, MLP-SG (K i 4.7 μm). The efficiency of GSTA1-1-mediated monoglutathionyl conjugate formation is more than 4-fold higher for CHB than MLP. Lastly, both CHB-SG and MLP-SG are efficiently transported by MRP1 with similarV max although the K m for CHB-SG (0.37 μm) is significantly lower than for MLP-SG (1.1 μm). These results indicate that MRP1 is required for GSTA1-1-mediated resistance to CHB in order to relieve potent product inhibition of the enzyme by intracellular CHB-SG formed. The kinetic properties of MRP1 are well suited to eliminate CHB-SG at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. For MLP detoxification, where product inhibition of GSTA1-1 is less important, GSTA1-1 does not confer resistance because of the relatively poorer catalytic efficiency of MLP-SG formation. Similar analyses can be useful for predicting the pharmacological and toxicological consequences of MRP and GST expression on cellular sensitivity to various other electrophilic xenobiotics.

Among the phase II enzymes, we have been particularly interested in the glutathione S-transferases (GST),1 a family of enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione with a variety of electrophilic toxins including cancer drugs, carcinogens, and other xenobiotics (1Coles B. Ketterer B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 2Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4313-4320PubMed Google Scholar). Although these conjugation reactions generally render the compound less chemically reactive and hence less toxic, the overexpression of the various isozymes of GST is frequently insufficient to confer significant protection from the cyto- and genotoxicities of these electrophiles. Indeed, we have shown that coexpression with GST of the glutathione conjugate efflux transporters, MRP1 or MRP2, is necessary to potentiate GST-mediated protection from the toxicities of the cancer drug chlorambucil (CHB) or the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (5Morrow C.S.

Carcinog. 2000; 29: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these and other studies, high intracellular accumulation of the toxin-glutathione conjugate formed in the absence of MRP1 (or MRP2) is associated with increased toxicity whereas low intracellular toxin-conjugate accumulation resulting from MRP-dependent conjugate efflux is associated with cellular resistance (5Morrow C.S. Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Townsend A.J. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 157: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results indicate that glutathione conjugates, especially when they accumulate to high intracellular levels, may themselves be directly or indirectly toxic. Rarely, the glutathione conjugate may be more reactive than the parent compound resulting in increased conjugate toxicity (9Anders M.W. Dekant W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 501-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Dekant W. Vamvakas S. Anders M.W. Toxicol. Lett. 1990; 53: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Dekant W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 387: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, in most cases, the conjugate is less reactive than the parent compound. Thus for the majority of glutathione conjugates, the basis for any apparent conjugate toxicity is unknown but may involve residual conjugate reactivity, product inhibition of GST by the conjugate (12Meyer D.J. Gilmore K.S. Harris J.M. Hartley J.A. Ketterer B. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Meyer D.J. Xenobiotica. 1993; 23: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), or novel toxicities of the conjugate when present at high intracellular concentrations. Previously we showed that expression of both GSTA1-1 and MRP1 are required to confer resistance to CHB; expression of GSTA1-1 or MRP1 alone afforded no protection from CHB cytotoxicity (6Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Diah S.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20114-20120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, combined expression of GSTA1-1 and MRP1 failed to confer protection from the cytotoxicity of the related drug, melphalan (MLP). This was surprising because both of these structurally similar drugs (Fig.1) are reportedly substrates of Alpha-class GST (12Meyer D.J. Gilmore K.S. Harris J.M. Hartley J.A. Ketterer B. Br. J.

Pourtier-Manzanedo A. Konig J. Lehmann W.-D. Keppler D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To explain the basis for this selectivity of MRP/GST-mediated resistance, here we report the results of side-by-side experiments designed to compare the kinetics of CHB-versus MLP-glutathione conjugate: formation, inhibition of GSTA1-1, and transport by MRP1. Other investigators have shown that MLP and CHB are substrates of Alpha-class GST, but to our knowledge no direct comparisons of the kinetic constants of purified GSTA1-1 toward the two substrates have been reported. Whereas, the monoglutathionyl conjugate of CHB, CHB-SG, is known to inhibit Alpha-class GST (12Meyer D.J. Gilmore K.S. Harris J.M. Hartley J.A. Ketterer B. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), again no direct comparison between inhibition by CHB-SG and the corresponding conjugate of MLP, MLP-SG, has been reported. Finally, previous studies on MRP1-mediated MLP-SG and CHB-SG transport did not report kinetic constants for the transport of these two compounds (18Barnouin K. Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Pourtier-Manzanedo A. Konig J. Lehmann W.-D. Keppler D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our results show that the kinetic parameters for CHB-SG and MLP-SG formation, efflux, and GSTA1-1 inhibition can explain the selectivity of GST/MRP1-mediated resistance synergy toward CHB versusMLP. The data indicate that the most important toxicity of CHB-SG is indirect and involves the inhibition of GSTA1-1 catalysis, which limits further drug detoxification. All cell lines were derived from parental MCF7/WT human breast carcinoma cells. MCF7/WT cells have low GST activity, no detectable GSTA1-1, and extremely low level MRP1 expression. The multidrug resistant variant, MCF7/VP, expresses high level MRP1 but again has low GST activity and no GSTA1-1 expression. Enforced expression of GSTA1-1 was accomplished by stable transfection of a GSTA1 expression vector into MCF7/VP cells to generate MCF7/VPα-a derivative expressing high levels of both GSTA1-1 and MRP1. Development, characterization, and culture of these cells has been described previously (6Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Diah S.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. J. Biol.

Exposure to varying concentrations of drugs, CHB or MLP (Sigma), was for 1 h in medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. Stock solutions of drugs were stored at −80 °C as 100 mm CHB in 95% ethanol and 16.4 mm MLP in acidified ethanol (∼0.8 N HCl in 95% ethanol). Monoglutathionyl derivatives of CHB and MLP were prepared in 1–5-ml reactions containing 0.13 mm CHB or MLP, 10 mm glutathione (Sigma), 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m NaCl. Mixtures were incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid to 6.4% (v/v). Samples were loaded onto Waters (Milford, MA) Oasis HLB 3-cc extraction cartridges and washed with 2 ml each of 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and successively higher concentrations of methanol in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. MLP-SG eluted in 40% methanol and CHB-SG in 60% methanol. The purity and identity of each conjugate was verified by analytical HPLC (below) and electrospray mass spectrometry (MLP-SG: m/z[M+H]+ 576.09; CHB-SG: m/z[M+H]+ 575.12). Concentrations of conjugate preparations were estimated by analytical HPLC using integrated absorbance peak areas (254 nm) of conjugates compared with CHB and MLP standards of known concentrations. Radiolabeled conjugates were prepared as described above with the following modifications. Total reaction volumes were reduced to 100 μl; MLP or CHB was added to 1 mm or 3 mm, respectively; and [glycine-2-3H]glutathione (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to 0.51 mm (specific activity: 0.98 mCi/μmole). Monoglutathionyl conjugates were purified by HPLC using a C18 reverse phase column (Beckman) and a solvent system consisting of a 90-min linear gradient of 5–90% (v/v) methanol in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid run at 0.5 ml/min. Chromatography was monitored spectrophotometrically at 254 nm with CHB-SG eluting at 57 min and MLP-SG at 41 min. Drug conjugates were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in water just prior to use. Recombinant human GSTA1-1 was prepared as described previously (6Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Diah S.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20114-20120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For the analysis of monoglutathionyl conjugate inhibition of GSTA1-1 activity, an adaptation of the CDNB assay described by Habig et al. (21Habig W. Pabst M. Jakoby W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Reactions contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, nonlimiting concentration (2 mm) glutathione, 0.5–2 mmCDNB (Sigma) as the variable substrate, ± 0.2 μg/ml purified GSTA1-1, and variable concentrations of MLP-SG or CHB-SG. Reactions were initiated at 25 °C by the addition of CDNB, and formation of its conjugate was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (21Habig W. Pabst M. Jakoby W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme-dependent catalysis was determined by subtracting conjugate formed in the absence of GSTA1-1. GSTA1-1 catalysis of MLP-SG and CHB-SG formation was determined as follows. Reactions contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 140 mm KCl, 2 mm glutathione, ± 0.27 μg/ml recombinant GSTA1-1, and either 50–500 μm CHB or 50–1000 μm MLP as the variable substrate. Reactions were initiated at 25 °C by the addition of CHB or MLP. At 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 min, aliquots were removed, and reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid to 5% (v/v). Conjugate formation was quantified by analytic HPLC as described above. Enzyme-dependent catalysis was determined by subtracting conjugate formed in the absence of GSTA1-1 from conjugate formed in the presence of GSTA1-1. Kinetic constants were calculated from the initial velocities of enzyme-dependent conjugate formation fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Synergy KaleidaGraph 3.0 software for the Macintosh. Membrane vesicles were prepared by modification of a method described by Loe and co-workers (22Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G.

Frozen cell pellets from ∼4 × 108 cells (MRP1−MCF7/WT or MRP1+ MCF7/VP cells) were thawed in 7 ml of the homogenization mixture (including fresh protease inhibitors) as described previously (22Almquist K.C.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 1700 rpm in a Sorvall RT6000 centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was overlaid on a 3-ml sucrose cushion (35% (w/v) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA). Following centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C (Beckman SW41 rotor), the opaque interface was collected, diluted into 5 parts TS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mmsucrose), and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C (Beckman 60 Ti rotor). The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, gently dispersed by 4 passages through a 27-gauge needle, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The use of high pressure nitrogen cavitation (24Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) resulted in >50% inside-out vesicles as determined by endo- and ecto-enzyme assays (25Garen A. Levinthal C. Biochim. Biophys.

The kinetics of 3H-labeled conjugate uptake by vesicles was determined using an adaptation of the membrane rapid filtration method (27Keppler D. Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25–50 μl reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 10 mm MgCl, 250 mmsucrose, either 4 mm ATP or 4 mmβ,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (nonhydrolyzable ATP control), and varying concentrations of [3H]MLP-SG or [3H]CHB-SG. Mixtures were warmed to 37 °C, and reactions were initiated by addition of membrane vesicles (32 μg/50 μl reaction). At 30-s intervals, 10-μl aliquots were removed, and reactions were terminated in 1 ml of ice-cold TS. Samples were immediately filtered with vacuum through 25 mm hydrophilic membrane filters (GVWP, Millipore), and the retained vesicles were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TS prior to liquid scintillation counting. Previous studies demonstrated that coexpression of MRP1 and GSTA1-1 confers resistance to CHB (6Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Diah S.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20114-20120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Additional experiments showed that both MRP1 and GSTA1-1 are required for resistance; expression of GSTA1-1 or MRP1 alone was ineffective for cytoprotection. The cytotoxicities of CHB versus MLP were compared in the MCF7 derivative cell lines expressing (i) neither MRP1 or GSTA1-1 (MCF7/WT), (ii) MRP1 alone (MCF7/VP), or (iii) MRP1 and GSTA1-1 in combination (MCF7/VPα). These data, shown in Fig.2, revealed that whereas combined expression of MRP1 and GSTA1-1 conferred resistance to CHB, combined expression had no effect on cellular sensitivity to MLP. We hypothesized that this selectivity of MRP1/GSTA1-1 cytoprotection may result from quantitative differences in (i) GSTA1-1-mediated MLP-SGversus CHB-SG conjugate formation, (ii) product inhibition of GSTA1-1 by MLP-SG versus CHB-SG, or (iii) MLP-SGversus CHB-SG efflux by MRP1. Using purified recombinant GSTA1-1 and CDNB as the variable substrate, experiments shown in Fig. 3, Aand B) demonstrated that both CHB-SG and MLP-SG are competitive inhibitors of GSTA1-1. CHB-SG is an exceptionally potent inhibitor with a K i of 0.14 μm whereas MLP-SG is considerably less potent with a K i of 4.7 μm (Fig. 3 C). These data indicate that MRP1 may be required to potentiate GSTA1-1-mediated resistance to CHB in order to relieve product inhibition of the enzyme by CHB-SG. For MLP, product inhibition of GSTA1-1 by MLP-SG is relatively less important. Thus, it is unclear from these data why GSTA1-1 alone or in combination with MRP1 did not confer resistance to MLP. To address this issue, the kinetics of GSTA1-1-mediated formation of the monoglutathionyl conjugates of MLP versus CHB were examined (Fig. 4). Whereas both compounds are substrates of GSTA1-1, the V max is significantly higher and the K m lower for CHB than for MLP resulting in a catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) that is more than 4-fold superior for CHB (Table I). These data predict that GSTA1-1 should be less efficient in the conjugation and detoxification of MLP; a prediction consistent with the cytotoxicity data (Fig. 2).Table IhGSTA1–1 catalysis of chlorambucil and melphalan conjugation with glutathioneSubstrateK mV maxV max/Kmμmnmol min−1 · mg−1ml min−1 · mg−1chlorambucil1117126.4melphalan1702511.5 Open table in a new tab A comparison of CHB-SG and MLP-SG uptake by isolated inside-out membrane vesicles revealed that both conjugates are efficiently transported by MRP1 in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig.5). Initial velocities of MRP1-mediated transport showed that both conjugates are transported with similarV max, but the K m of CHB-SG transport, 0.37 μm, is considerably lower than theK m of MLP-SG, 1.14 μm (Fig.6). The relatively lowK m for CHB-SG transport indicates that it is one of the better substrates so far reported for MRP1 and that MRP1-mediated efflux of CHB-SG operates efficiently at low, GSTA1-1 inhibitory, concentrations of CHB-SG.Figure 6Kinetics of MRP1-mediated transport of CHB-SGversus MLP-SG by inside-out membrane vesicles.Shown are the initial velocities of ATP-dependent CHB-SG (closed circles) versus MLP-SG (open circles) uptake by membrane vesicles derived from MCF7/VP cells as a function of substrate concentration.

Both drugs share detoxification pathways that involve GSTA1-1 catalysis of monoglutathionyl conjugate formation and MRP1-dependent conjugate efflux. Despite these shared processes, differential protection from drug toxicities is observed in cells expressing both GSTA1-1 and MRP1. In these MCF7/VPα cells, significant resistance is observed only toward CHB, not MLP (Fig. 2). The preferential detoxification of CHB over MLP can be primarily attributed to the superior catalytic efficiency of GSTA1−1 toward CHB (Fig. 4, Table I). The greater efficiency of MRP1-mediated transport of CHB-SG may make some additional contribution to the differential protection conferred by GSTA1-1 expressing cells (Fig. 6, TableII).Table IIMRP1-dependent transport of glutathione conjugates of chlorambucil (CHB-SG) versus melphalan (MLP-SG)SubstrateKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmpmol min−1 · mg−1ml min−1 · mg−1CHB-SG0.371300.35MLP-SG1.141300.11 Open table in a new tab The role of MRP1, or other glutathione conjugate efflux transporters, is an important issue in GST-mediated detoxification. GSTs catalyze the conjugation with glutathione of reactive electrophilic centers of several toxic xenobiotics, including MLP and CHB (2Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). These reactions generally decrease the reactivity and presumably the toxicity of the electrophile. However, as we have also noted for the cyto- and genotoxic compound 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, expression of GST alone is insufficient to afford measurable protection from CHB cytotoxicity (5Morrow C.S. Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Diah S.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. J.

Carcinog. 2000; 29: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these studies, GST-mediated resistance required the coexpression of a glutathione conjugate efflux transporter such as MRP1 (CHB and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide) or MRP2 (4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide). These results suggest that the glutathione conjugates, which accumulate within the cell in the absence of MRP, have some residual or novel toxicities. Indeed, in the absence of MRP1, GST-expressing MCF7 cell derivatives treated with only micromolar concentrations of CDNB or 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide can rapidly accumulate millimolar concentrations of the respective glutathione conjugates,S-(2, 4- dinitrophenyl)-glutathione or 4-(glutathione-S-yl)-quinoline 1-oxide (5Morrow C.S. Diah S. Smitherman P.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Townsend A.J. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 157: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, MRP1-expressing cells are able to maintain very low intracellular levels of these conjugates. There are at least two plausible mechanisms for the apparent toxicity of CHB-SG in cells lacking MRP1. The first is the potential direct toxicity of this monoglutathionyl conjugate of CHB. GSTA1-1 catalyzes the formation of CHB-SG but leaves the second reactive chloroethyl group intact. Whereas CHB-SG can no longer form DNA strand cross-linkages, it retains the ability to form monovalent adducts with cellular nucleophiles including proteins and nucleic acids. Therefore, it would not be surprising to find that the monoglutathionyl derivative of CHB retained significant cytotoxicity at high intracellular concentrations. Several findings argue that this mechanism contributes relatively little to the CHB toxicity overcome by combined expression of GSTA1-1 and MRP1. First, it is known that finite levels of CHB-SG are formed nonenzymatically, in the absence of GSTA1-1. MRP1 will support efflux of this conjugate (Figs. 5 and 6), yet MRP1 alone does not confer resistance (MCF7/VP, Fig. 2). Indeed, expression of MRP1 alone consistently results in either no change or a modest sensitization to CHB toxicity (6Morrow C.S. Smitherman P.K. Diah S.K. Schneider E. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20114-20120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Schneider E. Horton J. Yang C.-h. Nakagawa M. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 152-158PubMed Google Scholar). The data suggest that a second potential mechanism of CHB-SG toxicity is more important. This mechanism is indirect and involves product inhibition of GSTA1-1. As originally described by Meyer et al. (12Meyer D.J. Gilmore K.S. Harris J.M. Hartley J.A. Ketterer B. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and shown here (Fig. 3, Table I), CHB-SG is a potent inhibitor of GSTA1-1 (K i 0.14 μm). In contrast, MLP-SG is a much less effective inhibitor of GSTA1-1 (K i 4.7 μm). Hence, removal of intracellular CHB-SG is particularly critical to maintain GSTA1-1 activity and continued detoxifying conjugation of CHB. MRP1 efficiently supports CHB-SG efflux (Figs. 5 and 6 and Table II). TheK m of transport is remarkably low (0.37 μm), which indicates that MRP1-mediated transport is kinetically suited to remove CHB-SG at low, GSTA1-1-inhibitory concentrations of the conjugate. In summary, MRP1 is essential to potentiate GSTA1-1 detoxification of CHB in order to relieve product inhibition of this conjugating enzyme. In contrast to its effect on CHB toxicity, GSTA1-1 is unable to confer measurable protection from MLP toxicity because of its relatively poorer efficiency toward this substrate. These studies indicate that the determination of quantitative differences in the kinetics of phase II conjugation and phase III efflux processes can be used to accurately predict the sensitivities of cells and tissues to the toxicities of some drugs and other xenobiotics.

https://openalex.org/W2315781717,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the risk of colon cancer and this effect is mediated in part through inhibition of type 2 prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase/ cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2). In the present study, we demonstrate that COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis are up-regulated by an IGF-II/IGF-I receptor autocrine pathway in Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells. COX-2 mRNA and PGE2 levels are higher in proliferating cells compared with post-confluent differentiated cells and in cells that constitutively overexpress IGF-II. Up-regulation of COX-2 expression by IGF-II is mediated through activation of IGF-I receptor because: (i) treatment of Caco-2 cells with a blocking antibody to the IGF-I receptor inhibits COX-2 mRNA expression; (ii) transfection of Caco-2 cells with a dominant negative IGF-I receptor reduces COX-2 expression and activity. Also, the blockade of the PI3-kinase, that mediates the proliferative effect of IGF-I receptor in Caco-2 cells, inhibits IGF-II-dependent COX-2 up-regulation and PGE2 synthesis. Moreover, COX-2 expression and activity inversely correlate with the increase of apoptosis in parental, IGF-II and dominant-negative IGF-I receptor transfected cells. This study suggests that induction of proliferation and tumor progression of colon cancer cells by the IGF-II/IGF-I receptor pathway may depend on the activation of COX-2-related events."

Somatic rearrangements caused by chromosomal inversions activate the oncogenic potential of RET in human papillary thyroid carcinomas, whereas germline point mutations are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2; reviewed in Refs. 9Edery P.

Oncol. 1999; 17: 380-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1736s-1741sPubMed Google Scholar). The malignancies associated with these syndromes arise in several RET-expressing neural crest-derived cell populations. However, RET is expressed at high levels in many other cell types which do not show malignant changes in MEN2 (12Tsuzuki T. Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Asai J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 191-198PubMed Google Scholar). MEN2A is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytomas and parathyroid hyperplasia, whereas MEN2B is characterized by MTC associated with pheochromocytomas, enteric ganglioneuromas, skeletal abnormalities, and mucosal neuromas. MTC is the only phenotype in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. In MEN2A, cysteine substitutions in the extracellular domain of RET cause aberrant homodimerization and ligand-independent constitutive activation of RET (13Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romanova A. Bottaro D.L.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 14Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar), which alone or together with unknown factors cause the malignant proliferation of cells. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma mutations are more evenly distributed among the extracellular cysteines but are also found in the intracellular part of RET. Most cases of MEN2B contain a specific mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain, which is also frequently found in sporadic MTC. This leads to constitutive activation of RET with altered substrate specificity in downstream signaling pathway (13Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romanova A. Bottaro D.L.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A.

The tissue-specific tumorigenesis and phenotypic variability within a MEN2 family and between individuals carrying the same mutation in RET, suggests that further genetic events or modifier genes are required to induce the tumor phenotype. In this paper, we have characterized the human GFRα4 receptor and show that it is a functional co-receptor for PSPN, which mediates RET activation. Selective coexpression of GFRA4 andRET in normal and malignant C-cells suggests thatGFRA4 is a candidate modifier gene in MTC. RNA from different human tissues was purchased from CLONTECH (Human Total RNA Panels I-V). Total RNA from primary MTC tumors was isolated using UltraspecTM-II RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). Total RNA from the TT cell line (ATCC number CRL1803) was isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). RNA from human fetal thyroid and adrenal tissue (17- and 18-week-old, respectively) was isolated from autopsy samples (Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Finland), by RNAwizTM isolation reagent (Ambion). Total RNA from human blood cells was isolated using the QIAampTM RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RET mutation of five MTC patients had been analyzed: one from a MEN2A family member contained the germline C634R mutation, one patient was positive for the M918T but the germline situation was unknown, and three were sporadic MTCs of which one was positive for the M918T mutation. Human GFRA4 cDNAs were identified from a human thyroid cDNA (CLONTECH Marathon Ready cDNA) by the 3′- and 5′-RACE method using the GC-rich PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript II (Life Technologies). PCR systems were GC-rich PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) forGFRA4 and PSPN, Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for GFRA1, GFRA2,GFRA3, and RET, and Dynazyme II (Finnzymes) forPPIA (alias cyclophilin). PCR was run 40 cycles forGFRA4, 35 cycles for PSPN, GFRA1, andGFRA2, and 30 cycles for GFRA3, RET, andPPIA using annealing temperatures of 55–60 °C. Full-length human GFRA4 cDNA was obtained using Expand High Fidelity system PCR enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) together with GC-rich PCR system buffers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR products were cloned into mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The antisense primers used in 5′-RACE were the mouse-specificGfra4 primer 5′-CACGTTGTCCAGGTAGTTGG-3′ and a second human-specific GFRA4 nested primer 5′-GCACTGCGCCACATACTCGGA-3′. The 3′ region of GFRA4was cloned in two steps, first using a GFRA4-specific sense primer P2 (see Fig. 1 A) 5′-GCTCCGAGTATGTGGCGCAGT-3′ and a nested primer 5′-GCTCACCCACGCACTGCTCTTCTG-3′. The 3′-region containing the stop codon and 3′-untranslated region sequence was cloned using a sense primer 5′-CCTAACTACGTGGACAACGTGAGC-3′ and a second nested primer 5′-ATGGTGCCATTCAGGCCTTTGCCAG-3′ or 5′-GCAGGTGTCCTCCACAGGCAG-3′. RT-PCR of genomic human DNA was used to locate the intronic nucleotide sequences between exons 4 and 5, and between exons 5 and 6, using a sense primer 5′-CCTAACTACGTGGACAACGTGAGC-3′ and an antisense primer 5′-GAAGTATGGAGAGCAGGGAGCGTC-3′. Full-length human GFRA4cDNAs were obtained using a sense primer P1 (see Fig.1 A), 5′-CCACCATGGTCCGCTGCCTGG-3′ and an antisense primer P3, 5′-GAGGTCGCTGTCCTAATCAGAG-3′.

Primers used in RT-PCR for human GFRA1 flanked nucleotides 491–870 of GenBankTM sequence AF042080, forGFRA2 flanked nucleotides 148–427 of GenBankTMsequence U93703, for GFRA3 flanked nucleotides 574–1203 of GenBankTM sequence NM001496, and for RET flanked nucleotides 833–1114 of GenBankTM sequence X12949. The amounts of total RNA in samples were normalized by amplification of aPPIA fragment. Murine neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were transfected (FuGene6, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with full-length GFRA4a cDNA in pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen), and bulk selected with 400 μg/ml G418. PSPN was enzymatically iodinated by lactoperoxidase, to a specific activity of 100,000 cpm/ng. Binding assays were performed essentially as described (20Laurikainen A. Hiltunen J.O. Thomas-Crusells J. Vanhatalo S. Arumäe U. Airaksinen M.S. Klinge E. Saarma M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 43: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with 0.9 nm125I-PSPN in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) for 4 h on ice, either in the presence or absence of different concentrations of unlabeled human PSPN (PeproTech EC Ltd.), rat GDNF (Cephalon, Inc.), human NRTN (PeproTech EC Ltd.), or human ARTN (a gift from Drs. J. Milbrandt and E. M. Johnson, Jr.). The amount of125I-PSPN bound to mock-transfected cells was at the background level. Kd was calculated using Cheng-Prusoff equation (21McGonigle P. Molinoff P.B. Siegel G.J. Basic Neurochemistry. 5th Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 209-230Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected (FuGene 6) with full-length humanGFRA4a cDNA, grown for 2 days, washed and incubated with 0.9 nm125I-PSPN in binding buffer (see above) on ice for 4 h. After washing the cells were incubated with 1 mm bis-suberate (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 25 min. Following washes, some samples were treated with 0.5 unit/ml phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (Sigma) at +37 °C for 30 min. Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The cross-linking reaction for human GFRA4a and mock transfected (pcDNA3; Invitrogen) Neuro-2a cells was done as described above but the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1 × Tris-buffered saline, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml Ret antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and collected with Protein A-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Semiconfluent humanGFRA4a-, rat Gfra1-, or vector-expressing Neuro-2a cells were maintained with 0.5% serum for 24 h and then in serum-free medium for 4 h prior to stimulation. After stimulation with PSPN (0.01–100 ng/ml) or GDNF (100 ng/ml), cells were lysed and precipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at +4 °C on ice. The membranes were probed with 60 ng/ml anti-Ret antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons from postnatal day 1–2 FVB or NMRI strain mice were grown for 5–6 days on polyornithine/laminin-coated dishes with NGF (30 ng/ml). 50:50 ng/μl cDNA mixtures of short isoform of humanRET (gift from Dr. M. Billaud) and either mouseGfra4a1 (in pcDNA3, Invitrogen) or humanGFRA4a (in pCR3.1, not shown) or empty pcDNA3 vector were pressure-microinjected into nuclei. To find successfully injected neurons later, a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (10 ng/μl) was included in every injection mixture. Neurons were grown overnight with NGF and thereafter in NGF-free medium containing blocking anti-NGF antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and PSPN, GDNF, NRTN, or ARTN, all at 100 ng/ml. Number of living fluorescent neurons or uninjected control neurons was then counted (initial neurons). 30–80 initial neurons were successfully injected for every treatment group. Healthy fluorescent neurons with intact nuclei and phase-bright cytoplasm were counted 70–75 h later and expressed as percentage of initial neurons. Experiments were repeated on independent cultures: n = 7 for PSPN, n = 4 for GDNF and NRTN, n = 3 for ARTN. In each repeat, all treatment groups (plasmid combinations and controls) for a given factor, shown as a separate group of bars on Fig. 4, were assayed collectively in the same experiment. Experiments with GFRα4 alone (with and without PSPN) were performed separately (n = 4) and combined with other PSPN data. Significance of the differences between means was estimated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tuckey's post-hoc test at the significance level of α = 0.05. In situ hybridizations forRET, GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3,and GFRA4 were performed as described (22Rossi J. Luukko K. Poteryaev D. Laurikainen A. Sun Y.-F. Laakso T. Eerikäinen S. Tuominen R. Lakso M.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) on cryosections of the same thyroid tumor samples analyzed by RT-PCR. A 206-bp cDNA fragment of the 5′-end of human GFRA4 was used as template for sense and antisense RNA probes. PCR fragments of GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, and RET generated with the same primers as in RT-PCR were cloned and sequenced and used as templates for antisense and sense RNA probes. Control sections hybridized with sense probe did not show labeling above background (not shown). Dark-field and corresponding bright-field images of Nissl counterstained sections were digitized and processed using Adobe PhotoShop software. Sequence information from the mouse Gfra4 cDNA and gene (5Lindahl M. Timmusk T. Rossi J. Saarma M. Airaksinen M.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was used to identify humanGFRA4 cDNA and genomic clones. First, the genomic region covering putative exon 2 to exon 4 was cloned by PCR from human genomic DNA. Next, the structure of GFRA4 cDNAs and gene were characterized by 5′- and 3′-RACE of adult human thyroid cDNA and PCR of genomic DNA using primers corresponding to different regions of the putative exons of human GFRA4 (see “Materials and Methods”). The sequence of human GFRA4 exon 1 encoding the signal sequence showed high homology to the mouse Gfra4 exon 1a (5Lindahl M. Timmusk T. Rossi J. Saarma M. Airaksinen M.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding proteins with an alternative signal sequence homologous to the 1b signal sequence found in mouse, or putative transmembrane and soluble isoforms found in mouse (5Lindahl M. Timmusk T. Rossi J. Saarma M. Airaksinen M.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), were not identified from human thyroid. Instead, three different alternatively spliced GFRA4 cDNAs were identified (GFRA4a,GFRA4b, and GFRA4c, Fig.1B): (i) GFRA4a (810 bp) corresponds to the mouse Gfra4 transcript a1 (5Lindahl M. Timmusk T. Rossi J. Saarma M. Airaksinen M.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The predicted protein (GFRα4a, 290 amino acids, Fig. 1 C) contains a putative N-terminal hydrophobic signal, oneN-linked glycosylation site (NVSA) at position 178, and a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in the C terminus, preceded by a hydrophilic linker region, consistent with a GPI-anchor signal sequence (23Udenfried S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The amino acid identity between mouse and human GFRα4a is 76%, whereas the identity between human and chicken GFRα4 is 54% (covering amino acids 143–340 in chicken GFRα4). The other identified alternative human GFRA4 transcripts are: (ii) GFRA4b (900 bp), in which the small intron (79 bp) separating exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1 A) is included in the transcript, and the 3′-splice site of exon 4 is located 11 bp upstream of the respective splice site used in the GFRA4a transcript. The small intron between exons 2 and 3 is also inefficiently spliced in the majority of mouse tissues. Inclusion of this intron in mouseGfra4 transcripts with exon 1a or exon 1b leads to a putative soluble protein isoform (5Lindahl M. Timmusk T. Rossi J. Saarma M. Airaksinen M.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, translation of the transcript GFRA4b in human would lead to a GPI-linked protein of 299 amino acids. In this protein isoform, the N- and C-terminal ends are identical to the respective regions ofGFRA4a, but the middle region consists of a stretch of 66 amino acids translated in different frame from intron 2 and exon 3. This sequence is not homologous to any protein in public data bases. (iii) GFRA4c (867 bp), in which the introns between exons 2 and 3, and between exons 3 and 4 are included in the transcript. These introns would lead to a frameshift with a stop codon located inside exon 5 and production of a putative soluble isoform of 236 amino acids. It is interesting to note that the sequences of the 3′-splice sites of both mouse and human exon 3 and exon 4 contain a short polypyrimidine tract interrupted with purines, which is characteristic to alternatively spliced exons (24Lou H. Gagel R.F. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of GFRA4, PSPN, andRET was analyzed by RT-PCR in 27 different adult and 4 fetal tissues (Fig. 2 and not shown). Using primers P2 and P3, expression of GFRA4 was detected at high levels in the adult thyroid gland (Fig. 2) and, at lower levels, in the fetal adrenal and fetal thyroid gland (not shown), whereas all other tissues analyzed did not express detectable levels of GFRA4. Similar results were obtained with other combinations of primers P1, P2, and P3 (data not shown). On Fig. 2, the smallest fragment of 699 bp corresponds to the GFRA4a cDNA where all introns are spliced out, whereas the 789-bp fragment corresponds to the intron 2-containing GFRA4b transcript. The 863-bp PCR fragment corresponds to the cDNA containing both introns 2 and 3 encoding the putative soluble isoform (GFRA4c, Fig. 1 B). The unspliced transcript (560 bp) of PSPN was expressed in all human tissues examined using primers detecting the full-lengthPSPN transcript (Fig. 2, second row). No transcripts were observed when RNA was used as a template for PCR, which shows that the cDNA samples did not contain chromosomal DNA. Low levels of spliced PSPN transcripts (476 bp) encoding the functional protein were present in adult human adrenal gland, cerebellum, spinal cord, and testis, and were not detected in the thyroid gland. The nucleotide sequences for the spliced and unspliced PSPN transcripts were verified by sequencing. RET mRNA was expressed at variable levels in most tissues examined (Fig. 2,third row). To study the binding of human PSPN to human GFRα4, we used GFRA4a-transfected mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells (hGFRα4/Neuro-2a), which endogenously express Ret. These cells strongly bound 125I-PSPN, while mock-transfected Neuro-2a cells did not (Fig.3 C). Low concentrations (∼1 nm) of unlabeled PSPN effectively displaced125I-PSPN from the GFRA4-expressing cells, whereas GDNF (up to 300 nm), NRTN (up to 200 nm), and ARTN (up to 200 nm) were ineffective (Fig. 3 A). Thus, in the presence of Ret, human GFRα4 binds specifically PSPN, but not the other GDNF family ligands. PSPN binds to human GFRα4 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼100 pm (Fig. 3 A). Next we studied the binding of PSPN to GFRA4a-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express Ret. Treatment of the cells with 125I-PSPN, followed by chemical cross-linking and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, resulted in a major band of ∼46 kDa and minor bands of ∼62 and 92 kDa (Fig.3 B). The ∼46-kDa band corresponds a PSPN monomer (∼16 kDa) cross-linked to monomeric GFRα4 (30 kDa). The ∼62- and 92-kDa bands most probably correspond to PSPN dimer cross-linked to GFRα4 monomer and dimer, respectively. Additional 16- and 32-kDa bands represent PSPN monomer and dimer, respectively (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). No specific bands were detected from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). The amount of cell-bound complexes was greatly reduced by adding unlabeled PSPN or by removal of the GPI-anchored proteins by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C after cross-linking (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and5). Combination of these two treatments further reduced the yield of cross-linked products to undetectable levels (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Thus, the human GFRα4 protein, encoded by theGFRA4a transcript indeed contains a GPI anchor. Cross-linked complexes of the same sizes were also identified from hGFRα4/Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 3 C). In addition, a minor band of about 200 kDa was observed (Fig. 3 C) that could be a complex of PSPN-GFRα4 with Ret. To study the interaction of PSPN with Ret, proteins cross-linked to125I-PSPN in hGFRα4/Neuro-2a cells were precipitated with Ret antibodies (Fig. 3 D, lanes 2 and 4). The major cross-linked complexes of ∼190 and 220 kDa, as well as minor complexes of about 62 and 92 kDa (same size as bands in Fig.3 C), and also of ∼400 kDa were obtained under reducing conditions (Fig. 3 D, lane 2). Under nonreducing conditions, the ∼400-kDa band was greatly intensified, which indicates the presence of S-S-bound complexes. No cross-linked cell-bound products were detected using parental Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 3 D, lanes 1 and 3). The bands of about 190 and 220 kDa correspond to the complexes of PSPN-Ret (186 kDa) and PSPN-GFRα4-Ret (216 kDa), respectively. The components of the complex of about 400 kDa could be a dimer of the 186-kDa PSPN-Ret complex. To determine whether PSPN binding to human GFRα4 mediates Ret autophosphorylation, we used hGFRα4/Neuro-2a cells treated with PSPN.Gfra1 expressing Neuro-2a cells treated with GDNF served as a positive control. PSPN induced Ret tyrosine autophosphorylation in hGFRα4/Neuro-2a cells, which showed a phosphorylated band of 170 kDa, corresponding to the active form of Ret (Fig. 3 E). No phosphorylation of Ret was observed in vector-transfected Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 3 E, mock). Stimulation of Ret phosphorylation was dose-dependent starting at 0.1 ng/ml"

In the present study, we undertook a series of in vitro experiments to establish a correlation between the structural changes induced by mild oxidation of the model protein RNase A and the proteolytic rate found upon exposure of the modified protein toward the isolated 20 S proteasome. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used as a structure-sensitive probe. We report here strong experimental evidence for oxidation-induced conformational rearrangements of the model protein RNase A and, at the same time, for covalent modifications of amino acid side chains. Oxidation-related conformational changes, induced by H2O2exposure of the protein may be monitored in the amide I region, which is sensitive to changes in protein secondary structure. A comparison of the time- and H2O2concentration-dependent changes in the amide I region demonstrates a high degree of similarity to spectral alterations typical for temperature-induced unfolding of RNase A. In addition, spectral parameters of amino acid side chain marker bands (Tyr, Asp) revealed evidence for covalent modifications. Proteasome digestion measurements on oxidized RNase A revealed a specific time and H2O2 concentration dependence; at low initial concentration of the oxidant, the RNase A turnover rate increases with incubation time and concentration. Based on these experimental findings, a correlation between structural alterations detected upon RNase A oxidation and proteolytic rates of RNase A is established, and possible mechanisms of the proteasome recognition process of oxidatively damaged proteins are discussed.

Most of these studies revealed that the degradation of mildly oxidized proteins seems to be a normal cellular function, whereas extensively oxidized proteins are poor substrates for proteases and may accumulate and therefore contribute to diseases or aging processes (16Giulivi C.

It was concluded that the oxidative modification of amino acid side chains disrupts, at least locally, the tertiary protein structure, which is, in turn, accompanied by exposure of hydrophobic moieties to the surface of the protein. This increase in surface hydrophobicity seems to be the recognition signal for the 20 S proteasome for binding and degradation of the substrate protein (14Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S.

However, until now it could not be shown directly that protein oxidation is accompanied by the disruption of secondary and tertiary protein structure. The present investigation addresses the question of whether protein oxidation is followed by amino acid side chain modifications or changes in secondary and tertiary protein structure and whether these effects correlate with increased proteolytic susceptibility. For our studies, we selected the small single domain cytoplasmic protein RNase A as a model, since this protein is exceptionally well characterized by a variety of structure-sensitive techniques such as x-ray crystallography (23Wlodawer A. Bott R. Sjoelin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NMR spectroscopy (24Santoro J. Rico M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), UV-visible and CD spectroscopy (25Tsai A.M. van Zanten J.H. Bethenbaugh M.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 59: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), differential scanning calometric (for a review, see Pace et al. (26Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomas S.T. Makhatadze G.I. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)1spectroscopy (27Haris P.I. Lee D.C. Chapman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Backmann J. Schultz C. Fabian H. Hahn U. Saenger W. Naumann D.

In particular, FT-IR spectroscopy has proved to be a sensitive tool for following conformational changes in proteins (Ref. 31Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar; for a review, see Jackson & Mantsch (32Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar)). Peptide backbone and side chain infrared “marker” bands can be employed as conformation-sensitive monitors to derive structural parameters during refolding of RNase A in solution (33Fabian H. Schultz C. Naumann D. Landt O Hahn U. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Fabian H Schultz C Backmann J Hahn U Saenger W. Mantsch H.H. Naumann D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10725-10730Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, time-resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques have been employed to follow refolding processes of RNase A in the time range of 50 ms to 15 minutes (29Reinstädler D. Fabian H. Backmann J. Naumann D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15822-15830Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Backmann J. Fabian H. Naumann D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Reinstädler D. Fabian H. Naumann D. Proteins. 1999; 34: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we report structural alterations, detected by FT-IR spectroscopy, of the model protein RNase A upon exposure toward hydrogen peroxide and upon thermal unfolding. The changes of the protein structure were related to the results obtained by degradation measurements of the oxidized RNase A samples by isolated 20 S proteasomes. Highly purified lyophilized RNase A (from bovine pancreas) was purchased from Sigma Chemie GmbH (Deisenhofen, Germany). Proteasome was isolated from erythrocytes of outdated human blood conserves according to Houghet al. (37Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were lysed in 1 mmdithiothreitol. After the removal of membranes and nonlysed cells by centrifugation, the proteasome was isolated by DEAE chromatography, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and separation on a Mono Q column of a fast protein liquid chromatography system. All RNase A treatments were performed under standardized conditions to ensure reproducibility of the FT-IR spectroscopic and proteasome degradation experiments. Stock solutions containing RNase A were prepared in a 10 mm cacodylat/D2O-buffer at pH* 7.1 to yield an enzyme concentration of 20 mg/ml. The protein solutions were heated for 15 min at 60 °C to achieve complete H/D exchange of the amide protons (28Backmann J. Schultz C. Fabian H. Hahn U. Saenger W. Naumann D. Proteins. 1996; 24: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The different H2O2 solutions (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mm) were prepared from a 22m H2O2 stock solution by dilution with the respective volume of a 10 mmcacodylat/D2O buffer, pH* 7.1. The protein and H2O2 solution were subsequently mixed in a ratio of 1:1 (by volume) to a yield final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in H2O2 concentrations of 0 (control), 5, 10, 20, and 40 mm, respectively. Therefore, the maximal1H content of the final solutions never exceeded 0.2% (40 mm H2O2). Prior to the measurements of the proteolytic susceptibility, all RNase A solutions were diluted to 1 mg/ml. The degradation of native and oxidized RNase A by the 20 S proteasome was measured by incubation of 40 μg of substrate protein with 0.6 μg of proteasome in a proteolysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 20 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of trichloroacetic acid (20%). After centrifugation (15 min, 12,000 × g) the supernatants containing primary amines were neutralized with 1 m HEPES (pH 7.8). Fluorescamine (0.3 mg/ml in acetone) was added under vigorous shaking, and the fluorescence was determined at 390-nm excitation/470-nm emission. Leucine was used as a standard. Proteolysis rates were calculated as the difference between the measured value and the blank value (sum of incubated substrate protein without protease and of incubated protease only). To exclude the possibility of hydrogen peroxide-induced RNase A backbone fragmentation, RNase A samples (10 mg/ml) were incubated for 48 h with H2O2 (0, 1, 2, and 4 μmol of H2O2/mg of protein) and subsequently analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. A comparative analysis of the mass spectra indicated that no new peaks of the oxidized RNase A occurred between 300 and 60,000 Da. Thus, it could be experimentally confirmed that mild oxidation of RNase A does not cause protein backbone fragmentation. However, small shifts of RNase A peaks were observed. We interpreted these experimental findings as a result of covalent side chain modification of RNase A. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS28B FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a computer-controlled sample changer and a deuterated triglycin sulfate detector. To eliminate spectral contributions due to atmospheric water vapor, the instrument was continuously purged with dry air. After mixing, the solutions of RNase A and H2O2 were quickly transferred to an IR sample cell consisting of a pair of CaF2 windows separated by a 50-μm spacer. FT-IR measurements were carried out at a temperature of 30 °C. For each spectrum, 1024 interferograms were coadded and Fourier-transformed employing a Happ-Genzel apodization function and a zero filling factor of 4. Nominal resolution was 4 cm−1. For Fourier self-deconvolution, the software routines implemented in the manufacturer software package OPUS (Bruker) were used. Second derivative spectra were evaluated applying a Savitzky-Golay algorithm with seven smoothing points. To visualize and to interpret small spectroscopic changes, difference spectra Dt were calculated in the following way, Dt=Alast−AtEquation 1 where Dt is the difference spectrum at a given time t, while Alast andAt are absorbance spectra recorded at the end of a measurement series or at time t. Therefore, negative bands of the difference spectra indicate decreasing amounts of the respective structures, and vice versa. Temperature profiles were carried out on a Bruker IFS66 FT-IR spectrometer, which was equipped with a deuterated triglycin sulfate detector. Again, a Happ-Genzel apodization function, a zero filling factor of 4, and a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1 was used. For temperature profile measurements, infrared spectra were collected continuously in a thermostated IR cuvette with an optical path length of 50 μm. For this type of measurement, RNase A was dissolved in 10 mm cacodylat/D2O buffer at pH* 7.1 to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. The protein was unfolded and refolded in two consecutive cycles by applying a linear temperature gradient of 0.5 K/min between 20 and 80 °C and back to 20 °C. Complete H/D exchange of the amide protons was obtained after the first heating cycle. For data evaluation, only spectra of the second heating run (unfolding) were utilized. Infrared spectra were corrected for spectral contributions of buffer and water vapor as described previously (33Fabian H. Schultz C. Naumann D. Landt O Hahn U. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Difference spectra were calculated in the same way as outlined above. The accessible surface areas (ASA) were calculated using the program Naccess version 2.1 (38Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. Naccess, version 2.1. University College London, 1993Google Scholar), which is an implementation of the Lee and Richards method (39Lee B. Richards F.M. J..Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref Scopus (5346) Google Scholar). The program calculates the atomic accessible surface defined by rolling a probe of given size around a van der Waals surface. A slice thickness of 0.05 Å and a probe size of 1.4 Å for H2O and 2.1 Å for H2O2 was used. The latter value was estimated on the basis of the bond length and the atom radii of O2 and F2. We utilized an output file containing summed atomic ASA over each residue. For these calculations, the coordinates from the Protein Data Bank ID 1rbx (RNase A without ligand) by J. L. H. Dunbar and G. K. Farber (40Dunbar, J. L. H., Yennawar, H. P., Banerjec, S., Luo, J. & Farber, G. K. (1997) 1727–1733.Google Scholar) were used. To obtain new insights into the recognition process of oxidized proteins by the proteasome, we combined two different techniques: structural changes of the model protein RNase A upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide were followed by FT-IR spectroscopy, while the changes of susceptibility to proteasome degradation were tested by biochemical methods. For this purpose, stock solutions of RNase A and H2O2 were prepared and used for both kinds of experiments. Although the use of D2O buffers or fully H/D-exchanged proteins is not essential for the proteasome degradation characterizations, we tried to maintain the experimental protocols as much as possible. Therefore, the first steps of proteasome digestion were performed in D2O buffers after a complete H/D exchange of the protein. The degradation of various proteins by the 20 S proteasome was already measured by several groups for a number of different proteins (5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10857-10862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Since most of these experiments were performed under standardized conditions, we used the same experimental protocol to study the proteolytic susceptibility of RNase A toward the 20 S proteasome. The results of the investigations are demonstrated in Fig.1. When RNase A is treated with hydrogen peroxide concentrations up to 4 μmol/mg of protein (approximately 55 molecules of H2O2 per molecule of RNase A), an increase in proteolytic susceptibility of the resulting oxidized proteins is detected. At higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, a decrease of the proteolytic susceptibility was measured. As previously postulated and shown earlier (5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J.

Med. 1998; 24: 1369-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this decline is due to the irreversible formation of protein aggregates. These protein aggregates are poor substrates for the protease or may even be able to inhibit the 20 S proteasome (15Grune T. Blasig I.E. Sitte N. Roloff B. Haseloff R. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10857-10862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB.

Med. 1998; 24: 1369-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the objectives of the present work was to investigate the structural rearrangements of the protein induced by oxidation, which causes the recognition and the degradation of the protein by the 20 S proteasome. Consequently, hydrogen peroxide concentrations below 4 μmol/mg of protein were applied in all experiments. Since FT-IR spectroscopy requires relatively high protein concentrations (∼10 mg/ml), the hydrogen peroxide concentration was varied from 0 (control) to 40 mm. The hydrogen peroxide/protein concentration ratio was therefore identical to that utilized in the proteasome degradation experiments (0–4 μmol of H2O2/mg of protein). FT-IR spectroscopic studies of proteins in aqueous solutions are frequently performed in D2O buffers for the following reasons. The amide I band (1620–1690 cm−1), arising predominantly from the C=O oscillators of the secondary amide function of protein backbone, is superimposed on the deformation band at 1643 cm−1 of the solvent H2O. Thus, in many FT-IR spectroscopic studies on protein structure, H2O is substituted by 2H2O (D2O), which exhibits its deformation band at 1210 cm−1. Thus, the use of D2O instead of H2O as the solvent makes it possible to analyze spectral features in the secondary structure-sensitive amide I region without interference of bulk water. The interpretation and quantification of structural changes of RNase A during oxidation by hydrogen peroxide was carried out, comparing these data with infrared spectra for thermally unfolded protein. It is known that RNase A can be reversibly unfolded thermally, giving rise to a characteristic spectral unfolding pattern, particularly in the amide I region (29Reinstädler D. Fabian H. Backmann J. Naumann D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15822-15830Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Fabian H. Schultz C. Naumann D. Landt O Hahn U. Saenger W. J. Mol.

Mantsch H.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13651-13655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, FT-IR spectra were collected between 20 and 80 °C, applying two consecutive heating and cooling cycles with a linear temperature gradient of 0.5 K/min. The FT-IR spectrum of native RNase A is shown in Fig.2. This spectrum was recorded at a temperature of 30 °C after one heating and one cooling cycle (i.e. after complete thermal unfolding and refolding), which accelerates the exchange of the amide protons by deuterons (in the following, this procedure is called H/D exchange). Thedotted line in Fig. 2 A displays the absorbance spectrum corrected for the spectral contributions of the buffer, while the solid line represents the corresponding Fourier self-deconvolution spectrum (Fig. 2 A) to demonstrate the fine structure of the amide I band. A second derivative spectrum (Fig. 2 B) was also calculated from the absorbance spectrum (positive bands of an absorbance spectrum appear in second derivative spectra as negative bands). From the literature, it is known that the energy of the C=O oscillators of the protein backbone depends on the coupling to adjacent C=O oscillators and the strength of the hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the strength of these bonds and the symmetry of hydrogen bond patterns is characteristic for distinct secondary structure elements of proteins. It is therefore possible to distinguish various secondary structures from the experimentally observed band components of the amide I′ band. For"

Odontoblast-specific expression of TGF-β1 in the tooth continues throughout life; however, the precise biological functions of this growth factor in the odontoblasts are not clearly understood. Herein, we describe the generation of transgenic mice that overexpress active TGF-β1 predominantly in the odontoblasts. Teeth of these mice show a significant reduction in the tooth mineralization, defective dentin formation, and a relatively high branching of dentinal tubules. Dentin extracellular matrix components such as type I and III collagens are increased and deposited abnormally in the dental pulp, similar to the hereditary human tooth disorders such as dentin dysplasia and dentinogenesis imperfecta. Calcium, one of the crucial inorganic components of mineralization, is also apparently increased in the transgenic mouse teeth. Most importantly, the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (dspp), a candidate gene implicated in dentinogenesis imperfecta II (MIM 125420), is significantly down-regulated in the transgenic teeth. Our results provide in vivo evidence suggesting that TGF-β1 mediated expression ofdspp is crucial for dentin mineralization. These findings also provide for the first time a direct experimental evidence indicating that decreased dspp gene expression along with the other cellular changes in odontoblasts may result in human hereditary dental disorders like dentinogenesis imperfecta II (MIM 125420) and dentin dysplasia (MIM 125400 and 125420).

These molecules interact with each other to induce specific molecular and cellular changes leading to organogenesis. Interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme are particularly crucial during the initiation of development of key organs such as teeth, skin, hair, mammary gland, and prostate (1Thesleff I. Vaahtokari A. Partanen A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 35-50PubMed Google Scholar). Tooth development is initiated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the first branchial arch, and several transcription factors and growth factors are known to be expressed by dentin extracellular matrix (DECM)-producing1odontoblasts and enamel-producing ameloblasts during tooth development (2Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Begue-Kirn C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 51-68PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zeichner-David M . Diekwisch T. Fincham A. Lau E. MacDougall M. Mordian-Oldak J. Simmer J. Snead M. Slavkin H.C. Int.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a prototype of the TGF-β superfamily, is a multi-functional growth factor expressed in a wide variety of developing tissues from the early stages. The regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, embryonic development, and apoptosis by TGF-β1 is well established (6McCartney-Francis N.L. Frazier-Jessen M. Wahl S.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 553-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 8Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During mouse tooth development, TGF-β1 is expressed initially in the oral epithelium at embryonic day 13, and later its expression extends into the mesenchymal compartment and then gets restricted to the ectomesenchymal layer (odontoblasts). The odontoblast-restricted expression of TGF-β1 persists throughout life in the mice (9Vaahtokari A. Vainio S. Thesleff I. Development. 1991; 113: 985-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Odontoblasts produce DECM from embryonic day 16 and subsequently mineralize in an orderly manner. TGF-β1 has been shown earlier to have mitogenic effects in tooth explant cultures (10Sloan A.J. Smith A.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and to induce secretion of DECM components. Although it has been suggested that TGF-β1 plays a crucial role in dental tissue repair processes by the induction of reactionary (11Smith A.J. Cassidy N. Perry H. Begue-Kirn C. Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar) and reparative dentinogenesis (12Tziafas D. Papadimitriou S. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the precise in vivo functions associated with its continued expression are not clearly understood. Interestingly, subtle changes such as attrition and reduced mineralization of the teeth along with inflammation were observed in TGF-β1 knockout mice (13D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Dickinson D. Roberts A. Letterio J. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the maternal transfer of active TGF-β1, multi-focal inflammation, and neonatal lethality in these mice further complicate the clear understanding of the precise role of TGF-β1 in tooth development (14Kulkarni A.B. Huh C.G. Becker D. Geiser A. Lyght M. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Ward J.M. Karlsson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). To gain more insights into the specific in vivo roles of TGF-β1 during tooth development, we targeted the overexpression of active TGF-β1 to odontoblasts, starting from embryonic day 17 using the upstream regulatory sequences of the dentin sialophosphoprotein (dspp) gene (15Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These animals develop a novel phenotype that resembles hereditary dental disorders such as dentinogenesis imperfecta II (DGI; MIM 125420) and dentin dysplasia (MIM 125400 and 125420). We present here a detailed analysis of this phenotype and molecular mechanisms leading to this phenotype and discuss the role of TGF-β1 in dentinogenesis and the tooth disorders. The transgenic construct consisting of a 6-kilobase dspp upstream regulatory sequence (15Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol.

Mice were genotyped for the presence of the transgene by Southern analysis of the tail DNA using a SV40 poly(A) probe. The dspp-TGF-β1 transgenic (dTGF-β1) mouse lines varied in the copy number of integrated transgenes (data not shown). Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility and fed ad libitum with dough diet (Bio Serv, Holton Industries Co., Frenchtown, NJ). Transgenic and wild type mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the heads were dissected out and sliced sagittally into two symmetrical halves. The mineral density of teeth was analyzed by microradiographic technique using x-ray imaging with a standard setting of 120 s × 15KV (model MX20, Faxitron x-ray Corporation, Wheeling, IL). Images were scanned and quantified using a computerized National Institutes of Health image system. Whole jaws from the transgenic and wild type mice were dissected under a stereomicroscope and fixed in 10‥ buffered formalin overnight. The tissues were decalcified in EDTA-sodium phosphate buffer for 10–15 days, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax, and 5-micron-thick sections were cut and collected onto silanated microscope slides. Immunostainings for TGF-β1, Collagen (Col) I, II, and III were performed using antibodies at 1:400 dilution. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin and were photographed under light microscopy. Anti TGF-β1 antibody was a gift of Dr. Kathy Flanders (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Collagen I and III antisera were kindly provided by Dr. Larry Fisher (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). The incisors and molars were dissected out from wild type and transgenic mice, and total RNA was prepared using a RNA STAT-60TM kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1‥ formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with32P-labeled dspp probe (pSX1.7 Exon IV) (18D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner Res. 1997; 12: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were exposed to Kodak x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 24 h at −70 °C. Templates for antisense and sense riboprobes for dspp gene were generated by digesting pSX1.7 containing exon IV with SacI and XbaI, and anin vitro transcription assay was carried out to incorporate digoxigenin-11-dUTP with T7 and T3 RNA polymerases according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Frozen sections (15 microns) were cut, air dried, and fixed in 4‥ paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C. The sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.2 m HCl, 1 μg/ml proteinase K, 0.25‥ acetic anhydride in 0.1 mtriethanolamine buffer 5 min each with brief rinses in DEPC water in between the treatments. In situ hybridization and signal detection were carried out according to Roche Molecular Biochemicals nonradioactive In Situ Hybridization Application Manual. Slides were counter stained with hematoxylin and mounted with Crystal Mount (Biomedia, Foster City, CA) for photography. Five founder mice were generated from the microinjections of the dspp/TGF- β1 construct (Fig. 1 a) into fertilized FVB/N mouse eggs. All of the founders were established as independent lines based on independent integrations of the transgenic construct in the genome. Mouse tail DNA preparations were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, and the presence of the transgene was determined by Southern analysis using the whole transgene fragment as a probe. Copy number in each line was analyzed by using the endogenousdspp gene as an internal control. Transgenic mice were maintained as heterozygotes and mated with either wild type FVB/N or with the transgenic heterozygotes for further analysis. The lines were classified as low, medium, and high expressors, and these lines displayed a general correlation between the level of TGF-β1 expression and severity of the tooth phenotype (data not shown). One of the high expressor lines was further analyzed in detail. All the transgenic mouse lines displayed tooth-specific phenotypes with varying degrees of severity. The dTGF-β1 mice were born with no apparent defects and grew normally on the dough diet. However, from the age of 2 weeks, the dTGF-β1 mice displayed progressive discoloration of teeth (Fig. 1, b and c). Initially, both the mandibular and maxillary incisors of thedTGF-β1 mice appeared opaque, turned chalky white, and fractured, leaving behind stumps. The high resolution radiographic images of the incisors and molars of the dTGF-β1 mice exhibited remarkably reduced mineralization (Fig. 1, d ande). The quantitation of dTGF-β1 teeth by x-ray image analysis indicated a reduction of opacity by about 90‥ in the incisors (wild type, 145.5 ± 15.3 au (arbitrary units);dTGF-β1, 14.8 ± 4, au; n = 6,p < 0.001) and 62‥ in molars (wild type, 229.8 ± 16.2 au; dTGF-β1, 87.3 ± 15.7, n= 6; p < 0.001). In dTGF-β1 animals, the teeth displayed irregular dentin formation with a significant number of cellular inclusions (Fig.2, b, c,e, and f). Compared with the wild type (Fig. 2,a and d), the transgenic mice displayed a highly disorganized odontoblast layer and irregular dentinal tubules all along the dentinal layer (Fig. 2, b and c). The dentinal tubules were short in length and sparsely distributed (Fig. 2,c and f). Electron microscopic analysis of wild type mouse teeth showed normal dentin architecture with dentinal tubules coursing from the dentin-enamel junction in a parallel organization toward the dental pulp (Fig.3, a and c), whereas dTGF-β1 mouse incisors showed a thin layer of relatively normal mantle dentin and markedly abnormal dentin with reduced numbers of dentinal tubules (Fig. 3, b andd). The coronal area of the transgenic tooth pulp was obliterated with a disorganized dentin, similar to the structural abnormalities observed in the incisors.Figure 3Ultrastructural analysis ofd TGF -β1 mouse teeth.Ground sections of incisors from wild type (a andc) and dTGF-β1 (b and d) mice.

High levels of TGF-β1 were detected in the dentin matrix, around the odontoblasts and also in the dental pulp (Fig. 4 e). Transgenic TGF-β1 was also detected transiently in the ameloblasts similar to the endogenous dspp (data not shown). DECM components are among the most prominent molecules that are regulated by TGF-β1. Increased and abnormal accumulation of DECM was detected in the teeth of transgenic mice by Masson's trichrome staining (Fig. 4,b and f). Further, we examined the expression of collagens I and III in the dentin and the dental pulp by immunohistochemistry. Increased levels of collagens I and III were observed in the tooth pulp of dTGF-β1 mice (Fig. 4,g and h). However, in the dentin, the staining of collagen I appeared to be either unchanged or slightly reduced, whereas in the dental pulp the expression was increased (Fig. 4, cand g). The expression of collagen was not uniformly distributed in the dental pulp. Interestingly, the collagen III level was increased in both dentin and dental pulp (Fig. 4, d andh). It has been reported that the collagen III levels are elevated in osteogenesis imperfecta dentin and also in DGI dentin, suggesting the incomplete differentiation or maturation of the odontoblasts (19Sauk J.J. Gay R. Miller E.J. Gay S. J. Oral Pathol. 1980; 9: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The phenotypic characterization and histological analysis along with the radiographic profile of dTGF-β1 teeth suggested a defect in the mineralization. Therefore, we examined the calcium levels in the undemineralized ground sections from the wild type and transgenic mice teeth by von Kossa's staining (Fig.5 A). Uniform distribution of calcium was detected in the mineralized dentin and also in enamel of wild type mice (Fig. 5 A, panel a). Interestingly, in dTGF-β1 mouse teeth, the overall expression of calcium appeared to be elevated and unevenly distributed (Fig. 5 A,panel b). Because the dTGF-β1 tooth phenotype resembles dentin dysplasia and DGI, we examined the expression of the dspp gene that has been implicated in the etiology of the DGI II subtype (28Waltimo J. Ojanotko-Harri A. Lukinmaa P.-L. J. Oral. Pathol. Med. 1996; 25: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Northern analysis of tooth RNA using dspp exon-IV DNA as a probe revealed a significant reduction in the levels of dspp transcripts indTGF-β1 mice (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, we also examined the odontoblast specific expression of the dsppgene by in situ hybridization using the same dsppriboprobe. The expression of dspp mRNA was detected only in the odontoblasts of both incisors and molar teeth of the wild type mice (Fig. 5 C, panels a and c). The odontoblast specific expression of dspp gene (Fig.5 C, panels b and d) was significantly reduced in the transgenic mouse teeth, confirming the reduction seen in the Northern analysis. To analyze in vivo functions of the multi-functional growth factor TGF-β1 in tooth development, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing active TGF-β1 from embryonic day 17 in the teeth. We achieved the tissue-specific expression by driving the transgene with mouse dspp gene regulatory sequences, which were well characterized for the presence of tooth-specific expression in bothin vitro and in vivo model systems (16Sreenath T.L. Cho A. MacDougall M. Kulkarni A.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). The dTGF-β1 teeth displayed a gradual discoloration of teeth, finally resulting in an opalescent appearance. The teeth were worn progressively or fractured, leaving short stumps. These changes were associated with significantly decreased mineralization of teeth and abnormal dentin formation. Defective mineralization has been identified in human autosomal tooth disorders such as DGI (MIM 125490 and 125500), and dentin dysplasia (MIM 125400 and 125420). These disorders are generally characterized by discoloration and fractures of teeth associated with poor mineralization of DECM. Also, mutations in the Col1A1 and Col1A2 genes encoding collagen I that result in increased deposition and altered assembly of collagen fibers, major components of DECM, have been described for DGI-I associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (MIM 166240) (21Bonadio J. Ramirez F. Barr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2262-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pereira R. Khillan J.S. Helminen H.J. Hume E.L. Prockop D.J. J. Clin.

Mutat. 1996; 7: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although dspp regulatory sequences are odontoblast-specific, an intense staining for TGF-β1 was observed in dental pulp, indicating apparent secretion of this growth factor from odontoblasts into the pulp. In agreement with earlier reports on the inductive effects of TGF-β1 on differentiation of pulpal cells into odontoblasts (24Fan M.W. Bian Z. Gao Y.G. Chin. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 1: 17-21PubMed Google Scholar, 25Martin A. Unda F.J. Begue-Kirn C. Ruch J.V. Arechaga J. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and also on vasculogenesis (26Dickson M.C. Martin J.S. Cousins F.M. Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Akhurst R.J. Development. 1995; 121: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed an apparent increase in pulpal cell mass and also differentiation into odontoblast-like cells in dTGF-β1 teeth. In these transgenic mice, the dentinal tubules through which the DECM and other components are secreted to form dentin were disorganized and reduced in length as a result of improper polarization and alignment of odontoblasts (data not shown). This improper organization may impair the orderly secretion and deposition of collagenous and other molecules into the mineralization front. Increased vasculature in the pulp and around the odontoblasts was also observed in the mice (data not shown). However, unlike the wild type mice, the pulpal cells ofdTGF-β1 mice displayed patchy and ocular staining for collagen I and III, indicating the differentiation of dental pulp into odontoblast-like cells as a result of secreted TGF-β1 protein. Differentiation of dental pulp into collagen producing odontoblast-like cells has been suggested in in vitro and ex vivoculture systems by addition of exogenous growth factors, either alone or in combination, to understand the development of odontoblasts (10Sloan A.J. Smith A.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Increased levels of collagen I and III and their abnormal accumulation in the pulp seen in dspp/TGF-β1 transgenic mice are reminiscent of similar changes observed in dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin dysplasia (27Losco P.E. Toxicol. Pathol. 1995; 23: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Waltimo J. Ojanotko-Harri A. Lukinmaa P.-L. J. Oral. Pathol. Med. 1996; 25: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calcium, a major component of hydroxyapatite crystals in the teeth, was apparently elevated in the transgenic mice. The distribution in the dentin appeared to be patchy and reduced or absent in certain regions. In addition to the collagen trimers and calcium ions, inorganic phosphates are essential for proper mineralization of teeth. The growth and proper organization of hydroxyapatite crystal formation resulting from tri- or hexa-calcium phosphate provides the strength to the dentin. Hence, we examined the expression of DSPP, a highly phosphorylated tooth-specific phosphoprotein, in the teeth of these mice. Additionally, the dspp gene has been mapped to the DGI locus and is implicated as a potential candidate gene for DGI-II (20MacDougall M. Proc. Finn. Dent. Soc. 1992; 88: 195-208PubMed Google Scholar). The dspp gene product also has been demonstrated to function as a nucleator in hydroxyapatite crystal formation in dentin (29Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate for the first time a significant reduction in the levels of dspp mRNA in the presence of high levels of TGF-β1. In situ hybridization studies have confirmed the reduced expression of dsppmRNA in the odontoblasts of dTGF-β1 mouse teeth.dspp expression was undetectable in the odontoblast-like cells in the pulp canal of transgenic mice. This observation clearly indicates, despite the high levels of calcium and collagen I in the pulp canal in dTGF-β1 mouse teeth, that no mineralization in the dental pulp is detected. In addition to the dentin defects, the transgenic mice also displayed a defect in enamel mineralization. Because the main components essential for mineralization in the enamel are calcium and phosphates, the defect in the enamel mineralization may not be associated with the reduced expression of the dsppgene. Moreover, dspp expression has been shown to be transient during early stages of amelogenesis. Therefore, the transgenic TGF-β1 is expressed transiently, under the control ofdspp gene regulatory sequences in ameloblasts during early dentinogenesis, and hence, we speculate the involvement of regulatory molecules other than dspp, in the enamel mineralization. Most importantly, our studies clearly provide direct experimental evidence, suggesting that the reduction in the dssp gene expression is associated with the tooth phenotype similar to human hereditary conditions such as DGI. However, the direct correlation between either a mutation or decreased expression of thedspp gene in DGI disorders needs to be investigated. Interestingly, our preliminary studies on the double transgenic mice (dTGF-β1X dspp-LacZ generated by crossingdTGF-β1 mice with dspp-LacZ mice (16Sreenath T.L. Cho A. MacDougall M. Kulkarni A.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar)) indicate down-regulation of the LacZ expression suggesting the increased levels of TGF-β1 negatively regulate the dspp promoter activity. 2T. Sreenath, T. Thyagarajan, and A. B. Kulkarni, unpublished data. However, indTGF-β1 mice there is a clear overexpression of TGF-β1 in teeth presumably because of multiple copies of the transgene encoding active TGF-β1. The increased level of TGF-β1 in teeth is likely to accelerate its signaling cascade resulting in decreaseddspp gene expression, which may result in DGI and dentin dysplasia. A detailed examination of the downstream TGF-β1 signaling pathway will be important in identifying the molecular events underlying these dental disorders. We thank Drs. Henning Birkedal -Hansen, John Letterio, Anita Roberts, Larry Wahl, Yoshi Yamada, and Mary Jo Danton for critical reading of the manuscript."

Here, we examined mechanisms mediating this effect of insulin.

Studies with Gal4 fusion proteins reveal that insulin and PKB suppress transactivation by the major activation domain in C/EBPβ (AD II), located between amino acids 31 and 83. Studies with E1A protein indicate that interaction with p300/CBP is required for transactivation by AD II and the effect of insulin and PKB. Based on a consensus sequence, we identified a PKB phosphorylation site (Ser1834) within the region of p300/CBP known to bind C/EBPβ.

We have reported that a nucleoprotein complex containing C/EBPβ interacts with oligonucleotide probes containing insulin response sequences (IRSs) from the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and PEPCK genes (11Ghosh A.K.

This complex interacts with the IRS in a sequence-specific fashion that correlates with the ability of the IRS to mediate effects of insulin on promoter activity, and replacing the IRS with a consensus C/EBP-binding site in reporter gene constructs maintains the effect of insulin (11Ghosh A.K.

Together, these results suggest that signaling to C/EBP proteins may contribute to the effects of insulin on gene expression via an IRS. Based on these observations, we examined specific mechanisms by which insulin may suppress promoter activity via C/EBP proteins. Previous studies have shown that insulin inhibits basal activity of the IGFBP-1 promoter via an IRS, and that this effect of insulin is mediated by protein kinase B (PKB) downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (12Cichy S.B.

Since a nucleoprotein complex containing C/EBPβ interacts with IRSs in the IGFBP-1 and PEPCK genes, we considered the possibility that C/EBP proteins also might contribute to the ability of insulin to regulate promoter activity downstream from PI 3-kinase and PKB.

The region coding for amino acids 1752–1859 region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with one primer which contains an XhoI site (5′-CAGCTCGAGACCATGGGGATCCTCAATTGCTCACTGCCATCCTGC-3′) and a second primer (5′-GGCTCTAGACTAAGTTGGTGTCGTTGGAGTGGCAGGAG-3′) which contains a stop codon and an XbaI site. This fragment was cloned into the XhoI/XbaI site in pAlter.Max vector (Promega) and single stranded DNA was prepared with helper phage for site-directed mutagenesis. A BamHI site was introduced at the 5′ end of this fragment and Ser1834 was replaced with alanine or aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotides: p300.BamHI, 5′-P-CAGCGGCGGCGGGGATCCCCGGCGGGTGCTGC-3′; S1834A, 5′-P-CACACCAGTCCGCTGCATGGCGGCCATCCTCCTGCGAAG-3′; S1834D, 5′-P-CACACCAGTCCGCTGCATGTCGGCCATCCTCCTGCGAAG- 3′. The sequences of the polymerase chain reaction product and its mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing in the University of Illinois at Chicago DNA Sequencing Center. BamHI-XbaI fragments coding for amino acids 1752–1859 of p300 with/without mutation of Ser1834 were subcloned in-frame with the VP16 activation domain in the pVP16 eukaryotic expression vector (CLONTECH). A copy of the SV40 nuclear localization signal has been introduced in-frame with the VP16 activation domain in this vector by the manufacturer to ensure that expressed proteins are transported to the nucleus. Using aNotI site in the pAlter polylinker,BamHI-NotI fragments also were excised and cloned in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX4T-3 vectors were introduced into pBL21RIL bacteria (Stratagene) and fusion proteins were induced at 30 °C with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. For kinase studies with synthetic peptides, a peptide containing residues 1826–1842 of p300 (QMLRRRMASMQRTGVVG) was synthesized, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy at the UIC Protein Synthesis Center. A peptide (RPRAATF) derived from a known PKB phosphorylation site in glycogen-synthase kinase-3 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. HepG2 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged Myr-PKB and Myr-Lys179-PKB, and tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Calbiochem) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as before (12Cichy S.B.

Beads were washed and then incubated with target peptides for 10 min at 30 °C with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using buffers and peptide inhibitors of PKA and calcium-dependent kinase provided with the Akt kinase kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Kinase reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and phosphorylation was measured by scintillation counting after spotting onto p81 phosphocellulose discs and washing with phosphoric acid, as before (12Cichy S.B.

For phosphorylation studies with GST-p300 fusion proteins, bacterial lysates containing ∼3 μg of fusion protein were incubated with 25 μl of a 50% slurry of washed glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Washed beads were equilibrated with 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.25 units of active PKBα, provided by Dr. P. Cohen. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated at 30 °C by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated 20 min later by addition of 5 × Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 100 °C. Samples were cleared by centrifugation and loaded for 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, then dried and phosphoproteins identified by autoradiography at −70 °C with enhancing screens. HepG2 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected in triplicate with calcium phosphate precipitates containing reporter gene and expression vectors together with appropriate amounts of empty vector, as previously reported (12Cichy S.B.

Cells were refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1 g/liter fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with/without 100 nmrecombinant human insulin (Sigma) and/or 50 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem) or 200 nm rapamycin (Sigma) 18 h prior to the preparation of lysates and analysis of luciferase activity (12Cichy S.B.

Insulin inhibits promoter activity in luciferase reporter gene constructs containing an IRS (CAAAACA; ΔIRS.1) or when the IRS is replaced by a consensus binding site for C/EBP proteins (TTGCGCAA; ΔC/EBP), but not when the IRS is replaced by an unrelated sequence (ΔIRS.1M) (Fig. 1). This indicates that the ability of insulin to suppress promoter activity is sequence-specific and can be mediated by either an IRS or C/EBP site. Previous studies have shown that the ability of insulin to inhibit promoter activity via an IRS is mediated through the PI 3-kinase/PKB signaling pathway (12Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and we asked whether signaling to C/EBP proteins also might occur through this pathway. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, or coexpression of a dominant negative form of PI 3-kinase (Δp85) blocks the ability of insulin to suppress promoter activity via either an IRS or C/EBP-binding site (Fig. 1), indicating that this effect of insulin also is PI 3-kinase-dependent. Treatment with rapamycin, which blocks the activation of p70S6 kinase downstream from PI 3-kinase, does not disrupt the ability of insulin to inhibit promoter activity. Coexpression of a kinase-deficient form of PKB (Lys179-PKB), which blocks the activation of PKB in HepG2 cells (12Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), disrupts the ability of insulin to inhibit promoter activity. Expression of constitutively active PKB (Myr-PKB) inhibits promoter activity of reporter gene constructs containing either an IRS (ΔIRS.1) or a C/EBP-binding site (ΔC/EBP), but not an unrelated sequence (ΔIRS.1M), mimicking the effect of insulin. Together, these results indicate that signaling via PKB can mediate effects of insulin on promoter activity via either an IRS or C/EBP-binding site. To determine whether endogenous C/EBP proteins are required for the ability of insulin to inhibit promoter activity via a C/EBP-binding site, we performed coexpression studies with CHOP. CHOP, a C/EBP family member which contains a leucine zipper dimerization domain but no functional DNA-binding domain, disrupts the ability of endogenous C/EBP proteins to form hetero- or homodimers that are capable of binding to canonical C/EBP sites (11Ghosh A.K. Lacson R. Liu P. Cichy S.B. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 8507-8515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). In contrast, CHOP does not prevent C/EBPβ from interacting with other nuclear proteins and forming a complex with an IRS (11Ghosh A.K. Lacson R. Liu P. Cichy S.B. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 8507-8515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, overexpression of CHOP blocks the ability of insulin and Myr-PKB to inhibit promoter activity via a C/EBP-binding site in the ΔC/EBP construct (solid bars). This effect of CHOP is specific, since CHOP does not disrupt other effects of insulin and Myr-PKB in these cells, including the ability to suppress promoter function via an IRS in the ΔIRS.1 construct (open bars). CHOP-LZ−, which is missing the leucine zipper dimerization domain, does not block the ability of insulin and Myr-PKB to suppress promoter function via a C/EBP-binding site, indicating that this effect of CHOP is mediated through interaction with endogenous proteins via its leucine zipper domain. Together, these results indicate that interaction with hetero- or homodimers of C/EBP proteins is necessary for the ability of insulin and PKB to suppress promoter activity via this C/EBP-binding site. To determine whether insulin and PKB suppress promoter activity when specific C/EBP proteins occupy this C/EBP-binding site, we performed co-transfection studies with expression vectors for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ. As shown in the left panel of Fig.3 A, C/EBPα and full-length C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ1–276) effectively stimulate promoter activity in the ΔC/EBP construct. This effect is disrupted when the C/EBP site is replaced by an unrelated sequence (ΔIRS.1M), indicating that it is mediated through the C/EBP site. Truncated C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ132–276), which is missing two N-terminal transactivation domains, is less effective in stimulating promoter activity and this residual effect is not disrupted when the C/EBP-binding site is replaced by an unrelated sequence (ΔIRS.1M). These results confirm that C/EBPα and full-length C/EBPβ stimulate promoter activity via the C/EBP-binding site and that N-terminal activation domains are required for sequence-specific transactivation by C/EBPβ. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3 A, coexpression of C/EBPα disrupts the ability of insulin and PKB to suppress promoter activity in the ΔC/EBP construct. In contrast, insulin and PKB suppress the ability of full-length C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ1–276) to stimulate promoter activity. This effect of insulin and PKB is disrupted when the N-terminal region of C/EBPβ is deleted (C/EBPβ132–276). These results indicate that insulin and PKB suppress transactivation by C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα, and that the N-terminal region of C/EBPβ is required for this effect. We performed similar studies using a reporter gene construct where an array of 4 naturally occurring C/EBP-binding sites has been placed immediately upstream of the minimal albumin promoter (pAlb[DEI]4). In contrast to the ΔC/EBP construct, insulin modestly stimulates basal activity of the pAlb(DEI)4 promoter, possibly reflecting effects which are mediated via other transcription factors that can interact with this naturally occurring C/EBP-binding site or with other parts of this construct. As shown in Fig. 3 B, overexpression of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ stimulates the activity of this artificial promoter construct and truncated C/EBPβ is less effective. Insulin and PKB suppress the ability of C/EBPβ to stimulate the activity of this artificial construct. In contrast, neither C/EBPα nor truncated C/EBPβ confers this effect of insulin and PKB, confirming that insulin and PKB suppress transactivation by C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα, and that the N-terminal region of C/EBPβ is required for this effect. We next examined which regions of C/EBPβ are involved in mediating the effect of insulin and PKB on transactivation. For these experiments, we expressed fusion proteins containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (which contains its own nuclear localization signal) in-frame with portions of C/EBPβ, or the activation domain of VP16 as a control. Transactivation was measured using the pG5e1b luciferase reporter gene construct, which contains 5 Gal4-binding sites immediately 5′ to the e1b minimal promoter and has negligible basal activity in HepG2 cells. Fig. 4 A indicates the location of the leucine zipper dimerization domain (LZ), DNA-binding domain, and the two N-terminal transactivation domains previously identified in C/EBPβ (AD I and II) (32Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the Gal 4 fusion protein containing full-length C/EBPβ stimulates the pG5e1b promoter. Transactivation is enhanced when the C-terminal region containing the leucine zipper and DNA-binding domain is removed from C/EBPβ (Gal4.β1–132), and transactivation is increased still further when an additional 39 amino acids are removed (Gal4.β1–83), consistent with previous studies (32Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of C/EBPβ contains two activation domains, which are located between amino acids 1–31 (AD I) and 31–83 (AD II). The Gal4.β31–83 fusion protein is more potent in stimulating promoter activity than the Gal4.β1–31 protein, consistent with previous studies indicating that the major activation domain in C/EBPβ is located between amino acids 31 and 83 (32). As shown in Fig. 4 C, insulin and PKB suppress transactivation by Gal4.β1–276 but not Gal4.VP16, indicating that this effect of insulin and PKB is specific. Insulin and PKB also suppress transactivation by Gal4.β1–132 and Gal4.β1–83, indicating that regions outside the N-terminal transactivation domains of C/EBPβ are not required for this effect of insulin and PKB. Insulin and PKB suppress transactivation by Gal4.β31–83 (AD II) but do not suppress transactivation by Gal4.β1–31 (AD I), indicating that this effect is specific for ADII. Previous studies have shown that p300/CBP coactivator proteins interact directly with the N-terminal region of C/EBPβ (17Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in theleft panel of Fig.5 A, coexpression of E1A, an adenovirus protein that binds and sequesters p300/CBP, disrupts transactivation by the Gal4.β1–132 fusion protein in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, coexpression of ΔE1A, which does not interact with p300/CBP but still binds retinoblastoma protein and related proteins (33Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Devoto S.H. Kraus V.B. Moran E.

Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 161-195PubMed Google Scholar), does not suppress transactivation by the Gal4.β1–132 fusion protein but actually enhances this effect. Together, these results indicate that interaction with p300/CBP is critical for transactivation by this region of C/EBPβ, and that other cellular proteins that can interact with ΔE1A may repress this function, similar to results obtained with other transcription factors (39Pouponnot C.

As shown in the right panel of Fig. 5 A, coexpression of E1A (but not ΔE1A) also disrupts the ability of insulin and PKB to suppress transactivation by the Gal4.β1–132 fusion protein.

Although several linear tetrapyrrolic Chl catabolites were isolated during the last decade from green algae and higher plants, the metabolic pathway of tremendous amounts of the Chls is still under question. What products follow after the familiar formybilinones? What are the ultimate products of Chl degradation? Degradation of the Chls occurs in light as well as in darkness. During senescence cellular components are hydrolyzed and metabolized; liberated rare elements such as [N], [P], [S] and metal ions are relocated (1Stahl E. Stahl E.

This information triggered research activities in several disciplines to elucidate the apparently unique catabolic pathway of the Chls in the green plant lineage.

Chl breakdown has long been considered as a detoxification process in which photodynamic active Chls convert to colorless tetrapyrrolic products, all of them carry a characteristic formyl group (Fig. 1). Those products were regarded as the final products of Chl breakdown in senescent plants, which apparently do not cause further cleavage into smaller fragments (6Kräutler B. Matile P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 35-43Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This work focuses on the isolation and determination of the constitution of a new type of chlorophyll catabolite by spectroscopic methods and discusses the origin and relevance in the catabolic pathway of the chlorophylls in plants. Chemicals were reagent grade; all solvents were distilled before use. HPLC solvents were supplied from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). HPLC columns and Nucleosil 100-7 C8 VP 250/10 were from Macherey-Nagel (Oensingen, Switzerland), and MPLC columns Lobar® LiChroprep® RP-18 (40–63 μm) were purchased from Merk (Darmstadt, Germany). 35cc Sep-Pack® Vac C-18, 10 g, were provided from Waters (Milford, MA). Homo- and heteromagnetic resonance experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance DRX-500 spectrometer operating at the frequencies of 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.75 MHz for 13C. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts/million downfield from the solvent used and coupling constants (J) in Hertz (Hz). Mass spectra were obtained with a Bruker FTMS 4.7T BioAPEXII, using electrospray ionization technique in the positive mode. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 40 spectrometer, λmax (log ε) in nanometers. CD spectra were measured on a Jobin-Yvon Auto Dichograph Mark V, Δε [l mol−1 cm−1]. Barley seeds (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Lambic) were a gift from Florimond Desprez. The seeds were germinated in high density (5 seeds/cm2) in moist garden soil and grown under natural light conditions. The primary leaves were harvested when they reached about 10–15 cm in height. The greening and de-greening procedure of barley leaves was essentially as described previously (17Folly P. Engel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21811-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 150 g of de-greened yellow leaves of H. vulgare (fresh weight) were homogenized in a blender with 300 ml of a solution consisting of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (KP) buffer, pH 6.8:acetone:MeOH (1:1:1). Work-up was essentially as described previously (17Folly P. Engel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21811-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the aqueous phase were injected into a Lobar®LiChroprep® RP-18 (40–63 μm) column and eluted (4 bar, 22 ml/min) with a solution of 30 volume % MeOH in 0.01 mKP buffer, pH 6.8. Two fractions positive in the chromic acid degradation assay were sampled. MeOH was evaporated in vacuo. The polar fraction contained both urobinlinogens, the less polar fraction contained formylbilinone 5. The resulting aqueous phases were again concentrated on a 35cc Sep-Pack®RP-18 cartridge. Separation and purification of the urobinlinogens were achieved on a HPLC Nucleosil 100–7 C8 VP 250/10 column eluted isochratically (flow rate: 5 ml/min) with a solution of MeOH in 0.01m KP buffer, pH 6.8 (13 volume %). The fractions with a retention time of 13 min and of 14 min, respectively (DAD-UV detection at 250 nm) were collected at 0 °C and stored under argon. After removal of the volatile solvent in vacuo, each product was de-salted on a 35cc Sep-Pack® C-18 cartridge by first washing with 200 ml of distilled water and afterward eluted with aqueous acetone (50 ml of 50 volume %). The gross solvent was eliminated in vacuo, and the remaining aqueous solution was lyophilized giving 15 mg and 10 mg, respectively, of a slightly yellow powder. A triad of tetrapyrrolic compounds was isolated by HPLC from yellow cotyledons of barley. After chemical degradation all showed on TLC plates the same characteristic maleimide fragments, namely 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl maleimide, 3-(2,3-dihydroxyethyl)-4-methyl maleimide and hematinic acid imide (cf. Ref.17Folly P. Engel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21811-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The less polar compound isolated in about 7 mg was spectroscopically identical in all aspects with catabolite 5 (Fig.1) previously isolated from H. vulgare cv. Gerbel (4Kräutler B. Jaun B. Bortlik K. Schellenberg M. Matile P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1315-1318Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The second product, which was isolated in about 15 mg, was spectroscopically analyzed. Mass spectrometric analysis at high resolution showed two molecular ions at m/z705.2530 atomic mass units (100%) and m/z 743.2093 atomic mass units (10%). This corresponds exactly with a molecular ion [C34H41KN4O10 + H]+ (calculated: 705.2532; error: 2.5 × 10−4) and [C34H41KN4O10 + K]+ (calculated: 743.2091; error: 1.8 × 10−4), respectively, establishing the bulk molecular formula to be C34H41KN4O10. Details on the constitution of this metabolite were deduced from the analysis of the one-dimensional and two-dimensional {1H,13C}-homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The compound when dissolved in D2O shows 33 carbon-bound hydrogen atoms and 33 carbon atoms. Seven protons are bound to hetero-atoms, which rapidly exchange for solvent. Attached proton test spectra show 5 primary, 7 secondary, 4 tertiary, and 17 quaternary carbon atoms. All protons resonate largely as isolated systems and are well resolved, except the signal group at about δH 2.7 (Ha(5) and Ha(15)) and δH 3.6 (H2(32) and Hb(182)) in which two and three protons overlap, respectively (TableI). Four separated methyl groups resonance at high field δH 1.45 H3(21), δH 1.82 H3(131), δH 1.91 H3(171), and δH 1.97 H3(71). The fifth methyl group, which absorbs at δH 3.69 H3(85), is assigned to a methyl ester group, because of its chemical shift, line sharpness, and intensity. The highest resonance frequency was observed at δH 4.74 H(10); this excludes the presence of an aldehyde group. Two-dimensional {1H,1H}- and {1H,13C}-correlation spectra show the presence of two ethylene groups and three AMX systems, the X portions of which have resonances at δH 4.16 H(16), δH4.32 H(4), and δH 4.44 H(181), respectively. At δC 35.35 a weak CH cross-peak was found in the {1H,13C}-correlation spectrum with the H(10) at δH 4.74 ppm.Table I1H and 13C NMR signals of the major catabolite8; connectivities through space were assigned by1H{1H} NOE difference experimentsAtomδC(D2O)δH(D2O)NOE effects% EnhancementAssignement in formula 8 (Fig. 3)1175.892129.37217.161.54 s3154.673128.742.4 ddd (14.2/5.65/5.48) HaHb(31)1-aTriplet., H2(32)bDoublet.3, 2.8a, b2.64 ddd (14.2/6.59/7.13) Hb3259.403.56–3.66 m458.484.32 dd (4.76/4.75)526.992.68–2.74 dd (15.19/4.75) Ha3.01 dd (15.19/4.76) HbH(4), Ha(5), H3(71)1.7, 1.6, 1.6c, d, e6132.737112.31718.281.97 sHb(5)Smalle8123.9281191.778283171.278552.703.69 s9160.191035.354.74 pseudo sH2(121)3.1f11122.4412119.0612120.082.45–2.50 mH2(122), H3(131)Small, 0.3cSharp.h, i12238.612.1–2.2 m123181.9813114.501317.951.82 s14122.591526.992.68–2.74 dd (15.00/4.76) Ha2.85 dd (15.00/4.58) HbHa(15), H(16)Small, 1.6m, n1660.544.16 dd (4.58/4.76)Ha(15), Hb(15)1.3, 0.8l, n17159.7517111.461.91 sH(181)0.13cSharp.o18128.3618166.244.44 dd (4.59/4.39)H3(171), Ha(182), Hb(182)Small, 1, 0.9o, p, q18263.223.34 dd (11.73/4.59) HaHb(182), H(181)8.9, 4r, p3.56–3.66 m Hb19173.96a Triplet.b Doublet.c Sharp. Open table in a new tab Although the proton part of the spectra of the compound when measured in Me2SO-d6 as solvent showed considerable lower resolution, the missing proton became clearly visible at δH 3.88 H(82). This proton couples with a frequency of 3.35 Hz with a proton at δH4.65 H(10). The {1H,13C}-correlation spectrum showed in addition a cross-peak indicating a tertiary carbon atom at δC 65.44 C(82), which correlates with the H(82) proton at δH 3.88. This indicates that this carbon-bound proton is in dynamic equilibrium (keto-enol) and rapid exchange with deuterium from the solvent D2O. This “blind spot” has been previously observed when the plant catabolite5 was measured in D2O (20Kräutler B. Jaun B. Amrein W. Bortlik K. Schellenberg M. Matile P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 333-346Google Scholar). In the COSY spectrum (Fig. 2), particularly the appearance of six cross-peaks caused by long range couplings of the four methyl groups facilitated the constitutional assignment. Together with the information gathered from the heteronuclearcorrellation (HETCOR) spectrum, they provided the reference and indicated the starting points of the specific side chains and the bridging network for each of the two dipyrrylmethanone units. Nuclear Overhauser effect experiments corroborated the assignment of the fragments and showed, in addition, that both units are interconnected (Fig. 3 and Table I). Thus, when the proton at δH 4.74 H(10) was irradiated the signal group at δH 2.45–2.50 H2(121) was enhanced. When the latter signal was irradiated a methyl group H3(132) and a methylene group H2(122) responded through space. The overall bonding network and chemical shift assignments of the quaternary carbon atoms were deduced from correlation spectroscopy via long-range coupling (COLOC) spectra. The relaxation times used for the evolution of the long range couplings were equivalent to 1H,13C coupling constants of 5, 10, and 20 Hz, respectively. Although two quaternary carbon atoms at δC 191.77 and δC 160.19 showed no correlation, the former value was assigned for chemical shift reasoning to the carbonyl group C(81) and the latter consequently to the remaining aromatic carbon atom C(9). Thus, chemical degradation, mass, nuclear magnetic resonance, and UV spectra are consistent for the constitution of a potassium 31,181,182-trihydroxy-85-methyl-8 1-oxo-82,10-cyclourobilinogen (8) shown in Fig. 4. The third tetrapyrrole was isolated in about 10 mg and showed in the mass spectrometer a molecular mass ion at m/z 705.2534 atomic mass units (100%), indicating the presence of a configurational isomer of the former. 1H,13C NMR spectroscopic investigation corroborates a diastereomeric relationship. A 1:1 mixture of both diastereomers shows in 1H NMR only slight differences in chemical shifts. Two methyl groups (21) and (171) are shifted relative δ 0.079 ppm to lower field and δ 0.0134 ppm to higher field, respectively, the rest of the spectrum remains nearly identical. The CD spectrum shows that this compound too is optically active and that both diastereomers are chiroptically almost indistinguishable (Fig. 5). The new catabolites isolated from yellow cotyledons of barley are colorless, nonfluorescent, and optically active. The constitution resembles Urobilinogen IXα, a common metabolite of heme catabolism in warm-blooded organisms. The similarities in the peripheral substitution pattern of both catabolites indicate that the new catabolite derives from catabolite 5 by an oxidative process. The configurations of the five asymmetric centers cannot be deduced from the spectroscopic data. Suitable crystals are not available yet. Only one stereocenter at C(82) has its origin from the Chls, but due to the β-keto ester functional group, it is prone to epimerization. When measured in Me2SO-d6, a coupling of only 3.35 Hz between H(10) and H(82) indicates anticonfiguration. As found previously, proton H(15) in formula 5 arrives from the protic solvent during acid-catalyzed pyrroline/pyrrole rearrangement of both geometric isomers of the red chlorophyll catabolite from C. protothecoides (11Engel N. Curty C. Gossauer A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 77-83Google Scholar, 16Curty C. Chlorophyll Catabolism in Plants: Chlorella protothecoides and Cercidiphyllum . Ph.D. thesis No. 1143. University Fribourg, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). Intensive mechanistic-chemical studies showed a remarkable high stereoselectivity for this rearrangement. Because of the stereochemical consequence of these experiments, this position was tentatively assigned an R configuration. The proton at this position is highly resistant, even in boiling acetic acid-d1 it does not exchange (11Engel N. Curty C. Gossauer A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 77-83Google Scholar,16Curty C. Chlorophyll Catabolism in Plants: Chlorella protothecoides and Cercidiphyllum . Ph.D. thesis No. 1143. University Fribourg, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). It is most likely that both diastereomers arise from the uniformly configured 5 previously isolated from barley leaves by a consecutive oxidative process. Chemically, the cleavage of the formyl group of the main red chlorophyll catabolite from C. protothecoides (3) was achieved using H2O2/pyridine at 70 °C. Both possible C(4) diastereomers of the corresponding biliverdine were obtained from this reaction in a yield of 48% (16Curty C. Chlorophyll Catabolism in Plants: Chlorella protothecoides and Cercidiphyllum . Ph.D. thesis No. 1143. University Fribourg, Switzerland1996Google Scholar) and in a relation of 1:1. A comparable enzymatic formyl cleavage can be envisioned, for example, through a Baeyer-Villiger reaction with subsequent hydrolysis of the formiate ester group or through an oxidative decarboxylation mechanism. Nevertheless, the terminal protonation at C(4) is irreversible (vide infra) under those conditions (Fig. 4). Both diastereomers are observed in a relation of 1:0.6 as determined by HPLC. This indicates that this protonation most likely is nonenzymatically. Instead, the relation reflects the different rate constants of protonation of both diastereotopic faces of the double bond C(3)=C(4) in 9. That the catabolite 8 is produced in the leaf tissue of barley and not during the work-up procedure was demonstrated by an experiment in which the whole work-up procedure, including cell opening and HPLC separation, was performed in the presence of heavy water (30 atom % D). 1H and 2H NMR experiments showed that all carbon bond hydrogen atoms remained unlabeled; exchange occurred, as expected, only at position C(82). Moreover, a mirror experiment in which the leaves were bleached in the presence of heavy water (80 atom % D) showed by 2H NMR that a deuterium atom resides in position C(4) of compound 8 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the catabolite is formed entirely in the plant cell and not during the work-up procedure and further that H(4) is tautomerizationally stable under those conditions. Skeletal transformation between the two valence tautomers of urobilin/bilirhodin was reported to be reversible only under basic conditions (21Gossauer A. Plieninger H. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 6. Academic Press, New York1979: 625-627Google Scholar). From the Chlorophyte Bryopsis maxima a red, water-soluble tetrapyrrole was isolated (22Okada M. Ohtomi M. Nakayama K. Sakamoto Y. Satoh H. Konagaya M. Yoshizaki M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1435-1441Google Scholar), and a portion of structural information was published (23Miyake K. Ohtomi M. Yoshizawa H. Sakamoto Y. Nakayama K. Okada M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 109-113Google Scholar). The proposed constitution, a biliviolin, lacks the formyl group too and contains a phytol group and a sugar moiety. Nevertheless, the UV-visible spectrum is in disagreement with the constitution, which remains to be determined. In Cercidiphyllum japonicum almost quantitative amounts of the chls were isolated as catabolite 6 (8Curty C. Engel N. Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 1531-1536Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas in this work only about 20% of the tetrapyrrolic catabolites were recovered. As charged from a screening test of several autumnal plants using the chromic acid degradation method, (tetra)pyrroles are not always present. This raises the questions whether urobilinogenoids are peculiar or common intermediates in the catabolic pathway of the chls and whether they are finally degraded in the plant cell to nonpyrrolic, nitrogen-less compounds. Most recently, several maleimides were isolated from senescent cotyledones of barley (24Suzuki Y. Shioi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 909-915Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that phototrophic organisms are capable to degrade chls to maleimides derivatives (possibly via urobilnogenoids), a pathway that has already been discussed by Hendry et al. (25Hendry G.A.F. Houghton J.D. Brown S.B. New Phytol. 1987; 107: 255-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Maleimides still contain the nitrogen atoms of the former Chls. Can this nitrogen be re-utilized by the plant? This adaptation would certainly be of evolutionary advantage for plants, which grow in environments in which nitrogen is in high demand. Nevertheless, the ultimate fate of the Chls is still a matter of speculation. We appreciate the professional knowledge of F. Nydegger and F. Fehr to obtain optimal mass and NMR spectra. We are indebted to Florimond Desprez, Cappelle en Pévèle F-59242, for providing us with H. vulgare cv. Lambic."
https://openalex.org/W1983752881,"3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) from the hyperthermophilic bacteriumAquifex aeolicus differs from its Escherichia coli counterpart in the requirement of a divalent metal for activity (Duewel, H. S., and Woodard, R. W. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 22824–22831). Here we report the crystal structure of the A. aeolicus enzyme, which was determined by molecular replacement using E. coli KDO8PS as a model. The structures of the metal-free and Cd2+ forms of the enzyme were determined in the uncomplexed state and in complex with various combinations of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P), and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P). Like the E. coli enzyme, A. aeolicus KDO8PS is a homotetramer containing four distinct active sites at the interface between subunits. The active site cavity is open in the substrate-free enzyme or when either A5P alone or PEP alone binds, and becomes isolated from the aqueous phase when both PEP and A5P (or E4P) bind together. In the presence of metal, the enzyme is asymmetric and appears to alternate catalysis between the active sites located on one face of the tetramer and those located on the other face. In the absence of metal, the asymmetry is lost. Details of the active site that may be important for catalysis are visible at the high resolution achieved in these structures. Most notably, the shape of the PEP-binding pocket forces PEP to assume a distorted geometry at C-2, which might anticipate the conversion from sp 2 tosp 3 hybridization occurring during intermediate formation and which may modulate PEP reactivity toward A5P. Two water molecules are located in van der Waals contact with the siand re sides of C-2PEP, respectively. Abstraction of a proton from either of these water molecules by a protein group is expected to elicit a nucleophilic attack of the resulting hydroxide ion on the nearby C-2PEP, thus triggering the beginning of the catalytic cycle. 1FWN1FWS1FWT1FWW1FXP1FXQ1FX61FY6 3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) from the hyperthermophilic bacteriumAquifex aeolicus differs from its Escherichia coli counterpart in the requirement of a divalent metal for activity (Duewel, H. S., and Woodard, R. W. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 22824–22831). Here we report the crystal structure of the A. aeolicus enzyme, which was determined by molecular replacement using E. coli KDO8PS as a model. The structures of the metal-free and Cd2+ forms of the enzyme were determined in the uncomplexed state and in complex with various combinations of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P), and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P). Like the E. coli enzyme, A. aeolicus KDO8PS is a homotetramer containing four distinct active sites at the interface between subunits. The active site cavity is open in the substrate-free enzyme or when either A5P alone or PEP alone binds, and becomes isolated from the aqueous phase when both PEP and A5P (or E4P) bind together. In the presence of metal, the enzyme is asymmetric and appears to alternate catalysis between the active sites located on one face of the tetramer and those located on the other face. In the absence of metal, the asymmetry is lost. Details of the active site that may be important for catalysis are visible at the high resolution achieved in these structures. Most notably, the shape of the PEP-binding pocket forces PEP to assume a distorted geometry at C-2, which might anticipate the conversion from sp 2 tosp 3 hybridization occurring during intermediate formation and which may modulate PEP reactivity toward A5P. Two water molecules are located in van der Waals contact with the siand re sides of C-2PEP, respectively. Abstraction of a proton from either of these water molecules by a protein group is expected to elicit a nucleophilic attack of the resulting hydroxide ion on the nearby C-2PEP, thus triggering the beginning of the catalytic cycle. 1FWN1FWS1FWT1FWW1FXP1FXQ1FX61FY6 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate arabinose 5-phosphate erythrose 4-phosphate 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase loop 3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS1; phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyoctonate aldolase, EC 4.1.2.16) catalyzes the aldol-type condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to form KDO8P and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 1) (1Levin D.H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2532-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is the first step in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate, an essential component of the lipopolysaccharide of all Gram-negative bacteria (2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). A reaction very similar to KDO8P synthesis is the formation of 3-deoxy- d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) from erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) and PEP catalyzed by DAH7P synthase (DAH7PS; phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase, EC4.1.2.15), which constitutes the first step of the shikimate pathway (3De Leo A.B. Sprinson D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have established that KDO8PS and DAH7PS share several mechanistic characteristics. For example, in both enzymes, the condensation step of the reaction is stereospecific, involving the addition of the si face of C-3PEP to there face of the A5P/E4P carbonyl (4Kohen A. Berkovich R. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1577-1582Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol.

In particular, KDO8PS and DAH7PS are two of only four known PEP-utilizing enzymes in which phosphate release from PEP occurs by cleavage of the C–O rather than the P–O bond (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyltransferase (MurA) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase represent the other two members of this group). As a consequence, the anomeric oxygen of the products KDO8P and DAH7P originates from bulk solvent (5Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The recently determined structures of Escherichia coliKDO8PS and DAH7PS (8Shumilin I.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) provide evidence that these two enzymes are not only mechanistically, but also structurally related, and that they probably originated from a common ancestor. However, although all the known bacterial and eukaryotic DAH7PSs require divalent metals for activity (12Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5762-5767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20807-20810Google Scholar), two different groups or classes of KDO8PSs have been recognized with respect to their requirement for metals (14Birck, A., and Woodard, R. (2001) J. Mol. Evol.,in pressGoogle Scholar). The most extensively studied member of the KDO8PS family, the E. colienzyme, does not require a metal. In contrast, KDO8PS from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus requires a divalent cation for activity, with the level of activation varying over a 10-fold range in the order Cd2+ ∼ Mn2+ > Ni2+∼ Co2+ > Ca2+ > Cu2+ > Mg2+ ∼ Zn2+ (15Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To understand the basis for the different metal requirement between these two enzymes, we have determined the crystal structure of A. aeolicus KDO8PS in the presence of various combinations of substrates and metal. Results from this study support the previous hypothesis (11Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that the reaction of KDO8P synthesis proceeds through the formation of a linear intermediate and point to the essential role played by a surface loop in isolating the active site from bulk solvent and by the geometry of the active site in influencing the electronic configuration of the substrates during turnover. RecombinantA. aeolicus KDO8PS was isolated from E. coliBL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pAakdsA, as described previously (16Duewel H.S. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A concentrated KDO8PS solution (30 mg/ml in ∼15 mmTris-Cl) was obtained from purified enzyme that had been dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), lyophilized, and then reconstituted with distilled water. Lyophilization does not affect the activity of the reconstituted enzyme. Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. For this purpose, the concentrated enzyme solution (30 mg/ml) was mixed 1:1 with a reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8–4.9) and 5–6% polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystallization trays were incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 weeks. Crystals (typically 0.12–0.15 mm3) were harvested and maintained in a cryoprotectant holding solution consisting of 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8–4.9), 21% polyethylene glycol 4000, 16% glycerol, and 5% ethylene glycol. The concentrated solution of A. aeolicus KDO8PS as well as crystals of this enzyme in the original crystallization drops have a slight pink color. As discussed by Duewel et al. (15Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Duewel H.S. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this color is probably due to the presence of substoichiometric amounts of bound iron in the enzyme produced in E. coli. For these studies, we have opted to collect diffraction data from crystals that were either completely depleted of any metal or in which the iron had been replaced with Cd2+, the ion that confers the highest activity in solution (15Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Incubation of A. aeolicus KDO8PS crystals in a cryoprotectant liquor containing 100 μmCdCl2, with several daily changes of this solution, bleaches their color completely within 2 days. We attribute this color change to the replacement of iron by Cd2+. For experiments in which it was necessary to remove any residual traces of metal from the enzyme, crystals were incubated for several days in a cryoprotectant holding solution containing 10 mm EDTA, with frequent changes of the solution. Crystals incubated with EDTA are also completely colorless. Crystals of A. aeolicus KDO8PS belong to space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a = b ≅ 84.3 Å andc ≅ 159.5 Å and diffract to ∼1.9 Å. Data sets were collected at 100 K with an R-axis IV image plate detector or with a Bruker Hi-Star detector at the CuKα wavelength (see TableI). Oscillation data were processed with HKL (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) or SAINT (Brucker, Inc.). The structure of the A. aeolicus enzyme was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of one monomer of the tetrameric E. coli enzyme (11Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as the starting model. All the steps of the molecular replacement procedure were carried out using the CNS Version 1.0 suite of crystallographic programs (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Self-rotation and cross-rotation function analyses clearly identified the presence of two subunits in the asymmetric unit, related by a 2-fold axis of local symmetry. Correct placing of the subunits was obtained with two consecutive translation searches. Model refinement was also carried out with CNS Version 1.0 using cross-validated maximum likelihood as the target function (19Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar).

The asymmetric unit of A. aeolicus KDO8PS crystals contains a homodimer. Two crystal forms of E. coli KDO8PS previously reported by this laboratory contain instead a homotetramer of the enzyme with 222 local symmetry (9Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A third crystal form reported by Wagner et al. (10Wagner T. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R. Tolbert W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) contains only one chain in the asymmetric unit, but application of crystal symmetry generates a tetramer essentially identical to that present in the other two crystal forms. Application of one of the operations of crystallographic symmetry (x = y, y = x,z = −z) of space group P3121 produces a tetrameric assembly of A. aeolicus KDO8PS that can be superimposed on the E. coli enzyme with a root mean square deviation of only 1.22 Å for 696 aligned C-α atoms. In line with this finding, comparative analysis of the A. aeolicus(M r 29,734) and E. coli(M r 30,833) KDO8PSs by analytical size-exclusion chromatography reveals that the two enzymes have almost identical elution profiles (16Duewel H.S. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The enzyme from Salmonella typhimurium also demonstrates analogous chromatographic behavior (20Taylor W.P. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32141-32146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the native form of KDO8PS might be a tetramer in all Gram-negative bacteria. As in the case of E. coli KDO8PS, the A. aeolicusenzyme adopts a (β/α)8-barrel topology (Fig.2). Each monomer of A. aeolicus KDO8PS differs from the E. coli counterpart mainly at the N terminus, as the E. coli enzyme has an additional β-hairpin that seals the N-terminal end of the barrel. Consequently, the first residue of the thermophilic KDO8PS corresponds to residue 16 of the E. coli sequence. The enzyme active sites are located at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel of each subunit, at the interface with the adjacent subunit. Three long loops, L2, L7, and L8, control access to the active site cavity (Fig. 2). L7 and L8 were both disordered in the E. coli enzyme (11Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). L8 is always ordered in A. aeolicus KDO8PS; L7 becomes ordered under particular conditions (see below). The structure of substrate-free A. aeolicus KDO8PS was determined for the both the Cd2+ and metal-free forms of the enzyme. The Cd2+ form (Table I, Cd2+ column) was intentionally pursued because Cd2+ is the most effective activator of KDO8PS (15Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the active site of the enzyme, the Cd2+ ion displays a distorted octahedral coordination: the thiolate of Cys-11 and the ε-nitrogen of His-185 provide two axial ligands, whereas the carboxylate moieties of Glu-222 and Asp-233 and a water molecule provide the equatorial coordination (Fig.3). The water molecule that acts as equatorial ligand is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond to the ω-nitrogen of Lys-46. These features of the active site of A. aeolicus KDO8PS are particularly reminiscent of the homologous enzyme DAH7PS. The recently reported crystal structure of the E. coli phenylalanine-regulated DAH7PS (8Shumilin I.A. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R.H. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar) shows a lead ion (Pb2+) bound in the active site and interacting with PEP. The lead ion, which was included in the crystallization for the purpose of determining the structure by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction, but is itself an extremely poor activator of DAH7PS (8Shumilin I.A. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R.H. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar), is believed to occupy the same active site location as other metals that are good activators (13Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20807-20810Google Scholar). As expected, several residues in the coordination sphere of the lead ion in DAH7PS (Cys-61, His-268, Glu-302, and Asp-326) have counterparts in the active site of A. aeolicus KDO8PS (Cys-11, His-185, Glu-222, and Asp-233). In the substrate-free Cd2+ form of A. aeolicusKDO8PS, a phosphate ion (herein designated as PO4-1) occupies the position corresponding to the phosphate moiety of PEP in DAH7PS (8Shumilin I.A. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R.H. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or to the SO4-1 site described in the E. coli enzyme (11Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). A second phosphate ion (herein designated as PO4-2), corresponding to the SO4-2 ion of the E. coli enzyme, is located ∼10 Å from PO4-1 in a raised position close to the opening of the barrel and beneath the long loops L2 (residues 44–58) and L7 (residues 187–201) (Figs. 2 and 3). Some broken density associated with L7 is visible in one of the two subunits contained in the asymmetric unit; L7 of the other subunit is completely disordered. The structure of the substrate- and metal-free enzyme was obtained by extensive incubation of the crystals in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (Table I, – column). This structure is essentially identical to that of the Cd2+ enzyme, suggesting that the presence of the metal does not alter appreciably the overall conformation of the enzyme. However, small differences are present in the positions of the side chains of the residues directly involved in metal coordination. In particular, the water molecule that was one of the ligands of Cd2+ is no longer visible. L8, which provides the metal ligand Asp-233, moves slightly away, and a different rotamer is present in the side chain of Gln-188 (beginning of L7), such that the carboxylate and amide moieties of these 2 residues are now in hydrogen bond distance (Fig. 3). One of the largest changes is observed in the position of the imidazole ring of His-185, which undergoes a rotation of ∼40° around the C-β–C-γ bond. Although the position of PO4-1 is essentially unchanged, PO4-2 is not present, possibly as a consequence of the lack of stabilizing interactions provided by L7. This loop is completely disordered in both subunits of the metal-free enzyme between Val-187 and Met-200. Crystals of the metal-free or Cd2+ enzyme were incubated in the presence of 5 mm PEP (K m(PEP) = 40 μm at 60 °C), and their structures were determined (Table I, PEP and Cd2+/PEP columns, respectively). As predicted from the analysis of the structure of E. coliKDO8PS, PEP binds at the bottom of the active site cavity of theA. aeolicus enzyme, with its phosphate and carboxylate moieties stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Fig. 4 A). The phosphate group is anchored by salt bridges to the side chains of Lys-124 and Arg-154 and by a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Ala-102. The carboxylate group forms salt bridges with Lys-41, Lys-46, and Lys-124 and a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of Ser-43. Finally, Lys-124 also forms a hydrogen bond with the bridging oxygen of PEP. PEP binds in a similar fashion in the active site of the enzyme both in the presence and absence of a divalent metal. The most notable difference between the two structures is in the position of the Glu-222 side chain. If Cd2+ is present, Glu-222 is a metal ligand, whereas in the absence of the metal, its side chain moves slightly away from the vacant metal site (data not shown). Interestingly, the water molecule that, in the presence of Cd2+, is one of the metal ligands is retained even in the absence of Cd2+. This water is located on the si face of PEP in van der Waals contact with the substrate C-2 and C-3. The presence of PEP must have a significant stabilizing role, as this water molecule is not visible in the structure of the substrate- and metal-free enzyme. A water molecule is also in van der Waals contact with the re side of PEP (Fig.4 A). The potential role in catalysis of the water molecules located on both the si and re sides of PEP is discussed below. A striking feature of PEP bound in the active site of KDO8PS is that the geometry of the molecule at C-2 deviates appreciably from the planarity observed in the crystal structures of free PEP in various ionization states (reviewed in Ref. 21Souhassou M. Schaber P.M. Blessing R.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1996; 52: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar): the magnitude of the distortion is provided by the value of the angle between the plane defined by C-2, C-1, and C-3 and the plane defined by C-1, C-3, and O-2, which is ∼12° instead of the expected value of 0° (Fig.4 B). This deviation of the PEP molecule from perfect planarity appears to be imposed by the particular geometry of the active site and may be indicative of the fact that the enzyme modifies the electronic configuration of the substrate to favor a nucleophilic attack at C-2PEP (see below). The structure ofA. aeolicus KDO8PS in complex with A5P was determined by soaking crystals of the Cd2+ enzyme in the presence of 10 mm A5P (K m(A5P) = 8 μm at 60 °C) (Table I, Cd2+/A5P column). As predicted by Radaev et al. (11Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol.

The position of PO4-1 is unchanged with respect to the substrate-free enzyme. The phosphate moiety of A5P is stabilized by a salt bridge to Arg-49 and by hydrogen bonds to the backbone and side chain of Ser-50 (Fig. 5 A). In this structure, L7 is not ordered and therefore does not appear to contribute significantly to A5P binding. The carbon tail of A5P is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds directed to the substrate hydroxyls and to the aldehyde moiety, originating from Asp-233, Asn-48, and PO4-1 and from several water molecules (Fig. 5,A and B). In particular, C-2–OHA5Pis only 2.9 Å from Cd2+ and can be considered a weak ligand of the metal. In this fashion, the substrate C-2–OH appears to replace the water molecule that is a ligand of Cd2+in other structures of the enzyme.

Inclusion or skipping of a cassette-type exon in the 3′ portion of this pre-mRNA leads to the production of isoforms with antagonistic activity in apoptosis. We previously identified a negative regulatory element (In100) located in the intron downstream of alternative exon 9. The upstream portion of this element harbors a decoy 3′ acceptor site that engages in nonproductive commitment complex interactions with the 5′ splice site of exon 9. This in turn confers a competitive advantage to the exon-skipping splicing pattern. Further characterization of the In100 element reveals a second, functionally distinct, domain located downstream from the decoy 3′ acceptor site. This downstream domain harbors several polypyrimidine track-binding protein (PTB)-binding sites. We show that PTB binding to these sites correlates with the negative effect on exon 9 inclusion. Finally, we show that both domains of the In100 element can function independently to repress exon 9 inclusion, although PTB binding in the vicinity of the decoy 3′ splice site can modulate its activity.

It provides a potential for an extraordinarily high level of diversity in generating multiple, often functionally distinct, protein isoforms from a single gene. In addition to the basic splicing signals (5′ splice site, branch point sequence and pyrimidine tract-AG), numerous sequence elements have been identified in exons or introns that can influence in various ways the function of the splicing machinery (reviewed in Refs. 1Adams M.D. Rudner D.Z.

These regulatory elements can, in some cases, mediate their effects incis, for example, through the formation of stem-loop structures (e.g. Ref. 4Blanchette M. Chabot B. RNA. 1997; 3: 405-419PubMed Google Scholar), although they will usually interact with trans-acting factors. Such factors often form multicomponent complexes that can contain combinations of known constitutive splicing factors, including hnRNPs,1 snRNPs, and serine-arginine (SR) proteins as well as novel specific alternative splicing factors (e.g. Refs. 5Siebel C.W. Fresco L.D. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1386-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell.

However, little is known about the precise mechanisms by which these specific complexes interact with and influence the function of the splicing machinery. Similarly, the process of splice site selection in complex pre-mRNAs is still a poorly understood phenomenon (8Black D.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reed R. Curr. Opin.

One mechanism for intronic elements to function in repressing splicing was first described in Drosophila. The sex-specific splicing factor Sex-lethal (SXL) regulates the splicing of transformer (tra) pre-mRNA by competing with U2AF65 for binding to the polypyrimidine tract of the regulated 3′ splice site. This permits the use of an alternative 3′ splice site that is normally not selected, thus resulting in the production of a functional TRA protein only in female flies (11Sosnowski B.A. Belote J.M.

Direct competition with constitutive splicing factors has been shown to be a conserved strategy for vertebrate alternative 3′ splice site choice and often involves the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB/hnRNP I) (15Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 6-1173Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 17Lin C.H. Patton J.G. RNA. 1995; 1: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 18Norton P.A. Hynes R.O. Biochem. Biophys.

Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1874-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 21Patton J.G. Mayer S.A. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and then found to have features of an hnRNP protein (22Ghetti A. Piñol-Roma S. Michael W.M. Morandi C. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3671-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It was only recently that PTB was recognized as an important player in alternative splicing regulation (reviewed in Ref. 23Valcárcel J. Gebauer F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R705-R708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which PTB influences splicing is still unclear, even though it has been implicated in the alternative splicing of a number of genes. We have been using the caspase-2 (also known as Ich-1 (interleukin-1β converting enzyme homologue 1) or Nedd2) pre-mRNA as a model system to study the importance of alternative splicing regulation in the process of programmed cell death (24Jiang Z. Zhang W. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Inclusion or skipping of 61-base pair exon 9 in the 3′ end of this pre-mRNA leads to the formation of two mRNAs encoding protein isoforms with antagonistic activities in apoptosis (25Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). CASP-2L is derived from the skipping of alternative exon 9 and can induce cell death in a variety of cells (25Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 26Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

CASP-2S is a truncated version of the protein produced because of a premature termination codon created by the inclusion of exon 9. Overexpression of CASP-2S has been shown to prevent apoptotic death (25Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 30Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Dorstyn L. Noda M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 378-387Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, the generation of caspase-2-deficient mice has provided evidence that suggests an important role for caspase-2 as both a positive and negative cell death effector (31Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). We have previously implicated SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 as modulators of caspase-2 exon 9 alternative splicing (24Jiang Z. Zhang W. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Using a systematic mutagenesis approach, we have identified an intronic regulatory element (In100) located 140 nucleotides downstream of exon 9, that can repress inclusion of the alternative exon. The upstream portion of that element harbors sequences highly resembling a typical 3′ acceptor site. We have shown that this upstream region can behave as a normal 3′ splice site in certain conditions and can promote the assembly of stable U1 snRNP-dependent complexes on the 5′ splice site of nearby exon 9. Based on our results, we proposed a model in which this region would act as a “decoy” 3′ acceptor site, engaging in nonproductive splicing complexes with the 5′ splice site of the alternative exons, thus competitively favoring the pairing of exons 8 and 10 (32). We now show that PTB interacts with a region downstream of the decoy 3′ acceptor site in In100 and represses inclusion of the alternative exon. Furthermore, we find that each domain of the In100 element can function independently to repress exon 9 inclusion using distinct mechanisms. C2 and C3 have been described previously (24Jiang Z. Zhang W. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Various portions of the In100 element were amplified using PCR with specific oligonucleotides. Each fragment was either inserted in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in front of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter or at a BglII site in intron 9 of C3 to generate the respective C3 derivative (e.g. C3In50up, C3In50dn). In50upΔ and In50dnΔ were generated using overlapping mutagenic oligos. Oligos were hybridized, blunt-ended using Klenow fragment polymerase and inserted either in pcDNA3 or at a BglII site in intron 9 of C3 to generate C3In50upΔ and C3In50dnΔ. Specific mutations were introduced in the upstream (In100upΔ) or downstream (In100dnΔ) portion of the In100 fragment using “PCR overlap-extension mutagenesis” (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Mutagenic fragments were digested and substituted back into the C2 plasmid DNA. PCR was again used to mutate exon 9 3′ splice site AG to a CU. This fragment was then substituted into C3In50up, C3In50upΔ, C3In50dn, or C3In50dnΔ) at HindIII and BamHI sites to generate the respective 553 derivative. C3i9 consists of the Ex9–10 splicing unit with the In100 sequences deleted. i9 and i9In100 were generated by linearizing the corresponding C3i9 or C2i9 (containing In100) plasmid at the BglII site described above. i9In50up and i9In50dn were generated in a similar manner from the corresponding C3 constructs. Plasmids containing small fragments of the element were linearized at a BamHI site (present in 3′ oligos), and all C2 and C3 derivatives were linearized at an XhoI site in exon 10. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and were seeded at ≈2 × 105 cells/well in a six-well dish, 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was done using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure with 3 μg of DNA. Transfection efficiency was routinely ≈60%, as evaluated by cotransfection with a green fluorescent protein marker. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the RNA extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Spliced products derived from the expressed minigenes were detected using RT-PCR as described previously (24Jiang Z. Zhang W. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and resolved on 6% polyacrylamide 1× TBE gels. Splicing substrates were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) except for i9 derivatives, which was with T3 RNA polymerase. Final concentrations of reagents were as follows in a 10-μl reaction: 500 ng of linearized DNA template, 0.4 mm ATP and CTP, 0.1 mm GTP and UTP, 0.84 mm GpppG cap analogue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), 1× Transcription Buffer (Promega), 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 1 unit/μl RNA polymerase. Samples were then treated with 0.1 unit/μl DNase I (Promega) for 15 min and ethanol-precipitated, and the full-length transcripts were gel-purified as described (34Chabot B. Hames D. Higgins S. RNA Processing. I. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-29Google Scholar). Synthesis of cold competitor RNAs was in a scaled-up 100-μl reaction with the following modifications: 0.5 mmUTP and 0.42 mm cap analogue were used, and [α-32P]UTP was omitted. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to previously established protocols and contained ≈20 mg/ml total proteins (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Splicing reactions were set up and processed as previously described (36Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1985; 42: 725-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) except that some batches of nuclear extracts were supplemented with 1 unit of creatine kinase (Sigma). 2 fmol of RNA substrates was added and the samples incubated at 30 °C for 2 h unless otherwise mentioned. For trans-competition experiments, 0.5–1 pmol of cold RNAs were pre-incubated with nuclear extracts at 30 °C for 10 min prior to addition of the substrate and incubation under splicing conditions. Splicing products were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 murea gels. The identity of lariat molecules was determined by performing a debranching reaction in a S100 extract (37Ruskin B. Green M.R. Science. 1985; 229: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) followed by gel migration alongside molecular weight markers. The other products were identified according to size and comigration with pertinent partial splicing substrates. Splicing reactions were set up as above except that higher specific activity radiolabeled substrates were used. Trans-competition assays were carried out as above, except that 350–500 fmol of cold RNA competitors were used and the pre-incubation was for 10 min on ice. 6-μl aliquots were transferred onto a 96-well microtiter plate previously cooled at −20 °C and irradiated with ≈1 Joule in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Samples were then treated for 30 min. at 37 °C with one volume of RNase A (5 mg/ml). Radiolabeled cross-linked proteins were boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS loading buffer and separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Histidine-tagged PTB expression vector was a gift from Dr. J. G. Patton and was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described (38Pérez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). Purified U2AF65 was a generous gift from Dr. Rui-Ming Xu. Histidine-tagged hnRNP A1 was expressed and purified from E. coli using standard procedure. Cross-linking was carried out as described above except that, following the RNase treatment, samples were incubated with 20% fetal calf serum (as a normal serum control) or with various antibodies. Pre-blocked Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added with further incubation and gentle rocking. The RNA-labeled proteins retained on the beads after several washings were eluted and resolved on SDS-PAGE. This procedure was adapted from Refs. 39Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 40Chabot B. Frappier D. La Branche H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5197-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. 4-μl aliquots were removed from standard splicing reactions at indicated time points and mixed with 1 μl of heparin at 1 mg/ml. 0.5 μl of loading buffer (1× TBE, 20% glycerol, 1% bromephenol blue, and 1% xylene cyanol) was then added and the samples loaded on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 80:1), which had been pre-electrophoresed at 200 V for 30 min in 50 mmTris-glycine. Electrophoresis was then continued under the same conditions for 4–5 h at room temperature. ATP depletion of the nuclear extracts was achieved as in Ref. 41Michaud S. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar by pre-incubating the extracts at room temperature for 20–30 min. without addition of hexokinase and glucose. ATP, MgCl2, and creatine phosphate were omitted from these splicing reaction mixtures. Deletion mutagenesis experiments revealed a negative regulatory element (In100) located in the intron downstream of alternative exon 9 (Ref. 32Côté J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 1 and 2). To assess the potential involvement of trans-acting factors and dissect the functional domains of the In100 element, a series of small RNAs corresponding to various regions of the element (Fig.1 A) were produced in vitro and used in splicing trans-competition assays. Specifically, cold RNA competitors (0.5–1 pmol) were mixed with HeLa splicing reactions and pre-incubated for 10 min at 30 °C.32P-Labeled pre-mRNA substrates were then added and the incubation continued for 2 h. When added in trans to a splicing reaction containing C2 substrates, the In100 RNA promoted a complete shift toward the production of the casp-2S exon 9-inclusion mRNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). This was detected by monitoring the relative ratio of casp-2S to casp-2L mRNAs and corresponding lariat molecules (see Fig. 1 B; a black arrow represents casp-2L, and a white arrow marks casp-2S products/intermediate). This observation suggested that In100 mediated its negative effect on exon 9 inclusion at least in part through the involvement of trans-acting factors. These factors are titrated away by the excess amount of In100 competitor RNA and the inhibition is relieved. The same de-repression could also be observed with RNA competitors spanning the entire 3′ portion of the element (In75dn and In50dn; Fig. 1 B (lanes 7and 8) and see Fig. 3). In contrast, competitor RNAs spanning the upstream (In50up, In75up, In30up, and In20up) portion of the element were unable to induce any shift in the splicing profile when added in trans (Fig. 1, B (lanes 4–6) and A, respectively). This is consistent with the presence of a sequence resembling a 3′ acceptor site in this region, which may act as a decoy 3′ splice site for interacting with the 5′ splice site of exon 9 (32Côté J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to this model, the exon-skipping splicing pattern would be competitively favored over the exon inclusion through a cis-mediated mechanism and this fragment would not be expected to have any effect when added in trans. Finally, a centrally located fragment as well as a minimal RNA transcript spanning the last 25 nucleotides of the In100 element were also unable to release the inhibition of exon 9 inclusion (Fig.1 B, lanes 9 and 10 andlanes 11 and 12, respectively). These results thus define a minimal region (In50dn; denoted inblack in Fig. 1 A) downstream of the decoy 3′ splice site in In100 that requires interaction with nuclear factors for its activity.Figure 3PTB can repress exon 9 inclusion.Splicing reactions were carried out as before with In50dn added intrans to de-repress exon 9 inclusion (lanes 2–4). Following pre-incubation with cold In50dn RNA, purified His-tagged PTB (lanes 5 and6) or hnRNP A1 (lane 7) was added to the reaction and the incubation continued for 2 h. De-repression was reversed by addition of purified PTB (lanes 5and 6) but not by hnRNP A1 (lane 7). No de-repression was detected when In50dnΔ RNA was used as a competitor in trans (lane 8).

HeLa nuclear extracts were first pre-incubated under splicing conditions with the respective RNA competitors before C2 substrates were added and the samples UV-irradiated for 10 min. Following RNase treatment, the covalently cross-linked, RNA-labeled proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Using this method, we identified two bands with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 35 kDa, respectively, that were specifically competed away by the addition of cold In100 RNA in trans(Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). The 60-kDa protein could be titrated away specifically by the In50dn fragment, whereas the 35-kDa protein was competed away by the In50up fragment (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6and 7 and lanes 4 and 5, respectively). These results show that functionally distinct domains of the In100 regulatory element are recognized by different protein factors. Several observations led us to consider PTB as a likely candidate for the 60-kDa band observed on SDS-PAGE in our cross-linking experiments. First, putative PTB-binding sites are present in the In50dn portion of the element (see Fig. 2 A): specifically, two copies of the “core” PTB consensus motif UCUU(C) within a pyrimidine-rich context (38Pérez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar) and two copies of the UUCUCU(CU), which was identified previously as a candidate PTB splicing repressor motif (19Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chan R.C. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, PTB was one of the known splicing factors in this range of molecular weight. Third, longer gel migrations resolved the 60-kDa species as a doublet, typical of PTB. To test whether the 60-kDa cross-linking band was PTB, we used a cross-linking assay followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. Specifically, a labeled RNA substrate consisting of the complete In100 element was used in UV cross-linking as before (Fig. 2 C, lane 1) except that aliquots were taken, incubated with antibodies, and the immunoselected proteins recuperated using Protein A/G-agarose beads. Using this strategy, we show that a monoclonal antibody directed against PTB was able to immunoprecipitate specifically the 60-kDa doublet cross-linked on In100 (Fig.2 C, lane 3). In contrast, no proteins were selected if a control serum or an unrelated antibody was used (Fig. 2 C (lane 2) and data not shown, respectively). These results clearly identify the 60-kDa band as PTB. We next wanted to map precisely where PTB was binding on the In100 element. To do this, 32P-labeled short RNA substrates (see Fig. 1 A) were used to carry out the UV cross-linking assay as described above. As expected, PTB in the nuclear extract cross-linked exclusively on the In50dn region of the element (Fig.2 D, compare lane 4 to lane 3). Furthermore, consistent with the distribution of the PTB-binding sites, the entire In50dn fragment was required for strong binding of PTB, and an RNA containing only two (In25) or one (In40) out of four sites (see Figs. 1 A and 2 A) permitted only a weak interaction or no detectable interaction (Fig.2 D, lanes 6 and 5, respectively). This suggested that PTB may bind cooperatively on the PTB-binding site array, although we have not yet studied in detail the precise stoichiometry of this interaction. The other protein species cross-linked to In100 (including the 35-kDa species) all seem to interact specifically with the In50up fragment, with the exception of U2AF65, which cross-linked with equivalent efficiency to both In50up and In50dn substrates (Fig. 2 D, comparelanes 3 and 4). The identity of U2AF65 was assessed on the basis of its comigration with purified U2AF65 cross-linked on In100 as well as by immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 2–4 with lane 1 and Ref. 32Côté J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, we used site-specific mutagenesis to confirm that the consensus PTB-binding sites were indeed required to maintain strong PTB cross-linking to In50dn. Multiple purine insertions were made in each of the four sites present in In50dn, and the mutated fragment was used in a UV cross-linking assay using purified histidine-tagged PTB (In50dnΔ; Fig. 2 A). As was observed in the nuclear extract, His-PTB cross-linked specifically with the In50dn RNA substrate, and the signal of this cross-linking is as strong as that detected with the total In100 element (Fig. 2 E,lanes 1–3). As expected, no detectable cross-linking was observed when the In50dnΔ was used (Fig.2 E, lane 4). Taken together, these results revealed a specific interaction of PTB with consensus CU-rich sequences located in the downstream portion of In100. To address the functional significance of PTB binding to the In100 element, we used the in vitro splicing competition assay. Splicing reactions were carried out using the C2 substrate (which contains In100) with increasing amounts of cold In50dn RNA added in trans as described (see Fig. 1). This promoted a concentration-dependent derepression of exon 9 inclusion (Fig. 3,lanes 2–4). Addition of purified His-PTB protein to this de-repressed reaction shifted the splicing profile back toward the exon 9 skipping splicing profile (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, addition of similar amounts of purified histidine-tagged hnRNP A1 or other RNA-binding proteins to the de-repressed reaction had no effect on the splicing profile (Fig. 3, lane 7 and data not shown). Finally, In50dnΔ, in which PTB binding sites were mutated (see Fig.2 E), was unable to promote derepression of exon 9 inclusion when used as a trans-competitor (Fig. 3, lane 8). These results strongly suggest a role for PTB binding to In50dn in the repression of alternative exon 9 inclusion. The upstream portion of the In100 element, which acts as a decoy 3′ acceptor site can facilitate the skipping of exon 9 on its own, i.e. when the downstream PTB-binding region is deleted from the substrate (32Côté J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this isolated context, mutating all of the 3′ splice site signals (branch point, Py-tract, and AG dinucleotide) abolished completely the effect of In50up (see In50upΔ in Fig.4 A). In contrast, when tested in the context of the C2 substrate, i.e. in the presence of both portions of the element, these mutations had no effect on the splicing profile (Fig. 4, A (In100upΔ) andB (lane 2)). One possible explanation for these observations is that in this particular situation, PTB binding to the downstream portion of In100 was responsible for the repression observed. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the PTB-binding sites either in the context of the complete In100 element or in the isolated In50dn (see Fig. 4 A,In100dnΔ and In50dnΔ, respectively). The mutant DNA constructs were transfected in HeLa cells and the resulting splicing products were analyzed using RT-PCR with oligonucleotides located in the flanking exons 8 and 10. First, mutating PTB-binding sites downstream of the “functional” decoy acceptor site while keeping In50up intact had no effect on the level of exon 9 inclusion (Fig. 4 B,"

By using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, we found that wild-type λPKC localized predominantly to the cytoplasm, whereas both a kinase-defective mutant and an activation loop mutant accumulated in the nucleus. We have mapped a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the N-terminal part of the zinc finger domain of λPKC. Leptomycin B treatment induced rapid nuclear accumulation of GFP-λ as well as endogenous λPKC suggesting the existence of a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). Consequently, we identified a functional leucine-rich NES in the linker region between the zinc finger and the catalytic domain of λPKC. The presence of both the NLS and NES enables a continuous shuttling of λPKC between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our results suggest that the exposure of the NLS in both λ- and ζPKC is regulated by intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal part, including the pseudosubstrate sequence, and the catalytic domain. Thus, either deletion of the N-terminal region, including the pseudosubstrate sequence, or a point mutation in this sequence leads to nuclear accumulation of λPKC. The ability of the two atypical PKC isoforms to enter the nucleus in HeLa cells upon leptomycin B treatment differs substantially. Although λPKC is able to enter the nucleus very rapidly, ζPKC is much less efficiently imported into the nucleus. This difference can be explained by the different relative strengths of the NLS and NES in λPKC compared with ζPKC.

Based on sequence homology, domain organization, and biochemical properties, 10 different isoforms are grouped into three classes denoted classical, novel, and atypical PKCs. ζPKC and λ/ιPKC constitute the atypical PKCs (aPKCs). In contrast to the classical and novel PKCs that contain two repeated diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding zinc finger domains within their regulatory domains, the aPKCs have only a single zinc finger domain that is unable to interact with DAG or phorbol esters (4Ono Y.

Upon stimulation with either platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor, the nuclear pool of λPKC translocated in a wortmannin-sensitive manner to the cytoplasm and to more compact structures within the nucleus.

Here we have studied the subcellular localization of λ- and ζPKC in living cells using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. We find that a kinase-defective mutant of λPKC accumulates in the cell nucleus, whereas the wild-type kinase is mainly cytosolic. Inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export using leptomycin B leads to rapid nuclear accumulation of both GFP-λ and endogenous λPKC. By deletion studies and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified both a functional NLS and an NES in λPKC. These signals endow λPKC with the ability to shuttle continuously between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our results are compatible with the notion that the exposure of the NLS in both λPKC and ζPKC may be regulated by intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal region and the catalytic domain of the kinases. Also, we find that ζPKC is much less efficiently imported into the nucleus than λPKC in HeLa cells upon blockade of nuclear export by leptomycin B treatment. This is most likely due to differences in the relative strengths of the NES and NLS in the two atypical PKCs. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the antibiotics described above. Subconfluent HeLa and HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation method. For the nuclear export experiments, leptomycin B, kindly provided by Dr. M. Yoshida, Tokyo, was added to the medium to a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. The murine λPKC cDNA was amplified from a mouse brain cDNA library (Marathon Ready, CLONTECH) by PCR using ExTaq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals). The PCR product was made blunt and subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC18. Inspection of the cDNA sequences show that both the murine λPKC and the human ιPKC cDNAs actually contain an in frame ATG codon nine codons upstream of the proposed start codon (5Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Selbie L.A. Schitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The XenopusλPKC also contains this start codon eight amino acids upstream of the second ATG codon. Since this is the first in frame ATG and the amino acid sequences of this N-terminal extension also are conserved between the species, we suggest that this most 5′ ATG is the start codon of λ/ιPKC. Consequently, the numbering system used in this paper is based on this. To generate pHA-λ, pUC18-λPKC was digested withEcoRI and XbaI, and the fragment containing the coding region for full-length λPKC (amino acids 1–595 in our numbering system) was inserted into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3-HA. pcDNA3-HA was a kind gift from Dr. Jorge Moscat and contains an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag inserted into theHindIII-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pGFP-λ was made from pHA-λ by inserting theEcoRI-XbaI (blunted) fragment encoding λPKC into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). pGFP-ζ was made from pHA-ζ (kindly provided by dr. Jorge Moscat) by inserting anEcoRI-XbaI (blunted) fragment encoding rat ζPKC into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1. The expressions plasmids for HA-λK282W, GFP-λK282W, GFP-λT411A, GFP-λT411E, GFP-λK282W-R150E/R151E, GFP-λ(141–162)R150E/R151E, GFP-λF253A/L255A, GFP-λA129E, GFP-ζK281W, and GFP-ζF252A/L254A were made by site-directed mutagenesis according to the instruction manual for the Quick-Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) using the λPKCK282W, λPKCT411A, λPKCT411E, λPKCR150E/R151E, λPKCF253A/L255A, λPKCA129E, ζPKCK281W, and ζPKCF252A/L254A mutagenesis primers (Table I). The GFP-λ and GFP-ζ deletion mutants were made using the following strategy. Different parts of the λ- or ζPKC cDNAs were amplified by PCR using primers that contained recognition sequences for specific restriction enzymes. The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and inserted into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1. All constructs were verified by sequencing. All GFP-λ/-ζ constructs are named according to the included parts of either λPKC or ζPKC with the amino acid positions shown in parentheses. To study the localization of the regulatory domain of λPKC, two different constructs were made encoding fusion proteins where GFP was either fused to the N-terminal end or the C-terminal end. pUC18-regλ was generated by PCR using pUC18-λPKC as template and the λPKCR.5pr and λ256.3nt primers (Table I). The PCR product was made blunt and subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC18. pUC18-regλ was digested with NheI (blunted) and EcoRI, and the regλ fragment was inserted into the ApaI (blunted) andEcoRI sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). To make pGFP-λ(1–256), pregλ-GFP was cut with EcoRI andBamHI, and the regλ fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1. pGFP-λ(256–595) was made from a PCR product generated by using pUC18-λPKC as template and the primers λPKCcat.5pr and λPKC.3nt. The PCR product was cut withXbaI (blunted) and EcoRI and inserted intoSmaI-EcoRI digested pEGFP-C1. pGFP-λ(1–139) was constructed by inserting an EcoRI-MscI fragment from pGFP-λ(1–256) into theEcoRI-SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1. pGFP-λ(141–595) was made by PCR using the λPKC141.5pr and the λPKC.3nt primers. The product was cut with XbaI (blunted) and EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1. pGFP-λ(194–256) was constructed from a PCR product amplified using the λ194.5pr and λ256.3nt primers, digested with EcoRI and NheI (blunted), and inserted into theEcoRI-SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1. To make pGFP-λ(141–194), the λ141.5pr and λ194.3nt primers were used, and the PCR product was cut with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1. Exactly the same strategy was used to make pGFP-λ(1–194) and pGFP-λ,(163–194) using the primers λPKCR.5pr and λPKC194.3nt for pGFP-λ(1–194) and λPKC163.5pr and λPKC194.3nt for pGFP-λ(163–194) (Table I). pGFP-λ(141–163) was made from pGFP-λ(141–194) by inserting anEcoRI-Eco0109I (blunted) fragment intoEcoRI-SmaI-digested pEGFP-C1. To make pGFP-ζ(132–182) a cDNA fragment encoding the zinc finger domain of ζPKC was amplified from mouse brain cDNA library using the mζPKC132.5pr and mζPKC182.3nt primers (Table I). The PCR product was cut with BamHI and EcoRI before being inserted into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1. To make pGFP-α(37–88) and pGFP-α(37–155), containing one or both of the zinc finger domains from murine αPKC fused to GFP, the same strategy as for construction of pGFP-ζ(132–182) was used except that the αPKC37.5pr and αPKC88.3nt primers were used for pGFP-α(37–88) and the αPKC37.5pr and αPKC155.3nt primers were used for pGFP-α(37–155). pGFP-ζ(255–592) and pGFP-ζ(130–592) were made from PCR products amplified using pHA-ζPKC as template and the ζcat.5pr and ζPKC.3nt primers for pGFP-ζ(254–592) and primers ζ130.5pr and ζPKC.3nt for pGFP-ζ(130–592). The PCR products were blunted, cut with EcoRI, and cloned into theEcoRI-SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1. pGFP-ζ(1–255) was made from a PCR product generated using the ζPKC.5pr and ζPKC255.3nt primers that was cut with EcoRI andBamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites within pEGFP-C1. pGFP-ζ(1–182) and pGFP-ζ(130–255) were generated following exactly the same strategy as for pGFP-ζ(1–255) using the ζPKC5.pr and ζPKC182.3nt primers for pGFPζ(1–182) and the primers ζPKC130.5pr and ζPKC255.3nt for pGFP-ζ(130–255).Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used as PCR primers for plasmid constructions and site-directed mutagenesisNameSequenceλPKCR.5pr5′-AGTGAGAATTCGCCGACCCAGAGGGACAGC-3′λPKC.3nt5′-GAATTTCTAGAGGGGCAACATAAAATGCTAA-3′λPKCK282W5′-CGCATTTATGCAATGTGGGTTGTGAAGAAAGAGC-3′λPKCT411A5′-GGAGACACAACCAGCGCTTTCTGCGGCACTCCC-3′λPKCT411E5′-GGAGACACAACCAGCGAGTTCTGCGGCACTCCC-3′λPKCR150/151E5′-GCCAAACGTTTCAATGAGGAGGCCCACTGTGCCATC-3′λPKCF253A/L255A5′-GGTCTGCAGGATGCCGATGCGCTTCGAGTTATAGG-3′λPKCA129E5′-TTACCGGAGAGGGGAACGCCGGTGGAGAAAGC-3′ζPKCF252A/L254A5′-GGGCTGCAAGACGCTGACGCCATCAGAGTCA-3′ζPKCK281W5′-AGATTTACGCCATGTGGGTGGTAAAGAAGGAGC-3′λPKC256.3nt5′-CCTGCTAGCCGAAGCAAATCGAAATCCT-3′λPKCcat.5pr5′-GCAGAATTCCGATTTGCTTCGAGTTATA-3′λPKC194.5pr5′-TGAGTGGAATTCGCACTCTTTGCCACCGGAAC-3′λPKC141.5pr5′-TGTGCGAATTCCCACACTTTTCAAGCCAAACGT-3′λPKC194.3nt5′-CAAAGGATCCCGCCCACACTCAATTGTGACCA-3′ζPKC.5pr5′-GGAGAATTCCATGCCCAGCAGGA-3′ζPKC255.3nt5′-TGACGGATCCGAGGTCAAAGTCTTGCA-3′αPKC37.5pr5′-AGGTGAATTCCCACAAATTCATCGCC-3′αPKC88.3nt5′-CCCGGATCCGCACCCGGACAAGAGAAC-3′αPKC155.3nt5′-CTGGGATCCCCATTCCGCAGAGGCTAG-3′mζPKC132.5pr5′-AGCGAATTCCCACCTCTTCCAAGCCAA-3′mζPKC182.3nt5′-GAATGGATCCGCCTCCTGCAGGTCAG-3′ζPKC.3nt5′-ATGTCTAGACACGGACTCCTCAGCAGA-3′ζcat.5pr5′-ACTTGAATTCCATCAGAGTCATCGGG-3′ζ130.5pr5′-GAGCGAATTCCCACCTCTTCCAAGCCA-3′λPKC163.5pr5′-GAATGAATTCCCTCGGACGACAAGGATACAA-3′ζPKC182.3nt5′-GAATCGGATCCCCTCCTGCAGGTCAGCGGGA-3′ Open table in a new tab For the subcellular localization studies of the different GFP fusion proteins, HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of expression vectors for the different GFP fusions. The subcellular localizations of the GFP fusion proteins in living cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Leitz DMIRB invert microscope equipped for fluorescence and with a Leica DC100 digital camera. For DAPI staining the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C, and the DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. HA-λ and HA-λK282W were detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Subconfluent HEK293 cells in 24-well culture dishes were cotransfected with 0.4 μg of the different GFP-λ/-ζ-expressing plasmids and 0.4 μg of vectors expressing either HA-λ or HA-λK282W. Twenty four h later the cells were fixed by adding freshly made paraformaldehyde directly to medium to a final concentration of 4%. The cells were permeabilized for 10 min on ice using methanol pre-chilled at −20 °C. The aldehyde groups were quenched by incubating the cells with 10 mm glycine, pH 8.5, for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated with 3% pre-immune goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with the anti-HA antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The immunostaining was developed using an Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. Endogenous λPKC in HeLa cells was detected by staining with an anti-λPKC antibody (clone 41, Transduction Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:200. The activities of the different GFP-λ/-ζ mutants and HA-λ/-ζ were measured in total cellular extracts by immune complex kinase assays using histone H1 as substrate. Subconfluent cultures of HeLa cells in 100-mm diameter Petri dishes were transfected with 10 μg of vectors expressing the different GFP-λ/-ζ mutants or HA-λ/-ζ. The cells were harvested by trypsinization 24 h post-transfection, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (53Nead M.A. Baglia L.A. Antinore M.J. Ludlow J.W. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 tablet per 10 ml of Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate. Following isolation of the nuclei by centrifugation, the supernatant containing the cytosolic extract was removed. Finally, the cytosolic and nuclear extracts were mixed to give total cellular extracts. Approximately equal amounts of the different GFP- or HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from total cell extracts as follows. Total cellular extracts from 100-mm culture dishes were preincubated with unsaturated 50% gel-slurry solution of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min at 4 °C and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either 1 μg of anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 2 μg of polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) in a total volume of 400 μl in HA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). Fifteen μl of bovine serum albumin-saturated 50% gel-slurry was added to the samples before continuing the incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed five times in HA lysis buffer and once in λ/ζ-kinase buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2). The complexes were resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 3 μg of histone H1 (Calbiochem), 60 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The kinase reactions were terminated by adding 3.8 μl of 5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis load buffer, and the samples were boiled immediately for 5 min. The samples were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylated proteins were detected and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of immunoprecipitated GFP-λ/-ζ and HA-λ was determined by probing the membrane with the specific anti-λPKC antibody or an anti-ζPKC antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) that recognizes both ζPKC and λPKC. The chemiluminescence signals from the blots were detected using a LumiImager F1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and quantitated as Boehringer light units using the LumiAnalyst 3.0 software. The relative activities of GFP-λ and HA-λ were determined as PhosphorImager units of phosphorylated substrate divided on the Boehringer light units representing the amount of kinase used. HeLa cells were seeded at 4 × 105 per 100-mm dish the day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 10 μg of the different"
https://openalex.org/W2008373826,"Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia results from mutations in the collagen X (COL10A1) gene. With the exception of two cases, the known mutations are clustered in the C-terminal nonhelical (NC1) domain of the collagen X.In vitro and cell culture studies have shown that the NC1 mutations result in impaired collagen X trimer assembly and secretion. In the two other cases, missense mutations that alter Gly18at the −1 position of the putative signal peptide cleavage site were identified (Ikegawa, S., Nakamura, K., Nagano, A., Haga, N., and Nakamura, Y. (1997) Hum. Mutat. 9, 131–135). To study their impact on collagen X biosynthesis using in vitrocell-free translation in the presence of microsomes, and cell transfection assays, these two mutations were created inCOL10A1 by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that translocation of the mutant pre-α1(X) chains into the microsomes is not affected, but cleavage of the signal peptide is inhibited, and the mutant chains remain anchored to the membrane of microsomes. Cell-free translation and transfection studies in cells showed that the mutant chains associate into trimers but cannot form a triple helix. The combined effect of both the lack of signal peptide cleavage and helical configuration is impaired secretion. Thus, despite the different nature of the NC1 and signal peptide mutations in collagen X, both result in impaired collagen X secretion, probably followed by intracellular retention and degradation of mutant chains, and causing the Schmid metaphyseal chandrodysplasia phenotype.

Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia a collective term for mutations within the collagen X NC1 domain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis signal peptide mutant wild type polymerase chain reaction endoplasmic reticulum Collagen X is the most abundant extracellular matrix component synthesized by hypertrophic chondrocytes during the transition from cartilage to bone in endochondral ossification. It is classified as a short-chain nonfibrillar collagen and consists of three distinct protein domains; a central, short triple helical COL1 domain (463 amino acids) flanked by a small N-terminal nonhelical NC2 domain (38 amino acids) and a larger, more conserved, nonhelical C-terminal NC1 domain (161 amino acids). The chains are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide, which is proteolytically removed from the pre-α1(X) chains during biosynthesis (1Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Thomas J.T. Cresswell C.J. Rash B. Nicolai H. Jones T. Solomon E. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In collagen biosynthesis, once the polypeptide chains are translocated into the lumen of the ER, the chains of the trimer associate via their C-terminal globular domains. This allows nucleation and folding of the triple helix to occur sequentially from this end of the molecule. Mutations in the collagen X gene (COL10A1) result in Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD),1 an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by short to normal stature, bowed legs, coxa vara, and flaring of the metaphyses of long bones. To date, all reported SMCD mutations in COL10A1,except two, are localized to the C-terminal NC1 domain of the protein (see review by Chan and Jacenko, Ref. 3Chan D. Jacenko O. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These NC1 domain mutations (COL10-NC1m) were proposed to affect the initial stages of the folding and chain assembly of collagen X (4Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Warman M.L. Abbott M. Apte S.S. Hefferon T. McIntosh I. Cohn D.H. Hecht J.T. Olsen B.R. Francomano C.A. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), hindering nucleation of the triple helix and, therefore, impairing secretion of collagen X trimers. The disruption of collagen X assembly as a mechanism underlying SMCD is supported by studies using in vitro transcription and translation of mutant and normal COL10A1 cDNAs in a cell-free system (1Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this system, the inability of COL10-NC1mchains to trimerize was clearly demonstrated. Expression of COL10-NC1m cDNAs in cells resulted in poor expression levels, with little or no secretion of the mutant chains (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that the inability of mutant collagen α1(X) chains to assemble can lead to their intracellular retention and subsequent degradation. As a consequence, in SMCD, collagen X in the matrix could be reduced, potentially to 50% of normal levels, because of haploinsufficiency. The absence of detectable mutant COL10A1 mRNA in extracts of growth plate cartilage from a SMCD patient with a nonsense mutation in the NC1 domain, probably caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation, is consistent with haploinsufficiency as a mechanism in SMCD (7Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that other mechanisms could also underlie SMCD. For example, trace amounts of heterotrimers can be detected during cell-free coexpression of normal and mutant chains with amino acid substitutions in the NC1 domain (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the clustering of COL10A1 mutations in the NC1 domain, the absence of null mutations and the autosomal dominant inheritance of SMCD in patients are more consistent with a dominant-negative mechanism. That is, the expression of mutant collagen X chains could impact on the assembly and secretion of normal chains as well. We (8Chan D. Freddi S. Weng Y.M. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13091-13097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and others (9Marks D.S. Gregory C.A. Wallis G.A. Brass A. Kadler K.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Biol.

Recently, two missense mutations in SMCD patients were identified in the putative signal peptide of the molecule at nucleotide positions 148 and 149 (G148A and G149A) 2Positions of nucleotides and amino acids are numbered from the start of transcription (24Reichenberger E.

The molecular consequences of these mutations on collagen X biosynthesis are unknown but the predicted consequence is that secretion of the molecules will be impaired as the signal sequence plays a key role in this process (12Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We have aimed to obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SMCD in these patients by studying the impact of these two signal peptide mutations (SPm) on collagen X biosynthesis and assembly. Our data show that the G148A and G149A mutations do result in impaired secretion of collagen X. Overlap extension PCR (13Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

These were the G148A and G149A nucleotide substitutions which change the codon for Gly18to codons for Arg (G18R) and Asp (G18D), respectively.

PCR reactions were performed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.75 μm of each of the primers. The reactions were carried out using the GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer). Cycle one was performed at 96 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and then followed by 25 cycles at 96 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The reaction was terminated at 72 °C for 1 min. The recombinant fragment was purified and digested with KpnI andXhoI. A 337-base pair fragment containing the mutation was cloned into appropriate sites of pTM1 (14Rich D.P. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Paul S. Jefferson D.M. McCann J.D. Klinger K.W.

Two positive clones, pTM1-G18R and pTM1-G18D were selected for sequencing to ensure that the correct mutation was introduced and that there was no PCR error within the 337-base pair KpnI/XhoI fragment. A full-length cDNA was constructed by cloning a 3-kilobase fragment generated by XhoI and SalI digestion of pTM1-h10wt (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 12.5 μl and labeled with 10 μCi of translation grade l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine whether the mutant chains can form heterotrimers with normal chains, cotranslation experiments using an assembly-competent helix deletion α1(X) reporter construct, helixΔ (6Chan D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), were performed with either the G18R or G18D mutant constructs. Coupled transcription and translation experiments were carried out at 30 °C for 90 min using a total of 100 ng of purified plasmids. When required, the microsomes were separated from the reticulocyte lysate by centrifugation and analyzed separately. To assay for the location of the translation products, proteins external to the isolated microsome vesicles were digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml each (15Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5735-5740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples for SDS-PAGE analysis were dissolved or mixed with 40 μl of sample loading buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS (w/v), 2 m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% sucrose (w/v)), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretic conditions and fluorography of radioactive gels have been described previously (16Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were imaged and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The sodium carbonate extraction procedure of Fujikiet al. (17Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) was used, with minor modifications, to determine whether the mutant chains remained as an integral component of the lipid bilayer. Following cell-free synthesis, microsome vesicles were separated from the reticulocyte lysate by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 15 min, and washed with 0.5 ml of KHM buffer (110 mm KOAc, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mmMg(OAc)2). Unbound proteins were extracted from the microsome vesicles with 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5, on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged as described above. The lipid bilayer was washed with 0.5 ml of KHM buffer. The supernatants were neutralized to pH 7.5 with 1m HCl and the extracted proteins precipitated with 75% (v/v) ethanol. Proteins in both the Na2CO3-soluble, and the membrane fractions were dissolved in 40 μl of sample loading buffer, as described above, prior to analysis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. COL10A1cDNA constructs were expressed in a rat osteogenic sarcoma cell line, UMR 106–01 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC-CRL 1661), using the vaccinia-driven T7 bacteriophage expression system previously described (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis was used to study collagen X secretion and degradation. Transfected cells in 6-well plates were preincubated in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without l-methionine (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h, then pulse-labeled for 2 h with 150 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (1110 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For secretion studies, labeled cells were chased with fresh medium containing excess unlabeled methionine over a period of 2 h. Collagen X from the cell and medium fractions was recovered by immunoprecipitation using a specific antibody (gift from Dr. Olena Jacenko) (7Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein G-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. To study the formation of stable triple helical molecules, aliquots of the cell fractions were subjected to limited pepsin digestion (16Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For analysis of intracellular collagen X degradation, cells were treated with either a proteasome inhibitor (5 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, CalBiochem) or an ER-Golgi transport inhibitor for the endosome/lysosome pathway (1 μg/ml brefeldin A, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) throughout the preincubation, pulse labeling and chase periods. Cells were harvested after a 1-h chase, and collagen X was recovered by immunoprecipitation. Sequencing confirmed that the G148A and G149A mutations had been introduced in the cDNA constructs (Fig.1). In vitro transcription and cell-free translation demonstrated that the mutant cDNAs were translated into pre-α1(X) chains with the same molecular size as the wild type (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1–3). The lower molecular weight band in lanes 1–3represents translation products initiated from the second methionine residue. In the presence of microsomes (Fig. 2 a, lanes 4–6), the initiation of translation was more accurate, with only a single translation product for each of the constructs. A reduction in the molecular size can be clearly demonstrated when wt pre-α1(X) chains (Fig. 2 a, lane 1) were processed to α1(X) chains (Fig. 2 a, lane 4). In contrast, the mutant translation products remained as pre-α1(X) chains with no apparent reduction in the molecular size (Fig. 2 a,lanes 5 and 6).Figure 2Cell-free translation of normal and mutant collagen X chains. The normal and mutant cDNA constructs were transcribed and translated in a coupled cell-free translation system (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The resultant [35S]methionine-labeled products were analyzed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Translations were carried out either in the presence (+) or the absence (−) of microsomal membranes. Inpanel a, the total translation mix was analyzed, whereas inpanel b, the reticulocyte lysate (L) and microsomal membrane (M) fractions were separated prior to electrophoresis. The identity of the lanes, the migration positions of pre-α1(X) chains containing the signal sequence, α1(X) chains after cleavage of this sequence, and trimeric α1(X)3 components are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Translation in the presence of microsomes promoted trimer association for wt as well as G18R and G18D translation products (Fig.2 a, lanes 4–6). The homotrimers for G18R and G18D chains migrated with a slightly increased molecular size, suggesting that the mutant trimers contain chains with an unprocessed signal peptide. When microsomes were separated from the reticulocyte lysate prior to analysis, both the mutant and wild-type translation products were found predominately in the microsome fraction (Fig.2 b). The radioactive trimer and monomer components of the translation products were quantified using phosphor imaging. Trimer quantity expressed as percentage of the total translation product (trimers + monomers) was used as a measure of the efficiency of trimer assembly. The percentages of mutant pre-α1(X) chains that assembled into homotrimers were determined to be 20 ± 4.5% (n = 3) for G18R, 27 ± 5.5% (n = 3) for G18D, and 40 ± 6.5% (n = 3) for wild type. Because SMCD is an autosomal dominant disorder, an important consideration is whether the mutant pre-α1(X) chains are able to associate into heterotrimers with normal α1(X) chains. To address this issue, reporter (helixΔ) and SPm plasmids were cotranscribed and translated in the presence of microsomes. The helixΔ plasmid is an α1(X) construct, which contains a shortened triple helical domain but has normal NC1 and NC2 domains, and a normal signal peptide sequence. This construct has been used previously to generate a protein reporter, which allows the ability of mutant chains to assemble into heterotrimers in cotranslation experiments to be assessed (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the SPmchains can assemble with the helixΔ chains, the stoichiometry of these complexes can readily be determined by assessing the electrophoretic migration of the multimers. All translation products were localized to the microsomal membrane fraction (Fig. 3). Cotranslation of the SPm or wt transcripts with the helixΔ transcripts showed that in addition to the trimeric components of each product, two additional intermediate multimeric bands, labeled as a andb, were also observed (Fig. 3, lanes 8–10). This is consistent with band a containing heterotrimers of two pre-α1(X) or wt chains and one helixΔ α1(X) chain, and band b containing heterotrimers of one pre-α1(X) or wt chain and two helixΔ α1(X) chains. When compared with the cotranslation products of wt and helixΔ transcripts (Fig. 3, lane 8), bands a and b in lanes 9 and 10 (Fig.3) migrated with a slight increase in their apparent molecular sizes. To assess trimer assembly efficiency, the trimer bands, α1(X)3/pre-α1(X)3, band a,band b, and helixΔα1(X)3 in lanes 8–10, were quantified using phosphor imaging to estimate trimer assembly preference (Table II). The data showed that relative to the formation of helixΔα1(X)3, the formation of trimers containing one or more SPm chains in cotranslations with helixΔ is less efficient compared with cotranslations of wt with helixΔ. In cotranslational experiments of SPm and helixΔ chains, the assembly of heterotrimers containing one or two SPm chains appears to be more favored then the assembly of SPm homotrimers.Table IIRelative trimer concentrations formed in cell-free co-translation experimentspre-α1(X)3/ α1(X)3Heterotrimer band aHeterotrimer band bhelix Δ α1(X)3Wt + helix Δ0.81.21.21G18R + helix Δ0.10.60.81G18D + helix Δ0.10.50.71To assess trimer assembly efficiency, the trimer bands, α1(X)3/pre-α1(X)3, band a, band b, and helix Δ α1(X)3, in lanes 8–10 of Figure 3 were quantified using phosphor imaging to estimate trimer assembly preference. For each co-translation experiment, the values were calculated relative to helix Δ α1(X)3, which was set to unity. The values represent the average of three experiments.

For each co-translation experiment, the values were calculated relative to helix Δ α1(X)3, which was set to unity. The values represent the average of three experiments. Treatment of membrane vesicles at high pH solubilizes nonmembrane proteins and leaves only integral membrane proteins associated with the sedimentable lipid bilayers (18Nothwehr S.F. Hoeltzli S.D. Allen K.L. Lively M.O. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following cell-free synthesis in the presence of microsomes, the vesicles were treated with 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5 and centrifuged to determine whether the mutant chains remain integrated with the lipid bilayer. This approach revealed that the majority of the monomers and trimers containing uncleaved SPm chains associate primarily with the membrane pellet (Fig. 4 a). Thus it appears that, in the absence of cleavage by signal peptidase, mutant pre-α1(X) chains remain anchored to the translocons and behave as integral membrane components. We observed a similar pattern for cotranslation products of trimers containing SPm chains with an uncleaved signal peptide, which were preferentially retained in the membrane-bound fraction following treatment with Na2CO3 (Fig. 4 b). These included mutant pre-α1(X)3 homotrimers and the heterotrimers labeled a and b described above (Fig.4 b, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the homotrimers of the reporter (helixΔ), wt chains, and heterotrimers of helixΔ and wt chains, were found predominantly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 4 b, lanes 4–6). The in vitrocell-free system does not promote stable triple helix formation because of the lack of appropriate post-translational modifying enzymes (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To address the issue of helix formation, secretion, and the fate of the mutant chains, normal and mutant plasmids were transiently transfected into cells. Expression studies in UMR-106-01 cells, a collagen-producing osteoblast-like cell line, indicated that the wt chains assembled as trimers (Fig. 5), forming stable triple helical molecules (Fig.6), which were secreted efficiently by the cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, whereas the SPm chains (G18R and G18D) associated into homotrimers intracellularly (Fig. 5), they were sensitive to pepsin digestion (Fig. 6), demonstrating a lack of helical configuration. In Fig. 6, the pepsin-resistant α1(I) and α2(I) chains are endogenous collagen I expressed by the UMR106-01 cells and were present in control untransfected cells that were only infected with the vTF7-3 virus. Secretion of the mutant chains was also severely impaired as no immunoprecipitable products could be detected in the medium fractions over the 2-h chase period (Fig. 5).Figure 6SPm collagen X homotrimers failed to form stable triple helical molecules in transfected UMR106-01 cells. Transfections and biosynthetic pulse labeling withl-[35S]methionine were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell fractions after 1 h of chase were harvested. Protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with (+ pepsin) or without (− pepsin) digestion by pepsin. The position of collagen X trimers (α1(X) 3), and the pepsin-resistant α1(I) and α2(I) chains of collagen I and α1(X)P of collagen X are indicated. The bands labeled as procollagen I chains represent procollagen I α-chains and various processed intermediates containing N- or C-propeptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Even though SPm trimers or chains were not secreted, the intracellular concentration decreases over the chase period, suggesting that the mutant chains are being degraded intracellularly (Fig. 5). To determine the likely degradative pathway involved, cells were treated from the preincubation period with either a proteasome inhibitor (clasto-lactacystin β-lactone) or a vesicular transport inhibitor for the endosome/lysosome pathway (brefeldin A). The concentration of mutant collagen X was compared after 1 h of the chase period. Cells transfected with the G18R or G18D constructs showed a similar response (Fig.7). Incubation with brefeldin A resulted in a 4-fold increase in intracellular mutant chains compared with untreated cells and an approximately 8-fold increase was observed in the presence of clasto-lactacystin β-lactone. Signal peptide sequences of secreted proteins share common features that include a net positive charge at the N terminus, a central hydrophobic region, and a C-terminal region with small nonpolar amino acids at positions −1 and −3 from the cleavage site (12Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The −1 position of the putative signal peptide in collagen X is Gly18 (2Thomas J.T. Cresswell C.J. Rash B. Nicolai H. Jones T. Solomon E. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In view of the common requirement for signal peptide sequences, the G18R and G18D mutations are significant, changing the nonpolar glycine residue at the −1 position to the highly charged arginine or aspartate residues. Based on reports of signal sequence mutations in other secretory proteins (15Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5735-5740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the most likely consequence of these mutations is impaired cleavage of the signal peptide and inhibition of collagen X secretion. Cell-free translations in the presence of microsomal membranes will allow the interaction of the signal recognition particle with the newly synthesized polypeptides, followed by docking and translocation into the microsome vesicles, where cleavage of the signal peptide will occur (20Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This system was utilized to test whether the G18R and G18D mutations in COL10A1alter these events. When microsomes were separated from the reticulocyte lysate following translation, the translation products of wt, G18R, and G18D were found associated with the microsome vesicles. Only small amounts of translation product remained in the reticulocyte lysate thus showing no indication of a preferential retention of mutant chains in the reticulocyte lysate when compared with wt translation. This suggests that interaction with the signal recognition particle and targeting to the translocons are not affected, as the mutant chains are delivered to the microsome vesicles during cell-free synthesis. Translocation into the lumen of the microsome vesicles was also not affected because we were able to demonstrate that the translation products are inside the microsomes with a protease protection assay using exogenous trypsin and chymotrypsin (data not shown). As the exogenous proteases cannot enter the vesicle, the presence of intact pre-α1(X) chains implies that they are inside the microsomes (15Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5735-5740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our in vitro data suggest that signal peptidase failed to recognize or cannot cleave the mutant sites. With no cleavage, the mutant pre-α1(X) chains would not be released from the translocons and remain anchored to the microsomal membranes. The molecular consequence of mutations involving the signal peptide has not been characterized in the collagen family of proteins or other matrix components. However, there are a number of reports characterizing signal peptide mutations in secreted proteins that are associated with several diseases. For example, in human coagulation factor X deficiency (15Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5735-5740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and diabetes insipidus (19Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Beuret N. Rutishauser J. Bider M.D. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18965-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), signal peptide mutations have been identified in factor X and prepro-vasopressin, respectively. For these nonmatrix-secreted proteins, failure to cleave the signal peptide resulted in intracellular retention of the mutant products, with a severe reduction in the amount of circulating protein and protein activity. As shown by pulse-chase analysis in transiently transfected cells, impaired secretion of the mutant collagen X chains is clearly evident in the two cases reported here. That the nonsecreted SPmchains are targeted for intracellular degradation is supported by the continued decline of intracellular levels of SPm chains over the chase period in the absence of secretion. The precise mechanism(s) for this intracellular degradation is not clear at this stage. Our preliminary study using inhibitors of lysosomal and proteasome pathways suggests that both degradative pathways may be involved. However, the more significant level of protection from degradation shown by the proteasome inhibitor,clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, suggests this could be the major degradative pathway. The ability of SPm chains to associate into homo- and heterotrimers contrasts with our previous reports on SMCD mutations in the NC1 domain, where in vitro association of NC1 mutant collagen X chains was impaired (1Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although SPm chains do associate into homo- and heterotrimers, there appears to be some constraint on the nature of the trimers that are formed. In cell-free translation experiments expressing SPm or wt chains, we noted that the assembly of SPm pre-α1(X) chains into homotrimers was less efficient relative to the assembly of wt homotrimers. When cotranslated with helixΔ α1(X) chains, SPm chains showed a preference for assembly into heterotrimers over SPm homotrimers, with heterotrimers containing one SPm chain most favored. Collagen X triple helix formation is initiated via nucleation and extension following the assembly of the C-terminal NC1 domains, so a possible reason why heterotrimers are preferred is the physical constraint imposed by the anchoring of SPm chains to the membrane. For the formation of homotrimers, only chains that are close enough will be able to associate; however, this constraint will have a lesser effect on the formation of heterotrimers containing two SPm chains, and be smallest for heterotrimers containing one SPm chain. We reason that whereas SPmchains can associate into homo- and heterotrimers via the NC1 domainin vivo, folding of SPm chain-containing molecules into a triple helix is likely to be inefficient because the N termini will be anchored to the ER membrane. A lack of stable triple helical structure was demonstrated for SPm homotrimers by the absence of intracellular pepsin resistance SPm collagen X molecules in transfected cells. The precise impact on the level of available normal molecules in vivo is not clear. In transient transfected cells, it is difficult to make reliable assessments of the yield of trimers because of the variable transfection efficiency and the added complication of intracellular degradation. However, we noted a reduction of ∼60% in the amount of collagen X molecules secreted in a cotransfection experiment (data not shown), supporting a dominant-negative effect of SPm chains that could affect the level of normal collagen X molecules. We propose that SPm chains anchored to the translocons impair triple helix formation, and the unfolded chains are removed from the ER by retrograde translocation and targeted for degradation via the proteasome pathway (22Fitzgerald J. Lamandé S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27392-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It would appear that although the signal peptide mutations and the NC1 SMCD mutations reported previously (6Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) are at opposite ends of the molecule and have different molecular effects on collagen X biosynthesis, the net phenotype is similar, with intracellular retention and degradation of mutant collagen X. The fact that both types of mutations should give rise to SMCD is consistent with a similar molecular consequence for the mutations. Whereas an apparent 50% reduction in collagen X level has been shown in one patient to be a mechanism for SMCD (7Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this may not be the only mechanism. The current finding together with other in vitro studies (8Chan D. Freddi S. Weng Y.M. Bateman J.F. J.

Intracellular retention and active degradation processes of collagen molecules containing mutant chains could lead to deregulated cellular metabolism, altering cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. These are the critical cellular events in endochondral ossification that induce precise alterations in the ECM. An imbalanced ECM not only compromises matrix integrity but also alters cell-matrix interactions, eliciting aberrant cellular responses with unknown consequences. Further understanding of the impact of SPmand COL10-NC1m SMCD mutations on the metabolism and differentiation of chondrocytes in the growth plate will need to await investigation of these mutations in animal models.

In addition to its association with Ras, GAP has been shown to bind to several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells stimulated by growth factors or expressing transforming tyrosine kinase variants. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel GAP-binding protein, mTid-1, a DnaJ chaperone protein that represents the murine homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid gene. Three alternatively spliced variants of mTid-1 were isolated, two of which correspond to the recently identified hTid-1L and hTid-1S forms of the human TID1 gene that exhibit opposing effects on apoptosis. We demonstrate that both cytoplasmic precursor and mitochondrial mature forms of mTid-1 associate with GAP in vivo. Interestingly, although mTid-1 is found tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-src-transformed fibroblast cells, GAP selectively binds to the unphosphorylated form of mTid-1. In immunofluorescence experiments, GAP and Tid-1 were shown to colocalize at perinuclear mitochondrial membranes in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. These findings raise the possibility that Tid chaperone proteins may play a role in governing the conformation, activity, and/or subcellular distribution of GAP, thereby influencing its biochemical and biological activity within cells. p120 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) down-regulates Ras by stimulating GTP hydrolysis of active Ras.

Three alternatively spliced variants of mTid-1 were isolated, two of which correspond to the recently identified hTid-1L and hTid-1S forms of the human TID1 gene that exhibit opposing effects on apoptosis. We demonstrate that both cytoplasmic precursor and mitochondrial mature forms of mTid-1 associate with GAP in vivo. Interestingly, although mTid-1 is found tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-src-transformed fibroblast cells, GAP selectively binds to the unphosphorylated form of mTid-1. In immunofluorescence experiments, GAP and Tid-1 were shown to colocalize at perinuclear mitochondrial membranes in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. These findings raise the possibility that Tid chaperone proteins may play a role in governing the conformation, activity, and/or subcellular distribution of GAP, thereby influencing its biochemical and biological activity within cells. As a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Ras cycles between an active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformation (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Ras activity is attributed to the cytosolic Ras GTPase-activating Protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are:GAPGTPase-activating proteinSHsrc homologyHspheat shock proteinEGFepidermal growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered saline (2Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). GAP stimulates the weak intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras, accelerating the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating mitogenic signals elicited by Ras proteins. In addition to its role as a negative regulator of Ras, it has been suggested that GAP may exert an effector function in the control of cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration (3McGlade J.

Gish G. van der Geer P. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although Ras binding and catalytic activity of GAP reside in its C terminus, the N-terminal sequences consist of a number of conserved protein modules including src-homology (SH) 2 and 3 protein interaction domains that facilitate the formation of signaling complexes, which may couple GAP to upstream regulators of Ras or downstream effector targets (5Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Indeed, activated tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate GAP also promote its association via its SH2 domains, with several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, including members of the p62dok family of proteins (6Molloy C.J.

Moreover, its hyperphosphorylation levels correlate with the transformation phenotype of these oncogenic products (7Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 15DeClue J.E. Vass W.C. Johnson M.R. Stacey D.W. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6799-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that at least some of the transforming capabilities of oncogenic tyrosine kinases might be conferred by p62dok by virtue of its constitutive occupancy of the SH2 domains of GAP, which may have negative regulatory effects on GAP activity. Consistent with this notion, the binding of phosphorylated p62dok to GAP has been shown to significantly impair the GTPase-promoting activity of GAP towards Ras in vitro (16Kashige N. Carpino N. Kobayashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, p190 functions as a Rho/Rac GTPase-activating protein and may serve as a RasGAP effector, providing an interface between the Ras-signaling pathway and proteins of the Rho/Rac pathway that regulate the cytoskeletal architecture of the cell (13Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Searching for GAP-associated proteins is therefore of particular interest as it may lead to the identification of novel cellular components which may play an important role in Ras regulation and also, in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms by which oncogenic tyrosine kinases may effect transformation. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel GAP-binding protein, mTid-1, a DnaJ chaperone protein that represents the murine homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid gene (17Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Renthrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the recently identified human Tid (TID1) gene (18Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating protein src homology heat shock protein epidermal growth factor phosphate-buffered saline The ubiquitously expressed DnaJ family of proteins serve as regulatory factors to the evolutionary conserved heat shock 70 (Hsp70) superfamily of molecular chaperones (19Cyr D.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This protein family is defined by a highly conserved J-domain, which functions as the binding region for Hsp70 chaperones and orchestrates their interaction with specific substrates (21Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 305-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hsp70 proteins and their associated DnaJ co-chaperone mediate a variety of cellular activities including the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the translocation of proteins across membranes, and assembly of multimeric protein complexes (22Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3116) Google Scholar, 23Medema R.H. de Laat W.L. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). More recently, genetic and biochemical studies have implicated DnaJ and Hsp70 proteins as important components of intracellular signaling pathways linked to cell survival and growth regulation. In this context, they regulate many facets of the signaling process that have been described for protein modules such as pleckstrin homology SH2 and SH3 domains, namely subcellular localization, regulation of enzymatic activity, and enzyme/substrate recognition (5Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). For example, genetic studies of v-src toxicity in yeast indicate that the DnaJ protein, Ydj1, is necessary for the correct subcellular targeting and kinase activation of v-src (26Dey B. Caplan A.J. Boschelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Xu Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Ydj1 has also been implicated as a positive regulator of cell cycle progression essential for efficient recognition and phosphorylation of cyclin CLN3 by cdc28, events that signal CLN3 degradation (28Yaglom J.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additional biochemical evidence suggests that members of the DnaJ and Hsp70 family interact with and modulate the growth-suppressive properties of several tumor suppressor proteins, including p53, Wilms' tumor suppressor (WT1), retinoblastoma (Rb) and the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR (29Hansen S.

Gundacker D. Renthrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recessive mutations at the l(2)tid locus causes defects in differentiation and morphogenesis of larval imaginal discs leading to neoplastic growth of these cells into lethal tumors. hTid-1, the human homologue of the l(2)tid-encoded protein Tid56, was recently isolated in a screen for cellular substrates of the human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein (18Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two splice variants, hTid-1L and hTid-1S, have been identified. Interestingly, although both have been reported to localize to the mitochondria, they seem to display opposing effects on apoptosis. Notably, hTid-1S suppresses cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation in response to tumor necrosis factor α stimulation, whereas hTid-1L enhances the apoptogenic effects of the tumor necrosis factor α receptor (37Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that mTid-1, a novel member of the Tid family of chaperone proteins, complexes with GAP both in vitro and in vivo in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. Immunofluorescence experiments reveal that Tid-1 proteins are localized to the cytosol, mitochondria, or nucleus, depending on the particular cell type. Moreover, in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation, GAP and Tid-1 colocalize to distinct perinuclear subdomains resembling mitochondrial membranes. Furthermore, we present evidence that Tid-1 can associate with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperones. These findings suggest a possible novel role for GAP in collaboration with Tid-1·Hsp 70 chaperone complexes in the integration of mitogenic-signaling pathways at the plasma membrane and control of apoptotic signal transduction at mitochondrial membranes. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, Rat2 fibroblasts, COS-1 monkey kidney, SAOS-2 human osteosarcoma, and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies). S7a cells (v-src transformed Rat-2 fibroblasts) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20) and p120 RasGAP (GAP) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); mitochondrial Hsp70 (Grp 75, MA3-028) antibodies were from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Rat monoclonal Hsc70 (SPA-815) and rabbit polyclonal Hsp70 (SPA-812) antibodies were obtained from Stressgen Corp. (Victoria, BC). Mouse monoclonal 2G2 antibody (M00120) to an as yet uncharacterized integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane was obtained from Bionostics (Toronto, ON). Rabbit antisera raised against a bacterial fusion protein TrpE-GAP (GAP amino acid residues 171–448) was kindly provided by T. Pawson. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to murine Tid-1 were generated using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expressing the C-terminal 91 amino acid residues (389) of mTid-1. Affinity purification of mouse Tid-1 antibodies for immunofluorescence was carried out as described (38Stepanova L. Finegold M. DeMayo F. Schmidt E.V. Harper J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4462-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding full-length mTid-1L (amino acid residues 1–480), mTid-1I (residues 1–453), and mTid-1S(residues 1–429) were subcloned into pcDNA3 and pcDNA3-MYC expression vectors (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed by calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation methods. M3.2 cDNA encoding mouse Tid-1I sequences (amino acid residues 9–453) was in vitro transcribed and translated using a T′N′T kit (Promega) with T7 polymerase according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Radiolabeled proteins (8 μl) derived from reactions either containing or lacking M3.2 cDNA as template were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-mTid-1 antibodies. Labeled M3.2 proteins were also mixed with 1 ml of S7a cell lysate, prepared in PLC buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies to GAP or with normal rabbit serum as a control. Immune complexes were washed three times with PLC buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in ice-cold PLC buffer. Before lysis and immunoprecipitation with Hsp70 antibody, NIH 3T3 cells were heat-shocked for 1 h in a water bath heated to 43 °C and returned to 37 °C for 6 h to allow for Hsp70 accumulation. For immunoprecipitation experiments with Hsc70, cells were lysed in buffer that either contained or lacked 10 mm ATP. All cell lysates were normalized for protein content before immunoprecipitation with the corresponding antibody. Typically, 1 mg of protein was used in immunoprecipitations, and 50 μg of protein was used for whole cell lysates. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation with the respective primary antibody and subsequently with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, proteins were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was extracted from FVB mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and blotted onto a ζ-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). A 733-base pair fragment corresponding to nucleotides 690–1482 of mouse Tid-lI cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to probe the blot. Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as a quantitative control. Membranes were stripped and reprobed for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as control. Hybridizations were carried out according to the method of Church and Gilbert (39Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3, SAOS-2, and COS-1 cells were seeded into six-well plates containing glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with mTid-1 expression plasmids were plated 24 h after transfection. For mitochondrial staining with rhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes Inc.), cells were incubated 10 min with a 1:4000 dilution of a 2.5 mm stock in PBS. Culture media was then added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Staining of mitochondria with MitoTracker® mitochondrion-selective dye (Molecular Probes Inc.) was done as per the manufacturer's instructions using a working concentration of 50 nm. Slides were washed with PBS then subjected to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, rinsed, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5% goat serum containing affinity-purified mTid-1 antibody at 15 μg/ml. For double-labeling, a mixture of mTid-1 antibody and mitochondrial 2G2 antibody was used. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mixture of Alexa™488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa™546 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes Inc.), each diluted 1:200 in PBS. For nuclei staining, cells were incubated for 10 min with a 1:100 dilution of 10 μg/ml Hoechst stain. Cells were viewed and photographed using a Leitz Diaplan fluorescent microscope. For GAP and Tid-1 colocalization experiments, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Intergen) as described (40Wang Z. Tung P.S. Moran M.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 123-133PubMed Google Scholar). Fixation, permeabilization, and incubation with secondary antibodies and Hoechst were done as described above. Cells were incubated in 5% goat serum containing a mixture of mTid-1 and mouse monoclonal RasGAP antibody for 1 h. To ensure no cross-reactivity between secondary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine channels, control experiments were performed with cells stained for only one of mTid-1 or RasGAP antibodies and illuminated with two different filter sets, respectively. In an attempt to identify binding partners of GAP, we tested products of cDNA clones that had been isolated from a mouse mammary cDNA library in a separate screen for novel cellular targets of oncogenic v-src tyrosine kinase (data not shown) for their ability to bind to GAPin vitro. The product of one clone, M3.2, spanned an open reading frame of 445 amino acids and exhibited a high degree of sequence identity with the protein product of the Drosophilatumorous imaginal disc l(2)tid gene, Tid56 (17Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Renthrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the recently identified human TID1 gene, hTid-1 (18Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We refer to this murine homologue of hTid-1 as mTid-1. The ability of mTid-1 to interact with GAP was tested in vitro by determining whether products of in vitro transcribed and translated M3.2 cDNA could interact with GAP present in lysates from v-src-transformed Rat2 fibroblasts (S7a). As shown in Fig.1, a single radiolabeled translation product of ∼48 kDa was immunoprecipitated by mTid-1-specific antibodies raised against the C-terminal residues of M3.2 expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing M3.2 cDNA (lane M3.2) but not in the control lysate lacking a DNA template (lane C). The 48-kDa protein was also observed in GAP immune complexes after incubation of [35S]methionine-labeled M3.2 translation products with S7a lysates, suggesting that mTid-1 is capable of associating with GAP proteins. Full-length mouse Tid-1 cDNA was obtained by further screening of a mouse thymus cDNA library using M3.2 as a probe. As shown schematically in Fig.2A, both mouse and human Tid-1 cDNAs encode proteins of 480 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 53 kDa. Overall, mouse and human Tid-1 proteins are 87.5% identical, with the lowest degree of similarity residing in the first 88 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence of mTid-1 revealed typical modular features common to DnaJ chaperone proteins, including an N-terminal J-domain, displaying ∼95 and 69% identity with that of hTid-1 and Drosophila Tid56, respectively; a glycine/phenylalanine-rich hinge region, separating the J-domain from a zinc finger-like region that contains four repeats of the sequence CXXCXGXG (whereX denotes any amino acid) and is thought to stabilize the interaction of the target substrates with the Hsp70 chaperone machinery (41Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); and a less conserved C-terminal domain, exhibiting ∼92 and 39% identity with hTid-1 and Drosophila Tid56, respectively, thought to be involved in substrate binding. Flanking the N terminus of the J-domain is a mitochondrial cleavage motif (LRP-GV) (42Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) common to hTid-1 and other polypeptides targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. This would suggest murine Tid-1 proteins, like theirDrosophila and human counterparts, may also be localized to the mitochondria. Three alternatively spliced variants of mouse Tid-1 were isolated from a mouse thymus cDNA library (Fig. 2B). The long form, mTid-1L, corresponds to the full-length 480-amino acid protein. In the intermediate form mTid-1I, the C-terminal amino acids 447–480 of mTid-1L, corresponding precisely to exon 11 of the human TID1 gene, are spliced and replaced with six amino acids, KRSTGN, located within a downstream exon. 2X. Yin, and M. Rozakis-Adcock, manuscript in preparation. Notably, the partial M3.2 cDNA clone spans amino acid residues 9–453 of mTid-1I. Both the long and intermediate forms of mTid-1 agree with the previously reported human hTid-1L and hTid-1S alternative splice variants (37Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which we will refer to herein as hTid-1L and hTid-1I,respectively. The third and shortest variant, mTid-1S, contains an in-frame deletion of 50 amino acids (codons 211–260). This deletion, which corresponds precisely to exon 5 of the humanTID1 gene,2 results in a loss of two of the four CXXCXGXG motifs. Although DnaJ proteins containing only two cysteine-rich repeats have yet to be identified, DnaJ homologs lacking the zinc finger motif altogether have already been characterized and shown to exhibit some chaperone activity (17Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Renthrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 305-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of mTid-1 mRNA in several mouse tissues was determined by Northern blot analysis using a mTid-1I cDNA fragment (nucleotides 690–1482) as a probe. As depicted in Fig. 2C, a single transcript of ∼2.6 kilobases is highly expressed in each tissue examined. This contrasts to the variable expression observed of hTid-1 mRNA in human tissues, where strong signals are detected primarily in heart, liver, and skeletal muscle (18Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A prominent band of ∼1.9 kilobases is also evident in mouse testis. The identity of this mRNA species is not known. Since transcripts encoding mTid-1L, mTid-1I, and mTid-1S differ by less than 150 nucleotides, it is not possible to resolve individual mRNA species by Northern blot analysis. To detect endogenous mTid-1 proteins, cell lysates from Rat2 (R2) fibroblasts were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies raised to mTid-1I. Two major forms of mTid-1, migrating as a doublet with apparent molecular sizes of 40 and 43 kDa, were identified (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in several tumor cell lines screened by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates, an additional band was observed with an approximate molecular mass of 46–48 kDa (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Ectopic expression of mTid-1L and mTid-1I in COS-1 cells gave rise to prominent bands that comigrate with the 43- and 40-kDa endogenous forms of Tid-1, respectively (Fig. 3C). Although transfection of the recombinant mTid-1S cDNA construct generated high levels of mTid-1 proteins of the predicted 38-kDa size, the endogenous short mTid-1S form was not readily observed in any of the cell lysates examined. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis has revealed that mTid-1S transcripts are selectively expressed in mouse thymus, kidney, and liver (data not shown). Transient expression of the long, intermediate, and short isoforms of mTid-1 also gives rise to additional higher molecular mass polypeptides of apparent molecular sizes of 50, 48, and 46 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3C). As noted above, the mTid-1 protein is characterized by a mitochondrial cleavage signal situated between residues 63 and 67. Because most mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded, they are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and processed to a mature form upon import into the mitochondria (42Gavel Y. von Heijne G.

Therefore, the higher molecular mass proteins in the 46–50-kDa range observed in tumor and transfected cells likely represent cytoplasmic precursors of the mature mitochondrial forms. This suggestion is supported by the identification of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrially localized Drosophila l(2)tid-encoded proteins, believed to represent the Tid56 precursor and matu"

It contains a series of discrete protein-protein interaction domains including two contiguous C-terminal PDZ domains. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with the PDZ domains of human X11α, and we isolated a clone encoding domains II and III of the copper chaperone for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase-1 (CCS). The X11α/CCS interaction was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation studies plus glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays and was shown to be mediated via PDZ2 of X11α and a sequence within the carboxyl terminus of domain III of CCS. CCS delivers the copper cofactor to the antioxidant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) enzyme and is required for its activity. Overexpression of X11α inhibited SOD1 activity in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells which suggests that X11α binding to CCS is inhibitory to SOD1 activation. X11α also interacts with another copper-binding protein found in neurons, the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein. Thus, X11α may participate in copper homeostasis within neurons.

These, and a variety of other less well characterized protein-protein interaction regions (Fig. 1 A), mediate the binding of the X11s to a number of proteins. X11α binds to the pre-synaptic adaptor protein CASK via a sequence preceding the phosphotyrosine binding domain (9Borg J.P. Lopez-Figueroa M.O. De Taddéo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Turner R.S. Watson S.J.

CASK also binds both Veli1 and members of the neurexin family of pre-synaptic membrane-spanning proteins (14Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C.

The X11α-CASK-Veli pre-synaptic complex is highly evolutionarily conserved and is found in orthologous form in Caenorhabditis elegans as the LIN-10-LIN-2-LIN-7 complex (17Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.M.

Via its first PDZ domain (PDZ1), X11α has been reported to bind both the kinesin superfamily motor protein KIF17 (20Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.-H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and the C terminus of the N-type Ca2+ channel pore-forming α1B-subunit, which in turn can bind the SH3 region of CASK (21Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Finally, we have shown that X11α binds, via both of its PDZ domains, to presenilin-1 and mediates interactions between presenilin-1 and APP (22Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to several other PDZ-bearing proteins (for reviews see Refs. 13Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar and23Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), X11α appears to provide a framework, or scaffolding, for the assembly of multimolecular complexes and functions in the trafficking and sorting of proteins to different neuronal compartments. The full complement of ligands that bind to the X11 proteins is not yet known. In this study, we demonstrate that, via its second PDZ domain (PDZ2), X11α interacts with the copper chaperone for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (CCS). CCS delivers and inserts the copper cofactor into the antioxidant enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and is required for its activation (24Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J.

We also demonstrate that overexpression of X11α inhibits SOD1 activity in transfected cells, consistent with a role for X11α in regulating CCS function and SOD1 activation. Interactive cloning experiments, including relevant controls, were performed as described previously (2McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In brief, the sequence encoding the two human X11α PDZ domains (PDZ1 and -2; X11α amino acid sequence 649–837) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (22Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), subcloned into the EcoRI site of the yeast “bait” vector pY3 (29Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and used to screen a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). Yeast colonies were grown using selective media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Vigorously growing colonies were subjected to freeze-fracture β-galactosidase assays, and candidate library plasmids were rescued from positive colonies by transformation intoEscherichia coli HB101. Brain library cDNA inserts were sequenced using a Cyclist Exo− Pfu DNA sequencing kit (Stratagene). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and rat primary cortical neurones were cultured as described previously (8McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.-P. Leroy K. Miller C.C.J. Eur. J.

Full-length C-terminal Myc-tagged human X11α was as described previously (22Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell.

X11α was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against X11α-(161–421) (22Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The same immunogen was also used to generate mouse polyclonal antibodies. Antibody specificity was confirmed by competing out signals with immunogen (data not shown). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against CCS residues 1–85 were used to detect CCS (26Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). SOD1 sheep polyclonal antibody was purchased from Calbiochem, and the 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. CHO cells were doubly or singly transfected as indicated with Myc-tagged X11α, CCS, and SOD1. Transfected cells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. In binding studies with transfected SOD1, the cell lysates also underwent one freeze-thaw cycle (26Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation studies the supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Myc-tagged X11α was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total protein lysate using antibody 9E10. The antibody was captured using protein A-Sepharose beads that were then washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (8McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.-P. Leroy K. Miller C.C.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with X11α PDZ1-(649–746), PDZ2-(742–837), and PDZ1 + 2-(649–837) were as described (22Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The partial CCS clone (CCS-(48–274)) isolated in the library screen encoded the C-terminal 227 amino acids of CCS, incorporating the C-terminal 39 residues of domain I and all of domains II and III of CCS (Fig. 1 B). Digestion of this clone withBglII released cDNAs encoding CCS-(48–241) and CCS-(243–274) that were subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CCS-(48–241) encompasses all of domain II of CCS (amino acids 87–234), whereas CCS-(243–274) encodes the C-terminal 32 amino acids of CCS including the CXC copper-binding motif (31Schmidt P.J.

Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins, plus their use as ligands in pull-down binding assays, were essentially as described (22Lau K.-F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 555-563Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation and GST fusion assays to confirm the X11α and CCS interaction were performed three times with similar results. Transfected CHO cells and rat neuronal cultures were fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence as described (8McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.-P. Leroy K. Miller C.C.J. Eur. J.

X11α was detected in transfected CHO cells using the 9E10 antibody to the Myc tag; endogenous X11α in primary rat cortical neurons was detected with the mouse X11α antiserum. The rabbit antiserum was used to detect CCS in both transfected CHO cells and in neurons. Antibodies were visualized by goat anti-mouse Igs coupled to Texas Red and goat anti-rabbit Igs coupled to Oregon Green (Molecular Probes). CHO cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of SOD1, X11α, and CCS DNA as indicated; transfections receiving only one or two plasmids were balanced with empty vector such that all received the same total amount of DNA. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping into cold PBS, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended and lysed in water by a freeze-thaw cycle as described (35Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

A sample of each supernatant was removed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses; the remainder was adjusted to 0.125 m Tris chloride, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (35Borchelt D.R.

A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). 30 μg of protein from each sample was run on 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and SOD1 activities were determined by nitro blue tetrazolium in-gel staining assays as described (36Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). 1 μg of protein from each supernatant sample was analyzed by immunoblotting to determine the expression of SOD1, X11α, and CCS. Protein quantities were assayed using Bradford reagent (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's instructions. SOD1 activity assay gels and immunoblots were further analyzed by pixel densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS710 scanner and Quantity 1 software to obtain the ratio of SOD1 activity to expressed protein level for each sample (35Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Within each set of transfections, this ratio was set at 100% for the SOD1-only transfected cells, and the remaining activities were expressed relative to this. Data from three separate sets of transfections were analyzed together using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. To identify binding partners for the X11α PDZ1 + 2 region, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human brain cDNA library. A cDNA encoding the C-terminal 227 amino acids of CCS (CCS-(48–274)) was isolated (Fig.1 B). To investigate if the full-length proteins could interact in mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from X11α, CCS, and X11α/CCS cotransfected CHO cells. X11α was immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 antibody to the Myc tag. CCS was present only in immunoprecipitates obtained from X11α/CCS-cotransfected cells but not X11α or CCS alone transfected cells (Fig.2 A). Thus CCS coimmunoprecipitates with X11α from transfected CHO cells. Human CCS is comprised of three functional domains (31Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain I (amino acids 1–86) is homologous to the secretory pathway copper chaperone HAH1 and its yeast ortholog Atx1p (37Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar); the central domain II is ∼50% identical to SOD1 (24Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar); and the C-terminal domain III is unique to CCS (Fig. 1 B). As all of domain II of CCS was encoded in the CCS cDNA isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen, this raised the possibility that X11α might also interact with SOD1. However, under similar experimental conditions as above, SOD1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with X11α (Fig. 2 B). To map further the regions required for binding of X11α with CCS, we used GST fusion protein binding assays. GST fusion proteins containing X11α PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ1 + 2 were used as baits in pull-down assays from CCS-transfected CHO cells. CCS strongly interacted with PDZ2 and PDZ1 + 2, whereas no interaction could be detected between CCS and PDZ1 or GST alone (Fig.3 A). Since domain II of CCS is homologous to SOD1, we also tested whether SOD1 could bind to the X11α PDZ domain fusion proteins. No interaction between any of the X11α PDZ domains and SOD1 was detected (Fig. 3 A), which is consistent with the immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.2 B). In a complementary series of experiments, we used GST fusion proteins containing different domains of CCS in pull-down experiments from X11α-transfected CHO cells. X11α bound to full-length CCS, CCS-(48–274), which includes both domains II and III and replicates the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen, and also to CCS-(243–274) (i.e. the C-terminal 32 amino acids of domain III) but not to CCS-(48–241). GST alone did not bind X11α (Fig. 3 B). Thus sequences within domain III of CCS mediate the interaction with X11α. The strength of the signals obtained using these CCS baits was generally weaker than those with the X11α baits. However, it is notable that in these experiments the strength of signals obtained with the CCS baits was similar to that obtained with a GST bait containing the C-terminal 47-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of APP (Fig. 3 B), which is known to bind to all X11 proteins (2McLoughlin D.M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We also tested whether the CCS baits would interact with SOD1 in these pull-down assays. Only sequences that included domain II bound SOD1, a finding consistent with previous reports (26Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these binding studies indicate that the interaction between human X11α and CCS is mediated by the second PDZ domain of X11α and sequences within domain III of CCS. Immunocytochemical labeling of X11α/CCS cotransfected CHO cells revealed that both proteins had overlapping distribution patterns, particularly in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 A). X11α and CCS also displayed an overlapping distribution pattern in rat primary cortical neurons where staining for both proteins was particularly pronounced in cell bodies with weaker labeling of neurites (Fig.4 B). These observations are consistent with previous reports that X11α is present in cell bodies, possibly including the Golgi apparatus and to a lesser extent in axons, dendrites, and synapses (9Borg J.P.

Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), and copper is required for SOD1 activity (40Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether expression of X11α could influence SOD1 activity. SOD1 activity assays were performed on mock-transfected CHO cells, and CHO cells transfected with SOD1, SOD1 + X11α, SOD + CCS, and SOD1 + CCS + X11α (Fig.5 A). Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that similar levels of transfected SOD1 were expressed in the different transfections (Fig. 5 B). However, SOD1 activity was significantly reduced in CHO cells expressing X11α (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 8.74, D.F. = 3,p = 0.03; Fig. 5, A and C). This included cells that were not cotransfected with CCS (Fig. 5 A, track 3) which demonstrates inhibition of the action of endogenous CCS by X11α. In the present study we have demonstrated that human X11α interacts with CCS in a variety of biochemical assays and that X11α and CCS display overlapping subcellular distribution patterns in both neurons and transfected CHO cells. The interaction between X11α and CCS is mediated via the second PDZ domain of X11α and sequences within the C-terminal 32 amino acids of CCS. CCS is the first reported ligand specific for PDZ2 of X11α. The prototypical PDZ domain binding sequence is the C-terminal motif X(S/T)X(V/I/L). It is now apparent, however, that PDZ domains bind to a much broader range of C-terminal sequences (for example see Ref. 41Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) and can also bind to internal sequences as well as to other PDZ domains (13Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 23Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L.

It is thus possible that PDZ2 of X11α binds to the C terminus of CCS (i.e. PAHL) or alternatively to an internal sequence within the C-terminal 32 amino acids of domain III. The anti-oxidant enzyme SOD1 catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide anions through redox cycling of the bound copper ion in each monomer (40Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). Copper is delivered to SOD1 via CCS, and CCS is thus required for SOD1 activity (24Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J.

CCS comprises three domains as follows: an N-terminal domain I that is homologous to the Atx1p metallochaperone and that is involved in the recruitment of copper; a central domain II that exhibits homology to SOD1 and that facilitates the interaction of CCS with SOD1; and a C-terminal domain III that also binds copper but that additionally is involved in the interaction with SOD1 (26Casareno R.L.B.

Overexpression of X11α led to a down-regulation of SOD1 activity in transfected CHO cells, and this was not due to an effect of X11α on expression of either SOD1 or CCS (Fig. 5 B). These observations suggest that X11α binding to CCS is inhibitory to CCS function. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial importance of domain III in the delivery of copper from CCS to SOD1 (31Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J.

One suggestion is that domain III extends into the active site of SOD1 to facilitate insertion of copper into the enzyme (31Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V.

Thus, X11α may inhibit SOD1 activity by binding to CCS domain III and disrupting this process in some way. Altered copper homeostasis may be at least part of the pathogenic process in several neurodegenerative diseases (for reviews see Refs. 46Waggoner D.J. Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholarand 47Bush A.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In particular, mutations in SOD1 are the causative genetic defect in some familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (48Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P.

Science. 1993; 261: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). ALS mutant SOD1 proteins can bind CCS, and it has been suggested that mutant SOD1 may exert a toxic effect via altered cellular copper chemistry (25Corson L.B. Strain J.J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to binding CCS, X11α interacts with another copper-binding protein, APP, mutations in which can cause Alzheimer's disease (see for review Ref. 50Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). APP has a conserved copper binding region in its ectodomain (51Hesse L. Beher D. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and may play a role in the transport of copper to different cellular compartments (46Waggoner D.J. Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). APP has been shown to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) upon binding Cu(II) and may thereby mediate copper-induced toxicity and oxidative stress in neurons (52Multhaup G. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Beher D. Ruppert T. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Science. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 53Multhaup G. Ruppert T. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Bill E. Pipkorn R. Masters C.L.

Cappai R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9170-9179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, through its interactions with both CCS and APP, X11α may play a general role in copper homeostasis within neurons. Defective copper metabolism, perhaps involving X11α, may be mechanistic in both ALS and Alzheimer's disease."

Most of the missense mutations on the extracellular face of the receptor introduce additional cysteine residues. Several groups have proposed that these residues might disrupt the conserved disulfide bond of the V2 receptor. To test this hypothesis, we first calculated a structure model of the extracellular receptor domains. The model suggests that the additional cysteine residues may form a second disulfide bond with the free, nonconserved extracellular cysteine residue Cys-195 rather than impairing the conserved bond. To address this question experimentally, we used the NDI-causing mutant receptors G185C and R202C. Their Cys-195 residues were replaced by alanine to eliminate the hypothetical second disulfide bonds. This second site mutation led to functional rescue of both NDI-causing mutant receptors, strongly suggesting that the second disulfide bonds are indeed formed. Furthermore we show that residue Cys-195, which is sensitive to “additional cysteine” mutations, is not conserved among the V2 receptors of other species and that the presence of an uneven number of extracellular cysteine residues, as in the human V2 receptor, is rare among class I G protein-coupled receptors.

The receptor is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the principal epithelial cells of the renal collecting duct, where it mediates the antidiuretic action of the hormone AVP (for review, see Ref. 1Klussmann E. Maric K. Rosenthal W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 141: 32-95Google Scholar). Activation of the V2 receptor leads to stimulation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system. The subsequent rise in intracellular cAMP induces the fusion of vesicles containing water channels (aquaporin 2) with the apical membrane which is thus rendered water permeable. As a consequence, water is reabsorbed from the lumen of the collecting duct. Mutations in the gene of the V2 receptor are the cause of X-linked NDI (for review, see Ref. 2Oksche A. Rosenthal W. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a disease characterized by the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine despite normal or elevated levels of AVP. More than 170 V2 receptor mutations have been documented, approximately half of which are missense mutations. Most of the missense mutations are clustered within the transmembrane domains of the receptor. These mutations usually affect receptor folding in the bilayer and lead to intracellular retention of the misfolded forms by the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum. Compared with the numerous mutations found in the transmembrane domains, only few mutations are located on the cytoplasmic or extracellular faces of the receptor. It is striking that most of the extracellular mutations introduce additional cysteine residues. Such mutations include R106C (3Bichet D.G. Birnbaumer M. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Rosenthal W.

The most obvious explanation for the origin of the defect caused by these additional extracellular cysteine residues is that they impair formation of the single disulfide bond of the V2 receptor which connects residue Cys-112 of the first with Cys-192 of the second extracellular loop and which is conserved in the GPCR family. Several groups have proposed that the mutated residues form an alternative bond with either one of the two conserved cysteine residues (5Pan Y. Wilson P. Gitschier J. J. Biol.

Disease-causing mutations that lead to the introduction of additional cysteine residues have been observed for other GPCRs. The Y178C mutation of rhodopsin was shown to cause retinitis pigmentosa and is suspected to impair the formation of the conserved disulfide bond of this receptor (11Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The analysis of the molecular basis of the defect caused by these “additional cysteine” mutations of GPCRs is thus of general interest. In the case of the V2 receptor, recent studies called into question whether the additional cysteine residues impaired formation of the conserved disulfide bond (12Schülein R. Zühlke K. Oksche A. Furkert J. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); mutation of the conserved cysteine residues led to nonfunctional receptors with a strong transport defect, whereas the NDI-causing mutations G185C and R202C led to binding-defective but transport-competent receptors. If the additional cysteines of the NDI-causing mutant receptors were to disrupt the conserved disulfide bond, an impaired intracellular transport of these mutant receptors would also have been expected. Here we have analyzed in detail the defects of the NDI-causing mutant receptors G185C and R202C. We present molecular modeling and mutagenesis data that strongly suggest that the additional cysteine residues of both mutant receptors participate in a second disulfide bond with residue Cys-195 of the V2 receptor rather than impairing formation of the conserved bond.

All other reagents were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The primate genomic DNAs were kindly donated by Hans Zischler (Deutsches Primatenzentrum, Göttingen, Germany). Standard DNA preparations and manipulations were carried out according to the handbook of Sambrook and co-workers (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Nucleotide sequences of DNA constructs were verified using the FS dye terminator kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Plasmid pWT.GFP, encoding a fusion of the red-shifted variant of GFP to residue Lys-367 of the V2receptor (i.e. to the entire receptor except for the four C-terminal residues) has been described previously (15Schülein R.

The C195A mutation was introduced into pWT.GFP by the use of the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit. A primer with the sequence 5′-CTGACTGCTGGGCCGCCTTTGCGGAGCCC-3′ and its complementary equivalent were employed.

Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE according to the supplier's recommendations. For the [3H]AVP binding assay, 5 × 104cells in a 15-mm-diameter well (of a 24-well plate) were transfected with 250 ng of plasmid DNA and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE. The cell surface biotinylation assay and the isolation of crude membranes for adenylyl cyclase assays and for immunoblots proceeded from confluent cells grown on 60-mm-diameter dishes. Here, 5 × 105cells were transfected with 3.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 26.25 μl of LipofectAMINE. The transfection for laser scanning microscopy was carried out with cells grown in 35-mm-diameter dishes containing glass coverslips. Cells (4 × 104) were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 7.5 μl of LipofectAMINE. In all cases, cells were incubated further for 48 h after removal of the transfection reagent. The [3H]AVP binding assay was carried out with intact, transiently transfected HEK 293 cells as described previously for African green monkey kidney (COS.M6) cells (16Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Müller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, HEK 293 cells were grown in 24-well plates (15-mm diameter/well) rather than the 35-mm-diameter dishes described for COS.M6 cells. The adenylyl cyclase assay was carried out with nuclei-free crude membranes of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells as described previously for stably transfected Ltk− cells (16Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Müller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Crude membranes of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the GFP-tagged V2receptors were isolated from confluent cells grown on 60-mm-diameter dishes as described previously for COS.M6 cells (17Schülein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were incubated with or without endoglycosidase H or PNGase F. Receptors were detected by immunoblotting using a rabbit anti-GFP antiserum and 125I-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (13Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the GFP-tagged V2 receptors were grown in a 60-mm-diameter dish to confluence. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-CM buffer (PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Cell surface proteins were labeled by incubating cells with PBS-CM containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeling reactions were quenched by replacing the biotin solution with 1 ml of NH4Cl solution (50 mm in PBS-CM). After 10 min, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-CM. 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.0) was added to the dishes, and membrane proteins were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min, 4 °C, 47,000 × g), and biotinylated proteins were recovered from the supernatant by a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C with NeutrAvidin-agarose beads. Beads were sedimented (3 min, 17,000 × g, 4 °C), washed twice with buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 7.4) and once with the same buffer without NaCl. Proteins were solubilized in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), and biotinylated receptors were detected by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum and 125I-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (13Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the GFP-tagged receptors were grown on glass coverslips. Cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4), transferred immediately into a self-made chamber (details on request), and covered with 1 ml PBS (pH 7.4). The GFP fluorescence signals were visualized on a Zeiss 410 invert laser scanning microscope (λexc = 488 nm, λem = >515 nm). Subsequently, the cell surface of the same cells was stained with 0.05% trypan blue as described (15Schülein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Trypan blue fluorescence (λexc = 543 nm, λem = >590 nm) was recorded on a second channel, and its overlap with the GFP signals was computed. A structure model of the transmembrane and the intracellular domains of the V2receptor was described previously (13Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). For this model, packing of the transmembrane helices was based on electron density maps of frog rhodopsin (18Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The structure model of the extracellular domains was assembled stepwise taking this previously described model as a foundation. The starting conformations of the extracellular domains were obtained by assembling the known conformations of identical or similar fragments of other proteins (3–10 residues) retrieved from the Brookhaven 3D protein data bank (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). Overlapping fragments with comparable conformations in several different proteins, indicating a common conformational propensity, are listed in Fig.1 with their data base identification number. The strategy of assembling thoroughly selected fragments with known conformations has the advantage over loop search algorithms in that assignment of the orientation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the hydrophobic and to the water phase respectively is finer. Model components were assembled with the biopolymer module of the Sybyl program package (TRIPOS Inc. St Louis, MO) and minimized by an AMBER 5.0 force field. The stability of the resulting receptor model was finally assessed as described (19ter Laak A.M. Kühne R. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 295-308PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations maintaining helix stability only by backbone H-bond constraints were performed at 300 K for 200 ps using AMBER 5.0 force field conditionsin vacuo. The overall backbone conformations of the extracellular domains remained stable during the molecular dynamics runs, indicating a stable starting conformation. A detailed knowledge of the conformational features of the extracellular domains of the V2 receptor would indicate whether the additional cysteine residues of the NDI-causing mutant receptors might disrupt the single disulfide bond of the receptor by forming an alternative bridge with either one of the conserved cysteine residues. Because high resolution structural data are not available for the V2 receptor, we have computed a three-dimensional model with special emphasis on the extracellular domains. Calculations are based on the conformations of identical or similar fragments of other proteins retrieved from the Brookhaven 3D protein data bank (for details of the modeling procedure, see Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures”). The conformations of the protein fragments were assembled stepwise on the foundation of our previously described model of the intracellular and transmembrane domains (13Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar), and the stability of the completed model was assessed by molecular dynamics simulations. Top and side views of the structure model are shown in Fig. 2, Aand B, respectively. The positions of the NDI-causing additional cysteine mutations, the conserved cysteine residues Cys-112 and Cys-192 (which form the disulfide bond between ECL1 and ECL2) and the single nonconserved extracellular cysteine residue Cys-195 are indicated. It is thought for the V2 receptor that AVP binds with its cyclic portion in the large cavity formed by the upper parts of TM3, TM4, TM5 and TM6 and ECL2 and with its C-terminal portion in the smaller cavity formed by TM2, TM3, TM7, and parts of ECL1, ECL2, and ECL3 (20Chini B. Fanelli F. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 59-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar structure models for the location of the ligand binding domain have been proposed for other GPCRs with peptide ligands (21Hausmann H. Richters A. Kreienkamp H.J. Meyerhof W. Mattes H. Lederis K. Zwiers H. Richter D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6907-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our model predicts that the entrance of the larger ligand binding cavity is surrounded by the long ECL2 domain, which forms a U-like loop (see Fig. 2 A). Residue Cys-195 would be located in the center of the extracellular face of the receptor at the tip of the U-like loop and, more importantly, it would be accessible to each of the cysteine residues introduced by the NDI-causing mutations. Our model thus raises the possibility that the additional cysteine residues form a second disulfide bond with residue Cys-195 rather than disrupting the conserved bond between Cys-112 and Cys-192. This second bond may be formed easily in the case of our previously described mutant receptors G185C and R202C (12Schülein R. Zühlke K. Oksche A. Furkert J. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) because their additional cysteine residues lie at the surface of the molecule at approximately the same level as residue Cys-195 (see Fig. 2 B). Formation of the putative second disulfide bond could cause sealing of the entrance of the larger ligand binding cavity and/or may pertubate this site at a deeper level (see Fig. 2 A). In either case, the newly formed disulfide bond should not have a major influence on the overall structure of the receptor. To address the question of whether or not second disulfide bonds are formed upon introduction of the additional extracellular cysteine residues, we have introduced a C195A mutation into our previously described GFP-tagged NDI-causing receptor mutants G185C.GFP and R202C.GFP (12Schülein R. Zühlke K. Oksche A. Furkert J. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (resulting receptor mutants G185C/C195A.GFP and R202C/C195A.GFP). If additional bonds are present, mutation of Cys-195 should disrupt them and lead to functional rescue of the NDI-causing mutant receptors. It was demonstrated previously that mutation of residue Cys-195 alone led to receptors with almost wild-type properties, i.e. that this residue is not necessary for V2 receptor function (22Schulz A. Grosse R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Schöneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2381-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 2R. Schülein, K. Zühlke, G. Krause, and W. Rosenthal, unpublished results. The pharmacological properties of the double mutants were characterized in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells by performing [3H]AVP binding assays with intact cells (Fig. 3) and adenylyl cyclase activity assays with crude membrane preparations (Fig.4). The GFP-tagged wild-type V2 receptor (WT.GFP) and the NDI-causing single mutants (G185C.GFP and R202C.GFP) were used as controls. As described previously (12Schülein R. Zühlke K. Oksche A. Furkert J. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), no significant specific [3H]AVP binding was observed for the NDI-causing mutant receptors G185C.GFP and R202C.GFP. The introduction of the C195A mutation, however, led to functional rescue of both mutant receptors. The K dvalues of both double mutants were comparable to that of WT.GFP (5.2 nm for G185C/C195A.GFP versus 5.4 nmfor WT.GFP; 2.1 nm for R202C/C195A.GFP versus4.7 nm of WT.GFP). Whereas the B maxvalue of G185C/C195A.GFP (0.62 pmol/mg) was also in the range of WT.GFP (0.93 pmol/mg), that of R202C/C195A.GFP (0.24 pmol/mg) was decreased to 25% of that of WT.GFP (0.98 pmol/mg).Figure 4Adenylyl cyclase assays with crude membranes derived from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the double mutants G185C/C195A. GFP (panel A) and R202C/C195A. GFP (panel B). Membranes from cells expressing the wild-type GFP-tagged receptors (WT.GFP) and the NDI-causing single mutants (G185C.GFP and R202C.GFP) were used as controls. Data represent mean values of duplicates that differed by less than 10%. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The more sensitive adenylyl cyclase assays revealed AVP-dependent cAMP formation for both NDI-causing single mutants with decreased maximal activities and strongly increased EC50 values (159 nm for G185C.GFPversus 3.4 nm for WT.GFP; 503 nm for R202C.GFP versus 3.8 nm for WT.GFP). Residual cAMP formation, indicating the presence of low affinity binding sites, was also detected in our previous study for mutant receptor R202C but not for G185C (12Schülein R. Zühlke K. Oksche A. Furkert J. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because untagged receptors were used in the previous study, the adenylyl cyclase-stimulating activity of G185C.GFP is obviously caused by the GFP moiety which may, in this case, cause a stabilization of the mutant receptor. In any case, the adenylyl cyclase activity assays demonstrate the functional rescue of both NDI-causing mutant receptors by additional C195A mutations. The dose-response curves of both double mutants were left-shifted compared with those of the NDI-causing single mutants (K d values: 3.4 nm for G185C/C195A.GFP versus 159 nm for G185C.GFP; 33, 20 nm for R202C/C195A.GFP versus 503 nm for R202C.GFP). The maximal activities were comparable to that of the wild-type. The [3H]AVP binding assays with intact cells revealed theB max of the double mutant R202C/C195A.GFP to be significantly lower than that of WT.GFP (see above). This may be the result of decreased expression and/or an impaired cell surface transport caused by the now free cysteine residue at position 202. We therefore analyzed the expression and cellular distribution of the double mutants by localizing their GFP fluorescence signals in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells, using laser scanning microscopy. After recording the GFP fluorescence signals (Fig.5, left panels ingreen), the cell surface of the same cells was identified by the use of trypan blue (Fig. 5, central panels, inred). Trypan blue does not penetrate living cells, and its autofluorescence is suitable for visualizing the cell surface (15Schülein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The computer overlay of green GFP fluorescence andred trypan blue fluorescence allows identification of receptors that are transported to the cell surface (Fig. 5, right panels, colocalization is indicated by yellow). The GFP signals of the double mutants were compared with that of WT.GFP. The likewise transport-competent single mutant receptors G185C.GFP and R202C.GFP (12Schülein R. Zühlke K. Oksche A. Furkert J. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were also used as controls. GFP signals were detected at the cell surface for WT.GFP and the single mutants G185C.GFP and R202C.GFP, as indicated by the overlap with the trypan blue signal. Additional GFP signals were located inside the cells, presumably representing transport intermediates en route to the cell surface or receptors retained within the cell as a consequence of overexpression. The pictures for the double mutants G185C/C195A.GFP and R202C/C195A.GFP were very similar to that of WT.GFP, i.e.the receptors seem to be present in comparable amounts at the cell surface. For the double mutant R202C/C195A.GFP, these results indicate that its decreased B max is caused neither by decreased expression nor decreased transport to the plasma membrane. Expression and transport of the double mutants in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were also analyzed by immunoblot detection of total receptors (i.e. intracellular and cell surface receptors) in crude membranes (Fig.6 A) and by monitoring plasma membrane-bound receptors with cell surface biotinylation assays (Fig.6 B), respectively. Cells were transfected and grown in 60-mm-diameter dishes following an identical protocol prior to the assays. For the detection of the receptors in crude membranes (Fig.6 A), a glycosylation state analysis was performed to facilitate identification of intracellular forms. Membranes were treated with endoglycosidase H to remove high mannose glycosylations (indicative of endoplasmic reticulum forms), and PNGase F to remove both high mannose and complex glycosylations (the latter indic"

Based on our previous reports of gene structure (GenBankTM accession number AF029701), we now demonstrate that activated CREB binds to the proximal promoter of the human presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene to activate PS-1 transcription in rat and in human neuronal cells. Specific stimulation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of neuronal glutamate receptors activates CREB and results in increased PS-1 expression. Similarly, treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor activates CREB and increases PS-1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion. By using adenovirus vectors expressing dominant negative forms of CREB, we were able to show that induction of PS-1 expression requires the activation of CREB. Conversely, constitutive expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) results in activation of CREB and increased PS-1 expression that can be blocked by the addition of selective MEK inhibitors. Our findings suggest a hypothesis where stimulation ofN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors signals CREB activation to enhance PS-1 gene product expression that contributes to normal neuronal functions.

Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), the precise function of PS-1 proteins found in the synaptic membranes remains elusive and is also a matter of active investigation. Human PS-1 is widely expressed in a variety of organs throughout the body (8Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H. Lin C. Li G. Holman K. Tsuda T. Mar L. Foncin J.-F. Bruni A.C. Montesi M.P. Sorbi S. Rainero I. Pinessi L. Nee L. Chumakov I. Pollen D. Brooks A. Sanseau P. Pollinsky R.J. Wasco W. Da Silva H.A.R. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Tanzi R.E.

This distribution raises the question as to why mutations in the PS-1 gene and its products appear to confer a disease state that selectively affects the brains of patients with familial Alzheimer's disease without apparent effect on their peripheral organs. In contrast, rat PS-1 is poorly expressed in liver, kidney, lung, and heart (27Suzuki T. Nishiyama K. Murayama S. Yamamoto A. Sato S. Kanazawa I. Sakaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and mouse PS-1 is poorly expressed in skeletal muscle and spleen. 2N. Mitsuda, N. Ohkubo, M. Tamatani, Y.-D. Lee, M. Taniguchi, K. Namikawa, H. Kiyama, A. Yamaguchi, N. Sato, K. Sakata, T. Ogihara, M. P. Vitek, and M. Tohyama, unpublished observations.2N. Mitsuda, N. Ohkubo, M. Tamatani, Y.-D. Lee, M. Taniguchi, K. Namikawa, H. Kiyama, A. Yamaguchi, N. Sato, K. Sakata, T. Ogihara, M. P. Vitek, and M. Tohyama, unpublished observations. We also reported that the PS-1 promoter was more active in cells differentiated to become neurons than in cells differentiated to a muscle phenotype (28Mitsuda N. Roses A.D. Vitek M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 38: 23489-23497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These differences suggest both cell type-specific and species-specific distributions of PS-1 expression. The brain, however, is the only organ where PS-1 is universally well expressed in human, rat, and mouse species. Using in situ hybridization, PS-1 mRNA is most highly expressed in neurons and below the limit of detection in other brain cells (29Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E.

These results strongly suggest the existence of a mechanism where PS-1 transcription is regulated in a neuron-specific manner in the brain. To understand presenilin-1 function, one of our approaches is to study regulatory mechanisms in the brain. PS-1 expression is higher in the hippocampus and cerebellum than in the cerebral cortex (29Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E. Hollister R.D. Hallmark O.G. Mancini R.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7513-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hippocampal pyramidal neurons, dentate granule neurons, cerebellar Purkinje neurons, and primary olfactory cortical neurons show higher PS-1 expression than the neurons in other cortical regions of rat brain (33Quarteronet D. Pradier L. Czech C. Delalonde L. Burgevin M.C. Doble A. Petitet F. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Takami K. Terai K. Matsuo A. Walker D.G. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1997; 748: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Compared with the adult, the level of PS-1 expression is significantly higher in the developing rat brain. Peaking at postnatal day 10, PS-1 expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum is greatest at a time when proliferation, migration, and synapse formation are actively being completed (35Moreno-Flores M.T. Medina M. Wandosell F. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 410: 556-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Like PS-1, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are well expressed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate granule neurons at this time of development (36Benke D. Wenzel A. Scheuer L.

Benke D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Activation of NMDA receptors and consequent Ca2+ entry into postsynaptic spines are critical to the developmental maturation of the brain, to establishment of long term memory, and to the plasticity of synaptic transmission that are characteristic of functional brain neurons (40Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar, 41Casadio A. Martin K.C. Giustetto M. Zhu H. Chen M. Bartsch D. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

Furthermore, glutamate released from presynaptic terminals can bind to glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane stimulating Ca2+ influx, phosphatase, and kinase activities that serve to modulate several intracellular signaling systems. Of these systems, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) activates a signal transduction cascade that eventually modulates downstream protein synthesis in postsynaptic neurons (45Rajadhyaksha A. Barczak A. Macias W. Leveque J.C. Lewis S.E. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6348-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). An important relationship between these systems emerged when sequencing of the PS-1 promoter showed the existence of a CREB binding site near the major transcription start site. If CREB regulates the expression of PS-1, then control of CREB activation may be one of the keys to understanding the differences in PS-1 expression between neurons, between nonneuronal cells, during the steps of synapse formation, and during signal transmission at synapses. We now report that activation of CREB leads to increased PS-1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion. We also find that PS-1 colocalizes with neurons expressing NMDA receptors. Thus, we now test the ability of NMDA receptors to signal CREB activation and specifically stimulate PS-1 expression. Our findings support a hypothesis where NMDA-mediated CREB activation regulates PS-1 expression to play a potentially critical role in physiological and pathological, neuron-specific functions of presenilin-1. U0126 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Nifedipine and NMDA were purchased from Sigma.

Monoclonal antibody to the amino-terminal fragment of PS-1 (anti-PS-1-NTF) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-CREB monoclonal antibody (CREB-1, 24H4B) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures of rat primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat embryos at embryonic day 18 as described previously (49Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H.

Out of the three PAC clones identified, PAC94 was digested with EcoRI, and the restriction enzyme fragments were subcloned into pBluescript-II-KS (+) phagemid vector (Stratagene) using a DNA ligation kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide probe (5′-TGGGACAGGCAGCTCCGGGGTCCGCG-3′) from exon 1 of the human PS-1 gene, labeled with γ-32P and T4-polynucleotide kinase, was used to identify plasmid subclones that contain the putative promoter region by hybridization. One of the positively hybridizing plasmids, clone A4, was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated DNA sequencer with a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and protocols (PE Biosystems) recommended by the manufacturer. Potential binding sites of vertebrate transcription factors in the human PS-1 promoter were identified using the TFSEARCH (version 1.3) network service available from Genome Net in Japan. Nuclear extracts were prepared from NMDA-stimulated SK-N-SH cells according to published methods (51Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

In brief, cells were stimulated with 100 μm NMDA for 30 min, harvested by scraping, and washed with 0.5 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by a gentle centrifugation. The cells were then washed in 0.1 volume of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). The washed cell pellets were then suspended in 50 μl of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and incubated on ice for 10 min before briefly vortexing to mix the pellets, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and then incubated on ice for 15 min with intermittent vortexing. The extracts were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed and divided into aliquots for freezing at −70 °C and used as purified nuclear extract. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Probes corresponding to the CRE-like element of the human PS-1 promoter sequence (PS1-CRE; 5′-GAGCCGGAAATGACGACAACGGTGAGG-3′) and to a mutated CRE-like site containing three nucleotide substitutions (PS1-CREm; 5′-GAGCCGGAAATGATAGCAACGGTGAGG-3′) were synthesized as complementary double-stranded oligonucleotides. As a control probe, a consensus CRE element contained in a double-strand oligonucleotide probe (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) was purchased from Promega. The probes were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4-polynucleotide kinase and purified with Nucleotrap Push Columns (Stratagene). 5 fmol of labeled probes were incubated with 5 μg of SK-N-SH nuclear extract in a volume of 25 μl containing 0.33m urea, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.33% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. For antibody supershifts, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-CREB monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C prior to the addition of labeled probes. For competition experiments, a 10-fold excess of cold competitor probe was preincubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of labeled probes. Incubation mixtures were subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using high ionic strength buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 400 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA) as running buffer. Gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. The plasmid clone A4, which contains a human PS-1 genomic DNA fragment inserted into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS (+) vector, was double-digested with NotI and one of SalI, HindIII, or KpnI restriction enzymes, respectively. The promoter fragments were purified with Wizard PCRpreps DNA Purification System (Promega), blunted with a DNA blunting kit (Takara Biochemicals), and inserted into theSmaI site of promoterless pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to make LUC5, LUC4, and LUC3. Similarly, clone A4 was digested withHindIII alone or HindIII and KpnI, blunted, and inserted into pGL3 to make LUC2 and LUC1, respectively. Two synthetic oligonucleotides, PS1-CRE-S (5′-TCGAGAGCCGGAAATGACGACAACGGT-3′) and PS1-CRE-AS (5′-AGCTACCGTTGTCGTCATTTCCGGCTC-3′) were 5′-phosphorylated with ATP and T4-polynucleotide kinase, mixed together, heated to 95 °C to denature, gradually cooled down to room temperature to anneal, and then inserted into the XhoI/HindIII site of pGL3-basic vector to make LUC6. Similarly, two synthetic oligonucleotides, PS1-CREm-S (5′-TCGAGAGCCGGAAATGATAGCAACGGT-3′) and PS1-CREm-AS (5′-AGCTACCGTTGCTATCATTTCCGGCTC-3′), which are identical to the PS1-CRE-S and PS1-CRE-AS, respectively, except for the substitution of three nucleotides at the CRE-like site, were inserted into theXhoI/HindIII site of pGL3-basic vector to make LUC6m. SK-N-SH cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes at 9 × 104 cells/well and allowed to recover for 1 day. Cells containing PS-1-promoter/reporter constructs were then cotransfected with 0.3 pmol of one of the promoter-firefly luciferase plasmid constructs, pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-promoter plasmid (which contains an SV40 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene;Promega), and 0.3 pmol of pRL-TK plasmid (which contains a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter upstream of theRenilla luciferase gene; Promega), using the Lipofectin procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h, washed twice with 2 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase andRenilla (sea pansy) luciferase activities were measured sequentially using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a model TD-20E luminometer (Turner Design). After measuring the firefly luciferase signal (FL) and the Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase signal (RL), the relative promoter activity (RPA) was calculated as follows: RPA = FL/RL. Total RNA extracted from SK-N-SH cells after incubation with or without NMDA for 24 h was Northern blotted at 20 μg/lane. A 368-bp human PS-1 cDNA probe sequence was prepared using PCR with sense primer (5′-CGGGGAAGCGTATACCTAATC-3′), antisense primer (5′-TCAGCTCCTCATCTTCTTCCTCATC-3′), and human PS-1 cDNA as template. The probe was 32P-labeled using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized to Northern blots. Constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) adenovirus (Ad-caMEK) was constructed as follows. cDNA fragments comprising the entire coding regions for human MEK1 cDNA were isolated from HEK293 cell cDNAs by using PCR with sense (sequence of sense) and antisense (sequence of antisense) primers. Constitutively active MEK, which lacks its nuclear export signal (amino acids 30–51; Ref. 53Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

A plasmid bearing wild type rat CREB cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Hagiwara (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan). The coding sequence was amplified, and a c-Myc tag sequence was fused to its N terminus by PCR. Subsequently, leucine was substituted for arginine 301 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The fragment was subcloned into pAxCALNLw, Cre-inducible expression cassette (16Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I.

Treatment of human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5) cells with the topo I poison SN-38 or the topo II poison etoposide (VP-16) leads to activation of NF-κB before induction of apoptosis. Inhibiting the degradation of IκBα by pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 significantly inhibited NF-κB activation and apoptosis but not DNA damage induced by SN-38 or VP-16. Transfection of NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells with dominant negative mutant IκBα (mIκBα) inhibited SN-38 or VP-16 induced transcription and DNA binding activity of NF-κB without altering drug-induced apoptosis. Regulation of apoptosis by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of pro-caspase 9 followed by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by effector caspases 3 and 7 was similar in neo and mIκBα cells treated with SN-38 or VP-16. In contrast to pretreatment with MG-132, exposure to MG-132 after SN-38 or VP-16 treatment of neo or mIκBα cells decreased cell cycle arrest in the S/G2 + M fraction and enhanced apoptosis compared with drug alone.

Mauer A.M. Vokes E.E. Lancet. 2000; 355: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Etoposide (VP-16), which poisons the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II (topo II), is currently used in a number of therapeutic protocols. More recently, the topoisomerase I (topo I) poison, e.g.irinotecan, has also shown activity in the clinical management of NSCLC (1Hoffman P.C. Mauer A.M. Vokes E.E. Lancet. 2000; 355: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The chemotherapeutic efficacy of topoisomerase I and II poisons is presumed to be due to stabilization of a topoisomerase-DNA-cleavable complex leading to protein-linked DNA breaks and cell death by apoptosis (2Schneider E.

Tumor cell resistance to apoptosis induced by topoisomerase poisons has primarily focused on the membrane efflux pumps affecting cellular drug pharmacokinetics. A major impact of these studies has been the demonstration that reduced cellular drug levels due to overexpression of P-glycoprotein encoded bymdr1 gene leads to reduced DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell death. (5Chen K-V. Pasta I. Gottesman M.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both experimental and clinical studies suggest that overexpression of P-glycoprotein is frequently associated with resistance to topoisomerase II poisons and, occasionally, with resistance to topoisomerase I poisons (5Chen K-V.

However, unlike the vinca alkaloids, the magnitude of alterations in cellular drug levelsper se mediated by P-glycoprotein does not correlate with DNA damage or apoptosis in topoisomerase II poison-treated cells (6Ganapathi R. Kuo T. Teeter L. Grabowski D. Ford J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, reduced formation of drug-stabilized topoisomerase-DNA-cleavable complex can be due to decreased topoisomerase I/II protein levels or mutations in the enzyme, which can directly impact on sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis.

Although a cause and effect relationship of DNA damage leading to apoptosis appears relatively straightforward, determining signaling events and linking them to DNA damage and apoptosis could potentially lead to understanding the mechanistic basis governing topoisomerase poison-induced apoptotic cell death. NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor involved in the regulation of genes during inflammatory, acute phase, and immune responses (7Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 8Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar). The inappropriate regulation of NF-κB has been implicated in a variety of diseases including cancers (9Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Specifically, the activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor and the subsequent induction of apoptosis would suggest that these events are linked. However, it has been recently suggested that the activation of NF-κB can indeed be anti-apoptotic in response to tumor necrosis factor or topoisomerase poisons (10Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 11Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Drug Resistance Updates. 1999; 2: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition to tumor necrosis factor, topoisomerase poisons also induce activation of NF-κB (11Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Drug Resistance Updates. 1999; 2: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since apoptotic cell death is frequently observed in topoisomerase I/II poison-treated cells (12Schmitt S.E. Sane A-T. Bertrand R. Drug Resistance Updates. 1999; 2: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), establishing a functional link between NF-κB and drug-induced apoptosis has been pursued (11Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Drug Resistance Updates. 1999; 2: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Bentires-Alj M. Hellin A-C. Ameyar M. Chouaib S. Merville M-P. Bours V.

In the present study, using pharmacological inhibitors of proteasome function and the molecular strategy of transfecting a dominant negative IκBα to manipulate the activation of NF-κB in topoisomerase I and II poison-treated human NSCLC cells, we determined the signaling pathways contributing to apoptotic cell death. Our data in two independent model systems of human NSCLC suggest that inhibiting the activation of NF-κB by the proteasome inhibitor or transfection of a dominant negative IκBα result in markedly different responses to apoptosis induced by topoisomerase I and II poisons. Although the dominant negative IκBα and proteasome inhibitor MG-132 do not affect DNA damage induced by topoisomerase I and II poisons, pre- or post-treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 inhibits or enhances apoptosis respectively. In addition, after DNA damage induced by topoisomerase I or II poisons, neither activation of transcription or the DNA binding activity of NF-κB affects drug-induced apoptosis, based on the regulation of mitochondrial release of cytochromec and activation of caspase 9 followed by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by effector caspases 3 and 7. The topo I poison SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan) and the topo II poison VP-16 were obtained from Pharmacia & Upjohn and Sigma, respectively. Stock solutions of these drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and stored frozen at −20 °C. The dominant negative IκB (S32A/S36A) cDNA cloned into pUSEamp(+) expression vector and the empty control pUSEamp(+) expression vector were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. The PathDetect cis-reporting system pNF-κB-Luc reporter plasmid and pFC-MEKK positive control plasmid were obtained from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. Antibodies to caspase 8 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; antibodies to caspase 9 and cytochrome c were obtained from BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA; antibodies to IκBα were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology; antibodies to PARP were purchased from Enzyme Systems Inc., Livermore, CA. The fluorogenic substrate leucine-glutamic acid-histidine-aspartic acid (LEHD) coupled to 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) (LEHD-AFC) for determining caspase 9 activity was obtained from BioVision Inc. Palo Alto, CA. Cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD. All other chemicals of analytical grade were obtained from commercial sources. The human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma model systems NSCLC-3 and NSCLC-5 were established in culture in the laboratory using specimens obtained from patients during surgical resection of the tumor (15Ganapathi M.K. Weizer A.K. Borsellino S. Bukowski R.M. Ganapathi R. Rice T. Casey G. Kawamura K-I. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 923-929PubMed Google Scholar). The parental wild-type NSCLC-3/wt and NSCLC-5/wt cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 plus 95% air atmosphere. Doubling time in vitro for the NSCLC-3/wt and NSCLC-5/wt cells was ∼35 h. Transfection of parental wild-type NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells with a dominant negative IκBα (S32A/S36A) in pUSEamp(+) expression vector under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter or the empty pUSEamp(+) expression vector was carried out using 4 μg of DNA/2 × 106 cells/1.2 ml containing 6 μl of DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in 1 mg/ml G418. The cells in all experiments were either pre- or post-treated for 30 min with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (20 μm). Treatment with the desired concentration of SN-38 or VP-16 for 60 min either followed or preceded treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. After the required drug treatment, control and treated cells were washed in drug-free medium and re-incubated in drug-free medium to determine (a) target protein levels and/or their activity and (b) potential signaling events of apoptosis. DNA-topoisomerase-cleavable complex formation induced by SN-38 or VP-16 was determined by a modification of the SDS-KCl method (16Grabowski D. Holmes K.A. Aoyama M. Ye Y. Rybicki L.A. Bukowski R.M. Ganapathi M.K. Hickson I.D. Ganapathi R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells labeled overnight with [14C]thymidine. Apoptosis in drug-treated cells was determined using the technique of Muscarella et al. (17Muscarella D.E. Rachlinski M.K. Sotiriadis J. Bloom S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 control or treated cells were re-suspended in 100 μl of staining solution (70 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and 100 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The stained cells were viewed in a fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filters so as to visualize simultaneously the blue fluorescence from Hoechst 33342 and the red fluorescence from propidium iodide. Normal viable cells fluoresce blue within the nucleus, and the apoptotic cells show condensation of chromatin and formation of small masses of varying sizes. Necrotic cells stain pink, but these cells are swollen, and the chromatin is not condensed and fragmented as in apoptotic cells. Flow cytometry for cell cycle traverse perturbations was carried out after staining with propidium iodide as described earlier (18Kawamura K-I Grabowski D. Krivacic K. Hidaka H. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity induced by SN-38 or VP-16 was determined by a soft agar colony-forming assay. Cells were treated with a range of drug concentrations for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 plus 95% air atmosphere. After treatment, cells were washed and 3 × 104 cells plated in triplicate in 35 × 10-mm Petri dishes using RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 20% fetal bovine serum. Colonies were counted after incubation of the Petri dishes for 10–12 days in a humidified 5% CO2 plus 95% air atmosphere. Nuclear extracts from control and treated cells were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Electromobility shift assays (EMSA) were carried out using nuclear extracts containing equivalent amounts of protein (10 μg) that were incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence 5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′, corresponding to the κ-light chain enhancer motif (20Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Assays for supershift were carried out by incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies to the p65 subunit and the labeled oligonucleotide before analysis by EMSA. Cells transfected with PathDetect pNF-κB-Luc plasmid cis-reporting system were used to test the effect of drug treatment on transcriptional activation of NF-κB. Transfection with the pFC-MEKK plasmid was used as the positive control. Cell lysates prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na2VO4, 1 mm NaF) were used for detection of IκBα protein levels in Western blots. Cell lysates (50 μg protein) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose (0.45 μm), and blocked by incubation in 3% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were probed with antibody to IκBα (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature for signal detection by chemiluminescence. Cytosolic extracts were prepared in extraction buffer (21Sun X-M MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 50553-50560Google Scholar) containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors to determine cytochrome c protein levels. Control or treated cells were incubated on ice in extraction buffer for 30 min followed by disruption with a “B” pestle in a glass Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation of the cell homogenates at 14,000 × g, the supernatant containing 50 μg of cytosolic protein was resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm) and blocked by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin, 3% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at room temperature. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was probed by incubating with antibodies to cytochrome c (dilution 1: 500) overnight at 4 °C followed by horseradish-coupled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature for signal detection by chemiluminescence. Lysates prepared from aliquots of control and treated cells were tested for caspase 9 activity using the fluorogenic substrate LEHD-AFC. Cell lysates prepared in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol were used for detection of caspase 9 and PARP cleavage. The lysate samples from control and treated cells were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% nonfat dry powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline, and probed with antibody to caspase 9 or antibody C2.10 for PARP followed by horseradish-coupled secondary antibody for detection by chemiluminescence. The antibody to caspase 9 detects both pro- and cleaved active forms of caspase 9, and C2.10 antibody detects the 116-kDa monomeric PARP and cleaved 89-kDa PARP. Results in Fig. 1 A demonstrate that after treatment of NSCLC-3/wt cells with the topo I poison SN-38 or the topo II poison VP-16, there is a significant increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB compared with the untreated control. The activation of NF-κB by SN-38 and VP-16 is dose-dependent and specific for topoisomerase poisons, since treatment with the microtubule poison paclitaxel (PCT) or the DNA-damaging agent cis-platinum (CDDP) produced no measurable increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. In the next series of experiments we determined the time course governing the enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB in topo poison-treated cells, and the results in Fig.1 B demonstrate that maximal enhancement of DNA binding activity of NF-κB in topo poison-treated cells occurs at 2–3 h. The results in Fig. 1 C indicate that with the various drugs at concentrations tested for activation of NF-κB there is significant apoptosis in the NSCLC-3/wt cells by 24–48 h, and the topo poisons SN-38 and VP-16 induce apoptosis much more rapidly than cis-platinum or paclitaxel. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of NSCLC-5/wt cells with SN-38 or VP-16 but not cis-platinum or paclitaxel significantly enhanced the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that in NSCLC-3/wt or NSCLC-5/wt cells treated with a topo I or topo II poison, activation of NF-κB precedes the subsequent induction of apoptosis.Figure 2DNA binding activity of NF-κB determined by EMSA in NSCLC-5/wt cells treated with etoposide (VP-16), active metabolite of irinotecan (SN-38), paclitaxel (PCT), or cis-platinum (CDDP) for 1 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well recognized that degradation of phosphorylated IκB by the 26 S proteasome regulates the DNA binding of NF-κB subunits (22Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Thus, using MG-132 as a pharmacological inhibitor of proteasome activity, we determined the effect of pretreatment for 30 min of NSCLC-3/wt cells with MG-132 on the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in cells treated with SN-38 or VP-16. The results in Fig. 3 Aindicate that pretreatment with 20 μm MG-132 for 30 min significantly inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in SN-38- or VP-16-treated cells. The attenuated activation of NF-κB in cells pretreated with MG-132 is consistent with the data in Fig.3 B, demonstrating diminished degradation of IκBα protein. In subsequent experiments, we analyzed drug-induced apoptosis in an attempt to correlate the apoptotic response with the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in cells pretreated with MG-132. The results in Table I indicate that pretreatment with MG-132, which resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity, also inhibited SN-38- or VP-16-induced apoptosis.Table IEffect of pre-treatment with 20 μm MG-132 for 30 min on apoptosis induced in NSCLC-3/wt cells treated for 60 min with 100 μm VP-16 or 0.1 μm SN-38Treatment aNSCLC-3/wt cells were treated for 60 min with the indicated concentrations of SN-38 or VP-16 without or with pre-treatment for 30 min with 20 μm MG-132.

Open table in a new tab The data with MG-132 pretreatment (Fig. 3) suggest that in NSCLC-3/wt cells treated with SN-38 or VP16 reduced activation of NF-κB, and apoptosis is correlated. To establish a functional link between NF-κB activation- and apoptotic-signaling pathways in SN-38- or VP-16-treated cells, experiments were carried out in NSCLC-3/wt or NSCLC-5/wt cells stably transfected with vector control (NSCLC-3/neo, NSCLC-5/neo) or mutant IκBα (NSCLC-3/mIκBα or NSCLC-5/mIκBα). The results in Fig. 4 A demonstrate that after treatment with SN-38 or VP-16, the significant increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB observed in the parental or vector control (neo) cells is absent in cells transfected with dominant negative mutant IκBα (mIκBα). Consistent with this differential response to the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in neoversus mIκBα cells treated with SN-38 or VP-16, the transcriptional activation of NF-κB is also inhibited in the mIκBα but not in neo cells treated with VP-16 (Fig. 4 B). Treatment with VP-16 results in the rapid degradation of IκBα protein in the neo but not mIκBα cells (Fig. 4 C). Similar to the data obtained in NSCLC-3 cells, a differential response to SN-38- or VP-16-stimulated DNA binding activity of NF-κB, transcriptional activity of NF-κB, and degradation of IκBα protein is also observed between the neo- and mIκB-transfected NSCLC-5 cells (Fig. 5,A–C).Figure 5A, effect of treatment with VP-16 (100 μm) or SN-38 (0.1 μm) for 60 min on DNA binding activity of NF-κB detected by EMSA in nuclear extracts from neo (NSCLC-5/neo)- and mIκBα (NSCLC-5/mIκBα)-transfected NSCLC-5 cells.

Preliminary studies revealed that SN-38- or VP-16-induced apoptosis in the neo or mIκBα transfectants was not mediated by Fas or FasL, and the parental and transfected cells were caspase 8-deficient (data not shown). Immunoblotting results in Fig.6 A indicate that after treatment with either SN-38 or VP-16, a detectable increase in cytosolic cytochrome c was apparent at 4 h. This was followed by conversion of caspase 9 from the pro- to the active form at 6 h, with maximal levels being detectable at 24 h (Fig.6 A). Consistent with the immunoblot results on activation of caspase 9, experiments on caspase 9 activity using the specific substrate LEHD-AFC also revealed detectable activity at 6 h (Fig.6 A). Cleavage of PARP by the effector caspases 3 and 7 after activation of caspase 9 was detected as early as 6 h, and maximal levels of cleaved PARP product occurred at 24 h (Fig.6 A). The morphological determination of apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy indicated that drug-induced apoptosis was dose-dependent and similar between the neo- and mIκBα-transfected NSCLC-3 (Fig. 6 B). Confirming the data on topo poison-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 B), the results in Table II indicated that the clonogenic cell survival of VP-16- or SN-38-treated NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα is similar in soft agar colony-forming assay. The data in Fig. 7 show results on mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases, which lead to SN-38- or VP-16-induced apoptosis in NSCLC-5/neo and NSCLC-5/mIκBα cells. Overall, after treatment with VP-16 or SN-38, results on mitochondrial release of cytochromec, the conversion of unprocessed pro-caspase 9 (46–48 kDa) to active caspase 9 (35 kDa, 37 kDa), caspase 9 activity, and the cleavage of PARP by effector caspases 3 and 7 suggest no apparent differences in the temporal regulation of apoptotic pathways between the neo- and mIκBα-transfected NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells.Table IIColony formation in soft agar of NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα cells treated with VP-16 or SN-38Treatment aNSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of SN-38 and VP-16 for 60 min.Survival (% of Control) aNSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of SN-38 and VP-16 for 60 min.NSCLC-3/neo bColony-forming efficiency of NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα was 11.1 and 8.9%, respectively.NSCLC-3/mIκBα bColony-forming efficiency of NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα was 11.1 and 8.9%, respectively.VP-162.5 μm41.4 ± 2.8 cData are the mean ± S.D. using triplicate Petri dishes from at least duplicate experiments.36.2 ± 0.2cData are the mean ± S.D. using triplicate Petri dishes from at least duplicate experiments.10 μm13.9 ± 2.612.1 ± 1.940 μm1.9 ± 0.91.4 ± 0.6100 μm0.30.4SN-380.0025 μm50.9 ± 1.4 cData are the mean ± S.D. using triplicate Petri dishes from at least duplicate experiments.49.9 ± 6.8cData are the mean ± S.D. using triplicate Petri dishes from at least duplicate experiments.0.01 μm44.4 ± 2.736.2 ± 0.20.04 μm40.937.90.1 μm30.3 ± 4.130.4 ± 6.5a NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of SN-38 and VP-16 for 60 min.b Colony-forming efficiency of NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα was 11.1 and 8.9%, respectively.c Data are the mean ± S.D. using triplicate Petri dishes from at least duplicate experiments.

Apoptosis at 48 h in NSCLC-5/neo or NSCLC-5/mIκBα treated with 100 μm VP-16 and 0.1 μm SN-38 was ∼50 and 27%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Earlier experiments (Fig. 3) on pretreatment with the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG-132 indicated that the DNA binding activity of NF-κB, degradation of IκBα, and apoptosis induced by SN-38 or VP-16 were inhibited. However, comparative studies with the neo and mIκB transfectants of NSCLC-3 (Fig. 6) or NSCLC-5 (Fig. 7) cells demonstrated that SN-38- or VP-16-induced activation of NF-κB may not be required for apoptosis. To further evaluate the mechanisms contributing to these discrepant results, we determined the effect of pre- or post-treatment with MG-132 on SN-38- and VP-16-induced cell cycle traverse perturbations and apoptosis in NSCLC-3/wt or the neo and mIκB transfectants of NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells. Results in Fig.8 A demonstrate that in SN-38- or VP-16-treated NSCLC-3 cells (a) pretreatment with MG132 significantly inhibits apoptosis, and (b) post-treatment for 30 min with MG-132 results in a significant (>3-fold) increase in apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 8 B, an analysis of cell cycle traverse perturbations demonstrated that treatment with VP-16 alone or the pretreatment with MG-132 followed by VP-16 resulted in the accumulation of cells in the S + G2/M boundary at 24 h and a measurable increase in the apoptotic (sub-G1) cell population. In contrast, post-treatment for 30 min with MG-132 after VP-16 exposure resulted in no remarkable accumulation of cells at the S-G2 + M boundary but produced a marked increase in the apoptotic (sub-G1) population, suggesting either apoptosis in this phase or transit through cycle and mitotic catastrophe. The differential effect of pre- or post-treatment with MG-132 on SN-38- or VP-16-induced apoptosis is not unique to NSCLC-3/wt cells or dependent on NF-κB activation, since post-treatment with MG-132 also enhanced apoptosis in the neo- or mIκB-transfected NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells (Fig. 9 and Fig.10).Figure 9A, effect of pre- or post-treatment for 30 min with 20 μm MG-132 on VP-16 (100 μm) induced apoptosis at 4 and 24 h in NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα cells.

Although it is generally accepted that topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II poisons produce DNA damage and induce cell death by apoptosis, it remains to be addressed whether the signaling pathways that regulate the initiation of apoptosis induced by topo poisons are dependent on the DNA damage. Since it is well established that the activation of NF-κB is an inducible stress response and topo poisons are effective in stimulating this pathway (20Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we examined the functional role for NF-κB activation in apoptosis induced by SN-38 or VP-16. Our results indicate that NF-κB (based on an increase in DNA binding activity) is indeed activated after treatment with the topo I poison SN-38 or the topo II poison VP-16 but not with cis-platinum or taxol, although all of these agents are potent inducers of apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic role of NF-κB has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy, since attenuation of NF-κB activity in topoisomerase poison-treated cells leads to stimulation of an apoptotic response (11Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Drug Resistance Updates. 1999; 2: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The present data demonstrating reduced apoptosis after inhibition of NF-κB activity by pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 suggests that activation of NF-κB mediates apoptosis induced by SN-38 or VP-16. However, these results contradict data obtained with the neo- and mIκBα-transfected NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells, wherein the differential activation of NF-κB did not alter apoptosis or clonogenic cell survival (NSCLC-3/neo and NSCLC-3/mIκBα) in a soft agar colony assay after treatment with SN-38 or VP-16. A proposed sequence of events regulating chemically induced apoptosis involves release of cytochrome c followed by activation of initiator caspases 8 and/or 9 and the effector caspases 3 and 7 (21Sun X-M MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 50553-50560Google Scholar). In the present study we were able to detect changes in the protein levels and activity of initiators and effectors of apoptosis in a temporal manner after treatment of NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells with SN-38 and VP-16. Measurable increases in the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, an initiator of chemically induced apoptosis, were observed 2–4 h after treatment with SN-38 and VP-16, and maximal levels were apparent between 24 and 48 h after drug treatment. In these caspase 8-deficient NSCLC-3 and NSCLC-5 cells, the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c was followed by the detection of unprocessed inactive pro-form and the active proteolysed forms of caspase 9 (in Western blots) as well as changes in caspase 9 activity. The subsequent cleavage of PARP by effector caspases 3 and 7 was maximal at 24–48 h. Signaling pathways regulating SN-38- or VP-16-induced apoptosis in neo and mIκB transfectants of NSCLC-3 and NSCLC-5 cell were also similar, since no differences in the levels or activity of proteins initiating or effecting apoptosis were apparent on a temporal basis. Thus, these results suggest that in human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cells, NF-κB may not be functionally involved in affecting the initiation or execution of topoisomerase I/II poison-induced apoptosis. The differential apoptotic response with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, whether the treatment precedes or follows exposure to SN-38 or VP-16, is unique and indeed suggests that the downstream apoptotic response can be manipulated without any apparent change in the magnitude of the DNA damage induced by topoisomerase poisons. The apoptotic response, which is decreased with pretreatment and increased by post-treatment with MG-132 is not due to altered degradation of either topo I (23Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or topo II in the SN-38- and VP-16-treated cells, respectively (data not presented). The data on reduction in apoptosis with MG-132 pretreatment suggest that either a delay in mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or the activation of the pro-caspases may be involved. However, the increased apoptosis at 24 h with MG-132 post-treatment suggests that an alternate mechanism based on cell cycle traverse perturbations may exist. Data on cell cycle traverse in VP-16-treated cells indicate that pretreatment with MG-132 does not affect cell cycle arrest in the S + G2/M fraction. However, post-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, which does not result in sustained arrest in the S + G2/M fraction, leads to enhanced apoptosis, possibly due to continued cell cycle transit. Although a precise mechanism for this response is not readily apparent, the data strongly support the possibility that interference with proteasome function after DNA damage induced by topo poisons can affect cell cycle arrest in the late S + G2/M fraction. In both pre- or post-treatment with MG-132, activation of NF-κB induced by SN-38 or VP-16 is inhibited. However, the role of NF-κB mediating this enhanced apoptotic response is countered by data demonstrating that post-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor (which inhibits NF-κB activity in neo cells) results in enhancement of SN-38- or VP-16-induced apoptosis in the neo- or mIκBα-transfected NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells. In summary, the present results demonstrate that in human NSCLC cells treated with a topo I poison, e.g. SN-38 or a topo II poison, e.g. VP-16, the apoptosis downstream of drug-induced DNA damage is initiated by the mitochondrial release of cytochromec, followed by the processing of caspase 9, and the subsequent cleavage of PARP by the effector caspases 3 and 7. These apoptotic pathways are not regulated by activation of NF-κB induced by topoisomerase poisons. In contrast, although inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome do not affect topoisomerase poison-induced DNA damage, the use of a proteasome inhibitor after treatment with SN-38 or VP-16 remarkably affects the course of drug-induced cell cycle traverse perturbations and significantly enhances the apoptotic response independent of NF-κB activation. Future studies on the role of proteasome function in cellular response to chemically induced DNA damage could provide additional information on the signaling pathways of apoptosis that may be useful in improving the therapeutic benefit of topoisomerase poisons in cancer chemotherapy.

In the present study, we investigated the nature of the modifications occurring in proPO-CS, in which proteolytically and chemically cleaved fragments originating from the subunits of proPO-CS and proPO-HS were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, amino acid sequencing, and mass spectrometry. A subunit of the heterodimeric proPO-CS was found to contain five or six methionine sulfoxides, and another subunit was found to contain one methionine residue oxidized to the sulfoxide.

The Principles of Insect Physiology. 7th Ed. Chapman and Hall, London1972: 25-53Google Scholar). The cuticle is a structure featuring the body plan of the insect and displays various functions (2Andersen S.O. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 153-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar): a physical protective barrier between the internal tissues and the external environment, a structural support of the body that enables the insect to fly and walk, and a stage for the chemical defense against microbes by relaying the signal generated by the presence of microorganisms to epidermal cells underneath and by directing the cells to secrete anti-microbial peptides into the matrix (3Ashida M. Brey P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). The proteins and chitin fibers secreted by epidermal cells form the complexes that make up a lamellate structure. Proteins secreted by the epidermal cells play important roles in cuticular functions. Although all of the proteins in the chitinous exoskeleton of the insect are thought to be secreted by epidermal cells, their origins have been shown to be different. Some of cuticular proteins are thought to be synthesized in hemocytes and the fat body (an insect organ equivalent to the vertebrate liver) and to be transepithelially transported to the cuticle via the plasma fraction of the hemolymph. Recently, some hemolymph proteins have been shown to be transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle and vice versa in lepidopteran insects (4Sass M. Kiss A. Locke M. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 407-421Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Csikós G. Molnár K. Borhegyi N.H. Talián G.C. Sass M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2113-2124PubMed Google Scholar). However, there has been little investigation on the mechanisms for the transepithelial transport of proteins in insects, in contrast to studies on transepithelial and transendothelial protein transport in mammals in which the mechanisms of transcytosis of proteins such as polymeric immunoglobulin A and transferrin have been investigated in detail (6Mostov K.E. Histol. Histopathol. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okamoto C.T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1998; 29: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Swaan P.W. Pharm.

Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 644-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In our laboratory, we have been studying the activation mechanism of pro-phenoloxidase (zymogen of phenoloxidase (proPO))1 (3Ashida M. Brey P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). Our study has recently demonstrated that the silkworm cuticle contains proPO and the protease cascade for its activation. Furthermore, the epidermal cells underneath the cuticle were found not to contain the transcripts of the genes encoding proPO subunits, suggesting that cuticular proPO is transepithelially transported from the hemolymph (11Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).In the silkworm, Bombyx mori, two proPO isoforms have been purified from both the hemolymph and cuticle (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The isoforms from the hemolymph have been named proPO-HF and proPO-HS, and the isoforms from the cuticle have been named proPO-CF and proPO-CS. The isoforms proPO-HF and proPO-CF have the same mobilities in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (native PAGE), and they are collectively referred to as F-type proPO. Similarly, proPO-HS and proPO-CS migrated to the same position in native PAGE and are referred to as S-type proPO. F-type proPOs have slightly greater mobility than do S-type proPOs in native PAGE. ProPOs purified from the hemolymph and cuticle have been shown to be heterodimeric proteins (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of the two subunits of proPO-HS and proPO-HF is common, but the other subunits are different, and five amino acid substitutions have been detected between them (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).In the accompanying paper (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), proPO-HS is reported to be transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle and to be recovered as proPO-CS from the cuticle. ProPO-HF is thought to be transported similarly, although the direct evidence of such transportation has not yet been obtained. The isoforms proPO-CS and proPO-HS did not exhibit any appreciable difference in their molecular mass, as determined by gel permeation chromatography, or in their enzymatic properties after activation by a specific endogenous protease, but their elution profiles in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on an octadecyl (ODS) column were different. These results indicate that modifications occur in cuticular proPO. We observed that little proPO-CS purified from cuticles was transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle even if it was injected into the hemocoel of the larval silkworm (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It seems that the sites susceptible to modification play an important role in the transport of hemolymph proPO to the cuticle. We considered elucidation of the nature of the modification to be the first step in advancing our understanding of the mechanism of transepithelial protein transport in insects.Here, we report that the modification in proPO-CS is oxidation of methionine residues. All of the oxidized methionine residues are identified. This is the first report on the structural characterization of transepithelially transported protein in insects.DISCUSSIONInvertebrate epithelia have the septate junction that is functionally equivalent to the tight junction of vertebrates. The septate junction is thought to limit the diffusion of molecules through intercellular spaces in the epithelial layer (29Woods D.F Bryant P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17 (suppl.): 171-181Crossref Google Scholar, 30Peifer M. Orsulic S. Pai L.M. Loureiro J. Development. 1993; suppl.: 163-176Google Scholar). The transcripts of the proPO subunit genes have not been shown to be detected in epidermal cells (11Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), but proPO has been detected immunocytochemically in the epidermal cells of 5th instar silkworm larvae. 2M. Sass, T. Asano, and M. Ashida, unpublished observation. Furthermore, proPO has been shown to be transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results have indicated that hemolymph proPO is transepithelially transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle.The mechanisms of transepithelial or transendothelial transportation of mammalian proteins such as polymeric immunoglobulin A and transferrin have become clearer in recent years (6Mostov K.E. Histol. Histopathol. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okamoto C.T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1998; 29: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Swaan P.W. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 10Michel C.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 644-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the presence of the tight junction sealing extracellular space between the epidermal cells, macromolecules such as proteins cannot pass freely between mammalian epithelial cells. It is well documented that proteins taken up into the epithelial cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis at the basolateral surface are transported via cytoplasm to the apical surface and secreted (6Mostov K.E. Histol. Histopathol. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okamoto C.T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1998; 29: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in insects, the mechanism by which proteins are transepithelially transported has not been studied. There is not even any concrete evidence that a protein is transported by transcytosis through insect epidermal cells. We considered the silkworm proPO to be a molecule that would offer a rare opportunity to study the mechanism of transepithelial protein transport in the insect.Purified cuticular proPO had the same enzymatic properties as those of hemolymph proPO when they were activated by a specific activating protease, pro-phenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPAE) (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, subunits of cuticular proPO were not eluted at the same retention times as those of hemolymph proPO subunits in RP-HPLC, indicating that cuticular proPO is a modified form of hemolymph proPO. There are some reports suggesting that hemolymph proteins are transepithelially transported from hemolymph to the cuticle (4Sass M. Kiss A. Locke M. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 407-421Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Csikós G. Molnár K. Borhegyi N.H. Talián G.C. Sass M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2113-2124PubMed Google Scholar). However, there have been no detailed structural analyses of the transported proteins. Elucidation of the nature of the modification of transepithelially transported proteins would be the first step to understanding the mechanisms of transepithelial transport of macromolecules from hemolymph to the cuticle in insects.In the hemolymph of the silkworm, B. mori, two proPO isoforms (referred to as proPO-HS and proPO-HF) are present. Only proPO-HS has been proved to be transported to the cuticle and become proPO-CS, but it is almost certain that proPO-HF is also transported as proPO-HS (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present study, modification occurring in proPO-CS was analyzed. In RP-HPLC, proPO-CS was eluted in three peaks. The polypeptides in the peaks were named proPO-CS-pI, proPO-CS-pI*, and proPO-CS-pII. The polypeptides proPO-CS-pI and proPO-CS-pI* were revealed to be modified forms of proPO-HS-pI (a subunit of proPO-HS), and the former was revealed to have six methionine sulfoxides, Met(O)s, at Met58, Met73, Met176, Met324, Met327, and Met498, and the latter was revealed to have five Met(O)s at Met58, Met73, Met176, Met327, and Met498. The polypeptide proPO-CS-pII was shown to be a modified form of proPO-HS-pII (another subunit of proPO-HS) and to have a Met(O) at Met690. Molecular mass data for the subunits of proPO-CS, results of mass mapping of the peptides in protease digests of the subunits, N-terminal amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides in the digests, and the results of analyses of peptides containing methionine sulfoxide(s) by PSD mass spectrometry were all consistent with the contention that modification of the subunits of proPO-CS involves only oxidation of the methionine residues detected in the present study. In the case of F-type proPOs (proPO-HF and proPO-CF), our preliminary analyses indicated that proPO-HF and proPO-CF have the same amino acid sequences and that essentially the same modifications as those observed in proPO-CS occur on proPO-CF. 3T. Asano and M. Ashida, unpublished observation. Oxidation of methionyl residues in many proteins caused by atmospheric oxygen or other reactive oxygen species has been reported (31Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Brot N. Weissbach H. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 91-96PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore speculated that the oxidized methionyl residues detected in the cuticular proPO were artifactually introduced during the purification process employed in the present study. However, the purified or crude hemolymph proPO preparations could be stored for several months without any appreciable change of their elution profiles in RP-HPLC, indicating that the oxidation of methionyl residues detected in cuticular proPO did not occur during storage. In another experiment, an extraction buffer supplemented with hemolymph proPO was used to extract cuticular proteins, and immune precipitate of proPOs in the resulting extract was prepared. From the precipitate, a subunit (proPO-HS-pI) of hemolymph proPO was recovered in a high yield,3 indicating that the oxidation of methionine residues of proPO does not take place during the extraction of cuticular proteins. Considering these observations, cuticular proPO isoforms are likely to exist in the oxidized form in situbefore extraction.The molecular mass of purified native proPO-CS was estimated to be 142 kDa by permeation gel chromatography, and the same value was also obtained for the molecular mass of proPO-HS. Because proPO-HS has been shown to be composed of two different subunits, the molecular mass data seem to indicate that proPO-CS is also a heterodimeric protein. Thus, the purified proPO-CS was concluded to be a mixture of proPO-CS variants, one of which is composed of proPO-CS-pI and proPO-CS-pII and the other of which is composed of proPO-CS-pI* and proPO-CS-pII. We have not succeeded in separating the variants by any purification procedure under nondenaturing conditions.The silkworm proPO is a protein homologous to arthropod hemocyanins. Among the two types of arthropod hemocyanins of which the crystallographic three-dimensional structures have been determined (26Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H.

Two of them were obtained from protein crystallized in buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the other one was obtained from protein crystallized in the presence of nitrate (26Hazes B. Magnus K.A.

Biol. 1996; 262: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein modeling of proPO subunits was carried out with these three crystallographic structures as templates. The resulting model structures were very similar to those of the templates (Fig. 6). From the model structures, surface accessibilities of methionine residues were calculated (Table III). Methionine residues identified to be Met(O)s in cuticular proPO subunits were shown to have high surface accessibilities in the model, with Met73 bearing the lowest value, 32.5%, and Met176 bearing the highest value, 87.2%. Both Met73 and Met176 are the residues of proPO-HS-pI. The surface accessibility of Met58 of proPO-HS-pI and Met690 of proPO-HS-pII, which were both identified as methionine sulfoxides in proPO-CS, could not be assessed in the modeling because the regions containing these methionines were not included in the sequences submitted as targets in the present protein modeling. Although Met295 and Met456 of proPO-HS-pII were shown to have relatively high surface accessibilities (40.1 and 48.4%, respectively) in the model, they were not detected as oxidized methionine residues in proPO-CS-pII. This observation seems to be explainable if it is assumed that the methionyl residues are located at the surfaces where subunits of proPO interact and are therefore not exposed to the solvent surrounding the proPO molecule. Methionine residues in proteins are classified into three groups: exposed, partially exposed, and buried (31Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Oxidation of methionine is thought to be restricted to the exposed or partially exposed residues (31Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Considering the previous report, the calculated high surface accessibilities of the methionine residues detected as methionine sulfoxides in proPO-CS suggest that the model structures obtained in the present protein modeling reflect rather faithfully the real structures of proPO subunits, especially that of proPO-HS-pI.The oxidation of methionine residues of proteins sometimes induces conformational change and causes loss of their activity (31Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Brot N. Weissbach H. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 91-96PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the silkworm proPO, such oxidative inactivation did not seem to occur. We have observed (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that PPAE purified from the silkworm cuticle converted hemolymph proPO and cuticular proPO to phenoloxidases (monophenol,l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC1.14.18.1) of which the enzymatic properties were very similar and that the conversion catalyzed by PPAE did not appear to be influenced by the oxidation of methionyl residues. The only conspicuous effect of oxidation detected was on the transport of proPO from hemolymph to the cuticle; cuticular proPO-CS injected into the hemocoel was not transported to the cuticle, whereas the injected purified proPO-HS was transported to the cuticle (12Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11100-11112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The most plausible model for proPO transport may be receptor-mediated transcellular transport as has been observed in mammals (35Locke M. Ohnishi E. Ishizaki H. Molting and Metamorphosis. Japan Science Society Press, Tokyo1990: 173-206Google Scholar). It is possible that the putative receptor for proPO does not have appreciable affinity to the oxidized proPO isolated from cuticles. Methionyl residues of some proteins have been shown to participate in molecular interaction (36Gellman S.H.

Oxidation of methionyl residues has been observed to have a crucial effect on interaction between molecules without causing large conformational changes of the proteins (42Teh L.C. Murphy L.J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reduced hydrophobicity at the oxidized methionyl residues of cuticular proPO may lower the binding ability of molecules to the putative proPO receptors on epidermal cells. Such lowered affinity of the cuticular proPO for the putative receptor may imply that epidermal cells employ oxidation of the methionine residues to facilitate the secretion of proPO, which is destined to be transepithelially transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle. It is also possible that the lowered affinity plays a role in preventing the cuticular proPO from being taken up from the cuticle into epidermal cells. To the best of our knowledge, no structural studies have been carried out on insect proteins that have been shown to be transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle. Accordingly, it is not known whether methionyl residues of other transepithelially transported proteins are also oxidized.Since the first cDNA cloning of insect proPOs in 1995 (11Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 45Fujimoto K. Okino N. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Ohnishi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 7764-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the number of reports on cloned proPO cDNAs in literature has been increasing. A phylogenetic tree of proPOs of insects was constructed from the reported sequences (Fig.7 A). Insect proPOs were grouped in two clusters. The subunits proPO-HS-I and proPO-HS-II separately belong to each cluster. ProPO subunits belonging to the cluster in which proPO-HS-I is located have often been referred to as type I proPO subunits, and those belonging to the cluster in which proPO-HS-pII is located have often been referred to as type II proPO subunits. In the alignments of sequences around oxidized methionines ofBombyx proPO subunits, the methionine residue corresponding to Met73 of proPO-HS-pI was found in all type I subunits except for a coleopteran proPO subunit. Next to Met73, Met176 is well conserved among the type I proPO subunits with the exceptions of the subunits of coleopteran proPO andDrosophila proPO-1b (Fig. 7). With regard to Met690 of proPO-HS-pII, none of the type II proPO subunits of other insects were found to have a methionine residue at the position corresponding to Met690. These alignment data seem to raise the possibility that the methionine residue corresponding to Met73 or Met176 of proPO-HS-pI plays a role in the transport of proPOs from hemolymph to the cuticle in insects. The coleopteran proPO subunit, which does not have a methionine residue corresponding to Met73 or Met176 of proPO-HS-pI, cannot rule out this possibility because all of the proPOs so far characterized at protein level have been shown to be composed of more than two subunits. There has been no report of a partner of the coleopteran proPO subunit to form a complete proPO molecule, and it is not known whether coleopteran proPO containing the subunit is transported to the cuticle. In a dipteran species, Anopheles gambiae, as many as six genes coding for proPO subunits are known to be present, but there has been no examination of whether the gene products are transported to the cuticle. Further investigation is needed to determine whether particular proPOs in other insects are transported from hemolymph to the cuticle and whether the transported proPO subunints have conserved methionine at the position corresponding to Met73 or Met176 of proPO-HS-pI. More direct evidence of the roles of these two methionines of proPO-HS-pI in the transport of proPO subunits could be"

Intermolecular processing at or near the pro/mature junction, due either to the catalytic activity of active enzyme or to exogeneous proteases, has been well documented for this family of proenzymes. In addition, kinetic studies are suggestive of a slow unimolecular mechanism of autoactivation which is independent of proenzyme concentration. However, inspection of the recently determined x-ray crystal structures does not support this evidence. This is due primarily to the extensive distances between the catalytic thiolate-imidazolium ion pair and the putative site of proteolysis near the pro/mature junction required to form mature protein. Furthermore, the prosegments for this family of precursors have been shown to bind through the substrate binding clefts in a direction opposite to that expected for natural substrates. We report, using cystatin C- and N-terminal sequencing, the identification of autoproteolytic intermediates of processing in vitro for purified recombinant procathepsin B and procathepsin S.

To protect cells from unregulated digestion, this reverse configuration is believed to help ensure proenzyme stability at neutral pH as the zymogen is passed from the endoplasmic reticulum to its final destination, i.e. the acidified lysosomal compartment of the cell. In general, zymogens of all families of proteolytic enzymes may undergo maturation using either intermolecular or intramolecular processing pathways. For instance, autoproteolytic cleavage of prosubtilisin E, a serine protease precursor, has been suggested to occur at the same site near the pro/mature junction in either an intermolecular or intramolecular manner, and the mechanism that predominates is dependent mainly on the starting concentration of the proenzyme (18Li Y.

Thus it is only at very low concentrations of the proenzymes that the unimolecular mechanism plays a significant role in processing. Interestingly, the proposal of a unimolecular step of maturation is inconsistent to what is observed in the three-dimensional structures for this family of precursors (10Cygler M. Sivaraman J.

Here, we attempt to identify novel intermediates of processing for the precursors of cathepsin B and cathepsin S in vitro. This has been achieved by monitoring using SDS-PAGE3 the processing of either purified procathepsin B or procathepsin S in the presence of the endogenous inhibitor, cystatin C. Cystatin C has been shown to be a substrate binding cleft-directed protein inhibitor of papain-like enzymes with K i values in the subnanomolar range (27Abrahamson M. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Grubb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11282-11289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hall A. Dalbøge H. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. Biochem.

Because the formation of a tight binding complex with cystatin C requires that the substrate binding cleft of papain-like enzymes be unobstructed (29Illy C. Quraishi O. Wang J. Purisima E. Vernet T. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1197-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), for example free from the prodomain, it may be reasonably assumed that the affinity of cystatin C for the mature enzyme would be superior to that for either the full-length proenzyme or any intermediates generated during autoproteolysis,i.e. hierarchy of cystatin C affinity for mature enzyme > intermediates > proenzyme. In its excess, therefore, cystatin C may provide the desired effect of decreasing the rate of intermolecular proteolytic processing, which is mainly the result of the activity of mature (processed) enzyme, and thereby favoring the detection of other processing events. Furthermore, we investigate a role for the N terminus of the mature enzyme domain in the processing of precursors belonging to the papain family. This has been achieved by performing site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-8 to an alanine residue in propapain, i.e. causing the destruction of the conserved Asp-6 → Arg-8 salt bridge, and monitoring the overall effect of this mutation on the ability of propapain to autoactivate. 4In the text, the termsautoprocessing, autoactivation, andmaturation relate to the ability of zymogen to convert to mature protein at acidic pH due to autocatalytic cleavage at or near the pro/mature junction. 4In the text, the termsautoprocessing, autoactivation, andmaturation relate to the ability of zymogen to convert to mature protein at acidic pH due to autocatalytic cleavage at or near the pro/mature junction. Human wild-type cystatin C were a generous gift from Dr. Irena Ekiel (Biotechnology Research Institute (BRI)/National Research Council) and monoclonal antibody to papain was provided by Daniel Tessier and Dr. David Y. Thomas (BRI/National Research Council). Recombinant human wild-type procathepsin B was expressed and purified as described previously (30Quraishi O. Nägler D.K. Fox T. Sivaraman J. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5017-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pPIC9 vector and Pichia pastoris strain GS115 were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego). Butyl-Sepharose resin was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Bio tech. The substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine 4- methylcoumarinyl-7-amide hydrochloride (Z-Phe-Arg-MCA) and the irreversible inhibitor E-64 (l-trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucyl-amino(4-guanidino)butane) were purchased from IAF Biochem International Inc. (Laval, Canada). Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. A cDNA construct consisting of human wild-type procathepsin B or procathepsin S as a fusion with the preproregion of yeast α-factor was digested with XhoI and NotI, and the proenzyme fragment was subcloned into the pPIC9 vector (Invitrogen). For integration into the Pichia genome, the pPIC9-based constructs were linearized by cleavage with BglII and purified. The P. pastoris host strain GS115 (Invitrogen) was then transformed with the linearized constructs by electroporation. Positive transformants were grown for 2 days at 30 °C in medium containing glycerol as the carbon source followed by incubation in the presence of methanol for a further 3 days to induce expression of recombinant protein. The consensus sequence for oligosaccharide substitution located on the occluding loop within the mature enzyme domain of cathepsin B had been removed by the substitution S115A. All other sites for oligosaccharide substitution within procathepsin B and procathepsin S were left unaltered. Protein secreted into the culture supernatants was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gels). The proenzymes were purified from the culture supernatant using a hydrophobic resin under nonacidic conditions. The culture supernatant (250 ml) was concentrated to 50 ml using an Amicon stirred cell (YM-10 membrane). During concentration, the supernatant was exchanged to 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1.6 m(NH4)2SO4. Concentrated recombinant proenzyme was then purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a butyl-Sepharose fast flow column. Proenzyme fractions eluted from the column by applying a linear gradient of decreasing ammonium sulfate concentration. Glycosylated procathepsin B and procathepsin S eluted at 0.6–0.8 m and 0.3–0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, respectively, and samples were stored at 4 °C. Purified procathepsin B (20 μm) and procathepsin S (4 μm) samples were dialyzed against 50 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C overnight in the presence (or absence) of 100 μm human wild-type cystatin C. Each sample was then treated with excess E-64 followed by the addition of reducing buffer and denaturation in a boiling water bath. Protein samples were then applied to SDS-PAGE (12% gels) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) or AgNO3 (see Fig. 1). Propapain was produced as described previously (4Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vernet T.

Briefly, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ3501 was transformed with the expression vector derived from pVT100-U in which the propapain gene is under the control of the α-factor promoter. Yeast cells were first grown under selective conditions to ensure plasmid maintenance and then transferred into a rich medium. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and the soluble fraction of the crude lysate included propapain. Propapain was then partially purified using butyl-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as discussed previously for procathepsins B and S. Complete processingin cis was achieved by incubating propapain at 65 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.8), 20 mm cysteine for 30 min. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot following separation of the proteins using SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, protein bands were blotted onto hydrophobic PVDF membranes. The membranes were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and each protein band of interest was subjected to a minimum of five cycles of automated Edman degradation using the method described previously (31Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of human wild-type procathepsin B and procathepsin S was followed in a continuous manner by carrying out the reactions in a 3-ml quartz cuvette in the presence of the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (10 μm) and measuring fluorescence as a function of time. The conversion of procathepsins B and S to active enzyme leads to hydrolysis of the substrate, and fluorescence of the MCA product was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. Processing was initiated by lowering the pH from 7.4 (pH of the stock solution of procathepsins B and S) to 5.0 (pH of the assay). Reactions were carried out at 25 °C in the presence of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 0.2 mNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction mixture was stirred continuously in the cuvette during the reaction. The product versus time curves were fitted to the following equation (32Cha S. Biochem.

[P]=νEt−((νE−νPE)(1−exp(−kobst)))/kobsEquation 1 where P is the MCA product formed, v PErepresents the initial rate of product release (which should reflect activity of the proenzyme, if any), v Ecorresponds to the rate for mature (active) enzyme, andk obs is a first-order rate constant. On addition of cystatin C to a reaction mixture with which the processing of procathepsin B is being monitored, an intermediate species of cathepsin B is observed. This intermediate is observable even at nanomolar concentrations of proenzyme (as determined by AgNO3-stained SDS-PAGE; Fig.1) as well as at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 2 A; PVDF membranes, Coomassie Blue staining). The ability to immobilize on PVDF membranes, and consequently purify, protein bands that correspond to presumably unstable processing intermediates ensures that the residual prosegment of these species remains resistant to further degradation. Direct N-terminal sequencing of the intermediate band of cathepsin B processing (Fig. 2 A) indicated a mixture of intermediate species with autocatalytic cleavage having taken place at Cys-42p↑Gly-43p (70% of total signal) and Arg-40p↑Leu-41p (30% of total signal) (Fig. 3, cathepsin B prosegment numbering). After several weeks of incubation in the presence of cystatin C, both full-length procathepsin B and the processing intermediates disappear, and only the protein band corresponding to mature cathepsin B is observed. Therefore, it may be concluded that these are true intermediates of processing and not dead-end (side product) reactions. Because complete maturation of cathepsin B has been shown to also include autocatalytic trimming of six residues at the C-terminal end of the enzyme (37Rowan A.D. Feng R. Konishi Y. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it should be noted that the 30- and 32-kDa protein bands in Fig. 2 A, lane 2, most likely correspond to cathepsin B composed of a mature and semimature N terminus, respectively, and an unprocessed C terminus.Figure 3Structure-based sequence homology of the C-terminal ends of the prosegments of cathepsin B and cathepsin S.Cathepsin B prosegment numbering was used for cathepsin B, and cathepsin S prosegment numbering was used for cathepsin S. The established cleavage sites to form mature protein near the pro/mature junction are represented as ⇑. The sites of autoproteolytic processing detected using the cystatin C assay are denoted as ↑;1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of procathepsin S, the presence of cystatin C is not strictly required to observe, using SDS-PAGE, the accumulation of an intermediate processing band that is ∼2 kDa heavier than the mature enzyme (data not shown). To ensure the accumulation of sufficient quantities of this species for N-terminal identification, cystatin C was added to procathepsin S (Fig.2 B) under processing conditions to inhibit bimolecular reactions as has been discussed previously for procathepsin B. Based on their migration on SDS-PAGE, it is assumed that the intermediate species formed in the presence of cystatin C are identical to those in the absence of the inhibitor. This protein band obtained for the sample treated with cystatin C was found to be a mixture of species corresponding to cleavage at Ser-76p↑Ser-77p (50% of total signal) and Met-72p↑Ser-73p (50% of total signal) (Fig. 3; cathepsin S prosegment numbering). A continuous assay based on the hydrolysis of the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA by the active enzyme generated in the autocatalytic process was used. The rate of substrate hydrolysis increases with time due to time-dependent release of active enzyme from the precursor until a constant rate is obtained which corresponds to the activity of fully processed enzyme. The curves can be fitted to a model that assumes a first-order increase in rate from an initial rate vPE, corresponding to the activity of the precursors (if any), to a final ratevE, corresponding to the activity of fully processed enzyme. Based on the results of nonlinear regression analysis, no significant activity of the precursors against the Z-Phe-Arg-MCA substrate could be detected, and the first-order rate for autocatalytic processing, k obs, increases linearly with proenzyme concentration (Fig.4). The direct link between the rates of autoprocessing and precursor concentration confirms the occurrence of a bimolecular reaction, i.e. intermolecular processing of proenzyme by fully or partially processed (active) enzyme. In support of the postulated unimolecular autoproteolytic reactions discovered using the cystatin C assay (discussed above), the extrapolated rate constants were calculated to be 2.5 × 10−4 s−1 and 8.2 × 10−3 s−1 for procathepsin B and procathepsin S, respectively, as the concentration of these precursors appro"

We have previously reported that a nucleoprotein complex that interacts with an IRS in the IGFBP-1 promoter may involve members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, based on gel shift studies with an unlabeled competitor containing a known C/EBP-binding site (11Unterman T. Oehler D. Ngyuen H. Sengupta P. Lacson R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We now report that a similar complex also interacts with the IRS in the PEPCK gene and that this complex contains C/EBPβ. Gel shift and reporter gene studies with constructs containing point mutations within the IRS indicate that this complex interacts with an IRS in a sequence-specific fashion that correlates well with the ability of insulin to regulate promoter activity. Also, replacing the IRS with a consensus C/EBP-binding site (but not an HNF-3-binding site or cAMP response element (CRE)) maintains the effect of insulin on promoter activity. Taken together, these studies indicate that a nucleoprotein complex containing C/EBPβ can interact with IRSs in both the IGFBP-1 and PEPCK genes and may contribute to the ability of insulin to suppress promoter function.

H4IIE and HepG2 cells were grown to near confluency in polystyrene dishes and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 g/liter of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) 24 h before harvest. Nuclear extracts were prepared from H4IIE hepatoma cells after the method of Dignam as reported (9Unterman T.G. Fareeduddin A. Harris M.A. Goswami R.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Lacson R.G. Biochem.

Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured by the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). For gel shift and supershift studies, nuclear extracts were preincubated with unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors or GST-CHOP for 10 min or with antibody for 30 min at 22 °C in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 50 or 5 μg/ml (Figs. 1 B, 2 B, and 3 A) poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC).

Recombinant full-length C/EBPβ (20 ng) was preincubated with/without a 250-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor containing a consensus C/EBP-binding site, and then with probes containing the C/EBP site (C/EBP), the IGFBP-1 insulin response element (BP1), or the PEPCK IRS in the presence of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) at 4 °C, then loaded for native gel electrophoresis at 22 °C.

An oligo containing an SRF site was provided by Dr. R. Prywes, and oligonucleotides containing the high affinity HNF-3 site of the rat transthyretin gene, the PEPCK IRS and flanking sequence (including residues 401–422 upstream from the cap site), or residues 85–122 upstream from the RNA cap site of the rat IGFBP-1 promoter were prepared as previously described (11Unterman T. Oehler D. Ngyuen H. Sengupta P. Lacson R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Other oligos used in gel shift studies are described in the text or in figures. Oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear proteins from the livers of 3 rats were dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After dialysis, the salt concentration was adjusted to 0.1 m KCl based on conductivity, and proteins were loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (Sigma). The column was rinsed with low salt buffer, and proteins were eluted in 30 fractions with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m KCl in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors, and dithiothreitol. Binding activity in every other fraction was measured by gel shift assay using the ΔIRS.1 oligo as a probe. Fractions forming the nucleoprotein complex containing C/EBPβ were pooled, dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and conductivity was adjusted to 0.1 m KCl prior to affinity chromatography. A DNA affinity column was constructed with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) and biotinylated oligonucleotides containing three copies of IRSA from the IGFBP-1 promoter: 5′-biotin-dT-ATACGCAAAACAACATGTCAAAACAAGAGCAAAACAATGC-3′ and 3′-TATGCGTTTT GTTGTACAGTTTTGTTCTCGTTTTGTTACG-5′. Proteins were eluted with a 0.1–1 m KCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and binding activity was monitored by gel shift assay. Following dialysis, proteins were re-loaded onto this column with 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) to reduce nonspecific binding. Proteins were loaded for a third round of affinity chromatography without poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Gel shift assays were performed with either the ΔIRS.2 (round 1 and 3) or the ΔIRS.1 oligo (round 2 of affinity chromatography) labeled as a probe, thereby ensuring that the purified proteins would interact both with the affinity matrix and with two different oligonucleotide probes containing an IRS. Partially purified proteins were concentrated with a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon) and loaded for 4–20% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting with antibody against C/EBPβ. The membrane was probed with a second antibody tagged with horseradish peroxidase and the bound antibody was identified by enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The SauI/HgaI fragment of the rat IGFBP-1 promoter was cloned into pGL2, and an NheI site was introduced immediately upstream of the insulin response element by site-directed mutagenesis, as previously described (6Cichy S.B.

TheNheI/BamHI fragment containing the insulin response element was excised and replaced with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a single IRS (ΔIRS.1 and ΔIRS.2) with/without mutations of residues within the IRS (ΔIRS.1 m1-ΔIRS.1 m6, ΔIRS.1M, and ΔIRS.2M), or with oligonucleotides containing a consensus binding site for C/EBP (ΔC/EBP and ΔC/EBP.2) or HNF-3 proteins (ΔHNF-3) or the CRE from the PEPCK promoter (ΔCRE), as shown in Tables I and II. A functional or mutated IRS or C/EBP-binding site also was cloned into the polylinker region in pGL2 further upstream, as before (6Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G.

Dominant negative (DN) PKCα, -θ, -ε, and -ζ mutants stimulated the promoter activity. AII-, KCl-, and Bt2cAMP-stimulatory effects were abolished in cells cotransfected with CA-PKCα, -ε, or -θ.

Members of the conventional family (PKCα, -β1, -β2, and -γ) are calcium-dependent and are activated by phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol. Members of the novel family (PKCδ, -ε, -θ, and -η) do not require calcium for their activity but are activated by diacylglycerol, whereas members of the atypical family (PKCζ and -λ/ι) do not respond to calcium or diacylglycerol. Current knowledge supports the interpretation that PKC is involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis at least at two separate enzymatic steps of aldosterone synthesis, namely the transformation of cholesterol to pregnenolone (10Reyland M.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Reyland M.E. Williams D.L. White E.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C780-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone (3Coulombe N. Lefebvre A. LeHoux J.G. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 4LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the role of individual PKC isozymes in the regulation of aldosterone synthesis remains unknown. We have addressed this question by investigating the role of PKC isoforms on the regulation of the hamsterCYP11B2 gene promoter activity. We show here that cotransfection of NCI-H295 cells with constitutively active (CA) or dominant negative (DN) mutants of PKC isoforms, along with theCYP11B2 gene promoter, resulted in a differential regulation of promoter activity of conventional (α) and atypical (ζ) PKC. Adult male Syrian Golden hamsters (120 ± 10 g) and 2-month-old Long Evans male rats were purchased from Charles River Inc. (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) and kept on Purina rat chow and tap water ad libitum. Animals were sacrificed in accordance with the ethical standards of our local institutional review committee. The adrenal glands were removed and freed of fatty tissue. The zona glomerulosa was separated from the zona fasciculata-reticularis and the medulla by the method of Giroudet al. (16Giroud C.J.P. Stachenko J. Venning E.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1956; 92: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Three adult adrenal glands were obtained from 50-, 52-, and 55-year-old renal transplant donors, in accordance with the Human Subject Review Committee of our institution. The PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Gö6976 were purchased from Calbiochem, Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Hornsby, Ontario, Canada). TPA, AII, and Bt2cAMP were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). NCI-H295 cells were harvested in Laemmli's sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), and tissues were homogenized in the same buffer. Samples were passed through a 26-gauge needle, heated in boiling water for 10 min, and centrifuged (12,000 × g) for 10 min. Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions of NCI-H295 cells or hamster adrenal zona glomerulosa were prepared according to the technique described by Garcia-Paramio et al. (12Garcia-Paramio P. Cabrerizo Y. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thin human adrenal slices were obtained using a Stadie-Riggs tissue slicer (Thomas Scientific, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada). The first slices consisted of the adrenal capsule and the zona glomerulosa, and the next slices consisted of the zona fasciculata (18Guillon G. Trueba M. Joubert D. Grazzini E. Chouinard L. Côté M. Payet M.D. Manzoni C.B. Robert M. Gallo-Payet N.G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contamination of the zona glomerulosa by the zona fasciculata was estimated to be ∼20%, based on P450 17α-hydroxylase expression, as determined by Western blotting analysis, using the same quantity of proteins from each zone preparation (data not shown). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (19LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. Ducharme L. LeHoux J. Martel D. Brière N. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20LeHoux J.G. Mason J.I. Ducharme L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1874-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using the following polyclonal antibodies: anti-rabbit PKCα, anti-rabbit PKCβ1 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-rabbit PKCβ2, anti-mouse PKCγ, anti-rabbit PKCε, and anti-rabbit PKCζ (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-mouse PKCδ and anti-mouse PKCθ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and anti-rabbit PKCλ (N-17) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using ECL+ light emitting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Autoradiograms were observed by exposing the blots to Kodak X-Omat RP films. Adrenal glands were excised from three different animals. Human adult adrenal glands were also used. The glands were fixed in buffered neutral formalin solution for 24 h. The fixed adrenal glands were dehydrated by successive treatments with graded aqueous ethanol, cleared in toluene, and embedded in paraffin. Five to seven 5-μm-thick sections were prepared according to the usual histologic procedures. Sections were freed of paraffin, hydrated, and treated with NH4Cl in 50 mm PBS (20 min) to block aldehydic groups. After two washes, tissue sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the respective anti-PKCα, -ε, or -ζ antibodies (diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin), and then washed twice. Tissues sections were then incubated for 30 min with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada) diluted 1/50, washed in PBS for 5 min, and then mounted in glycerol-PBS (9:1) containing 0.1% phenylenediamine (21Calvert R. Millane G. Beaulieu J.F. Anat. Rec. 1994; 240: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Control sections were incubated with the second antibody only. Paraffin-embedded sections were examined with a Reichert Polyvar 2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Total RNA was isolated from NCI-H295 cells using RNeasy® (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and treated with DNase I. Two hundred ng total RNA was reversed transcribed and amplified using a Titan One Tube RT-PCR Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada) following the manufacturer's protocol. A 392-base pair (bp) fragment corresponding to exons 1 and 2 of P450C11 and P450aldo was amplified using the following primers: 5′-ATGGCACTCAGGGCAAAGGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAGAACACGCCACATTTGTGC-3′ (antisense) (7Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The PCR products were then digested withBglI (P450aldo-specific) and separated on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. GAPDH was used as an internal control; a 239-bp fragment containing a BglI restriction site was amplified using 5′-CATCCTGGGCTACACTGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTC-3′ (antisense) primers. The BglI digestion distinguished P450C11 from P450aldo by cleaving the 392-bp P450aldo fragment to 307- and 85-bp fragments; the conversion of the GAPDH 239-bp fragment to 176- and 63-bp fragments demonstrates completeBglI digestion. The marker pBR322 DNA-MspI digest was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). CA- and DN-PKC mutants were engineered by point mutation using a PCR technique (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar). In the case of the CA mutants, a specific alanine residue in the pseudo-substrate region was exchanged for a glutamic acid residue (PKCα A25E, PKCε A159E, PKCθ A148E, PKCζ A119E). The pseudo-substrate region refers to the consensus sequenceXRXX(S/T)XRX found in the phosphorylation sites of prominent PKC substrates. However, in the pseudo-substrate region of PKC, one alanine residue replaces a serine or threonine residue normally found in the substrate motif. It is generally thought that the pseudo-substrate region interacts with the catalytic (substrate binding) site of PKC and maintains the enzyme in an inactive state (23Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of the DN mutants, a critical lysine in the 5′-(pyro)-triphosphates of adenosine binding site was exchanged for an alanine residue (PKCα K368A, PKCε 75 437A, PKCθ K409A, PKCζ K281A) (24Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 25Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used as the expression vector. The modified pCAT basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to constructCYP11B2 gene deletion plasmids as we have described previously (3Coulombe N. Lefebvre A. LeHoux J.G. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 4LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The modifications consisted of the removal of an AP-1 consensus sequence and of an AP-1 like sequence. In this study −83-, −102-, −134-, −167-, −328-, −350-, −486-, and −2600-CYP11B2-CAT deletion plasmids were used (4LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequence 5′-CAGGGACAGC-3′ of the −102-CYP11B2 deletion plasmid was changed to 5′-tggtacccat-3′ to produce the −102 mutant (mut-102). NCI-H295 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 1% ITS Premix (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA), 2% UtroSer SF (Bio Sepra S.A., Villeneuve la Garenne, France), 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 units/ml penicillin G. The cells were grown at 37 °C under 95% air, 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed in NCI-H295 cells as described previously (4LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NCI-H295 cells (5 × 105) were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates and grown until 80–90% confluence. The cells were transiently transfected for 5 h with plasmid constructions using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, the cells were incubated with medium containing 2% UtroSer SF for 16 h to allow recovery and expression of foreign DNA. Media were changed to low serum media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 0.1% UtroSer SF), and the cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence/absence of AII (10−7m), KCl (16 mm), Bt2cAMP (1 mm), or TPA (0.16 μm). Cell lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing, and CAT assays were performed using [14C]chloramphenicol as described previously (4LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In experiments where CAT activity was too high, the assays were performed with smaller amounts of cell proteins to keep the rate of acetylation linear. Quantification was done using a Storm 860 laser scanner instrument (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Western blotting analysis was used to determine which PKC isoforms were expressed in hamster adrenal glands and in NCI-H295 cells. Adrenal glands of humans and rats were also included in our analysis to determine the similarity of PKC expression among species. Rat brain preparations were used as control (Fig.1, left lane). Results showed that the PKCα, -ε, and -ζ isoforms were present in hamster adrenal inner zones and zona glomerulosa, whereas PKCβ1, -β2, -γ, -θ, -λ, and δ were absent. PKCα, -ε, -θ, and -ζ and low levels of PKCλ were detected in NCI-H295 cells, whereas PKCβ1, -β2, -γ, and -δ were absent. PKCα, -ε, and -ζ were revealed in rat zona glomerulosa and inner zones, in human zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata-reticularis. Very low levels of PKCλ and -θ were also detected in adult human adrenal preparations. PKCδ was present in the human adrenal zona fasciculata and in very low levels in rat brain. The ubiquitous presence of PKCα, -ε, and -ζ in the adrenal cortex of species studied is indicative of their physiological importance in this tissue. Indirect immunofluorescence was also used to investigate the expression of PKC isozymes in paraffin sections of the hamster and the human adrenal cortex. Results showed (Fig. 2) that PKCα, -ε, and -ζ were present in hamster and human adrenal zona glomerulosa and, to a lesser extent, in the zona fasciculata.Figure 2Indirect immunofluorescence detection of PKC in micrographs of paraffin sections of hamster and human adrenal glands. A, the fluorescein-conjugated antibody revealed PKCα in the zona glomerulosa and in some cells of the zona fasciculata. B, PKCε was revealed in zona glomerulosa and in some cells of the zona fasciculata. C, PKCζ was revealed in the zona glomerulosa and in some cells of the zona fasciculata. Hum, human; Ham, hamster.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have analyzed the activation state of PKC in NCI-H295 cells and in hamster adrenal zona glomerulosa. Activated PKCs associate with cellular components and their distribution can be revealed in detergent Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (26Whelan R.D.H. Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of PKC isoforms makes them susceptible to dephosphorylation and degradation (27Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D.H. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In NCI-H295 cells, PKCθ and -ε isoforms were found in the Triton X-100-soluble (nonactivated) fraction whereas the α and ζ isoforms were distributed in the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 3). Similarly, in hamster adrenal zona glomerulosa, PKCα was also found in both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fraction. Furthermore, PKCε and -ζ were detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction. These data suggest that, under basal conditions, PKCα, -ε, and -ζ are activated in hamster adrenal zona glomerulosa and that PKCα and -ζ are also activated in NCI-H295 cells. In contrast, PKCε and -θ were found to be mostly associated with the Triton X-100-soluble fraction in NCI-H295 cells and therefore presumably nonactivated. The presence of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol (DAG)-sensitive PKC in NCI-H295 cells led us to investigate the effect of TPA on the P450aldo mRNA expression. This was done by reverse transcriptase-PCR performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 A shows the PCR-amplified products. BglI digestion distinguished P450aldo from P450C11 bands, and the complete BglI digestion was demonstrated by GAPDH (Fig. 4, B and C). TPA inhibited basal and stimulated P450aldo mRNA expression by AII, Bt2cAMP, or KCl. Although TPA inhibited AII- and KCl-stimulated P450C11 mRNA expression, it did not inhibit its basal or Bt2cAMP-stimulated expression. NCI-H295 cells transiently transfected with the hamster −2600-CYP11B2-CAT deletion plasmid were exposed to TPA and CAT activity determined as before (4LeHoux J.G. Lefebvre A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Results showed (Fig. 5) that TPA decreased CAT activity. Importantly, TPA abolished the stimulatory effects of AII, Bt2cAMP, or KCl, suggesting that activation of phorbol ester/DAG-sensitive PKC has a negative effect on the regulation of theCYP11B2 promoter activity. The KCl concentration used for stimulation in the above experiments was 16 mm. Although less efficient, lower concentrations of KCl (4–7 mm) were still able to stimulate the promoter activity (data not shown). The inhibitor Gö6976 specifically blocks the action of conventional PKCs (28Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schächtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This characteristic was used to discriminate between the action of the unique conventional PKCα and that of other DAG-dependent PKCs expressed in hamster adrenal and NCI-H295 cells. At 10−6m Gö6976 enhanced CAT activity (percentage of acetylation: mean ± S.E., control 8.43 ± 1.37; Gö6976: 16.51 ± 1.43, n= 3, performed in triplicate). These observations provided further evidence that PKCα was involved in suppression of the hamsterCYP11B2 promoter activity. To confirm the suppressive effect of PKCα on the expression of CYP11B2, cotransfection experiments were performed using CA-PKCα and DN-PKCα mutants. Results indicated that CYP11B2 promoter activity was inhibited when cotransfected with CA-PKCα (Fig.6 A). The inhibition was also observed when the cells had been transfected with 0.5 or 1 μg of PKCα-containing plasmid (Fig. 7). Of interest, expression of CA-PKCα also inhibited, in a plasmid concentration-dependent manner, the stimulatory effect of AII (Fig. 7). In contrast, expression of DN-PKCα enhanced promoter activity (Fig. 6 A).Figure 7CA-PKCα decreases the hamster −2600-CYP11B2-CAT expression in transfected NCI-H295 cells. NCI-H295 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of the hamster −2600-CYP11B2-CAT deletion plasmid and 1 μg of pcDNA3 per well (0). In other wells, increasing quantities (0.05–1 μg) of pcDNA3 harboring the mutated CA-PKCα DNA was substituted to equivalent quantities of pcDNA3. Results shown are measurements of three different samples (mean ± S.E.).Filled columns, treated angiotensin II (10−7m).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CA-PKCα also abolished the stimulatory effects of KCl and Bt2cAMP on CAT activity (Fig.8 A), whereas DN-PKCα increased the basal promoter activity (Fig. 6 A) and did not prevent the stimulatory effects of AII, KCl and Bt2cAMP (Fig. 8 A). The fact that the DN mutant enhanced rather than decreased these effects adds weight to the hypothesis that PKCα suppresses the hamster CYP11B2 promoter activity. The fact that PKCε was present in NCI-H295 cells and, to a lesser extent in hamster adrenal zona glomerulosa (Figs. 1 and 2), led us to address whether this PKC plays a role on the hamster CYP11B2 promoter activity in cotransfected NCI-H295 cells. We found that CA-PKCε had an inhibitory effect on CAT activity (Figs. 6 A and 8 B) similar to that of the CA-PKCα mutant. In contrast, DN-PKCε had a stimulatory effect (Figs. 6 A and 8 B). Moreover, the stimulatory effects of AII, KCl, and Bt2cAMP were blocked in cells transfected with CA-PKCε but not with DN-PKCε (Fig. 8 B). These results indicated that PKCε could also be involved in the regulation of the CYP11B2 promoter activity in NCI-H295 cells. The role of atypical PKCζ, which is expressed in the hamster adrenal zona glomerulosa and NCI-H295 cells (Fig. 1), on the hamster CYP11B2 promoter activity was investigated in the next series of experiments. In contrast to results obtained with CA-PKCα, CA-PKCζ stimulated the CYP11B2promoter basal activity (Figs. 6 B and 8 C). In addition, cell stimulation with AII or KCl were not abolished in cotransfection experiments with CA-PKCζ; the effect of Bt2cAMP, however, was abolished. DN-PKCζ increased the basal activity of the promoter and the stimulatory effects of AII, KCl, and Bt2cAMP were observed (Figs. 6 B and8 C). The aim of the next series of experiments was to obtain evidence of the state of activation of PKCα, CA-PKCα, and DN-PKCα by comparing their distribution in Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions in transfected NCI-H295 cells stimulated by AII or TPA. Fig.9 showed that wild type PKCα was mainly present in the soluble fraction whereas faint protein bands were found in the insoluble fraction. The pattern of PKCα distribution was not altered when cells were exposed to AII. In contrast, TPA induced an increase of PKCα in the insoluble fraction. Although speculative, the slow and fast moving bands observed in the soluble and insoluble fractions are presumably phosphorylated and dephosphorylated protein, respectively, which is in agreement with results reported by Garcia-Paramio et al. (12Garcia-Paramio P. Cabrerizo Y. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Marked differences were observed with preparations of cells transfected with CA-PKCα. In a situation where CAT activity was inhibited, the insoluble fraction of these cells contained large amounts of immunoreactive protein migrating faster than the single band detected in the soluble fraction, suggesting a translocation of PKCα within the cell and presumably dephosphorylation of the protein. The presence of AII did not change this profile. A similar profile was observed with TPA except for the appearance of a small fast migrating band in the soluble fraction. Fig.9 also shows results obtained in the case of the DN form of PKCα in a situation where CAT activity was not inhibited. Without treatment, the main immunoreactive band found was a slow migrating protein in the soluble fraction. When the cells were treated with AII or TPA, a second fast migrating band was revealed in the"

In the last decade dinucleoside polyphosphates received considerable attention in view of their multiple biological and pharmacological activities. Dinucleoside polyphosphates were identified in prokaryotic (1Kitzler J.W. Farr S.B. Ames B.N. McLennan A.G. Intracellular Functions of ApnN: Prokaryotes.

Di(adenosine-5′) tri- and tetraphosphates (Ap3A, Ap4A) were the first dinucleoside polyphosphates to be identified in human platelets (3Lüthje J. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Both Apn Gs and Gpn Gs (with n = 3–6) are growth-stimulating factors of VSMCs. (7Schlüter H. Gross I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several purine receptor subtypes (P2 receptors) mediating the actions of dinucleoside polyphosphates have been established with different physiological effects (8van der Giet M. Khattab M. Borgel J. Schlüter H. Zidek W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). The P2 receptors are divided into two families of ligand-gated ion channel and G protein-coupled receptors termed P2X and P2Y receptor, respectively. There are eight mammalian P2X receptors (P2X1–8) (10North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 11Bo X. Schoepfer R. Burnstock G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14401-14407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and five mammalian P2Y receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11) that have been cloned (9Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). From these results the question arose as to whether P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates containing two adenosine or guanosine groups or an adenosine and a guanosine group also occur in humans. There is one report on the existence of diadenosine diphosphate (Ap2A) isolated from human cardiac tissue (12Luo J. Jankowski J. Knobloch M. Van der Giet M. Gardanis K. Russ T. Vahlensieck U. Neumann J. Schmitz W. Tepel M. Deng M.C. Zidek W. Schlüter H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ap2A the P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates Ap2G and Gp2G have not been described as endogenous substances so far in the literature. Here the existence of diadenosine diphosphate (Ap2A), adenosine guanosine diphosphate (Ap2G), as well as diguanosine diphosphate (Gp2G) in releasable granules of human platelets is shown for the first time and their growth-stimulating effect on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells is described. HPLC water (gradient grade) and acetonitrile were from Merck (Germany). All other substances were purchased from Sigma (Germany). Dinucleoside diphosphates were isolated from human platelets unsuitable for transfusion. The platelets were suspended in an isotonic salt solution and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in an isotonic salt solution and centrifuged again (2500 × g, 5 min). The supernatant was aspirated, and the platelet pellet was frozen to −30 °C and rethawed in bidistilled water (step 1). Then the resulting suspension was deproteinized (step 2) with 0.6 m perchloric acid (final concentration). After adjusting the pH to 7.0 with 5m KOH, the precipitated protein and KClO4 were removed by centrifugation. Triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) was added to the supernatant (final TEAA concentration 40 mm), and hydrophobic substances were concentrated on a C18 reversed phase column (Lichroprep, 310 × 65 mm, 40–65 μm, Merck, Germany) using 40 mm TEAA in water (eluent A; flow, 2 ml/min). After removing substances not binding to the column with aqueous 40 mm TEAA (flow: 2 ml/min), the adsorbed substances were eluted with 20% acetonitrile in water (eluent B). The elution was detected by measuring the UV absorption at 254 nm. The eluate was lyophilized and stored frozen at −80 °C (step 3). The lyophilized eluate of the reversed phase chromatography was dissolved in 1 m ammonium acetate (eluent C; pH 9.5) and purified further with affinity chromatography (step 4). The affinity chromatography gel, phenyl boronic acid coupled to a cation-exchange resin (BioRex 70, Bio-Rad), was synthesized according to Barnes (13Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The affinity resin was packed into a glass column (150 × 20 mm) and equilibrated with 1m NH4Ac (pH 9.5; flow, 2 ml/min). The pH of the eluate from the reversed phase column was adjusted to pH 9.5 and loaded to the affinity column. The column was washed with 1 mNH4Ac (pH 9.5) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Binding substances were eluted with 1 mm HCl (eluent D). Fractions were monitored with a UV detector at 254 nm. The eluate was frozen and lyophilized. The eluate of the affinity chromatography was desalted by reversed phase chromatography (step 4). The reversed phase column (Supersphere, 210 × 4.1 mm, 4 μm, Merck) was equilibrated with aqueous 40 mm TEAA solution (eluent A). The sample, with 40 mm TEAA in water added, was pumped at a rate of 0.5 ml/min onto the column. After washing the column with 15 ml of eluent A, the fraction of interest was eluted with 35% acetonitrile in water (eluent E). The resulting fractions were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. The eluate of the reversed phase column was lyophilized, dissolved in 0.5 ml of 20 mm K2HPO4 in water (pH 8.0, eluent F), and chromatographed by using an anion-exchanger (DEAE 5PW, 150 × 20 mm, 10 μm, Tosohaas, Japan) using 20 mm K2HPO4 in water, pH 8.0 (eluent F), and 20 mm K2HPO4 and 1m NaCl (pH 8.0) (eluent G) in water using the following gradient: 0–10 min: 0–5% G; 10–105 min: 5–35% G; 105–110 min: 35–100% G; 110–120 min: 100% G; 120–121 min: 100–0% G. The flow rate was 2.0 ml/min, and absorption was measured at 254 nm (step 6). Thereafter, each fraction of the anion-exchange chromatography with a significant UV absorbance at 254 nm was chromatographed on an analytical reversed phase column (Supersphere RP C18 end-capped, 250 × 4.6 mm, Merck) using 40 mm TEAA in water (eluent A) and 100% acetonitrile (eluent H) with the following gradient: 0–4 min: 0–4% H; 4–64 min: 4–11% H; 64–70 min: 11–70% H (flow, 0.5 ml/min; step 7). The resulting fractions were lyophilized and stored at −30 °C. Fractions corresponding to the main UV254 nm-absorbing peaks were rechromatographed (step 8) on the reversed phase column (conditions as in step 7). To test the fractions for homogeneity, a small part (1/1000) of the desalted and lyophilized fractions of the anion-exchange chromatography were chromatographed on a second reversed phase HPLC column (Poros, R 2/H, 2.1 × 100 mm, Perseptive Biosystems). The column was run in the gradient mode (flow rate, 300 μl/min) with 10 mm K2HPO4 and 2 mm tetrabutyl-ammonium hydrogen sulfate in water (eluent I) and 80% acetonitrile in water (eluent J; gradients: 0–30.5 min, 0–30% J; 30.5–31 min, 30–50% J; 31–34.5 min, 50% J; 34.5–35 min, 0% J). The elution was detected by measuring the UV absorption at 254 nm. The desalted and lyophilized fractions of the anion-exchange chromatography were examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) (14Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A reflectron-type time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Reflex III, Bruker-Franzen, Germany) was used according to Hillenkamp (14Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The sample was mounted on an x, y, z movable stage allowing for irradiation of selected sample areas. In this study, a nitrogen laser (Laser Science Inc.) with an emission wavelength of 337 nm and 3-ns pulse duration was used. The laser beam was focused to a diameter typically of 50 μm at an angle of 45° to the surface of the target. Microscopic sample observation was possible via a diachronic mirror in the beam path. 10–20 single spectra were accumulated for a better signal-to-noise ratio. The concentrations of the analyzed substances were 1–10 μm in double-distilled water. 1 μl of the analyte solution was mixed with 1 μl of the matrix solution. For this study, a solution of 50 mg/ml 3-hydroxypicolinic acid was used. For calibration of the mass spectra, diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6A) was used as external standard. The mixture was gently dried on an inert metal surface before introduction into the mass spectrometer. The mass accuracy was in the range of ∼0.05%. The desalted, lyophilized fractions of the reversed phase chromatography (step 8) were dissolved in water (100 μl). To measure UV spectra at different pH the pH values of the solutions were adjusted to 3.0, 7.0, and 9.0 by 0.1 m HCl and 0.1 mNaOH, respectively. The UV absorbance of the fractions were determined by a UV-visible spectrometer (DU-600, Beckman) at wavelengths between 190 and 400 nm with a scan speed of 400 nm/min. Three platelet concentrates (each 200 ml; 107platelets/μl) were resuspended in 600 ml of a buffer containing 0.14m NaCl, 0.15 mm Tris-HCl. To prevent premature activation 0.35% (w/v) albumin was added to the buffer. The resuspended platelet concentrates were divided into three parts. To test the release of the dinucleoside diphosphates, one aliquot was incubated with thrombin (0.05 units/ml) for 1 min. Preliminary experiments showed that fibrinogen binding in platelets did not exceed 2000 molecules/cell. After stimulation with thrombin, the fibrinogen binding rose 20- to 30-fold. Determination of fibrinogen was performed exactly as described previously (15Nofer J.R. Walter M. Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Tepel M. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, the concentration of serotonin was determined in the supernatant. As control the second aliquot was not incubated with thrombin. For purification of dinucleoside diphosphates Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G from the supernatant, platelets were removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). The supernatant was deproteinated with 0.6 m (final concentration) perchloric acid and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). After adjusting the pH to 7.0 with 5 m KOH the precipitated proteins and KClO4 were removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). The supernatants of both aliquots of the platelet concentrates were chromatographed according to chromatographic steps for the purification of dinucleoside diphosphates from platelets. Dinucleoside diphosphates Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G were identified by retention time comparison with authentic substances as well as MALDI-MS. For the measurement of the total endogenous serotonin content, a method described by Hervig et al. (16Hervig T. Volundardottir T. Bakken A.M. Farstad M. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, 600 μl of the platelet concentrate as prepared above was mixed with 200 μl of a 2.8 m perchloric acid solution containing dithiothreitol (40 mm) to precipitate the proteins. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation (8000 × g, 2 min), and 520 μl of the supernatant was neutralized with 130 μl of 3 m K2HPO4. The precipitated potassium perchlorate was removed by a second centrifugation (8000 × g, 2 min). The supernatant was transferred and was directly analyzed by the reversed phase chromatographic method of Anderson et al.(17Anderson G.M. Feibel F.C. Cohen D.J. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 100 μl of the supernatant was injected onto a reversed phase column (Supersphere, 210 × 4.1 mm, 4 μm, Merck) eluted with 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 250 μl/liter triethylamine, 150 mg/liter sodium octylsulfate, and 20% (v/v) methanol (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min). The fluorescence was detected using an SP920 intelligent fluorescence detector (Jasco) with excitation and emission wavelength settings of 285 and 350 nm, respectively. Quantification of serotonin was done by using a calibration curve. For the measurement of the released serotonin after thrombin stimulation, a method described by Hervig et al. (16Hervig T. Volundardottir T. Bakken A.M. Farstad M. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, 600 μl of the platelet concentrate as prepared above were incubated with 10 NIH units of thrombin (10 μl) for 10 min. After removing the platelet remnant by centrifugation (8000 ×g, 30 s), 450 μl of supernatant was mixed with 150 μl of the perchloric acid/dithiothreitol solution and centrifuged again (8000 × g, 2 min). 400 μl of the supernatant was neutralized with 100 μl of a 3 m solution of K2HPO4, recentrifuged as above, and injected to the chromatography using the method described by Anderson et al. (17Anderson G.M. Feibel F.C. Cohen D.J. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast to diadenosine diphosphate and diguanosine diphosphate, adenosine guanosine diphosphate was commercially not available. Therefore, synthesis of adenosine guanosine diphosphate was necessary to control the authenticity of the isolated substances. Adenosine guanosine diphosphate was synthesized and chromatographed following a study described elsewhere (18Jankowski J. Potthoff W. Zidek W. Schlüter H. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 719: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ap2G was synthesized by mixing AMP (25 mm) and GMP (25 mm) as substrates in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (2.5 m), HEPES (2 m), and magnesium chloride (125 mm). The substances were dissolved in water, thoroughly mixed with a vortex mixer, and incubated at 37 °C at pH 6.5 for 48 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated on a preparative C18 reversed phase column (condition described above). The concentrate was displaced on a reversed phase column (carrier: 40 mm TEAA in water (eluent A); displacer: 160 mm n-butanol (eluent K), flow 100 μl/min). As a result of displacement chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography yielded baseline separated dinucleoside diphosphates (Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G). Commercially available diadenosine diphosphate and diguanosine diphosphate are contaminated with mononucleotides. Therefore, these P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates were purified by displacement chromatography using a reversed phase column (conditions as describe above) before testing the authenticity of the isolated substances. Aliquots of the fractions containing homogenous nucleotides from the reversed phase chromatography (steps 7 and 8 of the purification procedure), were incubated with enzymes as described in the following. The samples were dissolved: (a) in 20 μl 200 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.9) and incubated with 5′-nucleotide hydrolase (3 milliunits (mU); from Crotalus durissus, EC3.1.15.1, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany, purified according to Sulkowski and Laskowski (19Sulkowski E. Laskowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for 9 min at 37 °C; (b) in 20 μl of 200 mm Tris and 20 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 3′-nucleotide hydrolase (1 mU; from calf spleen, EC 3.1.16.1, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C; and (c) in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (1 mU; EC 3.1.3.1, from calf intestinal mucosa, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by an ultrafiltration with a centrifuge filter (exclusion limit, 10 kDa). After filtration of the enzymatic cleavage products, the filtrate, dissolved in 980 μl of eluent F, was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a MiniQ PC 3.2/3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; eluent F: 10 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.0; eluent G: 20 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.0 with 1 m NaCl; gradient: 0–5 min: 0% G, 5–35 min: 0–40% G, 35–37 min: 40–100% G; flow rate: 30 μl/min). Aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were subcultured in 96-well dishes (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml and kept in culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) to reach a subconfluent monolayer. After 24 h, the cells were growth-arrested in 0.1% FCS for 48 h without affecting cell adherence to culture wells. Quiescent VSMCs were then exposed to fresh culture medium with 0.1% FCS with and without the tested agonists for another 48-h incubation period. Cell proliferation was measured using the [3H]thymidine incorporation rate as described elsewhere (20Heidenreich S. Tepel M. Schlüter H. Harrach B. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2862-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The viability of VSMCs was tested using trypan blue exclusion test. The viability was 95.2 ± 3.5% under control conditions and 93 ± 4.1% after stimulation with dinucleoside diphosphates. Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ) and cultured over several passages after detachment of the confluent cells with Puck's Saline A physiological solution (21Puck T.T. Cieciura S.J. Fischer H.W. J. Exp. Med. 1957; 106: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) containing 0.04% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA buffer. The cells were allowed to grow as described for VSMCs. Fibroblasts were seeded in 24-well culture plates and grown to confluence. Then the medium was replaced by serum-free medium consisting of a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-10 medium (1:1). Following another 24-h cultivation in serum-free medium, stimuli were added and cells were exposed to the stimulating agents for 20 h before 3 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to the serum-free medium. Four hours later, experiments were terminated by aspirating the medium and subjecting the cultures to sequential washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% trichloroacetic acid, and ethanol/ether (2:1, v/v). Acid-insoluble [3H]thymidine was extracted into 250-μl dishes with 0.5 m NaOH, and 100 μl of this solution was mixed with 5 ml of scintillant (Packard, Ultimagold) and quantified using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801, Düsseldorf, Germany). Human platelets were isolated (step 1) and deproteinated with perchloric acid (step 2), and the supernatant nucleotides were concentrated by ion-pair reversed phase chromatography (step 3). In the following steps, isolation and identification of dinucleoside diphosphates from human platelets is exemplified for Gp2G. After mononucleotides were separated from dinucleotides by affinity chromatography (13Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (step 4) the desalted and lyophilized eluate (step 5) was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography (step 6). The anion-exchange chromatogram is shown in Fig.1 A. Although P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates have the same charge, P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G were separated because of hydrophobic interaction between the anion-exchanger and the P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphate. Fractions of the anion-exchange chromatography with a significant absorbance at 254 nm were separated by reversed phase chromatography (step 7). In Fig. 1 B the chromatogram of the reversed phase chromatography is given. The substance eluting at a retention time of 27 min was rechromatographed by reversed phase chromatography (step 8) using the same conditions as before (step 7). In the last chromatographic step (step 8), a single UV peak was obtained (Fig. 1 C). The substance underlying this peak was identified by the following results: (a) The substance chromatographed to homogeneity was analyzed by MALDI-PSD mass spectrometry revealing a molecular mass of 709.4 (Fig.2 A). Each signal was assigned to a fragment of Gp2G as shown in TableI. The MALDI-PSD spectrum was completely identical to that of authentic Gp2G (14Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). (b) The UV spectrum of guanine was obtained from the rechromatographed substance, including the characteristic shift obtained by acidification to pH 3.0, 7.0, and 9.0 (Fig. 2 B; Table II) (22Beaven G.H. Holliday E.R. Johnson E.A. Chargaff-Davidson J.N. Nucleotide Acids. 1. Academic Press, New York1947: 493-494Google Scholar). (c) The retention time of the isolated fraction in step 8 was identical to that of authentic Gp2G (18Jankowski J. Potthoff W. Zidek W. Schlüter H. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 719: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). (d) Cleavage of the molecules with 5′-nucleotide hydrolase (from C. durissus) yielded GMP, as evidenced by MALDI mass spectra and by retention times identical with those of authentic Gp2G. The cleavage pattern was identical to that of synthetic Gp2G. Incubation of the molecule with 3′-nucleotide hydrolase (calf spleen) and alkaline phosphatase yielded no cleavage products. The enzymatic cleavage experiments demonstrate that the polyphosphate chain interconnects the guanosines via phosphoester bonds with the 5′-oxygens of the riboses (Fig. 2 C).Table IResults of positive-ion PSD-Maldi mass spectra of the isolated fractions (A, adenine; A, adenosine; M, protonated parent ion; p, phosphate group, e.g. Ap4 adenosine tetraphosphate) (conditions: reflectron-type time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Reflex III, Bruker-Franzen, Germany); concentration of the analysed substance: 1–10 μmol/l; matrix solution: 50 mg/ml 3-hydroxy-picolinic acid; emission wavelength: 337 nm; pulse duration: 3 ns).Fragment ions [M +H]+Ap2A/DaAp2G/DaGp2G/DaA′136136G′-H2O134G′152152A-2H2O232232G-2H2O248248A-H2O250250M-Ap1330M-Gp1330M-Gp1346M-Ap1346Ap1348348Gp1364364Ap2428428Gp2444444M-A′-H2O525M-A′542M-G′-2H2O523M-G′-H2O523540M677693709 Open table in a new tab Table IIMaxima and minima values of the UV absorbance of the isolated fractions after two reversed phase chromatographies at different pH values (condition: UV/Vis-spectrophotometer DU-600 (Beckmann); pH values 3.0, 7.0, and 9.0 were adjusted by using 0.1 mol/l HCl and 0.1 mol/l NaOH respectively; scan speed: 400 nm/min).pH 3.0pH 7.0pH 9.0λmin/nmλmax/nmλmin/nmλmax/nmλmin/nmλmax/nmAp2A232.1260.0231.9261.1229.8261.1Ap2G230.1256.8227.8255.1226.9255.0Gp2G228.7255.3227.6254.6226.8253.7 Open table in a new tab In analogous manner also Ap2A as well as Ap2G were purified from human platelets and identified by the signal pattern of the PSD-MALDI-MS fragmentations (Table I), enzymatic cleavage experiments, and UV spectroscopy (Table II). Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G induced a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells as determined by [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig.3). The bar labeled ascontrol in Fig. 3 represents the [3H]thymidine incorporation in cultures without the stimulants. The maximum effect of Ap2A was obtained at a concentration of 10−5m, which induced an increase of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation of 225.9 ± 66.9% above control, 168.6 ± 31.0% above control at a concentration of 10−6m for Ap2G, 77.0 ± 13.3% above control at a concentration of 10−6m for Gp2G, and 1175.0 ± 66.3% above control at a concentration of 5 × 10−9m for PDGF. These data are means ± S.E. from 10 independent experiments with 8 cultures. The raw data of a characteristic series of measurements for each dinucleoside diphosphate were: 10−5mAp2A: 16,440 ± 1,621 (control: 5,175 ± 160); 10−6m Ap2G: 8,453 ± 2,210 (control: 3,199 ± 335); 10−6mGp2G: 6,556 ± 429 (control: 3,986 ± 239) (in cpm/well ± S.E.). Characteristic data for 10−8m PDGF were 19,570 ± 2,193 (control 1,823 ± 219) (in cpm/well ± S.E.). The calculated EC50 (log m; mean ± S.E.) for the P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates were −6.07 ± 0.14 for Ap2A, −6.27 ± 0.25 for Ap2G, −6.91 ± 0.44 for Gp2G, and −9.72 ± 0.25 for PDGF. Costimulation with PDGF had no significant effect on the threshold concentration of the growth-stimulating effect of all three dinucleoside diphosphates. The growth-stimulating effect of dinucleoside diphosphates on VSMCs was not significantly modified in the presence of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In the range of 10−9 to 10−5mdinucleoside diphosphates did not significantly affect DNA synthesis of cultured fibroblasts (10−5m Ap2A: 178 ± 21; 10−5m Ap2G: 221 ± 25; 10−5m Gp2G: 229 ± 22; control: 172 ± 12 (in cpm/well ± S.E.)). After isolation and identification of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates from human platelets, the question arose as to whether P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates are released in the extracellular space. Fig. 4 shows the anion-exchange chromatograms of a platelet suspension (Fig.4 A) and a supernatant from an equivalent platelet suspension aggregated with thrombin (Fig. 4 B). P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates can be found in the supernatant after platelet aggregation (labeled in Fig.4 B by arrows) but not in the supernatant of unstimulated platelets. The intracellular amount of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates in intact human platelets can be estimated in the range of 0.5–2.0 attomol/platelet. From the concentrations determined in the supernatant, the portion released upon platelet aggregation was estimated as 61.5 ± 4.3% for each P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates. The intracellular amount of serotonin was 3.2 ± 0.5 attomol/platelet. In the supernatant of unstimulated platelets serotonin was not detectable. After platelet stimulation with thrombin the serotonin amount of supernatant was 2.2 ± 0.4 attomol/platelet, indicating that 68.7 ± 12.6% of the intracellular serotonin amount was released by thrombin stimulation. The comparable degree of secretion of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates and serotonin suggests that both classes of agents are released in a quantitatively similar fashion. The findings revealed that P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G are endogenous messengers of human platelets. The results of the cell proliferation assay show that Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G act as potent growth mediators of VSMCs. The maximum effect of Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G on VSMC proliferation rate was about one order of magnitude less, and the threshold concentration was about one order of magnitude higher than for PDGF, indicating that the dinucleoside phosphates are weaker growth factors than PDGF. Nevertheless, it has to be kept in mind that the local concentrations of these nucleotides after platelet aggregation probably are much higher than the physiological PDGF concentrations. The receptor-mediating vascular growth is not yet known, although a P2 purinoceptor subtype is most likely. Especially, the P2Y2 purinoceptor may be considered, because ATP and GTP binding to this receptor cause similar mitogenic effects in VSMCs (23Erlinge D. You J. Wahlestedt C. Edvinsson L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At present, the growth-stimulating effect of dinucleoside diphosphates is only demonstrable in VSMCs. The growth of fibroblasts is not affected by dinucleoside diphosphates. This result may represent a different expression of purinoceptors on VSMCs and fibroblasts. In contrast to Apn G and Gpn G with n = 3–6 (7Schlüter H. Gross I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G do not potentiate the growth-stimulating effect of PDGF. Presently it is open to speculation whether this different behavior reflects activation of different purine receptor subtypes. Because the P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates are released upon platelet activation, their growth-stimulating effect may contribute to that of PDGF and other growth mediators released from platelets. Therefore, together with known growth mediators, the described nucleotides may also participate in initiating atherosclerotic lesions. Obviously, Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G may exert their effects after release by platelet activation as is known for the diadenosine polyphosphates Apn A (with n= 3–6) (3Lüthje J. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press Inc., Ann Arbor, MI1992Google Scholar) and for the Apn Gs and Gpn Gs with (n = 3–6) (7Schlüter H. Gross I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). From the intracellular amount of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates in intact human platelets, the intracellular concentration of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates in intact human platelets can be calculated as 0.1–0.4 mm (volume of a platelet: 5.2 fl (25Corash L. Tan H. Gralnick H.R. Blood. 1977; 49: 71-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In platelets, two pools of nucleotides have been demonstrated (26Holmsen H. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1965; 17: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One pool is utilized for the metabolic needs of the platelets. The second pool, the dense granules, is a storage pool, which can be released into the extracellular space. As demonstrated, serotonin and dinucleoside diphosphates Ap2A, Ap2G, and Gp2G are released in parallel, it can be assumed that dinucleoside diphosphates are costored in dense granula with serotonin. The concentration of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates in the dense granula can be estimated to be 0.2–0.8 mm, assuming that 50% of total volume of human platelets constitutes dense granula (27White J.W. Colman R.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 2nd. Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1987: 537-555Google Scholar). The extracellular dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations occurring after platelet activation depend on the extracellular volume of distribution. The intraplatelet concentrations suggest that, in the close environment of a platelet thrombus, similar dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations can be found as in platelets. Therefore, the maximum extracellular concentration of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates can be calculated as 0.2–0.8 mm in accordance to the concentration of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates in dense granula. The minimum concentration can be correspondingly estimated as 0.1 − 0.4 μm in accordance with the concentration of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates after the release into the surrounding blood volume of the platelets. Theses estimations demonstrate that the extracellular concentrations of P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates are sufficient for affecting the rate of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. How are these substances biosynthesized? The enzymes involved in synthesis of diadenosine polyphosphates are only partially known, and none of the known enzymes are described in human platelets (for review see Ref. 28Schlüter H. Tepel M. Zidek W. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the formation of Ap3A and Ap4A (aminoacyl-AMP + ADP → Ap3A, aminoacyl-AMP + ATP → Ap4A) (29Plateau P. Blanquet S. McLennan A.G. McLennan A.G. Synthesis of NpnN (n = 3 or 4) in Vitro and in Vivo. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 63-79Google Scholar). Adenosine 5′-monophosphate does not react with this enzyme (30Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. McLennan A.G. Determination of Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 29-61Google Scholar), and therefore this type of enzymatic reaction cannot yield Ap2A. Ap4A phosphorylases are another class of diadenosine polyphosphate-synthesizing enzymes according to the following reaction ADP + ATP → Ap4A + Pi(29Plateau P. Blanquet S. McLennan A.G. McLennan A.G. Synthesis of NpnN (n = 3 or 4) in Vitro and in Vivo. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 63-79Google Scholar). Theoretically, the reaction of a diadenosine polyphosphate phosphorylase catalyzing the formation of Ap2A should be AMP + ADP → Ap2A + Pi. Alternatively, a nonenzymatic synthesis may be considered. Given that mostly mononucleotides such as AMP are found together with biogenic amines such as catecholamines, the coexistence of both nucleotides and amines within the same subcellular localization may allow a nonenzymatic reaction generating diadenosine polyphosphates. From AMP and a biogenic amine a phosphoramidate may be generated, which is a highly reactive intermediate. A further reaction with another AMP could then yield diadenosine diphosphate (Ap2A). At present no definite answer can be given by which biochemical pathway P1,P2-dinucleoside diphosphates are synthesized in human platelets. In conclusion, releasable granules of human platelets contain diadenosine diphosphate (Ap2A), adenosine guanosine diphosphate (Ap2G), as well as diguanosine diphosphate (Gp2G), which are potent growth-stimulating mediators in vascular smooth muscle cells.

GM-CSF is expressed by a wide variety of cells including myeloid, mesenchymal, and lymphoid cells in response to stress signals such as those derived from infection, inflammation, and blood loss (20Shannon M.F.

The human GM-CSF proximal promoter can be conveniently divided into two domains (domain 1, −114 to −71 and domain 2, −70 to −31), which are both important for GM-CSF regulation (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

The two domains have many binding sites for transcription factors including: NF-κB/Rel, CBF, AP-1, ETS/NFAT, and CD28-responsive complex (CD28RC), which all act to mediate GM-CSF expression (reviewed in Refs. 20Shannon M.F.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to the double-stranded DNA binding transcription factors mentioned above, we have shown previously that there are four CSD binding sites along the GM-CSF proximal promoter. There are two single-stranded DNA CSD binding sites along the noncoding (−) strand of domain 1 and two along the coding (+) strand of domain 2 (Fig. 1, A andB) (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F.

We demonstrated that these CSD sites acted as repressor sites in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, that CSD proteins could bind to these sites, and that overexpression lead to repression of TNFα-mediated activation of GM-CSF (21Coles L.S.

T cells are a major source of GM-CSF in vivo, and we wished to determine whether CSD proteins played a role in GM-CSF transcription in these cells. We now report that CSD proteins are present in Jurkat T cells and bind to the defined CSD binding sites along the GM-CSF promoter. The Jurkat T cell nuclear CSD complexes that form on the GM-CSF promoter are distinct from those found in HEL fibroblasts. Using transient transfection assays, we previously showed that the CSD binding sites acted as repressor elements in HEL fibroblasts. However, when Jurkat T cells are stimulated with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore to mimic T cell receptor activation, the CSD factors behave as coactivators. The coactivation seen does not function through the CSD binding sites but through potential protein-protein interactions mediated via the C-terminal domain of CSD proteins. Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting oligonucleotides encoding human GM-CSF promoter fragments into the pXP1 luciferase vector (Promega). The number after the pGM in each luciferase construct name indicates how many CSD binding sites are present. The plasmids pGM1-Luc, pGM2-Luc, and pGM4-Luc were constructed by cloning oligonucleotides (withHindIII 5′ and BamHI 3′ ends) spanning regions of the GM-CSF promoter (−65 to +28), (−70 to +28), and (−114 to +28) into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pXP1 (Fig.1 A). The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the CSD binding site in pGM1-Luc from 5′-ACCA-3′ to 5′-AGGA-3′ to create the pGM1-mut1-Luc reporter plasmid (Fig. 1 A). The backbone expression vector pRcCMV was obtained from Invitrogen. Construction of the RelA expression plasmid has been described previously (42Dunn S.M. Coles L.S. Lang R.K. Gerondakis S. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 2469-2479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of the expression plasmids pSGdbpAv and pSGdbpB has been described previously (22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The dbpB deletion plasmid pSGdbpBΔ1 was created by digesting pSGdbpB withNarI, which removes the CSD and C-terminal domain of dbpB, followed by religation (pSGdbpBΔ1 contains the first 47 amino acids of dbpB) (Fig. 1 C). The dbpB deletion plasmid pSGdbpBΔ2 was created by digesting pSGdbpB with EcoRI andSau3AI, which removes most of the C-terminal domain of dbpB, and ligating this fragment into anEcoRI/BglII-digested pSG5, pSGdbpBΔ2, containing the first 173 amino acids of dbpB (Fig. 1 C). All oligonucleotides were purchased from GeneWorks (Adelaide, Australia), and full-length product was purified from nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (43Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2d ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA probes for gel retardation assays were prepared by end-labeling oligonucleotides with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP followed by gel purification. Construction of the bacterial expression construct for CSD protein dbpB (pGEXBT) has been previously described (23Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14482-14493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain MC1061 transformed with pGEXBT was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to produce recombinant GST-dbpB fusion protein. Recombinant GST-dbpB was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bacterial expression construct for recombinant RelA was a gift of Dr. Steven Gerondakis, and protein was prepared according to the procedure described by Dunn et al.(42Dunn S.M. Coles L.S. Lang R.K. Gerondakis S. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 2469-2479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HUT78 T cells and Jurkat T cells as previously reported (44 45). Gel retardations were carried out using 0.25 ng of single-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 1 A) in a 10-μl reaction mix of 0.5× TM buffer (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

Retardation assays using recombinant protein also contained 2 μg of bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed on 12% (for nuclear extracts) and 6% (for recombinant proteins) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run in 0.5× TBE (46Shannon M.F. Occhiodoro F.S. Ryan G.R. Vadas M.A. Lymphokine Recept. Interact. 1989; 179: 73-80Google Scholar). Competitions with unlabeled single strand oligonucleotides were performed by mixing protein and unlabeled probe followed by the immediate addition of the 32P-labeled probe (22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antibody blocking experiments were performed by adding protein and antibody and incubating for 5 min at room temperature before adding the32P-labeled probe. The reaction was then incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature before being analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. For UV cross-linking, nuclear extracts were bound to 32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probes (Fig.1 B), and the complexes were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel as described above. The gel was exposed to UV light (340 nm) for 15 min to cross-link bound protein to the DNA. The gel was exposed to x-ray film for 12 h at 4 °C, and the retarded complexes were excised. Protein in the excised bands was analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 43Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2d ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar). The anti-CSD peptide antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with the peptide (IKKNNPRKYLRSVGD) (dbpB amino acids 89–103) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Imject conjugation kit, Pierce). Immunoglobulins were partially purified via ammonium sulfate precipitation. The specificity of the anti-CSD peptide antibody was verified by dot blot immunoblots against the CSD peptide, peptides to different regions of the dbpB protein, and recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (data not shown). The Jurkat T cell line was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and gentamycin antibiotics. Electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser was used for transfection of Jurkat T cells at 270 V and a capacitance of 960 microfarad. 5 × 106 cells were electroporated in 500 μl of RPMI with 20% fetal calf serum per transfection with 5 μg of reporter plasmid and 10 μg of expression plasmid. Cells were stimulated 24 h post-transfection at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm calcium ionophore (A23187) and, 8 h post-stimulation, were assayed for luciferase activity as described by Osborne et al. (47Osborne C.S. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from Jurkat and HUT78 T cells were isolated as described previously (44 45), and 10 μg of protein was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane via a Bio-Rad protein transfer apparatus. The filter was probed with CSD peptide antibody (1:1000 dilution) and developed with an ECL detection kit according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Southwestern analysis, nuclear extracts were prepared as described above, and the filter was probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides as described by Silva et al. (48Silva C.M. Tully D.B.

We have previously shown that both HEL fibroblasts and HUT78 T cells contain nuclear CSD proteins and that they bind to the human GM-CSF proximal promoter (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F.

We have also shown previously that the nuclear CSD complexes in HEL fibroblasts and HUT78 T cells are the same (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

To determine whether Jurkat T cells contained CSD proteins, Jurkat T cell nuclear extract was bound in a gel shift assay to single-stranded oligonucleotides spanning domain 1 and domain 2 of the human proximal GM-CSF promoter (Fig. 1 B) and compared with HUT78 T cell CSD factor binding on the same oligonucleotides. When HUT78 T cell nuclear extract was used in a gel shift assay with the noncoding (−) strand of domain 1 (GM−), which contains two CSD binding sites, we observed the previously reported NF-GMb and NF-GMc nuclear complexes (Fig.2 A, lane 2). Specific competitions, cross-linking, and antibody analysis have previously demonstrated that these HUT78 T cell complexes contain CSD proteins (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

In HEL fibroblast and HUT78 T cells, the nuclear NF-GMb complex migrates in multiple apparent conformational forms NF-GMb (1Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M.

Bioessays. 1993; 16: 245-251Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and we have shown the different conformational forms have identical sequence specificity and protein content (21Coles L.S.

When Jurkat T cell nuclear extract was used in a gel shift assay we saw complexes that comigrated with the HUT78 T cell NF-GMb complexes but could not detect a NF-GMc-like complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Using HUT78 T cell nuclear extract in a gel shift with the coding (+) strand of domain 2 (GM93+), which also contains two CSD binding sites, we observed three bands making up the NF-GMb complex and a single NF-GMc band (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) (21Coles L.S. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

To verify that the Jurkat T cell NF-GMb complexes seen on domains 1 and 2 were authentic CSD-containing NF-GMb complexes, competition assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the unlabeled, wild-type, noncoding (−) oligonucleotide GM− (contains two CSD sites), when used as a competitor, inhibited formation of the Jurkat T cell NF-GMb complex on both domain 1 (GM−) (Fig. 2 B,lane 7) and domain 2 (GM93+) probes (Fig.3 A, lane 7). Competing with GMm23, domain 1 noncoding strand oligonucleotide, which has both CSD sites mutated, had no effect on NF-GMb complex formation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 8). As a positive control, we used an oligonucleotide from the coding (+) strand of the human papillomavirus 18 enhancer (HPV+), which has been shown to bind recombinant and nuclear CSD proteins (22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49Spitkovsky D.D. Royer-Pokora B. Delius H. Kisseljov F. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Royer H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HPV+ was able to compete the Jurkat T cell NF-GMb complex binding almost as well as the wild-type GM− oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4and 9). The NF-GMb complex was not competed by an oligonucleotide (non-specific) that we and others have shown is unable to bind nuclear or recombinant CSD proteins (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5 and 10) (5Kolluri R. Torrey T.A. Kinniburgh A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F.

Using recombinant KATP channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we observed that MgATP (100 μm) block of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents gradually declined with time, whereas inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR1 or Kir6.2ΔC36 currents did not change. The decline in Kir6.2/SUR2A ATP sensitivity was not observed in Mg2+ free solution and was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors LY 294002 (10 μm) and wortmannin (100 μm), and by neomycin (100 μm). These results suggest that a MgATP-dependent synthesis of membrane phospholipids produces a secondary decrease in the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A. Direct application of the phospholipids PI 4,5-bisphosphate and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the presence of 100 μm MgATP activated all three types of channel, but the response was faster for Kir6.2/SUR2A. Chimeric studies indicate that the different responses of Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR1 are mediated by the first six transmembrane domains of SUR. The MgATP-dependent loss of ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A was enhanced by the actin filament disrupter cytochalasin and blocked by phalloidin (which stabilizes the cytoskeleton). Phalloidin did not block the effect of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate. This suggests that MgATP may cause disruption of the cytoskeleton, leading to enhanced membrane phospholipid levels (or better targeting to the KATPchannel) and thus to decreased channel ATP sensitivity.

Ashcroft S.J.H. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). They play important functional roles in all these tissues by linking cellular metabolism to electrical activity. Opening of the KATP channel produces a voltage-independent K+ current that hyperpolarizes the cell and reduces its electrical excitability; conversely, KATPchannel closure usually decreases membrane excitability. The KATP channel is an octamer, formed by the physical association of four inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits (Kir6.2) and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits (2Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). KATP channels in different tissues are composed of different Kir and SUR subunits. In most tissues, Kir6.2 acts as the pore-forming subunit (3Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. IV. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J.

There is evidence that SUR1 serves as the regulatory subunit of the KATP channel in pancreatic B-cells and some types of neurone (5Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. IV.

Binding sites for drugs and modulatory agents are found on both Kir6.2 and SUR subunits. The nucleotides ATP and ADP bind to an intracellular site on Kir6.2 and bring about KATP channel closure (11Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M.

The balance between these inhibitory and stimulatory effects results in channel inhibition by most concentrations of MgATP and high concentrations of MgADP (10 mm) and in channel activation by low micromolar concentrations of MgADP. It is thought that metabolic regulation of KATP channel activity is mediated, in part, by changes in the intracellular concentrations of these nucleotides. Recent studies indicate that membrane phospholipids also play an important role in modulating KATP channel activity. Thus, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) increases the activity and reduces the ATP sensitivity of both native and cloned KATP channels (17Hilgeman D.W. Ball R.

( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Findlay I. Dunne M.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Physiol. 1987; 408: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and PIP2 has also been implicated in this effect (25Xie L.H. Takano M. Kakei M. Okamura M. Noma A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is postulated that PIP2 is produced in plasma membrane by serial phosphorylation of PI and that this process is sequentially catalyzed by PI 4-kinase and PI 5-kinase. MgATP generation of phospholipids, therefore, has multiple but related effects on KATP channel activity. It decreases the rate of channel rundown, it causes reactivation of the channel after removal of ATP, and it reduces the channel ATP sensitivity. In this paper, we demonstrate that the time course of KATPchannel inhibition by ATP is markedly different for Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A. Whereas inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by 100 μm ATP does not change with time, that of Kir6.2/SUR2A decreases during prolonged nucleotide application. This ATP-dependent activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents by MgATP can be prevented by 10 μm LY 294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it results from MgATP-dependent production of PIP3 or PI(3,4)P2 rather than PI(4,5)P2(PIP2). Both PIP3 and PIP2, however, are able to promote channel activity in excised patches. Studies with chimeric SUR further suggest that the different responses of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A channels are conferred by the first set of transmembrane domains of the sulfonylurea receptor.

A truncated form of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2ΔC), which lacks the C-terminal 36 amino acids and forms functional channels in the absence of SUR, was prepared as described previously (11Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Chimeras between SUR1 and SUR2A were constructed as described previously (29Ashfield R.

Capped mRNA was prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE large scale in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), as previously described (30Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized with MS222 (2 g/liter added to the water). One ovary was removed via a mini-laparotomy, the incision was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. Immature stage V and VI oocytes were incubated for 60 min with 1.0 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, type V) and manually defolliculated. Oocytes were either injected with ∼1 ng of Kir6.2ΔC mRNA or coinjected with ∼0.1 ng of Kir6.2 mRNA and ∼2 ng of mRNA encoding either SUR1 or SUR2A. The final injection volume was 50 nl/oocyte. Isolated oocytes were maintained in Barth's solution and studied 1–4 days after injection (30Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 250–500 kΩ when filled with pipette solution. Macroscopic currents were recorded from giant excised inside-out patches at a holding potential of 0 mV and at 20–24 °C using an EPC7 patch-clamp amplifier (List Electronik, Darmstadt, Germany; Ref. 30Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The pipette (external) solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The intracellular (bath) solution contained 107 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH; final [K+], ∼140 mm). The magnesium-free intracellular solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). LY 294002 (CalBiochem), phalloidin, and cytochalasin (CalBiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO to make 10 mm stock solutions. Stock solutions (1 mm) of PIP2 and PIP3 were made in magnesium-free intracellular solution and diluted to the desired concentration and sonicated (30 min on ice) immediately before use. Rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by positioning the patch in the mouth of one of a series of adjacent inflow pipes placed in the bath. Test solutions were applied in random order unless otherwise stated. In most experiments, currents were recorded in response to repetitive 3-s voltage ramps from −110 mV to +100 mV. They were filtered at 10 kHz, digitized at 0.4 kHz using a Digidata 1200 Interface, and analyzed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Records were stored on videotape and resampled at 20 Hz for presentation in the figures. The slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line to the current-voltage relation between −20 and −100 mV; the average response to five consecutive ramps was calculated in each solution. In other experiments, macroscopic currents were recorded at a fixed holding potential of −50 mV in response to nucleotide or drug applications. Currents were sampled at 20 Hz and analyzed using Microcal Origin software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Macroscopic currents were recorded in inside-out patches fromXenopus oocytes expressing either Kir6.2/SUR1 or Kir6.2/SUR2A. Current amplitudes were similar for both types of KATP channel. Fig.1 A shows that application of 100 μm ATP to the intracellular membrane surface initially inhibited both Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A currents by ∼90%. Inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR1 currents did not change, or even slightly increased, over the course of a 10-min exposure to ATP. In contrast, there was a gradual decline in the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents with time; despite the continued presence of nucleotide, a slow increase in current was observed that began about 2 min after the onset of ATP application and stabilized 8–10 min later at around 75% block. This decrease in ATP sensitivity was not reversed by a 1-min exposure to nucleotide-free solution (Fig. 1 A). Mean data are shown in Fig. 1 B. The extent of initial block of both types of KATP current by 100 μm ATP is in agreement with that previously published for Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A channels. When expressed in oocytes and measured immediately after patch excision, half-maximal inhibition (K i) of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A channels is produced by 28 and 29 μm ATP, respectively (31Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Seino S. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The K i value for Kir6.2/SUR1 is in good agreement with that found when the channel is expressed in mammalian cells (8–47 μm; Refs. 21Shyng S.L. Barbieri A. Gumusboga A. Cukras C. Pike L. Davis J.N.

( Lond. ). 1989; 416: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Reported values for half-maximal inhibition of cloned Kir6.2/SUR2A channels and for native cardiac KATP channels vary widely, from 17 to 100 μm (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 31Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Seino S. Ashcroft F.M.

Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It seems possible that this may reflect, at least in part, the time at which the measurements were made during exposure to ATP. It may also reflect differences in the concentration of endogenous membrane phospholipids. To confirm that the difference in nucleotide response between Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A currents was conferred by the SUR subunit, we also measured the effect of continued exposure to ATP on a truncated form of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2ΔC), expressed in absence of SUR. Fig.1 B shows that Kir6.2ΔC currents resemble Kir6.2/SUR1 currents and show a slow decline with time in the presence of ATP, despite the lower ATP sensitivity. These data argue that the time-dependent activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents is conferred by the SUR2A subunit. It is possible that the time-dependent stimulatory effect of MgATP is mediated via the NBDs of SUR2A, either directly or via hydrolysis of MgATP to MgADP. It is known that MgADP is able to stimulate both Kir6.2/SUR1 (13Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P. IV. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Mutation of the lysine residue in the Walker A motif of NBD2 (but not NBD1) of SUR2A abolishes this stimulatory effect (35Gribble F.M. Reimann F. Ashfield R. Ashcroft F.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1256-1261PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of MgATP on channels containing this mutation (Kir6.2/SUR2A-K2A). Fig. 2 shows that initial ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A-K2A currents is slightly greater than that found for the wild type channel; the mean block by 100 μm ATP was 97.7 ± 0.6% (n = 6) compared with 87.6 ± 4.3% (n = 7) for Kir6.2/SUR2A-K2A and Kir6.2/SUR2A, respectively. This is not unexpected because a similar increase in ATP sensitivity is found when the equivalent residue is mutated in SUR1 (14Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). As in the case of SUR1, therefore, it may result from loss of MgATP activation mediated via the NBDs of SUR. Despite the enhanced ATP sensitivity, however, Kir6.2/SUR2A-K2A currents showed a time-dependent activation in the presence of MgATP that resembled that found for wild type channels; it began 1–2 min after exposure to ATP, and the current amplitude increased 3-fold within 5 min. This decrease in ATP sensitivity did not occur in the presence of 100 μm LY 294002, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (see below); rather the currents declined with time (as was also observed for Kir6.2/SUR2A; Fig. 3 B). These results therefore suggest that the MgATP-dependent decline in ATP sensitivity is not mediated via nucleotide interaction with the NBDs of SUR.Figure 3Effects of LY 294002 on Kir6.2/SUR2A currents. A, macroscopic Kir6.2/SUR2A currents recorded in response to a series of voltage ramps from −110 to +100 mV.

All solutions contained Mg2+.B, mean conductance recorded for Kir6.2/SUR2A currents at different times after the addition of 100 μm MgATP to the intracellular solution in the presence of 10 μm (▪,n = 3) or 100 μm (▴, n= 3) LY 294002. The dashed line indicates the data obtained in control solution (as shown in Fig. 1 B). The slope conductance (G) is expressed as a fraction of the mean (Gc) of that obtained in control solution before exposure to ATP. C, schematic illustrating the metabolism of phospholipids. The pathways inhibited by 10 and 100 μm LY 294002 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another mechanism by which the ATP sensitivity of the KATP channel might be reduced is by the ATP-dependent generation of PIP2 in the patch membrane caused by the action of endogenous lipid kinases (21Shyng S.L. Barbieri A. Gumusboga A. Cukras C. Pike L. Davis J.N. Stahl P.D. Nichols C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of the lipid kinase inhibitor LY 294002 on the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents (Fig. 3). LY 294002 is a potent and relatively specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase with an IC50 of 1.5–4 μm (27Ohno-Shosaku T. Zunkler B.J. Trube G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 408: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9110-9113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, at a concentration of 10 μm, PI 3-kinase is totally inhibited, but there is little effect on PI 4-kinase, whereas at a concentration of 100 μm, PI 4-kinase is also completely blocked (36Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9110-9113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, 10 μm LY 294002 blocked the time-dependent decline in ATP sensitivity observed for Kir6.2/SUR2A currents and prevented the reduction in ATP sensitivity produced by preincubation with ATP (compare Figs. 1 and 3). It also slightly enhanced the ATP sensitivity of the channel. This suggests that production of PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, or PIP3is required for the response. 100 μm LY 294002 also blocked the ATP-dependent activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents and further increased the extent of inhibition by 100 μm ATP. Wortmannin (100 μm,n = 3), which also blocks PI 3-kinase (37Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindey G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar), and neomycin (100 μm, n = 3), which chelates phospholipids, produced an immediate decline in Kir6.2/SUR2A channel activity and prevented the MgATP-dependent loss of ATP sensitivity (data not shown). As expected if a lipid kinase is involved, ATP was not effective at stimulating Kir6.2/SUR2A currents in the absence of Mg2+ (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that MgATP is used as a substrate by PI 3-kinase in the oocyte membrane to generate PIP3 or other membrane lipids and that the gradual accumulation of PIP3 causes a slow decline in the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents. Because PI 4-kinase is not blocked by 10 μm LY 294002, this activation cannot be mediated by PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3 C). Earlier studies have shown that KATP channel is very sensitive to the level of PI 5-kinase activity (21Shyng S.L. Barbieri A. Gumusboga A. Cukras C. Pike L. Davis J.N. Stahl P.D. Nichols C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which favors the possibility that the effects of MgATP are mediated via production of PIP3 rather than PI(3)P or PI(3,4)P2. Although we cannot formally exclude a role for the latter two phospholipids, for simplicity, we will simply refer to PIP3 (rather than PIP3, PI(3)P, or PI(3,4)P2) in the rest of this paper. The time lag observed before ATP induces activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents may therefore reflect the time taken for sufficient PIP3 to accumulate within the membrane to cause a measurable reduction in ATP sensitivity. Accumulation of PIP3 within the membrane may also explain why the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents is not immediately restored on return to control solution. Clearly, if the lipid is not rapidly removed from the membrane, then subsequent ATP application will produce a smaller inhibitory response. Although exogenously applied PIP3 is known to modulate β-cell KATPchannel activity (20Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 38Harvey J. Hardy S.C. Irving I. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it need not necessarily interact directly with the channel. It might also exert its effect indirectly, by modulating a protein that regulates the KATP channel. It is well established that PIP2 and other membrane lipids influence the cell cytoskeleton by inhibiting the activity of actin-binding proteins that sever and cap actin filaments (39Jammey P.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 61-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, PIP3 associates with the Rho family of GTPases (40Missy K., Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which are key regulators of actin filament structure (41Settleman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E7-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Agents that modulate the cytoskeleton also influence the activity of native KATP channels in cardiac membranes in both the presence and absence of ATP (42Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 43Terzic A. Jahangir A. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C525-C545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of phalloidin, which stabilizes the cytoskeleton, and of cytochalasin, which disrupts the cytoskeleton, on the ATP-dependent activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents. Cytochalasin (10 μm) increased the time-dependent current activation produced by 100 μm ATP, whereas phalloidin (20 μm) diminished the extent of activation (Fig.4 A). These results argue that the ATP-dependent activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents involves the cell cytoskeleton and that disruption of the cytoskeleton enhances the ATP-dependent decline in the channel ATP sensitivity. The effect of cytochalasin might be mediated subsequent to PIP3 production, or it might affect generation of the phospholipid. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined whether LY 294002 was able to inhibit the response to cytochalasin; if cytochalasin influences PIP3 production, then LY 294002 should block the response whereas, conversely, if cytochalasin has an effect downstream of the phospholipid it should still be effective in the presence of LY 294002. As shown in Fig. 4 (A andB), both 10 and 100 μm LY 294002 completely abolished the response to cytochalasin. The simplest explanation of this result is that changes in the cell cytoskeleton do not modify the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents directly. Rather, disruption of the cytoskeleton enhances MgATP-dependent production of PIP3 (or its metabolites) or facilitates PIP3targeting to the KATP channel and thereby enhances the loss of ATP sensitivity. In contrast to Kir6.2/SUR2A channels, KATP channels containing the SUR1 subunit were not activated by cytochalasin in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4 C). Thus, like the ATP-dependent activation itself, this response is specific to SUR2A. It is striking that whereas Kir6.2/SUR2A currents show an ATP-dependent activation that appears to be mediated by PIP3 production, this is not the case for Kir6.2/SUR1 currents. In some patches, however, we observed a slow, time-dependent activation of Kir6.2/SUR1 currents when exposed to 1 mm ATP (data not shown). This suggests that Kir6.2/SUR1 channels may simply be less sensitive to PIP3 than Kir6.2/SUR2A channels. We therefore tested the effect of direct application of PIP2 or PIP3 on Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A currents in the presence of 100 μm ATP. Fig.5 (A and B) shows that (in the absence of Mg2+) PIP3 produces a time-dependent decline in the ATP sensitivity of both types of channel but that this effect was more rapid and pronounced in the case of Kir6.2/SUR2A than Kir6.2/SUR1. The magnitude and time course of the PIP3 activation of Kir6.2ΔC36 was similar to that observed for Kir6.2/SUR1 (Fig. 5 B), providing additional support for the idea that the differential action of the phospholipid on Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A is mediated by the SUR2A subunit. Similar results were found with PIP2 (n = 2–3 in each case, date not shown). Because the effects of PIP3 were tested in the absence of Mg2+, we can be certain that current activation is the result of the phospholipid rather than ATP itself. It has previously been reported that the ATP sensitivity of both types of channel is reduced by PIP2 in excised patches (18Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but the difference in sensitivity has not been remarked. Fig. 5 C shows that neither LY 294002 nor phalloidin is able to block the effect of PIP3 on Kir6.2/SUR2A currents. Similar results were found with PIP2 (data not shown). The lack of effect of phalloidin is consistent with the idea that stabilization of the cell cytoskeleton is involved in the MgATP-dependent generation of phospholipids rather than directly affecting the KATP channel. The data also indicate that PIP2 does not have to be metabolized to PIP3 to mediate its effect, because its effect was not blocked by LY 294002. To determine the molecular basis of the differential sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A currents to phospholipids, we made chimeras between SUR1 and SUR2A and investigated the ability of 100 μm MgATP to produce a time-dependent activation of KATP channels containing chimeric SUR. These results are summarized in Fig.6. SUR1 containing both NBDs, or just the last 42 amino acids of SUR2A, behaved like SUR1. Likewise, SUR2A containing the last 42 amino acids, or NBD2, of SUR1 behaved like the parent channel. When the first six TMs of SUR1 were transferred into SUR2A, however, the ability of MgATP to stimulate KATPchannel activity was abolished (Fig. 6 A). Thus, it appears that this region of SUR is critical for the different response of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A channels to MgATP. Our results suggest that the gradual loss of ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents is due to a MgATP-dependent synthesis of membrane phospholipids, which causes a secondary decrease in the channel ATP sensitivity. This hypothesis is supported by the facts that LY 294002, wortmannin, neomycin, and Mg2+-free solutions prevent this effect and that the effect of MgATP is mimicked by the phospholipids PIP2 and PIP3. In the cell membrane, PI 4-kinase phosphorylates PI to give PI(4)P, which is subsequently phosphorylated by PI 5-kinase to PIP2 (PI(4,5)P2). All three phospholipids are also phosphorylated by PI 3-kinase to produce PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PIP3 respectively (Fig.3 C). Biochemical studies have shown that 10 μmLY 294002 specifically inhibits PI 3-kinase and is without effect on PI 4-kinase but that at a concentration of 100 μm, LY 294002 also totally blocks PI 4-kinase (36Rosado J.A.

Because 10 μm LY 294002 abolished the magnesium-dependent loss of ATP sensitivity, we conclude that either PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, and/or PIP3 is involved the response. At this concentration, LY 294002 does not prevent PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P2 formation, suggesting that neither of these lipids is responsible for the magnesium-dependent decrease in ATP sensitivity. When applied directly to the membrane patch, both PIP2 and PIP3 were able to reduce the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR2A, although no MgATP-dependent activation of the channel was observed in the presence of 10 μm LY 294002. This suggests that PIP3 is a more potent regulator of the channel and that, in the presence of LY 294002, PIP2generated by addition of MgATP does not accumulate to a concentration sufficient to reduce the channel ATP sensitivity. This may be due to the action of endogenous phospholipase C or lipid phosphatases. It is also worth pointing out that because many proteins bind PIPs, they may influence KATP channel activity simply by sequestering the amount of PIPs available for interaction with the channel. Our results suggest that the effect of PIP3 on the ATP sensitivity of the KATP channel is not mediated via the cell cytoskeleton, because it was not blocked by phalloidin. We did observe, however, that agents that perturb the cytoskeleton have a marked effect on the MgATP-dependent decline in ATP sensitivity. Notably, disruption of actin microfilaments by cytochalasin enhanced the response, whereas stabilization of microfilaments by phalloidin decreased the response. It is possible that the effect of cytochalasin may be mediated upstream of PI 3-kinase because it can be blocked by 10 μm LY 294002. This might suggest that disruption of the cytoskeleton enhances PIP3 levels (or targeting to the KATP channel), whereas, conversely, stabilization of the cytoskeleton by phalloidin reduces PIP3 levels. Furthermore, the ability of phalloidin to inhibit the ATP-dependent loss of ATP sensitivity suggests that MgATP may mediate its effect by inducing cytoskeletal disruption. This idea is supported by the fact that phalloidin did not prevent the loss of ATP sensitivity produced by direct application of PIP3 to the intracellular membrane surface. In contrast, the stimulatory action of PIP3 on native β-cell KATP channels is prevented by phalloidin (24Harvey J. McKay N.G. Walker K.S. Kay J.V.D. Downes C.P. Ashford M.L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4660-4669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 45Harvey J. Ashford M.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 511: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Presumably, this difference reflects the different cell types, which may metabolize PIP3differently. Interestingly, cytochalasin reduced the activity of native cardiac KATP channels in the absence of ATP (42Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) but enhanced it when ATP was present (43Terzic A. Jahangir A. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C525-C545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems plausible that the latter effect is due to an increase in MgATP-mediated PIP3 generation, as in the case for the cloned channel Kir6.2/SUR2A. A different mechanism may underlie the action of cytochalasin in the absence of ATP, which promotes KATP channel rundown (42Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast to Kir6.2/SUR2A currents, Kir6.2/SUR1 currents were not activated by 100 μm MgATP. Moreover, when PIP3 was added directly to the patch in the presence of 100 μm MgATP, the phospholipid produced a much faster and more marked activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A than of Kir6.2/SUR1. Our results indicate that these different responses are mediated by the first set of transmembrane domains of SUR (TMs 1–6). It is noteworthy that this region of SUR confers the different gating kinetics of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A channels (46Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 47Proks P. Ashfield R. Ashcroft F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25393-25397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This region of SUR may therefore be involved in transducing conformational changes in SUR into gating of the channel pore. Both Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2ΔC channels have shorter bursts of openings and a lower open probability than Kir6.2/SUR2A channels. Loussouarn and colleagues (48Loussouarn G. Makhina E.N. Rose T. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that there is an exponential correlation between the burst duration (or open probability) of the KATP channel and its K i for ATP inhibition, and it has been suggested that PIP2 mediates its effect on KATP channel ATP sensitivity, at least in part, via changes in the channel open probability (49Enkvetchakul D. Loussouarn G. Makhina E. Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2334-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Whether or not a given increase in open probability (P o) results in a change in ATP sensitivity will therefore depend on the initial P o. Because this is lower for Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2ΔC currents, the likelihood of observing a change in ATP sensitivity will be less. It is therefore possible that the different responses of Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR1 are due to their different single-channel kinetics; the higher P o of Kir6.2/SUR2A channels means that a further increase in P o produced by PIP2 is more likely to reduce the channel ATP sensitivity than in the case of Kir6.2/SUR1 channels. An alternative interpretation of our results, however, is that PIP3 is able to interact directly with the SUR2A subunit of the KATP channel to decrease the channel ATP sensitivity (in addition to its effect on Kir6.2) and that the functional effect of this interaction involves the first six TMs of SUR.

This single copy gene is regulated by multiple alternative promoters that are coupled with alternative splicing mechanisms to generate several GGT cDNAs each with a unique 5′-noncoding region. But all encode the same protein, because coding exons appear to be spliced only in a constitutive fashion (1Shi Z.-Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Gene. 1995; 167: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The protein product is synthesized as a single-chain N-glycosylated propeptide, processed into an N-terminal amphipathic subunit and a smaller C-terminal subunit, and expressed on the cell surface where it functions as a key enzyme in glutathione metabolism (2Curthoys N.P. Vina J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 217-225Google Scholar). Several human GGT cDNAs also exhibit unique 5′-ends and encode a protein that is processed in a similar fashion and shares 79% amino acid identity with that of the mouse (3Sakamuro D. Yamazoe M. Matsuda Y. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. Matsuo H. Yoshikawa H. Ogasawara N. Gene. 1988; 73: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, an alternatively processed human GGT cDNA has been described that contains an insertion of 22 bases within the coding domain. The extra nucleotide bases introduce a frameshift and a premature stop codon so that the predicted polypeptide would be a truncated GGT isoform. The protein product has never been characterized, but the elimination of the small subunit suggests that it would lack γ-glutamyltransferase activity. The identification of this alternative transcript implies that humanGGT gene expression may be more complex than that of other species (4Pawlak A. Cohen E.H. Octave J. Schweickhardt R. Wu S. Bulle F.

However, while characterizing the site of a point mutation in the GGTenu1 mouse (5Jean J.C. Harding C.O. Oakes S.M., Yu, Q. Held P.K. Joyce-Brady M. Mutagenesis. 1999; 14: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we identified four previously unknown alternative splicing events involving coding exons in the normal mouse GGT gene (see Fig. 1). We studied these events to determine whether GGT protein isoforms are being generated through alternative processing of mouse GGT mRNA, to identify if these events are shared between mouse and human GGT, and finally to explore a potential role for these new mouse GGT protein isoforms in glutathione metabolism. Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to isolate total RNA from tissue or cells. Mouse genomic DNA was isolated from the lung. Human genomic DNA was provided by Dr. Qiang Yu from the Pulmonary Center of Boston University. Electrophoresis grade agarose was from International Biotechnologies, Inc. (New Haven, CT), and DNA standards were from Life Technologies, Inc. Materials for protein electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA), and protein standards were High-Range molecular weight markers from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). X-OMAT and BioMax MR films were used for radiography and obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). [α-32P]CTP, specific activity 800 Ci/mmol, was obtained from ICN (Irvine, CA) and [35S]Met/Cys, specific activity ∼1000 Ci/mmol, was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Wilmington, DE) as Easy Tag Express-[35S]Protein Labeling Mixture. Primers were synthesized at the DNA/Protein Core Molecular Biology Unit of Boston University School of Medicine. The cDNA probes for CHOP and BiP were generated by PCR after selecting primers based on the published sequences in the GenBank™. The probe for β-actin has been used routinely in this laboratory. The cell lines hCAR (human coxsackie and adenovirus cell surface receptor) and hMUC (human mucin 1) were available in the laboratory of Dr. Rebecca Hughey (12Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Total RNA from various tissues was used for RT-PCR as described previously (5Jean J.C. Harding C.O. Oakes S.M., Yu, Q. Held P.K. Joyce-Brady M. Mutagenesis. 1999; 14: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PCR primers were selected for primary and secondary PCR reactions, and each PCR reaction was performed for 20 cycles on a MJ Research thermal cycler. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, then eluted, cloned into an Invitrogen TA vector (San Diego, CA), and sequenced for verification at the DNA-Protein Core facility at Boston University School of Medicine. RT-PCR primers used for constitutive GGT cDNA amplification were M72, 5′-CCTTTCGGTTTGCCTATGCCAAGAGGAC (upstream); 11M, 5′-GCGCTCCCTCTGTCCCACCCA (nested downstream); and 12M, 5′-GGCTTCCCGCAGCTTGGCGGTGG (primary downstream). For intron 7 and intron 9 insertions, upstream hemi-nested primers were 22U, 5′-GCCAGCTCTGGGGTCTCGGCAG and 24D, 5′-CCTGTCTCCTCCTATGGATCATAG, respectively. The primary primers used for genomic PCR and cloning of intron 7 were M71, 5′-AGGCACTGACGTATCACCGTATCGTG and 10.1M, 5′-CCTCCATCATCCTGAAGGTAGA. Primers M72 plus 10.1M were used in secondary PCR. Intron 9 was cloned using M811, 5′-ACCGCTCACCTGTCTGCGGTTTC as the upstream primer for both PCR reactions together with downstream primers 12M and 11M for primary and secondary PCR, respectively. The relative mRNA abundance of GGTΔ7versus constitutive GGT was determining by using primers 71M plus 11M for the primary reaction, then 72M plus 810M, 5′-GAAACCGCAGACAGGTGAGCGGTGCCTCC, for the secondary reaction. TnT T7 Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System, a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, was purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse GGT constructs were generated by PCR using upstream primers with (CGGACCGGGCCCTACTGGAAGCAGACCATGAAGA) and without (CGGACCGGGCCCTACTGGAAGACCATGAAGAATC) the CAG insertion 5 bases upstream of the ATG initiation codon along with a common 3′ primer (CCGGAATTCCCGCTGAGTGGGGCACTGGGCACG). Template cDNA was reverse-transcribed from normal mouse kidney mRNA. The 5′ primers contained an EcoRI and the 3′ primer an ApaI site that were used to clone the PCR products into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Plasmids were sequenced to ensure accuracy, and the T7 promoter was used for in vitro transcription. The translated products were labeled with [35S]methionine, separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. The primary translation product was predicted to have a molecular mass of 35.2 kDa with the terminal 47 amino acid residues encoded from the vector. A secondary translation product of 27 kDa was predicted from utilization of an internal translation initiation site. Total RNA was analyzed as previously described (5Jean J.C. Harding C.O. Oakes S.M., Yu, Q. Held P.K. Joyce-Brady M. Mutagenesis. 1999; 14: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RNA obtained from cell lines was quantitated by spectrophotometry and electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel with 2.2m formaldehyde in 1× MOPS, transferred to a HyBond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL) overnight, both at RT, then cross-linked with a Stratagene UV cross-linker. The membrane was prehybridized with QuickHyb (Stratagene) at 68 °C for 15 min. Radiolabeled probe was then added and incubated for 2 h. The filter was washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, washed twice more with 1× SSC in 0.1% SDS at 60 °C, and dried. An exposure of the filter was made on Kodak X-OMAT film, and the film was developed. A full-length mouse GGT cDNA (type 3) was kindly provided by Drs. Z.-Z. Shi and M. W. Lieberman (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). This was cloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To express the alternatively spliced GGT cDNAs, this wild type GGT cDNA sequence was replaced with that of GGTΔ1, Δ2–5, Δ7 and Δ8–9. All plasmids were sequenced to ensure accuracy. Plasmids encoding the mGGT isoforms for cell transfections were prepared with the JETstar 2.0 plasmid purification kit (Genomed, PGC Scientifics, Frederick, MD). Stable clonal cell lines were obtained by transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) using LipofectAMINE (1:3 ratio of DNA:lipid; Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) followed by selection in media containing G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Transient expression of the mGGT isoforms was obtained in CHO cells using a cowpox/bacteriophage T7 (vT7CP) expression system as described previously (6Ramsey-Ewing A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16962-16966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Weisz O.A. Machamer C.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 137-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of CHO cells were grown in 35-mm plastic dishes with a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 3% FBS (normal culture media). Cells were washed with 1 ml of serum-free medium and infected with vT7CP (multiplicity of infection ∼30) in 0.3 ml of the same media for 30 min. The media containing vT7CP was removed from the cells before transfection with a mixture of plasmid DNA (pCDNA3.1 with a T7 promoter) and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) at a 1:3 ratio in 1 ml of the same serum-free media for 3 h. The lipid and DNA mixture was them removed, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of DMEM media lacking methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and returned to culture for 15 min in the same media prior to metabolic labeling. Either stably transfected clonal cell lines expressing the mGGT isoforms or CHO cells transiently expressing the mGGT isoforms (described above) were starved for Met and Cys for 15 min in 1 ml of DMEM media lacking Met and Cys before addition of 50–100 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys for the times indicated in each experiment. Cells were chased in normal culture medium as indicated. Surface levels of the mGGT isoforms were determined by moving the dishes of cells to ice for biotinylation (8Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1992; 14: 173-180Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as previously described (12Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed four times with 1 ml of PBS++ (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 15.2 mmNa2HPO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2and 0.7 mm CaCl2) then incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in triethanolamine-buffered saline (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.6, 137 mmNaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2) for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by three washes of the cells with normal culture media. Cells were solubilized as described above, and the supernatants were rotated end over end overnight at 4 °C after addition of protein G immobilized on Sepharose 4B (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 1 μl of goat anti-rat GGT antisera. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by brief centrifugation and washed once with 0.5 ml each of 1% Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp., Indianapolis, IN) in HBS (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), 0.01% SDS in HBS and HBS alone. Biotinylated mGGT was recovered by eluting the immunoprecipitates for 2 min at 90 °C in 80 μl of 1% SDS in HBS and further incubation with 30 μl of ImmunoPure Immobilized Avidin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) after addition of 0.8 ml of HBS. After overnight rotation at 4 °C, the avidin-conjugated beads were washed with 1 ml each of 1% Triton X-100 in HBS, 0.01% SDS in HBS, and HBS alone. The biotinylated mGGT isoforms were eluted by heating for 3.5 min at 90 °C in 50 μl of Laemmli SDS-sample buffer containing fresh 0.14m β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 3–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels, and radioactive protein bands imaged and quantitated from the dried gel using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Radioactive immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 80 μl of 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0, and 0.5% SDS by heating beads at 90 °C for 2 min (9Capraro M.A. Hughey R.P. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The eluted sample was divided in half and incubated overnight at 37 °C with or without 1 milliunit (mU) of endoglycosidase H (endo H, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). COS cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes, transiently transfected with the cDNAs for the mGGT isoforms using LipofectAMINE, and analyzed by immunofluorescence 2 days later. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS++ for 5 min prior to fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS++ for 12 min. After washing with 10 mm glycine in PBS++(PBS-Gly), cells were permeabilized by incubation for 4 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS-Gly and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS-Gly for 5 min. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-rat GGT antisera (diluted 1/600) for 45 min and then CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1/2500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 30 min, both in 1% goat serum in PBS-Gly. Cells were incubated for 5 min with 0.5 μg/ml 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS-Gly to stain nuclei and then washed twice for 5 min with PBS-Gly before mounting on slides with 1 mn-propylgallate in glycerol and viewing with a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope. Calnexin was stained as a positive control for localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using an antibody directed against the cytosolic tail (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada). Specific GGT enzyme activity was measured at room temperature using the substrates γ-glutamyl-para-nitroanilide and glycylglycine as previously described (10Hughey R.P. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry. The majority of our PCR-derived GGT clones generated from lung and kidney RNA of wild type andGGTenu1 mice contained the trinucleotide insert CAG five bases upstream of the ATG initiation codon (details in Fig. 1). An examination of GGT cDNA sequences in the GenBank™ revealed an absence of this CAG insert in all mouse GGT cDNAs, as well as those from rat and pig, but revealed its presence in most, but not all, human GGT cDNAs. Certain human lung GGT cDNAs lacked this CAG insert (11Wetmore L.A. Gerard C. Drazen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7461-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because this CAG insertion is located at an intron/exon junction, we compared the intron sequences from the mouse, rat, and pig to determine whether alternative splicing could account for its presence (Fig.2A). All three introns contain the highly conserved dinucleotides GT and AG at the 5′- and 3′-boundaries, respectively, and the AG is preceded by a cytosine residue. However, the mouse intron contains two CAGs in tandem at its 3′-intron boundary, whereas the rat and the pig intron each contain a single CAG. We then cloned and partially sequenced a corresponding human GGT intron sequence. We confirmed that this intron is identical in size to that of rat, mouse, and pig, ∼0.5 kb, and contains two tandem CAG trinucleotides at the 3′-boundary like that of mouse. To see if the proximity of this CAG insert to the ATG initiation site could affect the site of translation initiation, we used a transient VT7CP expression system to characterize the protein encoded by the GGTΔ1. Cow pox-infected CHO cells transfected with the GGTΔ1 plasmid were starved for Met and Cys and pulse-labeled in the same media with [35S]Met/Cys, before a chase period of 0 or 2 h. SDS-PAGE analysis of GGT-specific immunoprecipitates from the cell extracts revealed a single peptide of 83 kDa at t= 0, which was sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H and produced a product of 59 kDa (Fig. 3), consistent with expression of the full-length propeptide of 61 kDa (Table I). Because endo H removes all but one GlcNAc residue of high mannose N-glycans (Mr ∼ 3000) from glycoproteins, this difference in Mr (2400) is consistent with N-linked glycosylation of the GGTΔ1 at all seven consensus sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). After 2 h of chase, only a trace of the 83-kDa propeptide was evident, whereas the two expected subunits of the cleaved GGT propeptide were present at 50 and 23 kDa. Endo H treatment of this sample produced trace bands at 33 and 20 kDa, consistent with the presence of six N-glycans and one N-glycan on the subunits, respectively. The more diffuse gel pattern of the large subunit indicated that there is considerable microheterogeneity in the processing of these N-glycans, whereas the small subunit was more homogeneous despite its resistance to endo H treatment, indicating that the single N-glycan is minimally processed.Table ICharacteristics of mouse GGT protein isoformsmGGT isoformPeptide FW1-aFormula weight was calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence.N-Glycan consensus site1-bThe consensus sequence forN-linked glycosylation is Asn-X-Ser/Thr.SDS gelMr (± end H)1-cApparent molecular weight of isoform on SDS gel as shown in Fig. 4.Mrdifference1-dDifference in molecular weight of the isoform before and after treatment with endo H.No. ofN-Glycans estimated1-eCalculated number ofN-linked glycans, assuming that removal of each glycan alters mobility by 3 kDa.Half-life1-fHalf-life was calculated from recover of [35S]GGT isoforms after chase times of 3 and 18 h (Δ1 and Δ7) or chase times of 0 and 3 h (Δ2–5 and Δ8–9) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A clonal CHO cell line expressing Δ8–9 was not available.

Open table in a new tab Similar data were obtained for the synthesis of GGTΔ1 in stable transfectants of CHO cells (Fig. 4). When these clonal CHO cells expressing GGTΔ1 were pulse labeled for 30 min and chased for 2 h prior to cell surface biotinylation with the membrane impermeant sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, ∼20% of the heterodimer was recovered from the immunoprecipitates with avidin-conjugated beads. This indicated that the GGTΔ1 protein did reach the plasma membrane (compare mock lanes in Fig. 4, A andB). This cell surface localization of the GGTΔ1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of COS cells 2 days after transfection with the GGTΔ1 cDNA (Fig.5A). A similar pattern of immunofluorescence was observed in stably transfected CHO cells expressing the GGTΔ1 (data not shown). In both cases nearly all the GGT-specific immunofluorescence was found at the cell surface. An equally important result is that the clonal CHO cells expressing GGTΔ1 exhibited a much higher γ-glutamyl transferase-specific enzymatic activity (280 mU/mg) than nontransfected CHO cells (<1 mU/mg). And after overnight accumulation of GGTΔ1 in transfected cow pox-infected CHO cells, this enzyme activity was greatly increased (200–1000 mU/mg). Because this latter result indicated that the GGTΔ1 protein must be relatively stable, the half-life was determined for the radiolabeled GGTΔ1 during stable and transient expression by pulse-labeling cells for 30 min and immunoprecipitating GGTΔ1 after chase times of 3 and 18 h (Table I). Calculation of the half-life from the percent loss of radiolabeled GGT between the two time points indicated the half-life for the GGTΔ1 is similar in stable (18.7 h) and transiently transfected (17.4 h) CHO cells. Thus GGTΔ1 encodes the normal mouse GGT protein. This protein exhibited normal synthesis, cell surface expression, stability, and enzymatic activity. Because the expression of GGTΔ1 in cultured cells was indistinguishable from that described previously for rat and human GGT, we next assessed whether the CAG insert in the mouse GGTΔ1 could affect translational efficiency using an in vitro transcription/translation assay. The synthesis of the primary translation product (35.2 kDa) from the transcript containing the CAG insert was reduced ∼2-fold when compared with synthesis from a transcript lacking the CAG sequence, whereas synthesis of an alternate protein from an internal ATG codon (27 kDa) was unchanged (Fig. 2B). Thus, the CAG appears to regulate translation of the GGT mRNA, not the protein product.Figure 5Immunofluorescence analysis. COS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GGTΔ1 (A), Δ2–5 (B), Δ7 (C), and Δ8–9 (D). The steady-state localization of the expressed proteins were analyzed with rabbit anti-rat GGT antiserum followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. COS cells (E) were stained for calnexin as a positive control for an ER protein, and primary antibody was omitted for a negative control (F). Surface staining is observed only for mGGTΔ1. Although Δ2–5, Δ7, and Δ8–9 predominantly show staining in the endoplasmic reticulum, a low level of juxtanuclear Golgi-like staining is also seen for all the proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This alternative splicing event produces an in-frame deletion of the last eight nucleotides of exon 2, all of exons 3 and 4, and most of exon 5 (Fig.6A). Nonconsensus 5′- and 3′-splice sites appear to have been utilized in exons 2 and 5, respectively. We could not identify a corresponding human GGT mRNA transcript but did find at least two alternative rat GGT cDNAs using mRNA from cultured rat alveolar type 2 cells that utilized the same 5′-splice site (data not shown). The encoded protein loses amino acid residues 96 through 231, including four N-glycan consensus sites from the amphipathic N-terminal subunit, while the C-terminal hydrophilic subunit remains intact (Fig.6B). When CHO cells transiently transfected with the GGTΔ2–5 were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 15 min, a single labeled protein of 47 kDa was immunoprecipitated after both 0- and 2-h chases (Fig. 3). At both time points the protein was sensitive to endo H treatment producing a protein of 38 kDa, consistent with the presence of three N-glycans, but which is notably smaller than the predicted sequence (46.7 kDa). Because the protein remains anchored to the membrane (data not shown), this indicates that the GGTΔ2–5 either is cleaved after the N-glycan consensus site in the small subunit or migrates anomalously on SDS gels. The persistence of the endo H sensitivity of the GGTΔ2–5 protein after the 2-h chase also suggests that the protein is retained in the ER or early Golgi rather than moving to the cell surface. When this was tested by transient expression of GGTΔ2–5 in CHO-GGTΔ1 cells, only 1.5% of the GGTΔ2–5 was biotinylated at the cell surface after a 2-h chase, whereas ∼20% of the GGTΔ1 was biotinylated in the same cells (Fig. 4). Localization in the ER was also evident by immunofluorescence microscopy of COS cells transiently expressing the GGTΔ2–5 (Fig. 5B). Determination of the half-life for the GGTΔ2–5 in both stable transfected (1.7 h) and transiently transfected (2.1 h) CHO cells indicates that this isoform of the mouse GGT is considerably less stable than the GGTΔ1 (Table I). Enzyme assays of these cell extracts reveal no increase in γ-glutamyl- transferase activity (<1 mU/mg) above the control levels observed in nontransfected CHO cells. This alternative splicing event introduces a 22-base insertion within the coding domain. This insertion mimics that in humans and induces a frameshift and a premature stop codon within the open reading frame (Fig.7A). The encoded mouse protein is a truncated GGT-like protein that retains only the first 339 amino acids of the native GGT protein and gains 14 novel residues at the C terminus, the first seven of which are identical to that in the human (Fig. 7B). Because the intron/exon structure of mouse GGT is known and the last 10 nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of the insert agree exactly with the intron 7 sequences in the literature (1Shi Z.-Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Gene. 1995; 167: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it appears that the 22-base insertion results from an alternative splice site at intron 7. To confirm this, we cloned and partially sequenced the ∼3 kb of mouse intron 7 (Fig. 7A). The remaining 10 nucleotides at the 5′-end of the insertion wer"

Many of these functions are mediated by binding and recruiting signaling proteins which contain specific phosphoinositide-binding domains such as SH2 domains, pleckstrin homology domains, FYVE domains, C2 domains or polybasic domains, thereby localizing these effector proteins to specific membranes (reviewed in Refs. 3Hinchliffe K.A.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 also plays a role in regulating vesicle budding and in the recruitment and activation of proteins involved in the coating of vesicles (2Toker A. Curr. Opin.

Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-phosphatases) regulate cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels by hydrolyzing the 5-position phosphate from the inositol ring forming phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) (10Majerus P.W.

Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p each comprise an N-terminal SacI domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region (12Srinivasan S. Seaman M. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Suchy S.F.

These enzymes share significant sequence homology with the mammalian homologue synaptojanin, which regulates the recycling of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals (14McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P.

Synaptojanin, Inp52p, and Inp53p contain two catalytic domains, a central 5-phosphatase domain and an N-terminal SacI domain which hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(3)P forming PtdIns (15Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Null mutation of any two SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatases results in plasma membrane invaginations and thickened cell walls, defects in polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, and impaired endocytosis (12Srinivasan S.

However, double SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatase null mutants display normal secretion of invertase suggesting that Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p do not play a role in regulating secretion (16Singer-Kruger B. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Ferro-Novick S. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3347-3356PubMed Google Scholar). A triple SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatase null mutant is nonviable suggesting Inp54p cannot function to rescue the loss of these three 5-phosphatases.Inp54p is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase (17Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), as are all the yeast 5-phosphatases. Therefore it is not surprising that single null mutation of INP54 is not lethal (18Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). However, further characterization of the phenotype of this mutant has not been reported. In this study we demonstrate Inp54p is a C-terminal tail-anchored protein that localizes to the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum. This localization is mediated by a short 13-amino acid leucine-rich region at the extreme C terminus of the protein. Null mutation of INP54, but not any of the SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatases, results in increased levels of secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose the enzyme regulates PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby regulates secretion.DISCUSSIONThe results of the studies described here demonstrate that the yeast PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase Inp54p is a C-terminal tail-anchored protein that localizes to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER where it may play a role in the regulation of secretion. Evidence for the ER localization of this novel 5-phosphatase is suggested by the presence of the C-terminal hydrophobic domain, which is consistent with a tail-anchor motif comprising a stretch of hydrophobic residues at the extreme C terminus. Many studies indicate C-terminal tail-anchored proteins localize to either the mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Ref. 36Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that recombinant Inp54p expressed as a fusion protein with either GFP or HA co-localizes with the ER-specific protein BiP, both when the protein is overexpressed, or expressed under the control of its native promoter. We have shown inp54 null mutant cells demonstrate increased secretion, consistent with a functional role for Inp54p in the ER.All four yeast 5-phosphatases hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2forming PtdIns(4)P. The necessity for four 5-phosphatases in yeast to regulate cellular concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 may in part be explained by the localization of each 5-phosphatase to specific membrane compartments. However, this has yet to be shown. Recently our laboratory has demonstrated that Inp52p and Inp53p are localized diffusely throughout the cell excluding the nucleus and translocate to cortical actin patches following hyperosmotic stress (21Ooms L.M. McColl B.K. Wiradjaja F. Wijayaratnam A.P.W. Gleeson P. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Mitchell C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9376-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of Inp51p has not been delineated, as the enzyme is extensively proteolyzed when expressed as a recombinant protein (21Ooms L.M. McColl B.K. Wiradjaja F.

The localization of Inp54p to the ER is the first evidence of the targeting of a yeast 5-phosphatase to a specific subcellular compartment in the resting cell. To date no mammalian 5-phosphatase has been localized to the ER, although the Lowe's protein has been identified in both the Golgi and the lysosomal compartment (56Olivos-Glander I.M. Janne P.A. Nussbaum R.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar, 57Zhang X. Hartz P.A. Philip E. Racusen L.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1574-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a novel 72-kDa 5-phosphatase has been localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi, where the enzyme is proposed to regulate phosphoinositide-mediated vesicular trafficking (58Kong A.M.

Deletion of the Inp54p hydrophobic tail resulted in a cytoplasmic distribution of the protein, consistent with previous observations that the C terminus of tail-anchored proteins contains the membrane targeting information (38Egan B.

The length of the hydrophobic tail is a critical factor in determining intracellular localization. While shorter hydrophobic domains of 10–12 amino acids have been demonstrated to target synaptobrevin and cytochrome b5 to the ER (59Mitoma J. Ito A.

Lengthening the hydrophobic tail of the ER protein Ufe1p from 16 to 24 amino acids, by the insertion of eight hydrophobic residues, resulted in the protein being mislocalized to the plasma membrane (50Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Increasing the length of the C-terminal membrane anchor of UBC6 from 17 to 21 amino acids caused mistargeting of the protein from the ER to the Golgi, whereas a further increase to 26 amino acids resulted in expression of the protein at the plasma membrane (34Yang M.

Based on these previous studies, the short 13-amino acid targeting sequence of Inp54p would be consistent with the ER localization of the protein.The exact mechanism by which C-terminal anchored proteins are targeted to specific membranes remains unclear. Several studies have shown that the targeting of various isoforms of synaptobrevin to the ER requires ATP, but is independent of the Sec61p/SRP pathway, relying instead on an as yet uncharacterized receptor system (37Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 40Lan L. Isenmann S. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mapping of the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence of Inp54p to a helical wheel reveals that the lysine, tyrosine, and serine are predicted to line one face of the helix, however, this would not be predicted to form an amphipathic face. Mutation of the positively charged lysine residue at position 382 had no effect on the localization of the protein, as has been shown for mutation of the arginine residue within the C terminus of cytochromeb5 (48Kuroda R.

Location of the tag did not affect the cytoplasmic orientation of Inp54p, or its intracellular localization. Previous studies have shown that C-terminal tags attached to cytochrome b 5 and synaptobrevin did not affect their insertion or orientation in the membrane (33Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The topology of tail-anchored proteins in the membrane is predicted to mimic classical transmembrane segments, whereby the tail spans the width of the membrane bilayer, with only a few residues on the other side of the membrane (32Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At only 13 amino acids in length, the hydrophobic region of Inp54p is too short to span the membrane as typically integral membrane proteins contain a hydrophobic span of 20 amino acids (64Rapoport T.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2792-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that although Inp54p membrane association is resistant to salt extraction, it is sensitive to alkaline treatment, indicating that it is not an integral membrane protein. Since a GFP tag fused to the extreme C terminus of Inp54p was degraded by proteinase K, it is most likely that the C terminus of Inp54p is also exposed to the cytoplasm. Thus, we propose the hydrophobic tail of Inp54p dips into the membrane to form a hairpin loop configuration whereby both the N and C termini are located in the cytosol (Fig. 8). As Inp54p membrane association is sensitive to high salt treatment, it is also possible that Inp54p could form a tight noncovalent interaction with an ER membrane protein. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B has been proposed to adopt such a membrane topology (47Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).The localization of Inp54p on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER would place the enzyme in an optimal position to regulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels on vesicles budding from the ER. In mammalian cells PtdIns(4,5)P2 binds ADP-ribosylation factor which results in the recruitment of coatomer proteins and activation of phospholipase D, followed by vesicle budding from the Golgi membrane (65Brown H.A.

In yeast, the PtdIns 4-kinase Pik1p is essential for normal Golgi morphology and Golgi-plasma membrane trafficking (52Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol.

Pik1p-dependent generation of PtdIns(4)P regulates the transport of vesicles destined for the cell surface and normal secretion (52Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Pik1p kinase activity is also required for normal endocytic transport of Ste6p from the plasma membrane to the vacuole (53Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells PtdIns 4-kinase plays a role in secretion of granules from chromaffin cells (69Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As pik1 null mutants demonstrate decreases in both PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, a role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 in regulating secretion cannot be excluded (53Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). While PtdIns(4,5)P2 has not been shown to play a definitive role in vesicular trafficking from the ER, our results would suggest the increased secretion observed ininp54 null mutants is mediated by the regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in this compartment. Phosphoinositides are ubiquitous membrane components of various intracellular compartments, which regulate many diverse cellular functions including membrane trafficking events, secretion, actin cytoskeletal organization, cellular proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1De, Camilli P.

Many of these functions are mediated by binding and recruiting signaling proteins which contain specific phosphoinositide-binding domains such as SH2 domains, pleckstrin homology domains, FYVE domains, C2 domains or polybasic domains, thereby localizing these effector proteins to specific membranes (reviewed in Refs. 3Hinchliffe K.A.

Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)1serves as a precursor to second messenger molecules such as inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, but also independent of further modification regulates the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking (1De, Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 5Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem.

Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and displaces capping proteins from actin filaments, allowing polymerization and formation of actin stress fibers (7Gilmore A.P.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 also plays a role in regulating vesicle budding and in the recruitment and activation of proteins involved in the coating of vesicles (2Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are regulated by a series of lipid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions mediated by specific lipid kinases and phosphatases. Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-phosphatases) regulate cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels by hydrolyzing the 5-position phosphate from the inositol ring forming phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) (10Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Mitchell C.A. Brown S. Campbell J.K. Munday A.D. Speed C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has four 5-phosphatase genes,INP51, INP52, INP53, and INP54. Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p each comprise an N-terminal SacI domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region (12Srinivasan S. Seaman M. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Suchy S.F.

These enzymes share significant sequence homology with the mammalian homologue synaptojanin, which regulates the recycling of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals (14McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P.

Synaptojanin, Inp52p, and Inp53p contain two catalytic domains, a central 5-phosphatase domain and an N-terminal SacI domain which hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(3)P forming PtdIns (15Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Null mutation of any two SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatases results in plasma membrane invaginations and thickened cell walls, defects in polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, and impaired endocytosis (12Srinivasan S. Seaman M. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Suchy S.F. Emr S. De Camilli P. Nussbaum R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 350-360PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, double SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatase null mutants display normal secretion of invertase suggesting that Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p do not play a role in regulating secretion (16Singer-Kruger B. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Ferro-Novick S. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3347-3356PubMed Google Scholar). A triple SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatase null mutant is nonviable suggesting Inp54p cannot function to rescue the loss of these three 5-phosphatases. Inp54p is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase (17Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), as are all the yeast 5-phosphatases. Therefore it is not surprising that single null mutation of INP54 is not lethal (18Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). However, further characterization of the phenotype of this mutant has not been reported. In this study we demonstrate Inp54p is a C-terminal tail-anchored protein that localizes to the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum. This localization is mediated by a short 13-amino acid leucine-rich region at the extreme C terminus of the protein. Null mutation of INP54, but not any of the SacI domain-containing 5-phosphatases, results in increased levels of secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose the enzyme regulates PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby regulates secretion.

Cellular protein degradation is under the control of multiple systems, including lysosomes, proteasomes, calpains, and giant protease. Insulin has been shown to alter proteasome activity in vitro andin vivo. We examined the inhibition of protein degradation by insulin and insulin analogues (LysB28,ProB29-insulin (LysPro), AspB10-insulin (B10), and GluB4,GlnB16,PheB17-insulin (EQF)) in H4, HepG2, and L6 cells. These effects were compared with receptor binding. Protein degradation was examined by release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity from cells previously labeled with [3H]leucine. Short- and intermediate-lived proteins were examined. H4 cells bound insulin with an EC50 of 4.6 × 10−9m. LysPro was similar. The affinity of B10 was increased 2-fold; that of EQF decreased 15-fold. Protein degradation inhibition in H4 cells was highly sensitive to insulin (EC50 = 4.2 × 10−11 and 1.6 × 10−10m, short- and intermediate-lived protein degradation, respectively) and analogues. Despite similar binding, LysPro was 11- to 18-fold more potent than insulin at inhibiting protein degradation. Conversely, although EQF showed lower binding to H4 cells than insulin, its action was similar. The relative binding potencies of analogues in HepG2 cells were similar to those in H4 cells. Examination of protein degradation showed insulin, LysPro, and B10 were equivalent while EQF was less potent. L6 cells showed no difference in the binding of the analogues compared with insulin, but their effect on protein degradation was similar to that seen in HepG2 cells except B10 inhibited intermediate-lived protein degradation better than insulin. These studies illustrate the complexities of cellular protein degradation and the effects of insulin. The effect of insulin and analogues on protein degradation vary significantly in different cell types and with different experimental conditions. The differences seen in the action of the analogues cannot be attributed to binding differences. Post-receptor mechanisms, including intracellular processing and degradation, must be considered.

The differences seen in the action of the analogues cannot be attributed to binding differences. Post-receptor mechanisms, including intracellular processing and degradation, must be considered. The major effect of insulin on whole body protein turnover is inhibition of protein degradation (1Rooyackers O.E. Nair K.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 457-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Insulin also stimulates the synthesis of selected proteins and overall protein synthesis under certain conditions such as growth and development (2Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C221-C228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thompson M.G. Palmer R.M. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the adult animal, however, total protein synthesis is not increased by insulin, and the protein anabolic effect of the hormone is actually an anti-catabolic property, i.e. inhibition of degradation (1Rooyackers O.E. Nair K.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 457-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of cellular protein degradation and the control of these processes are poorly understood. Currently, the major degradative systems are considered to be the lysosome, the proteasome, and various cytoplasmic and cellular proteases such as the calpain family and a recently described giant protease (4Bohley P. Seglen P.O. Experientia. 1992; 48: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

Cohen R.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R551-R553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which may functionally overlap proteasome activities. In general, lysosomes appear responsible for degradative processing of most endocytosed proteins and for autophagy under extreme catabolic states (4Bohley P. Seglen P.O. Experientia. 1992; 48: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The proteasome is a multifunctional organelle with multiple forms, e.g. 20 S and 26 S, which degrades abnormal and targeted proteins (ubiquitin, ATP-dependent pathway) and has various specific functions (antigen processing, etc.) (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Calpains participate in Ca2+-mediated degradative activity (6Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Various other proteases have specialized or uncertain roles but have a relatively minor contribution to cellular protein balance. Overall, cellular protein degradation can also be divided according to the half-lives of the proteins. This is particularly relevant, because many of the techniques for assessing protein turnover involve prelabeling with radioactive amino acids. The duration of labeling, chase, and subsequent release can provide data on turnover of different classes of proteins (e.g. short-lived versuslong-lived). Protein degradation is altered by many factors, including hormones, amino acid levels, metabolic substrates (e.g. glucose), ions, and others (8Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Am. J.

In addition, tissues such as liver and muscle may interact in regulating degradation in the alternate tissue; for example, amino acids from muscle breakdown may alter hepatic protein degradation. With this degree of complexity and interaction, it is not surprising that the specific effects of insulin on protein degradation and the mechanisms of those effects are not well understood.

In recent work, we have shown effects of insulin on ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (19Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Duckworth W.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2508-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present studies examine the inhibition of protein degradation by insulin and various insulin analogues in three different cell types under different conditions. We have compared these effects to the binding of the different peptides. The rat hepatoma cell line, H4-II-E, the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, and the rat skeletal muscle cell line, L6, were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD).

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS and 10 μg/ml gentamicin and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. The medium was changed every 2–3 days. L6 myoblasts spontaneously differentiate upon confluency and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes (20Mandel J.-L. Pearson M.L. Nature. 1974; 251: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells are used when differentiated (10 days after plating). H4 cells and HepG2 cells were grown in 24-well plates (starting density = 3.4 × 104 cells/cm2). The growth medium consisted of Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10% FCS and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5%CO2/95% air. The medium was changed every 2–3 days, and the cells were used when confluent (∼5 days). Binding of 125I-insulin to cells was carried out at 4 °C for 3 h. Radioactivity (10–20,000 cpm) was added with either insulin or analogues in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mm TES, pH 7.5. After incubation unbound material was removed and the cells were washed twice in PBS, pH 7.4. Solubilized cells were counted in a gamma-counter. Protein degradation was measured as described by Gunn et al. (21Gunn J.M. Clark M.G. Knowles S.E. Hopgood M.F. Ballard F.J. Nature. 1977; 266: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for liver cells with slight modifications. For L6 cells, on day 9 after plating, the growth medium was removed from the cells and replaced with leucine-free DMEM containing 10% FCS and 10 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine. Cells were incubated for 18 h to allow labeling of cellular proteins with [3H]leucine. Labeling medium was replaced with incubation/chase medium (DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled leucine, 20 mm TES, pH 7.5, and 0.1% BSA) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C (chase time). The 3-h chase period allowed for the removal of short-lived proteins. Following this the chase medium was removed and the cells were rinsed in chase medium. Insulin or analogues (10−12to 10−6m), in incubation medium, were added to the cells and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C (incubation time). For some experiments DMEM, which normally contains 20 mmglucose, was replaced with DMEM containing 5 mm glucose (low glucose medium). The incubation was stopped by placing the cells on ice and adding an equal volume of 6 m acetic acid containing 2% Triton X-100 to solubilize the cells. Aliquots of the cell/medium mix were analyzed for protein degradation by precipitation in 10% (final concentration) trichloroacetic acid. Protein degradation was taken as the percent trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. Assays in hepatoma cells were carried out as described for L6 cells except the cell labeling medium was leucine-free MEM with 10% FCS, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1 μCi/ml leucine. The incubation/chase medium consisted of MEM with 20 mm TES, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, and 2 mm leucine. All incubations were identical to the muscle cells. The effect of insulin on short-lived protein degradation was investigated essentially as described for intermediate-lived protein degradation except there was no chase period before the addition of insulin or analogues. Following labeling for 18 h with radioactive leucine, cells were rinsed twice with incubation/chase medium, insulin or analogues were added, and the cells incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Comparisons between the different conditions were by analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparison post test. p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Because insulin effects on cellular function are initiated by receptor binding, the binding of [125I]iodoinsulin and the effects of native insulin and various analogues were examined. Fig. 1shows the competitive displacement of [125I]iodoinsulin by native insulin and three analogues, LysPro, B10, and EQF. Insulin and LysPro are similar. B10 has a 2-fold increased affinity and EQF a 15-fold reduced affinity as compared with insulin.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 A shows that H4 cells are very sensitive to the inhibition of protein degradation by insulin (Table II), as has also been seen for other actions of insulin (22Kelley D.S. Becker J.E. Potter V. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4591-4600PubMed Google Scholar). LysPro and B10 are even more effective (p < 0.001) (Table II). Despite the significant differences in binding, EQF (Fig. 2 C) had an effect similar to insulin on protein degradation (Table II). The studies shown in Fig.2 were done with overnight labeling and a 3-h incubation with insulin or analogues in complete medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Several aspects of the results are notable, including the very high sensitivity to insulin and the differences in activity of the analogues relative to their binding potencies as compared with insulin.Table IIThe effect of insulin and analogues on protein degradationCell typeAssay type2-aShort-lived: overnight labeling, 3h incubation; intermediate-lived: overnight labeling, 3h chase, 4h incubation.EC50InsulinLysProB10EQFnmH4Short-lived0.0420.00232-bp < 0.001 versusinsulin.0.00412-bp < 0.001 versusinsulin.0.069Intermediate-lived0.160.0142-bp < 0.001 versusinsulin.0.0232-cp < 0.05 versusinsulin.0.13HepG2Short-lived1.41.30.5524.62-dp < 0.01 versusinsulin.Intermediate-lived1.30.921.943.02-cp < 0.05 versusinsulin.L6Short-lived4.01.41.724.02-cp < 0.05 versusinsulin.Intermediate-lived6.44.61.02-cp < 0.05 versusinsulin.14.22-a Short-lived: overnight labeling, 3h incubation; intermediate-lived: overnight labeling, 3h chase, 4h incubation.2-b p < 0.001 versusinsulin.2-c p < 0.05 versusinsulin.2-d p < 0.01 versusinsulin. Open table in a new tab The studies were repeated using a modification of the experimental protocol. In the approach shown in Fig. 2 the degradation of both short- and intermediate-lived proteins is measured. To remove the contribution of the rapidly turning over proteins and to focus on proteins with longer half-lives, a 3-h chase period was added, and the incubation with insulin or analogues was extended to 4 h (Fig.3). Under these conditions the curves are shifted to the right, indicating lesser sensitivity for insulin and LysPro (Fig. 3 A). Despite this, LysPro remains more effective than insulin (Table II). B10 (Fig. 3 B) is significantly more effective than insulin under these conditions (TableII). EQF (Fig. 3 C) remains equivalent to insulin (Table II). Thus, discrepancies between binding and activity for LysPro and EQF, but not for B10, remain. For this reason, studies were done in a different cell line. Fig.4 shows competitive displacement of [125I]iodoinsulin by insulin and analogues from HepG2 cells. The pattern is similar to H4 cells with insulin and LysPro being equivalent and with B10 having an increased and EQF a marked decrease in apparent affinity (Table I). Fig. 5 compares the effectiveness of the analogues with insulin on the inhibition of short-lived protein degradation in HepG2 cells. Insulin, LysPro (Fig. 5 A), and B10 (Fig. 5 B) are very similar (Table II). EQF (Fig.5 C) is much less effective (p < 0.01). To examine intermediate-lived proteins, a 3-h chase and a 4-h incubation were done (Fig. 6). In these studies, the dose-response curve for EQF was different from insulin (Fig. 6 C), and the EC50 was significantly higher (Table II). Insulin, LysPro, and B10 were equivalent. Fig. 7 shows binding of 125I-insulin to L6 myotubes and displacement by insulin and analogues. The EC50 values are shown in Table I. Although the affinities followed the same relative order as with other cells, the absolute differences were less and no statistical significance was seen among the materials. Protein degradation was examined for short-lived (Fig. 8) and intermediate-lived (Fig. 9) proteins. Figs. 8 A and 9 A show insulin and LysPro to be equal, Fig. 9 B shows an increased potency of B10, and EQF is less potent (Figs. 8 C and 9 C) (Table II).Figure 8Degradation of short-lived proteins in L6 cells.

Protein degradation is a complex set of processes involving multiple pathways and multiple classes of proteins with different turnover rates. Insulin has variable effects on the different processes. The present series of studies demonstrates this complexity. We compared the effects of insulin on protein degradation under different conditions with several insulin analogues in various cell types. The rapidly absorbed analogue LysPro (23Holleman F. Hoekstra J.B.L. N. Eng. J. Med. 1997; 337: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was examined along with two other analogues that have altered binding and processing characteristics. B10 has an increased binding affinity (24Slieker L.J. Brooke G.S. DiMarchi R.D. Flora D.B. Green L.K. Hoffmann J.A. Long H.B. Fan L. Shields J.E. Sundell K.L. Surface P.L. Chance R.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S54-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but reduced susceptibility to cellular processing and degradation (25Hamel F.G. Siford G.L. Fawcett J. Chance R.E. Frank B.H. Duckworth W.C. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The B10 position is an early cleavage site for the degradation of insulin (26Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocrine Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and the Asp for His substitution alters cellular processing in several ways, including slower receptor dissociation and intracellular processing (25Hamel F.G. Siford G.L. Fawcett J. Chance R.E. Frank B.H. Duckworth W.C. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). EQF has several substitutions that decrease both binding and susceptibility to degradation (27Slieker L.J. Brooke G.S. Chance R.E. Fan L. Hoffmann J.A. Howey D.C. Long H.B. Mayer J. Shields J.E. Sundell K.L. DiMarchi R.D. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Current Directions in Insulin-like Growth Factor Research. Plenum Press, New York1994: 25-32Google Scholar). The B16 site, which is altered in EQF insulin, is one of the earliest cleavage sites in insulin (26Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocrine Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). This study confirms the increased binding affinity of B10 (24Slieker L.J. Brooke G.S. DiMarchi R.D. Flora D.B. Green L.K. Hoffmann J.A. Long H.B. Fan L. Shields J.E. Sundell K.L. Surface P.L. Chance R.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S54-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the reduced receptor binding of EQF (27Slieker L.J. Brooke G.S. Chance R.E. Fan L. Hoffmann J.A. Howey D.C. Long H.B. Mayer J. Shields J.E. Sundell K.L. DiMarchi R.D. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Current Directions in Insulin-like Growth Factor Research. Plenum Press, New York1994: 25-32Google Scholar), and the unaltered binding of LysPro. Similar results were seen with H4 hepatocytes, HepG2 hepatocytes, and L6 myotubes. These studies illustrate the complexities in cellular protein degradation and the effects of insulin. The results varied with study conditions and cell type. H4 cells were very sensitive to insulin. Under conditions that measured the turnover of both short- and intermediate-lived proteins, an extremely sensitive insulin effect was seen (EC50 = 4.2 × 10−11m). When a preincubation was added to eliminate rapidly turning over proteins, the EC50 increased ∼4-fold (1.6 × 10−10m) but remained very sensitive (22Kelley D.S. Becker J.E. Potter V. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4591-4600PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinity is typical (4.6 × 10−9m) (28Ballard F.J. Wong S.S. Knowles S.E. Partridge N.C. Martin T.J. Wood C.M. Gunn J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 105: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This shows a dissociation between binding and activity. The biological effects of insulin and analogues on protein degradation relative to binding are shown in TableIII. No consistent relationship between binding and biological activity on protein degradation by the analogues was seen. This is in contrast to the high correlation between insulin receptor binding and glucose transport (29Hansen B.F. Danielsen G.M. Drejer K. Sørensen A.R. Wiberg F.C. Klein H.H. Lundemose A.G. Biochem.

We also found that glucose incorporation into glycogen in L6 cells and H4 cells correlate with receptor binding. 2J. Fawcett, F. G. Hamel, R. G. Bennett, Z. Vajo, and W. C. Duckworth, unpublished observation.Table IIIPotency of insulin analogues to inhibit protein degradation relative to binding as compared to insulinProtein degradationCell lineRelative potency: Protein degradation compared to bindingInsulinLysProB10EQFShort-livedH4121.04.510.9HepG210.50.30.5L613.61.70.4Intermediate-livedH4113.23.021.9HepG210.70.10.3L611.74.51.1 Open table in a new tab Of equal note is that the results varied in different cell types and with different experimental conditions. In general, H4 cells responded better to the analogues than to insulin, and HepG2 cells responded less well to the analogues. Relative to binding, LysPro was 13–21 times more effective than insulin in H4 cells but only half as effective in HepG2 cells. EQF was up to 22 times more effective in H4 cells but less than half as effective in HepG2 cells. The simple conclusion is that differences in action of insulin analogues on protein degradation cannot be attributed solely to their receptor binding. These results illustrate the importance of factors beyond receptor binding in the actions of insulin. LysPro insulin binds to the insulin receptor with an affinity identical to insulin (Ref. 23Holleman F. Hoekstra J.B.L. N. Eng. J. Med. 1997; 337: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and our results). The effects of this analogue on glucose metabolism are identical to insulin (34Kurtzhals P. Schäffer L. Sørensen A. Kristensen C. Jonassen I. Schmid C. Trüb T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 36Howey D.C. Bowsher R.R. Brunelle R.L. Woodworth J.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Other effects, including cell growth and mitogenesis, are also similar to insulin (27Slieker L.J. Brooke G.S. Chance R.E. Fan L. Hoffmann J.A. Howey D.C. Long H.B. Mayer J. Shields J.E. Sundell K.L. DiMarchi R.D. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Current Directions in Insulin-like Growth Factor Research.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). B10 has an increased affinity for the insulin receptor and correspondingly greater effects on glucose metabolism and on mitogenesis (29Hansen B.F. Danielsen G.M. Drejer K. Sørensen A.R. Wiberg F.C. Klein H.H. Lundemose A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34Kurtzhals P. Schäffer L. Sørensen A. Kristensen C. Jonassen I. Schmid C. Trüb T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The latter effect has been attributed to increased IGF-I receptor binding (29Hansen B.F. Danielsen G.M. Drejer K. Sørensen A.R. Wiberg F.C. Klein H.H. Lundemose A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the present study LysPro was more potent than insulin in decreasing protein degradation in H4 cells but not HepG2 or L6 cells (Table II). B10 had a greater effect than insulin in H4 cells but not in HepG2 cells despite the increased binding of B10 in HepG2 cells. EQF had a markedly decreased binding affinity in both hepatic cell lines but had effects similar to insulin on protein degradation in H4 cells. In HepG2 cells EQF was less potent than insulin at inhibiting protein degradation. Overall, there was a very poor correlation between binding and inhibition, which extended across all cell types for all analogues. Previous studies have shown that biological activity (glucose transport and metabolism, cell growth, and mitogenesis) and insulin receptor binding activity correspond closely for insulin and most analogues (24Slieker L.J.

In the present study of insulin effects on protein degradation, these correlations break down. The activities of the analogues relative to binding vary among different cell types and with different assay conditions (Table III). In H4 cells all of the analogues tended to have increased activity relative to binding, when compared with insulin. EQF had a considerably greater effect than insulin on intermediate-lived proteins relative to binding. In contrast, in HepG2 cells, another cultured hepatocyte line, the analogues tended to have less activity relative to binding, as compared with insulin. Again there were differences between effects on intermediate- and short-lived proteins. EQF was much less effective on short-lived protein degradation and B10 less effective on intermediate lived proteins. LysPro was very similar to insulin. Lastly, in L6 cells, EQF was less effective than insulin on short-lived protein degradation but equally effective when intermediate protein degradation was measured. LysPro and B10 were similar to insulin when activity relative to binding was considered. This lack of correlation demonstrates that post-receptor binding events must be involved. The conclusion that the control of protein degradation by insulin requires more than just receptor binding is supported by previous literature. Draznin's group (37Draznin B. Trowbridge M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11988-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our laboratory (38Peavy D.E. Edmondson J.W. Duckworth W.C. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that cellular insulin processing and degradation were required for the effect of insulin on protein degradation. We have shown direct effects of insulin on isolated proteasomal activity (15Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Duckworth W.C.

Duckworth W.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49 (abstr.): A26Google Scholar) may play a role in mediating some of the effects of insulin on protein degradation. In studies of cellular processing of the analogues used in this study, the correlation between cellular processing and effect on protein degradation is much greater than that between binding and activity. 3J. Fawcett, F. G. Hamel, R. G. Bennett, Z. Vajo, and W. C. Duckworth, manuscript in preparation. The present study has shown that the effects of insulin and various insulin analogues on protein degradation vary significantly in different cell types and with different experimental conditions. These differences cannot be explained by alterations in receptor binding. Post-receptor mechanisms, including intracellular processing and degradation, deserve evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2075204522,"Abstract T cell activation through the antigen receptor (TCR) involves the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3e, and CD3ζ. Whereas the biological significance of the cytoplasmic tails of these molecules is suggested, in part, by their evolutionarily conserved sequences, their interactions with signal transduction molecules are not completely understood. We used affinity chromatography columns of glutathione S-transferase fused to the CD3e cytoplasmic tail to isolate proteins that specifically interact with this subunit. In this way, we identified the shuttling protein nucleolin as a specific CD3e-interacting molecule. Using competition studies and affinity chromatography on peptide columns, we were able to identify a central proline-rich sequence as the nucleolin-interacting sequence in CD3e. Transfection in COS cells of wild type CD3e, but not of nonbinding mutants of CD3e, resulted in redistribution of nucleolin from the nucleus and nucleoli to the cytoplasm. This property was transferred to a CD8 protein chimera by appending the cytoplasmic tail of CD3e. We also found that nucleolin associated with the TCR complex. This association was increased upon TCR engagement, suggesting that the CD3e/nucleolin interaction may have a role in T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2084685106,"Rab GTPases are localized to distinct subsets of organelles within the cell, where they regulate SNARE-mediated membrane trafficking between organelles. One factor required for Rab localization and function is Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), which is proposed to recycle Rab after vesicle fusion by extracting Rab from the membrane and loading Rab onto newly formed transport intermediates. GDI is composed of two domains; Rab binding is mediated by Domain I, and the function of Domain II is not known. In this study, Domain II of yeast GDI, encoded by the essential GDI1/SEC19gene, was targeted in a genetic screen to obtain mutants that might lend insight into the function of this domain. In onegdi1 mutant, the cytosolic pools of all Rabs tested were depleted, and Rab accumulated on membranes, suggesting that this mutant Gdi1 protein has a general defect in extraction of Rab from membranes. In a second gdi1 mutant, the endosomal/vacuolar Rabs Vps21/Ypt51p and Ypt7p accumulated in the cytosol bound to Gdi1p, but localization of Ypt1p and Sec4p were not significantly affected. Using an in vitro assay which reconstitutes Gdi1p-mediated membrane loading of Rab, this mutant Gdi1p was found to be defective in loading of Vps21p but not Ypt1p. Loading of Vps21p by loading-defective Gdi1p was restored when acceptor membranes prepared from a deletion strain lacking Vps21p were used. These results suggest that membrane-associated Rab may regulate recruitment of GDI-Rab from the cytosol, possibly by regulating a GDI-Rab receptor. We conclude that Domain II of Gdi1p is essential for Rab loading and Rab extraction, and confirm that each of these activities is required for Gdi1p functionin vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1994854803,"BCL-XL is a key anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein that is widely expressed in human cancer cells and is induced in response to diverse survival signals. The translation initiation codon for BCL-XL is located in BCL-X exon II and previous analyses have indicated that BCL-XL RNAs initiate close to the start of exon II or additionally contain a non-coding first exon (exon IA) spliced to exon II. Using 5' RACE we have now identified a novel BCL-X non-coding exon (exon IB) which is spliced directly to exon II in place of exon IA. Exon IB-containing RNAs encoded BCL-XL and were detected in non-malignant lymphocytes and lymphoma cells from lymph node biopsies and were expressed at significant levels in cell lines derived from ovarian, colon and breast cancers. We identified two TATA-box sequences upstream of exon IB and demonstrated that surrounding genomic sequences contained strong promoter activity in lymphoma cells (approximately 300-fold active relative to controls).

In this study, a second photoreactive SP analogue, Bpa4-SP, in which the Bpa residue is located in the N-terminal portion of the peptide, was used to define further the peptide-receptor interface. The NK-1 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was specifically and efficiently photolabeled with a radioiodinated derivative of Bpa4-SP. Fragmentation analysis of the photolabeled receptor restricted the site of photoincorporation of Bpa4-SP to an amino acid within the sequence Thr-173 to Arg-177 located on the N-terminal side of the E2 loop. To identify the specific amino acid in this sequence that serves as the covalent attachment site for Bpa4-SP, a small photolabeled receptor fragment was generated by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometric analysis of the purified fragment identified a single protonated molecular ion with a molecular mass of 1801.3 ± 1.8, indicating that upon irradiation, the bound photoligand covalently attaches to the terminal methyl group of a methionine residue. This result, taken together with the results of the peptide mapping studies, establishes that the site of Bpa4-SP covalent attachment to the NK-1 receptor is Met-174.

White C.F. Cerpa R. Kaiser E.T. Leeman S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Identification of side-chain interactions between SP and the NK-1 receptor is important to understand the molecular basis for high affinity peptide binding and receptor activation. In the absence of high resolution structural data, molecular biological and biochemical approaches, particularly when combined, have provided useful information that allows the localization of specific interactions between SP and the NK-1 receptor. We have developed a methodology using the direct approach of photoaffinity labeling for the determination of contact sites between a peptide ligand and its receptor (1Boyd N.D. White C.F. Cerpa R. Kaiser E.T. Leeman S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In previous work, an analogue of SP in which a photoreactive amino acidp-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) was incorporated into position 8 of the peptide Bpa8-SP was used to covalently label the NK-1 receptor (1Boyd N.D. White C.F. Cerpa R. Kaiser E.T. Leeman S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Importantly, the introduction of the Bpa residue into this position does not alter the ability of the SP analogue to bind the NK-1 receptor with high affinity or to induce a functional response. Furthermore, Bpa8-SP was shown to be a specific and an efficient photoprobe of the NK-1 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The site of Bpa8-SP covalent attachment was identified by peptide mapping strategies and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to be Met-181 of the E2 loop of the receptor (2Kage R.

In the present study, to define further the peptide binding domain of the NK-1 receptor as well as to orient the SP peptide within the binding pocket, a second photoprobe, Bpa4-SP, in which proline 4 is replaced by the photoreactive Bpa residue (Bpa4-SP), has been used to covalently label the NK-1 receptor. The introduction of the Bpa residue into this position does not alter the ability of this analogue to bind to the NK-1 receptor with high affinity or to function as an NK-1 receptor agonist. The attachment site of radioiodinated 125I-Bpa4-SP was identified by peptide mapping and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to be Met-174. p-Benzoyl-l-phenylalanine4-substance P (Bpa4-SP) was synthesized and radioiodinated with a specific activity of 2200 Ci/mmol using the Bolton-Hunter reagent as described previously (1Boyd N.D. White C.F. Cerpa R. Kaiser E.T. Leeman S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CHO cells were stably transfected with the rat SP receptor cDNA as described previously (6Takeda Y. Blount P. Sachais B.S. Hershey A.D. Raddatz R. Krause J.E. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The transfected CHO cells expressing 1 × 105 SP binding sites/cell were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For preparative experiments, cells were obtained in quantity by culture in suspension using spinner flasks to a cell density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml. For the saturation binding experiments, transfected CHO cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with increasing concentrations of125I-Bpa4-SP (0.1–5 nm) in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), supplemented with 6 mg/ml glucose and 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Binding experiments using photoaffinity ligands were performed in the dark. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of excess unlabeled SP (1 μm). Binding was terminated by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer and rapid filtering through a glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/C) that had been soaked for at least 2 h in polyethyleneimine (0.1%). The filters were then assayed for radioactivity by γ spectrometry. Binding affinity (Kd) was calculated from the Scatchard transformation of the binding data. Cells were plated on 9 × 22-mm glass coverslips in a tissue culture dish and maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.8 mg/ml G418. When the cells reached 70–90% confluence, the coverslips were washed with a HEPES-buffered saline solution (10 mm HEPES, 140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). The cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator, 4 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes), with 0.01% pluronic acid (9:1, v/v) in 2 ml of HEPES-buffered saline and incubated for 25 min at room temperature. The coverslip was then washed with HEPES-buffered saline and placed into a fluorescence spectrophotometer in a cuvette containing HEPES-buffered saline. Upon the addition of peptide ligands, fluorescent emission was measured at 510 nm with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (Fura-2 bound and unbound to calcium, respectively). [Ca2+]i was determined by the ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths as described previously (7Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in HEPES buffer and incubated with 125I-labeled Bpa4-SP (0.1 nm) for 2 h at 4 °C in the dark. The cells were then irradiated at a distance of 6 cm from a 100-watt long-wave (365 nm) UV lamp (Blak-ray, San Gabriel, CA) for 15 min on ice. For large scale photolabeling, cells were obtained in large quantity (5-liter suspension culture) and incubated with125I-Bpa4-SP isotopically diluted with127I-labeled Bpa4-SP (1:1000). After photolysis, the cells were obtained by centrifugation and washed twice with HEPES buffer. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), homogenized briefly, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The photolabeled membrane pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min and stored at −20 °C. To test the specificity of the photoaffinity ligand, labeling was also carried out in the presence of excess unlabeled SP (1 μm). Membrane preparations containing the photolabeled receptor were partially digested for 18 h withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The amount of trypsin used per mg of membrane protein is specified in the figure legends. The digestion was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The solubilized peptide fragments were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel using the Tricine gel system of Schagger and von Jagow (8Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5) with an intensifying screen (DuPont). The molecular masses of the radiolabeled fragments were determined using molecular mass markers from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (2.35–46 kDa). Following autoradiography, the radioactive bands were excised from dried gels and macerated into pieces. The partially digested receptor fragments were then eluted passively in either extraction buffer (0.1% SDS, 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8) for subcleavage by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or 0.1n HCl for CNBr (cyanogen bromide) subcleavage. The eluted tryptic fragments were also incubated with 100 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at room temperature and then reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE. For cleavage of the intact receptor with CNBr, photolabeled membranes were first absorbed to C18-derivatized silica beads (Alltech) at 1 mg of C18 beads/mg of membrane protein. The silica beads were washed twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, followed by 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water to remove the unbound ligand. The membrane-attached silica beads were then incubated overnight with 50 mg/ml CNBr in 0.1 n HCl in the dark at room temperature. CNBr-generated peptide fragments were eluted from the silica beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were subject to electrophoresis and autoradiography. To evaluate the effects of CNBr on the ligand, which also contains a methionine residue, 127I-Bpa4-SP was treated with 50 mg/ml CNBr in 0.1 n HCl at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was further separated by C18 HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry. For preparative experiments, a small receptor fragment (2 kDa) generated from CNBr cleavage was partially purified on preparative SDS-PAGE Tricine gel (3 mm). The small labeled receptor fragment was eluted from the gel in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for further purification by HPLC. To determine the yield of photolabeled receptor fragments, the autoradiographs were aligned with the dried gels, the radiolabeled polypeptides were cut out, and the amount of radioactivity was measured. The eluted receptor fragment (2 kDa) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC using an Alltech C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) and a Vydac C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The columns were eluted with increasing Solvent B (60% acetonitrile/0.08% trifluoroacetic acid/39% water) against Solvent A (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water) at a constant flow rate of 1.5 ml/min at 45 °C. The concentration of Solvent B was raised from 20 to 60% at a rate of 1%/min. Fractions were collected every minute, and the 125I radioactivity of eluted fractions was monitored by γ spectrometry. The UV absorbance of each fraction was also recorded at a wavelength of 210 nm. The molecular mass of the purified 2-kDa receptor fragment was determined at the Mass Spectrometry Resource at Boston University School of Medicine using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in less than picomole quantities. The Finnigan Vision 2000 instrument (Thermo BioAnalysis, Franklin, MA) is equipped with an LSI nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse duration). The matrix, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, was dissolved in 1:4 water/acetonitrile (10 mg/ml). The addition of a 127I-labeled Bolton-Hunter conjugate of Bpa4-SP to transfected CHO cells expressing the NK-1 receptor induced a Ca2+ response comparable with that induced by the same concentration of the parent peptide SP (Fig.1). The response evoked by both peptides was completely inhibited in the presence of 1 μmRP-67,580, a specific nonpeptide antagonist of the rat NK-1 receptor. The binding affinity of radioiodinated125I-Bpa4-SP to intact CHO cells expressing the NK-1 receptor was determined by saturation binding experiments. The observed equilibrium binding was characterized by Kd= 1.4 ± 0.2 nm, a value about 5-fold higher than that previously reported for the corresponding radioiodinated conjugate of the parent peptide (3Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 9475-9480Google Scholar). In contrast, the number of NK-1 receptors/cell (Bmax) was the same for both derivatives. NK-1 receptors expressed on intact CHO cells were photolabeled with 125I-Bpa4-SP, and the resulting ligand-receptor complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Photolabeled receptors were observed as a broad band centered at 80 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1). The diffuseness of the band is attributable to heterogeneous glycosylation of NK-1 receptors expressed in CHO cells (5Kage R. Hershey A.D. Krause J.E. Boyd N.D. Leeman S.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the radioactivity incorporated into the NK-1 receptor indicated that photolabeling was highly efficient; ∼40% of the specifically bound photoligand became covalently linked to the receptor upon UV exposure. Membrane preparations of photolabeled receptors were treated under nonreducing conditions with trypsin, and the resulting fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Three major photolabeled fragments of 22, 14, and 5 kDa were observed (Fig. 2, lane 2). These bands were eluted from the gel. Further digestion by trypsin of the eluted fragments converted the 22- and 14-kDa fragments to the 5-kDa fragment (data not shown), thus establishing that the 5-kDa fragment is the limit peptide produced by trypsin digestion. Previously we have shown that the NK-1 receptor contains a disulfide bond linking Cys-105 on the E1 loop to Cys-180 on the E2 loop and that this bond plays an important role in the high affinity binding of SP (3Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 9475-9480Google Scholar). The analysis of receptor fragments generated in the absence or presence of DTT is valuable for the identification of receptor fragments held together by a disulfide bond between Cys-105 and Cys-180. Therefore, each of the photolabeled bands obtained from tryptic digestion under nonreducing conditions was further treated with DTT and reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE. Upon reduction by DTT, the mobility of the 22-kDa band increased to 14 kDa, whereas the 14-kDa band increased to 7 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). In contrast, the mobility of the 5-kDa fragment was not changed by treatment with DTT, indicating that this photolabeled receptor fragment, unlike the other two larger fragments, lacks the disulfide bond (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Based on the experimentally determined molecular mass of the limit fragment and extended forms, together with their susceptibility to reductive cleavage by DTT, we can conclude that digestion of the photolabeled receptor with trypsin generates an ∼5-kDa fragment corresponding to residues Leu-142 to Arg-177, which has a calculated molecular mass of 5.8 kDa when the mass of the covalently attached probe, 1.8 kDa, is added. This 5-kDa fragment contains a single cleavage site for S. aureus V8 protease at residue Glu-172. To define more closely the residue that serves as the site of photoincorporation, the limit tryptic fragment of Mr 5000 was treated with S. aureus V8 protease. After cleavage of the 5-kDa fragment with S. aureus V8 protease, a small fragment of 2.4 kDa in agreement with the calculated mass (2.3 kDa) of the photoligand covalently attached to a receptor fragment extending from residues 173 to 177 (TMPSR) was obtained (Fig.4, lane 2). TheMr 5000 limit tryptic fragment was also treated with CNBr, a reagent specific for cleavage after Met, generating a fragment of Mr ∼2000 (Fig. 4, lane 3), a value that is close to that of the photoligand itself. To obtain a sufficient amount of the 2-kDa fragment for accurate determination of molecular mass MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis, transfected CHO cells (109) were photolabeled with125I-Bpa4-SP isotopically diluted with127I-Bpa4-SP to a specific activity of 2 Ci/mmol and then subjected to solid-phase CNBr cleavage (2Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 pmol of the photolabeled receptor was absorbed onto C18-derivatized silica beads. Following treatment with CNBr, the generated fragments were resolved using Tricine-based SDS-PAGE. The 2-kDa radiolabeled fragment was eluted and further purified by HPLC using both C18 and C4 columns (Fig. 5,A and B). The final yield of the purified 2-kDa fragment was 8 pmol, representing 8% of the starting photolabeled receptor, an amount more than sufficient to permit MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the CNBr-generated fragment yielded a (M+H)+ with an m/z value of 1801.3 ± 1.8 (Fig. 6). This mass spectrum not only confirms the purity of the isolated fragment but also defines the chemical structure of the fragment. The observed molecular mass (1801.3 ± 1.8) could only be generated from a photolabeled receptor by the covalent attachment of the probe127I-Bpa4-SP (molecular weight = 1776.9) to the methyl group of a methionine residue, followed by CNBr cleavage of the bond between the γ-carbon and sulfur on the methionine side chain to form a thiocyanate (−CH2SCN) derivative. In addition, the C-terminal methionine amide of the covalently attached probe is converted by CNBr to a homoserine lactone. The observed (M+H)+ of m/z1801.3 ± 1.8 of the final cleavage product is in good agreement with the calculated (M+H)+ of m/z1802.9. Because there is only one methionine residue (Met-174) in the photolabeled receptor fragment (residues 173–177), we can conclude that the site of photoincorporation of Bpa4-SP is Met-174 (Fig.7). Our previous results have shown that Bpa8-SP, which contains the photoreactive Bpa residue in the eighth position of the SP peptide within the conserved C-terminal region that defines the tachykinin peptide family, covalently attaches to a single residue, Met-181, on the NK-1 receptor (2Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present study characterizes the site of a covalent attachment of a second photoreactive analogue of SP with the photoreactive residue located in the nonconserved N terminus of the peptide, specifically position 4 (Bpa4-SP). The substitution of the 4th position of SP (Pro-4) by Bpa is well tolerated by the receptor, as evidenced by its high affinity binding to the NK-1 receptor and its ability to stimulate an increase in intracellular calcium in the in vitro assay. The results presented in this report show that Bpa4-SP covalently attaches to a single residue Met-174, implying that position 4 of SP is in close spatial proximity to Met-174 when bound to the NK-1 receptor. Interestingly, in a separate study, Girault et al. (9Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) identified Met-174 as the attachment site on the human NK-1 receptor for the SP analogue Bpa8-Pro9-SP, the same residue that is labeled in the present study by Bpa4-SP. Although the basis for the discrepancy in these studies is unknown, the introduction of a proline residue at the 9th position of SP could potentially alter the confirmation of the peptide in such a manner that the Bpa residue of Bpa8-Pro9-SP is positioned in close proximity to Met-174 rather than Met-181. Additional explanations could include (i) species differences (humanversus rat) or (ii) experimental differences (e.g. labeling of membrane preparations versuslabeling of intact cells). The results obtained here with radioiodinated Bpa4-SP, when combined with our previous findings (2Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 9475-9480Google Scholar) with radioiodinated Bpa8-SP, establish the importance of the initial sequence of the E2 loop extending beyond transmembrane 4 of the NK-1 receptor (in peptide binding). Based on these findings, it is likely that the bound SP peptide is oriented parallel to this region of the receptor with its 4th position adjacent to Met-174 and its 8th position adjacent to Met-181. Because of its location in the E2 loop just after it emerges from the lipid bilayer, Met-174 is positioned close to the membrane. Furthermore, although Met-181 is located in the middle of the E2 loop, it is adjacent to Cys-180, which participates in a disulfide bond with Cys-105 (3Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 9475-9480Google Scholar), a residue that is close to the membrane interface. Thus, Met-181 is also positioned near the membrane interface of the peptide. Interestingly, we have recently obtained evidence (10Macdonald D. Mierke D.F. Li H. Pellegrini M. Sachais B. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that these two methionines on the E2 loop are also spatially close to each other."

The fact that p-nitrophenyl phosphate can be hydrolyzed in the presence or absence of Ca2+ by the purified enzyme is consistent with the observed phenomenon of intramolecular uncoupling. Under the most favorable conditions, which include neutral pH, intact microsomal vesicles, and low free Ca2+ in the lumen, the Ca2+/Picoupling ratio was 0.6.

Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (817) Google Scholar). In this sense, clear structural and functional similarities among P-type ATPases have been observed (2Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 59-68Google Scholar, 3Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These similarities include the hydrophobic transmembrane segments containing the porelike region, the extramembranous globular head where the ATP binding site is located, two major conformational states of the enzyme, the acyl phosphate intermediate and the catalytic cycle. Although these common features suggest that ion-transporting ATPases share the same energy transduction mechanism, this idea was challenged when non-nucleotide compounds were used as phosphorylating substrate (5Asano S. Kamiya S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6590-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, it was observed that the transport activity supported by non-nucleotide substrates is dependent on the cation-ATPase involved. In other words, the same non-nucleotide substrate does not always perform the same task since it is dependent on the energy transduction system. For instance, it has been reported that Ca2+ is transported by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1 Ca2+-ATPase during the hydrolysis of pNPP or acetyl phosphate (6Inesi G.

However, the hydrolysis of pNPP supports neither Ca2+ transport by the erythrocyte membrane Ca2+-ATPase (10Sarkadi B. Szasz I. Gardos G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 598: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Caride A.J. Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) nor H+ transport by the H+-ATPase from the yeast plasma membrane (12Ferreira-Pereira A. Alves-Ferreira M. Carvalho-Alves P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12074-12079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have reported that reconstituted Na+,K+-ATPase displays slight Na+uptake during the hydrolysis of acetyl phosphate (13Beauge L. Berberian G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 772: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas the H+,K+-ATPase from gastric mucosa cannot actively transport H+ and K+ when hydrolyzing acetyl phosphate (5Asano S. Kamiya S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6590-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been recognized that the hydrolysis of non-nucleotide substrates in the absence of transport activity is related to low energy conformations of the enzyme (5Asano S. Kamiya S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6590-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ferreira-Pereira A. Alves-Ferreira M. Carvalho-Alves P.C. J. Biol.

Acta. 1983; 731: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas the simultaneous occurrence of both substrate hydrolysis and ion transport is associated with high energy conformations (7Pucell A. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bodley A. Jencks W.P. J. Biol.

In an attempt to clarify the role of non-nucleotide substrates in the energy coupling process, we selected pNPP as energy-donor substrate and SR Ca2+-ATPase as a transduction system. Initially, the enzyme was exposed to conditions that allowed Ca2+transport at the expenses of pNPP hydrolysis. Then, the assay conditions were modified to induce uncoupling. The use of a purified enzyme preparation (16Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and the highly specific inhibitor TG (17Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wictome M. Michelangeli F. Lee A.G. East J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) shed light on the hydrolytic activities measured in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The experimental strategy for analyzing the energy uncoupling routes was based on the inhibitory effect of vanadate and TG, namely vanadate interacts selectively with theE 2 conformation of the enzyme whereas TG inhibits the accumulation of E 1 forms. Our functional model provides a mechanistic description of the intramolecular uncoupling phenomenon when the SR Ca2+-ATPase hydrolyzes pNPP. This is relevant for understanding the uncoupling of different P-type ATPases in the presence of different phosphorylating substrates and in the absence of a cationic leak. [45Ca]CaCl2 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The Ca2+ standard solution (Titrisol) was purchased from Merck. Ionophore A23187 fromStreptomyces chartreusensis was a product of Calbiochem. Ammonium metavanadate was from Acros Organics. 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate (disodium salt) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. TG was obtained from Molecular Probes Europe. The liquid scintillation mixture (S 4023), deoxycholic acid (sodium salt), and other reagents of analytical grade were from Sigma. HAWP filter units with pore diameter of 0.45 μm were from Millipore. 45Ca2+-loaded vesicles were filtered under vacuum with a Hoefer manifold filtration box from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Right side-oriented (intact) vesicles were obtained from the SR membrane of fast twitch rabbit leg muscle as described by Eletr and Inesi (19Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Purified Ca2+-ATPase was prepared by deoxycholate treatment according to method 2 of Meissneret al. (16Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Final pellets were resuspended and stored in frozen aliquots at −80 °C until use. Vesicles leaky to Ca2+ were obtained by including A23187 in the reaction medium. The protein concentration was measured by the Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) procedure using bovine serum albumin as standard. Free Ca2+ in the external medium was calculated as described by Fabiato (21Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), taking into account the Ca2+-EGTA absolute stability constant (22Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the pK values for the EGTA protonation (23Blinks J. Wier W. Hess P. Prendergast F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), pH, and the presence of relevant ligands. Free Ca2+ in the lumenal medium was fixed by equilibrating the vesicles in the standard reaction medium but including potassium oxalate in the range of 0.5–5 mm. Stock solutions containing mostly monovanadate were prepared by dissolving ammonium metavanadate in ultrapure water (Milli-Q grade) adjusted at pH 10.0 with NaOH. The absence of a yellow/orange color indicated the absence of any decavanadate species (24Hua S. Fabris D. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2217-2225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity to vanadate was studied by measuring the dependence of the pNPP hydrolysis rate on the vanadate concentration. Linear rates of pNPP hydrolysis were measured at 25 °C by following the time-dependent accumulation of p-nitrophenol (25Nakamura Y. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The standard reaction medium consisted of 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.247 mm CaCl2 (50 μm free Ca2+), 0.2 mg/ml SR protein, and 5 mm potassium oxalate. The reaction was started by adding a given pNPP concentration. Aliquots containing 0.5 ml of reaction mixture were withdrawn at different time intervals and mixed with 0.5 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. For each sample, the membrane protein was sedimented at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and the supernatant containing p-nitrophenol (0.9 ml) was supplemented with 45 μl of 10 n NaOH (final concentration, 0.5 n). A blank assay was performed by adding 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing no phosphorylating substrate. After mixing, pNPP was added and processed as described before. p-Nitrophenol was quantitated by colorimetric reading at 420 nm. The extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol (1.62 × 104m−1·cm−1) was determined previously under the experimental conditions used in this study. pNPP hydrolysis was also measured under nonstandard conditions. A detailed description of the reaction media composition is provided in the corresponding figure legends. Linear rates of active Ca2+ accumulation were measured at 25 °C with the aid of radioactive tracer and sample filtration (26Martonosi A. Feretos R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 648-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction medium consisted of 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.247 mm CaCl2 (free Ca2+ was 50 μm), ∼7,000 cpm/nmol 45Ca2+, 0.2 mg/ml SR protein, and 5 mm potassium oxalate. After equilibration, the reaction was initiated by adding pNPP and stopped at various times by filtering aliquots of 0.5 ml. Filters retaining the microsomal vesicles were rapidly rinsed with 10 ml of ice-cold La3+ medium (10 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 2 mm LaCl3), solubilized, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Unspecific 45Ca2+retained by the filters was subtracted by performing a blank assay. In this case, an aliquot of 0.5 ml of reaction mixture before the addition of pNPP was filtered and processed as described previously. Other assay conditions for Ca2+ transport are given in the figure captions and in the text where appropriate. Hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence or absence of Ca2+ was measured at 25 °C, as described for SR vesicles. Measurements in the presence of Ca2+ were carried out in a medium containing 20 mm buffer (Mes, pH 6.0, Mops, pH 7.0, or Tris, pH 8.0), 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, CaCl2 and EGTA to yield 50 μm free Ca2+, 0.2 mg/ml purified enzyme, and 10 mm pNPP. For measurements in a nominally Ca2+-free medium, EGTA was raised to 1 mm and Ca2+ was omitted. Some experiments at neutral pH were performed in the presence of 40% (v/v) Me2SO. The reaction medium was supplemented with 2 μm TG when indicated. The degree of activation by Ca2+ was calculated as the ratio between the enzyme activity observed in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (both measured in the absence of TG). The TG inhibition factor was calculated as a ratio between the enzyme activity in a Ca2+-containing medium measured in the absence or presence of TG. SR vesicles (0.4 mg/ml) were equilibrated at 25 °C in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.247 mmCaCl2, ∼9,000 cpm/nmol 45Ca2+, and 5 mm potassium oxalate. The hydrolytic reaction was initiated by adding 10 mm pNPP. The final volume was 2.5 ml and the temperature 25 °C. A blank assay was carried out by processing a sample with no added pNPP. At t = 6 min, the reaction medium was supplemented with 5 μm TG and a volume of 2.5 ml containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.247 mm CaCl2, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and 80% (v/v) Me2SO was added immediately. The time course of Ca2+ accumulation was followed at different times by filtering aliquots containing 0.1 mg of membrane protein. Filters were rinsed with 10 ml of ice-cold La3+ medium, solubilized, and counted by liquid scintillation. Experimental data are presented as the mean plus or minus the standard error and correspond to at least three independent assays, each performed in duplicate. Kinetic parameters were evaluated after curve fitting by nonlinear regression algorithm using the SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific). The initial experimental conditions included a preparation of microsomal vesicles showing negligible passive Ca2+ leakage (27Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a reaction medium containing 20 mm Mg2+. Free Ca2+ in the external medium was maintained at 50 μm by including a Ca2+/EGTA-buffered system while 5 mm oxalate ensured a low free Ca2+ in the lumen. The dependence of the hydrolysis rate on the pNPP concentration measured at pH 7.0 and in the Ca2+-containing medium displayed a hyperbolic profile, as shown in Fig. 1 A. A reaction medium at pH 6.0 or 8.0 did not significantly modify the hydrolysis rate measured at each pNPP concentration. The dependence of the Ca2+ transport rate on pNPP concentration was also measured. The rate of active Ca2+accumulation was highly dependent on the reaction medium pH (Fig.1 B). A hyperbolic dependence was observed at pH 6.0 or 7.0, even though higher rates were obtained at neutral pH. Negligible rates were observed after a fast and small component of Ca2+transport when the experiments were carried out at pH 8.0. An analysis of the experimental curves (TableI) revealed that K mfor pNPP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+ and that for Ca2+ transport were in the 2–3 mm range when measured from pH 6.0 to 8.0. Moreover, V max for pNPP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+ was around 55 nmol/min/mg of protein, with the pH having only a slight effect whereasV max for Ca2+ transport was clearly affected by pH. The Ca2+/Pi coupling ratio at neutral pH was around 0.6. The coupling ratio decreased to 0.4 when measured at pH 6.0, and complete uncoupling was observed at pH 8.0.Table IEffect of pH on the SR Ca2+-ATPase performance in the presence of pNPP and Ca2+pHHydrolysisTransportCa2+/PicouplingKmVmaxKmVmax61.852.31.020.80.471.956.51.832.50.683.151.2NMaNM, not measurable (negligible transport).NM0.0Kinetic parameters and coupling values were obtained from the data shown in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters and coupling values were obtained from the data shown in Fig. 1. K m and V maxunits are mm and nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Free Ca2+ in the lumen affects to the enzyme coupling ratio when ATP is the substrate (28Weber A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 57: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura Y. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3090-3097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, this parameter was also checked. We selected a reaction medium at pH 7.0 containing 20 mm Mg2+, 50 μm free Ca2+, and 10 mm pNPP that was equilibrated with different concentrations of oxalate. The hydrolysis rate in the presence of Ca2+ displayed a small increase from 42 to 50 nmol/min/mg of protein when the oxalate concentration was raised from 0 to 5 mm (Fig. 2 A). The rate of Ca2+ transport increased as oxalate concentration was raised in the millimolar range, displaying a sigmoidal dependence (Fig. 2 B). The rate was negligible in the absence of precipitating anion, whereas maximal values of 31 nmol of Ca2+/min/mg of protein were obtained in the presence of 5 mm oxalate. The catalytic properties of the enzyme are sensitive to the presence of Me2SO (30The R. Hasselbach W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5481-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); therefore, we evaluated the organic solvent effect in the standard reaction medium at pH 7.0 containing 50 μm free Ca2+, 10 mm pNPP, and native SR vesicles. The pNPP hydrolysis rate in the presence of Ca2+ increased when the organic solvent concentration was raised. Maximal activity was observed at 20% Me2SO, whereas a further increase in the solvent concentration up to 40% induced a progressive decrease in the hydrolysis rate (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the hydrolysis rate measured in the absence of Ca2+ increased progressively as the Me2SO concentration was raised. Furthermore, maximal Ca2+ transport rates were observed in the presence of 10% Me2SO and higher solvent concentrations decreased the transport activity, tending to the zero value (Fig. 3 B). The dependence of pNPP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+ and that of Ca2+ transport on the Me2SO concentration did not show the same profile. Possible effects of Me2SO on SR vesicle permeability (i.e. in Ca2+ transport measurements) were ruled out experimentally using 45Ca2+-loaded vesicles. An active loading was started by adding 10 mmpNPP to the standard reaction medium and stopped after 6 min by adding 5 μm TG. The 45Ca2+ load was ∼170 nmol/mg of protein, and a subsequent addition of 40% Me2SO had no effect on the Ca2+ content retained by the vesicles (data not shown). Vanadate is known to interact with the enzyme conformation in the absence of Ca2+ by acting as a Pi analog (32Dupont Y. Bennett N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reaction medium was at pH 7.0 and contained 20 mmMg2+, 1 mm EGTA (i.e. absence of Ca2+), 10 mm pNPP, and 5 mmoxalate, the hydrolysis of pNPP by native SR vesicles was completely inhibited by ∼20 μm vanadate (Fig.4). The inhibition profile in the absence of Ca2+ was exactly the same when a preparation of purified Ca2+-ATPase was used. Nevertheless, the pNPP hydrolysis rate in a medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+and leaky vesicles required ∼100 μm vanadate to induce complete inhibition. A partial inhibition of 45% was observed in the presence of 100 μm vanadate when A23187 was removed (i.e. when intact vesicles were used) and oxalate was included. Similar experiments using SR vesicles were performed at pH 6.0 (Fig.5 A). In the absence of Ca2+, complete inhibition of the pNPP hydrolysis was now observed in the presence of ∼50 μm vanadate. Interestingly, the hydrolysis rate in a Ca2+-containing medium and A23187 (leaky vesicles) displayed the same dependence on vanadate concentration. However, when the enzyme activity was measured in the presence of extravesicular Ca2+ and oxalate (intact vesicles), the sensitivity to vanadate was lower. A vanadate concentration of 100 μm induced a 60% inhibition of the pNPP hydrolysis rate. Fig. 5 B shows the sensitivity to vanadate when measured at pH 8.0. The enzymatic activity of SR vesicles in the absence of Ca2+ was completely inhibited by 10 μmvanadate. Likewise, the pNPP hydrolysis rate measured in a Ca2+-containing medium and A23187 (leaky vesicles) was inhibited by 45% in the presence of 100 μm vanadate. The percentage of inhibition induced by 100 μm vanadate was only 32% when the Ca2+ ionophore was substituted for oxalate (intact vesicles). Fig. 6 shows the effect of lumenal Ca2+ on vanadate sensitivity. The lumenal free Ca2+ was manipulated by modifying the initial concentration of oxalate added (34Wells K.M. Abercrombie R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5020-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the standard reaction medium at pH 7.0 containing 20 mm Mg2+ and 50 μmfree Ca2+ in the external medium was equilibrated with either 0.5 or 5 mm oxalate before the addition of 10 mm pNPP. Intact vesicles and an oxalate concentration of 5 mm, i.e. a low free Ca2+ in the lumen, displayed low sensitivity to vanadate. As a reference, 100 μm vanadate produced a 45% inhibition of the enzyme activity. When the oxalate concentration was cut to 0.5 mmto increase the free Ca2+ in the lumen, there was a further decrease in vanadate sensitivity. In this case, 100 μmvanadate induced a 35% inhibition of the pNPP hydrolysis rate. The Me2SO effect on the enzyme activity was also analyzed by studying vanadate sensitivity (Fig.7). In one case, the reaction medium at pH 7.0 and in the absence of Ca2+ was supplemented with 40% Me2SO and the reaction was started by adding 10 mm pNPP. The inhibition of pNPP hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+ showed a hyperbolic dependence with respect to vanadate reaching an asymptotic level at ∼50 μmvanadate. In the other case, the reaction medium contained 50 μm free Ca2+, 5 mm oxalate and was also supplemented with 40% Me2SO. The inhibition of the enzyme activity in the presence of Ca2+ showed the same vanadate dependence observed in the absence of Ca2+. A key question is to know whether or not Ca2+-ATPase is able to hydrolyze pNPP in the absence of Ca2+. The hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and the effect of TG on these activities were measured using a preparation of purified enzyme. Under these conditions, any hydrolytic activity should be attributed to the Ca2+-ATPase protein. Fig. 8(panels A–C) show data obtained at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. The rate of pNPP hydrolysis at pH 6.0, in the presence of 10 mm pNPP and in the absence of Ca2+ was 11.0 nmol/min/mg protein. This value decreased to 7.7 nmol/min/mg of protein when measured at pH 7.0 and was 2.7 nmol/min/mg of protein at pH 8.0. The corresponding hydrolytic activities measured in the presence of 50 μm free Ca2+ and 10 mm pNPP were 45.7, 62.0, and 42.0 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Therefore, the activating effect of Ca2+ on the pNPP hydrolysis rate increased from 4.2-fold at pH 6.0, to 8.0-fold at pH 7.0 and 15.5-fold at pH 8.0. In any case, the addition of TG to the enzyme in the presence of Ca2+gave the corresponding activity values measured in the absence of Ca2+. Moreover, TG had no effect on the pNPP hydrolysis rate measured in the absence of Ca2+. Data obtained at neutral pH and in the presence of 40% Me2SO (Fig. 8,panel D) show that the enzyme activity in the presence or absence of Ca2+ had the same value and also that TG had the same effect on the rate of pNPP hydrolysis when Ca2+ is present or absent. The activation by Ca2+ or the inhibition by TG calculated as described (see Fig. 8 legend) are dependent on the experimental conditions, increasing from ∼4 to ∼15 as the pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0. Neither activation nor inhibition occurred (the factor is 1) in the presence of 40% Me2SO. The coupling efficiency of SR Ca2+-ATPase during the hydrolysis of pNPP is clearly dependent on pH (Fig. 1 and Table I). It is known that Ca2+ binding at equilibrium is a pH-dependent process involving different enzyme conformations and a sequential mechanism (35Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as follows. E2H3+↔E2H+↔E1↔E1Ca↔E1Ca2 REACTION1Therefore, acidic pH stabilizes the enzyme in the absence of Ca2+ (protonated E 2 conformation) and alkaline pH favors Ca2+ binding (E 1Ca2 conformation). The activating effect of Ca2+ on the pNPP hydrolysis rate in the purified enzyme is also pH-dependent and increases when the H+ concentration decreases (Fig. 8, A–C). This indicates that, under turnover conditions and acidic pH, the protonatedE 2 conformations will be more abundant, whereas the E 1 species will predominate at alkaline pH. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when a preparation of intact vesicles and an oxalate-containing medium were used (data not shown). The highest sensitivity to vanadate was observed during pNPP hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+ (Figs. 4 and 5). Higher vanadate concentrations were necessary to produce complete inhibition when the H+ concentration was raised. This is to be expected since the target species for vanadate, the protonatedE 2 forms, will be more abundant at acidic than at alkaline pH. Data obtained with a preparation of purified enzyme (Fig. 4) indicated that pNPP hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+ is associated with the catalytic activity of the Ca2+-ATPase protein and not with any other protein. The effect of vanadate in the presence of Ca2+ was also pH-dependent (Figs. 4 and 5). The hydrolysis of pNPP in leaky vesicles and in the presence of Ca2+ at pH 6.0 was highly sensitive to vanadate. The inhibition profile was the same for leaky vesicles in a Ca2+-containing medium as for intact vesicles in a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 5A). High sensitivity to vanadate is indicative of the predominant accumulation ofE 2 forms, especially when pNPP is the substrate. The non-nucleotide substrate does not prevent vanadate binding and inhibition, as occurs with mm ATP (33Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Medda P. Hasselbach W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, the degree of activation by Ca2+ and inhibition by TG in a preparation of purified enzyme was low (Fig. 8 A). TG selectively inhibits the Ca2+-dependent activity (17Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so high inhibition by TG indicates the predominant accumulation of E 1 forms, whereas low TG inhibition is indicative of a low accumulation ofE 1 or what is the same, the predominant presence of E 2 forms. Enzyme activity in leaky vesicles and in the presence of Ca2+ at pH 8.0 was clearly resistant to vanadate, the inhibition profile being very similar to that displayed by intact vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ and oxalate (Fig.5 B). The Ca2+ activation and TG inhibition factors at pH 8.0 were high (Fig. 8 C). These data suggest that E 1 forms will be the predominant species. Lumenal free Ca2+ has profound effects on coupling when the phosphorylating substrate is ATP (37Meltzer S. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4244-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Yu X Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but not when the phosphorylating substrate is pNPP. The reaction cycle at neutral pH and in the presence of a low lumenal Ca2+ concentration was already highly uncoupled (coupling ratio = 0.6), and the sensitivity to vanadate was relatively low. An increase in internal free Ca2+ produced complete uncoupling and slightly decreased the sensitivity to vanadate. Uncoupling throughE 1 forms induced by lumenal Ca2+ has already been characterized when the phosphorylating substrate is UTP (39Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The rate of pNPP hydrolysis had the same value in the presence or absence of Ca2+ when Me2SO is 40% (Fig.3 A). In other words, Ca2+ does not activate pNPP hydrolysis in a medium containing 40% Me2SO. These are conditions of complete uncoupling (Fig. 3 B), and we confirmed that Me2SO does not alter membrane permeability (data not shown). This lack of Ca2+ activation is associated with a high sensitivity to vanadate, and was the same whether pNPP hydrolysis was measured in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7). In addition, pNPP hydrolysis in the presence of Ca2+ and using purified enzyme was insensitive to TG inhibition (Fig. 8 D). These observations can be explained if Me2SO favors the reaction cycle in the absence of Ca2+ even when Ca2+ is present. It suggests that one sole catalytic route involving E 2 forms can be forced when the Me2SO concentration is high enough. The activation by Ca2+ and inhibition by TG in a preparation of purified enzyme had different absolute values, but, for each experimental condition tested, the activation and inhibition factors had the same value (Fig. 8). We know that TG produces stabilization of the E 2 conformation (18Wictome M. Michelangeli F. Lee A.G. East J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, TG inhibits the Ca2+-dependent activity and allows the hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of Ca2+through E 2 forms. This points to the existence of a relationship between the Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent activities measured in SR vesicles and suggests that both hydrolytic activities are related to the Ca2+-ATPase protein. It has been reported that SR Ca2+-ATPase is phosphorylated by and/or hydrolyzes ATP (40Carvalho-Alves P.C. Scofano H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), UTP (39Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), or even the non-nucleotide substrate furylacryloylphosphate (41Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Nakamoto R. de Meis L. Bernhard S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6040-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a Ca2+-free medium. In the case of pNPP, the rate of phosphorylation, which is much lower than that by ATP (25Nakamura Y. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), does not allow the accumulation of phosphorylated intermediate during the enzyme turnover. The rates of Ca2+ binding in the presence of pNPP and phosphorylation by pNPP in the absence of Ca2+ must be of similar magnitude in contrast to those observed when ATP is the substrate. This explains why pNPP hydrolysis in a Ca2+-containing medium can partly occur through E 2 forms. In conclusion, the low efficiency of Ca2+ transport sustained by pNPP may be attributed to the coexistence of one coupled (E 1-E 2 cycle) and two uncoupled routes (E 1 cycle andE 2 cycle), as depicted in SchemeFSI. This means that: (i) alkaline pH favors the operation of the E 1 cycle, whereas acidic pH potentiates the E 2 cycle; (ii) uncoupling through the E 1 cycle is favored by the integrity of the vesicles and occurs even when the free Ca2+ in the lumen is low; and (iii) pNPP can be hydrolyzed through the E 2 cycle even in a Ca2+-containing medium. This study confirms that the catalytic cycle of P-type ATPases does not follow a rigid sequence of reactions and is consistent with the existence of one sole energy transduction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2077653663,"Abstract We coexpressed Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus G protein-coupled receptors (KSHV-GPCRs) with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors or m1-muscarinic-cholinergic receptors in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian cells. In oocytes, KSHV-GPCR expression resulted in pronounced (81%) inhibition (heterologous desensitization) of Ca2+-activated chloride current responses to TRH and acetylcholine. Similar inhibitions of cytoplasmic free Ca2+responses to TRH were observed in human embryonic kidney HEK 293 EM cells and in mouse pituitary AtT20 cells. Further study of oocytes showed that this inhibition was partially reversed by interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), an inverse agonist of KSHV-GPCR. The basal rate of 45Ca2+ efflux in oocytes expressing KSHV-GPCRs was 4.4 times greater than in control oocytes, and IP-10 rapidly inhibited increased45Ca2+ efflux. In the absence of IP-10, growth-related oncogene α caused a further 2-fold increase in45Ca2+ efflux. In KSHV-GPCR-expressing oocytes, responses to microinjected inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were inhibited by 74%, and this effect was partially reversed by interferon-γ-inducible protein 10. Treatment with thapsigargin suggested that the pool of calcium available for mobilization by TRH was decreased in oocytes coexpressing KSHV-GPCRs. These results suggest that constitutive signaling by KSHV-GPCR causes heterologous desensitization of responses mediated by other receptors, which signal via the phosphoinositide/calcium pathway, which is caused by depletion of intracellular calcium pools."
