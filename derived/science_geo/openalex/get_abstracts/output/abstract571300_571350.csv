https://openalex.org/W2538723608,"A large percentage of redox-responsive gene promoters contain evolutionarily conserved guanine-rich clusters; guanines are the bases most susceptible to oxidative modification(s). Consequently, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the most abundant base lesions in promoters and is primarily repaired via the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OOG1)-initiated base excision repair pathway. In view of a prompt cellular response to oxidative challenge, we hypothesized that the 8-oxoG lesion and the cognate repair protein OGG1 are utilized in transcriptional gene activation. Here, we document TNFα-induced enrichment of both 8-oxoG and OGG1 in promoters of pro-inflammatory genes, which precedes interaction of NF-κB with its DNA-binding motif. OGG1 bound to 8-oxoG upstream from the NF-κB motif increased its DNA occupancy by promoting an on-rate of both homodimeric and heterodimeric forms of NF-κB. OGG1 depletion decreased both NF-κB binding and gene expression, whereas Nei-like glycosylase-1 and -2 had a marginal effect. These results are the first to document a novel paradigm wherein the DNA repair protein OGG1 bound to its substrate is coupled to DNA occupancy of NF-κB and functions in epigenetic regulation of gene expression."

The Alive & Thrive initiative aimed to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices through large-scale implementation of social and behavior change communication interventions in four regions of Ethiopia. The study assessed the effects of the interventions on IYCF practices and anthropometry over time in two regions–Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region and Tigray. A pre- and post-intervention adequacy evaluation design was used; repeated cross-sectional surveys of households with children aged 0–23.9 mo (n = 1481 and n = 1494) and with children aged 24–59.9 mo (n = 1481 and n = 1475) were conducted at baseline (2010) and endline (2014), respectively. Differences in outcomes over time were estimated using regression models, accounting for clustering and covariates. Plausibility analyses included tracing recall of key messages and promoted foods and dose-response analyses. We observed improvements in most WHO-recommended IYCF indicators. Early BF initiation and exclusive BF increased by 13.7 and 9.4 percentage points (pp), respectively. Differences for timely introduction of complementary foods, minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF), minimum acceptable diet (MAD), and consumption of iron-rich foods were 22.2, 3.3, 26.2, 3.5, and 2.7 pp, respectively. Timely introduction and intake of foods promoted by the interventions improved significantly, but anthropometric outcomes did not. We also observed a dose-response association between health post visits and early initiation of BF (OR: 1.8); higher numbers of home visits by community volunteers and key messages recalled were associated with 1.8–4.4 times greater odds of achieving MDD, MMF, and MAD, and higher numbers of radio spots heard were associated with 3 times greater odds of achieving MDD and MAD. The interventions were associated with plausible improvements in IYCF practices, but large gaps in improving children’s diets in Ethiopia remain, particularly during complementary feeding."

Bone loss is mitigated by bone protective therapies, but there is a clinical need for new bone-anabolic agents. Previous work has demonstrated that Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), a histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase, suppressed differentiation of osteogenic progenitors. Here, we investigated whether inhibition of Ezh2 can be leveraged for bone stimulatory applications. Pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA knockdown of Ezh2 enhanced osteogenic commitment of MC3T3 preosteoblasts. Next generation RNA sequencing of mRNAs and real time quantitative PCR profiling established that Ezh2 inactivation promotes expression of bone-related gene regulators and extracellular matrix proteins. Mechanistically, enhanced gene expression was linked to decreased H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) near transcriptional start sites in genome-wide sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitations assays. Administration of an Ezh2 inhibitor modestly increases bone density parameters of adult mice. Furthermore, Ezh2 inhibition also alleviated bone loss in an estrogen-deficient mammalian model for osteoporosis. Ezh2 inhibition enhanced expression of Wnt10b and Pth1r and increased the BMP-dependent phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Thus, these data suggest that inhibition of Ezh2 promotes paracrine signaling in osteoblasts and has bone-anabolic and osteoprotective potential in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2532412170,"In this study, we strove to substantiate the ability of linc-MAF-4 to act as a regulator of pathogenesis during multiple sclerosis (MS). We recruited 34 patients who were diagnosed with MS according to the revised McDonald criteria. Six patients with MS and 5 healthy volunteers contributed peripheral blood mononuclear cells for microarray analysis. Subsequent knockdown and overexpression of linc-MAF-4 in naive CD4+ T cells from the additional 28 patients with MS was performed to track changes in CD4+ T-cell subsets and their function, as well as to confirm results from the prior microarray analysis. Expression of linc-MAF-4 increased significantly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with MS compared with those of control participants. In addition, linc-MAF-4 regulated encephalitogenic T helper (Th)1-cell differentiation in patients with MS. Transfection of synthetic linc-MAF-4 into naive CD4+ T cells facilitated Th1-cell differentiation and inhibited Th2-cell differentiation by directly inhibiting MAF, which is a Th2-cell transcription factor. Linc-MAF-4 also promoted activation of CD4+ T cells from patients with MS. Expression level of linc-MAF-4 correlated with the annual relapse rate in patients with MS. Our results suggest that linc-MAF-4 is involved in the pathogenesis of MS, specifically via regulation of encephalitogenic T cells.-Zhang, F., Liu, G., Wei, C., Gao, C., Hao, J. Linc-MAF-4 regulates Th1/Th2 differentiation and is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis by targeting MAF."
https://openalex.org/W2533912097,"Lethal mutagenesis is an antiviral approach that consists in extinguishing a virus by an excess of mutations acquired during replication in the presence of a mutagen. Here we show that favipiravir (T-705) is a potent mutagenic agent for hepatitis C virus (HCV) during its replication in human hepatoma cells. T-705 leads to an excess of G → A and C → U transitions in the mutant spectrum of preextinction HCV populations. Infectivity decreased significantly in the presence of concentrations of T-705 which are 2- to 8-fold lower than its cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50). Passaging the virus five times in the presence of 400 μM T-705 resulted in virus extinction. Since T-705 has undergone advanced clinical trials for approval for human use, the results open a new approach based on lethal mutagenesis to treat hepatitis C virus infections. If proven effective for HCV in vivo, this new anti-HCV agent may be useful in patient groups that fail current therapeutic regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2535139911,"This study is aimed to assess the biodegradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and characterization of heavy metal resistance in three pure bacterial cultures and also their chemotactic response towards 2-aminopyrimidine. The bacterial cultures were isolated from pig manure, activated sludge and sediment samples, by enrichment technique on SDZ (6 mg L-1). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the microorganisms were identified within the genera of Paracoccus, Methylobacterium and Kribbella, which were further designated as SDZ-PM2-BSH30, SDZ-W2-SJ40 and SDZ-3S-SCL47. The three identified pure bacterial strains degraded up to 50.0, 55.2 and 60.0% of SDZ (5 mg L-1), respectively within 290 h. On the basis of quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography, 2-aminopyrimidine and 4-hydroxy-2-aminopyrimidine were identified as the main intermediates of SDZ biodegradation. These bacteria were also able to degrade the metabolite, 2-aminopyrimidine, of the SDZ. Furthermore, SDZ-PM2-BSH30, SDZ-W2-SJ40 and SDZ-3S-SCL47 also showed resistance to various heavy metals like copper, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, nickel and zinc. Additionally, all three bacteria exhibited positive chemotaxis towards 2-aminopyrimidine based on the drop plate method and capillary assay. The results of this study advanced our understanding about the microbial degradation of SDZ, which would be useful towards the future SDZ removal in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2532713663,"Ferritin molecular cages are marvelous 24-mer supramolecular architectures that enable massive iron storage (>2000 iron atoms) within their inner cavity. This cavity is connected to the outer environment by two channels at C3 and C4 symmetry axes of the assembly. Ferritins can also be exploited as carriers for in vivo imaging and therapeutic applications, owing to their capability to effectively protect synthetic non-endogenous agents within the cage cavity and deliver them to targeted tissue cells without stimulating adverse immune responses. Recently, X-ray crystal structures of Fe2+-loaded ferritins provided important information on the pathways followed by iron ions toward the ferritin cavity and the catalytic centers within the protein. However, the specific mechanisms enabling Fe2+ uptake through wild-type and mutant ferritin channels is largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we report extensive molecular dynamics simulations, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic measurements that characterize the transport properties and translocation mechanism of Fe2+ through the two ferritin channels, using the wild-type bullfrog Rana catesbeiana H′ protein and some of its variants as case studies. We describe the structural features that determine Fe2+ translocation with atomistic detail, and we propose a putative mechanism for Fe2+ transport through the channel at the C3 symmetry axis, which is the only iron-permeable channel in vertebrate ferritins. Our findings have important implications for understanding how ion permeation occurs, and further how it may be controlled via purposely engineered channels for novel biomedical applications based on ferritin."
https://openalex.org/W2529384370,"Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a systemic amyloidosis mainly caused by amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR). This incurable disease causes death ∼10 years after onset. Although it has been widely accepted that conformational change of the monomeric form of transthyretin (TTR) is very important for amyloid formation and deposition in the organs, no effective therapy targeting this step is available. In this study, we generated a mouse monoclonal antibody, T24, that recognized the cryptic epitope of conformationally changed TTR. T24 inhibited TTR accumulation in FAP model rats, which expressed human ATTR V30M in various tissues and exhibited non-fibrillar deposits of ATTR in the gastrointestinal tracts. Additionally, humanized T24 (RT24) inhibited TTR fibrillation and promoted macrophage phagocytosis of aggregated TTR. This antibody did not recognize normal serum TTR functioning properly in the blood. These results demonstrate that RT24 would be an effective novel therapeutic antibody for FAP."
https://openalex.org/W2534206460,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a well-characterized plant hormone, known to mediate developmental aspects as well as both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Notably, the exogenous application of ABA has recently been shown to increase susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum, the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and other cereals. However roles and mechanisms associated with ABA's modulation of pathogen responses remain enigmatic. Here the identification of putative ABA receptors from available genomic databases for Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) and Brachypodium distachyon (a model cereal) are reported. A number of these were cloned for recombinant expression and their functionality as ABA receptors confirmed by in vitro assays against protein phosphatases Type 2Cs. Ligand selectivity profiling of one of the wheat receptors (Ta_PYL2DS_FL) highlighted unique activities compared to Arabidopsis AtPYL5. Mutagenic analysis showed Ta_PYL2DS_FL amino acid D180 as being a critical contributor to this selectivity. Subsequently, a virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach was used to knockdown wheat Ta_PYL4AS_A (and similar) in planta, yielding plants with increased early stage resistance to FHB progression and decreased mycotoxin accumulation. Together these results confirm the existence of a family of ABA receptors in wheat and Brachypodium and present insight into factors modulating receptor function at the molecular level. That knockdown of Ta_PYL4AS_A (and similar) leads to early stage FHB resistance highlights novel targets for investigation in the future development of disease resistant crops."
https://openalex.org/W2536706142,"The plasmalemmal monoamine transporters clear the extracellular space from their cognate substrates and sustain cellular monoamine stores even during neuronal activity. In some instances, however, the transporters enter a substrate-exchange mode, which results in release of intracellular substrate. Understanding what determines the switch between these two transport modes demands time-resolved measurements of intracellular (co-)substrate binding and release. Here, we report an electrophysiological investigation of intracellular solute-binding to the human serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in HEK-293 cells. We measured currents induced by rapid application of serotonin employing varying intracellular (co-)substrate concentrations and interpreted the data using kinetic modeling. Our measurements revealed that the induction of the substrate-exchange mode depends on both voltage and intracellular Na+ concentrations because intracellular Na+ release occurs before serotonin release and is highly electrogenic. This voltage dependence was blunted by electrogenic binding of intracellular K+ and, notably, also H+. In addition, our data suggest that Cl− is bound to SERT during the entire catalytic cycle. Our experiments, therefore, document an essential role of electrogenic binding of K+ or of H+ to the inward-facing conformation of SERT in (i) cancelling out the electrogenic nature of intracellular Na+ release and (ii) in selecting the forward-transport over the substrate-exchange mode. Finally, the kinetics of intracellular Na+ release and K+ (or H+) binding result in a voltage-independent rate-limiting step where SERT may return to the outward-facing state in a KCl- or HCl-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W2536738845,"Over the past decade, the free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano has been successfully used in many areas of biology, including embryology, stem cells, sexual selection, bioadhesion and aging. The increased use of this powerful laboratory model, including the establishment of genomic resources and tools, makes it essential to have a detailed description of the chromosome organization of this species, previously suggested to have a karyotype with 2n = 8 and one pair of large and three pairs of small metacentric chromosomes. We performed cytogenetic analyses for chromosomes of one commonly used inbred line of M. lignano (called DV1) and uncovered unexpected chromosome number variation in the form of aneuploidies of the largest chromosomes. These results prompted us to perform karyotypic studies in individual specimens of this and other lines of M. lignano reared under laboratory conditions, as well as in freshly field-collected specimens from different natural populations. Our analyses revealed a high frequency of aneuploids and in some cases other numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities in laboratory-reared lines of M. lignano, and some cases of aneuploidy were also found in freshly field-collected specimens. Moreover, karyological analyses were performed in specimens of three further species: Macrostomum sp. 8 (a close relative of M. lignano), M. spirale and M. hystrix. Macrostomum sp. 8 showed a karyotype that was similar to that of M. lignano, with tetrasomy for its largest chromosome being the most common karyotype, while the other two species showed a simpler karyotype that is more typical of the genus Macrostomum. These findings suggest that M. lignano and Macrostomum sp. 8 can be used as new models for studying processes of partial genome duplication in genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2535718125,"The sirtuin family of proteins catalyze the NAD+-dependent deacylation of acyl-lysine residues. Humans encode seven sirtuins (Sirt1-7), and recent studies have suggested that post-translational modification of Sirt1 by cysteine S-nitrosation correlates with increased acetylation of Sirt1 deacetylase substrates. However, the mechanism of Sirt1 inhibition by S-nitrosation was unknown. Here, we show that Sirt1 is transnitrosated and inhibited by the physiologically relevant nitrosothiol S-nitrosoglutathione. Steady-state kinetic analyses and binding assays were consistent with Sirt1 S-nitrosation inhibiting binding of both the NAD+ and acetyl-lysine substrates. Sirt1 S-nitrosation correlated with Zn2+ release from the conserved sirtuin Zn2+-tetrathiolate and a loss of α-helical structure without overall thermal destabilization of the enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Zn2+ loss due to Sirt1 S-nitrosation results in repositioning of the tetrathiolate subdomain away from the rest of the catalytic domain, thereby disrupting the NAD+ and acetyl-lysine-binding sites. Sirt1 S-nitrosation was reversed upon exposure to the thiol-based reducing agents, including physiologically relevant concentrations of the cellular reducing agent glutathione. Reversal of S-nitrosation resulted in full restoration of Sirt1 activity only in the presence of Zn2+, consistent with S-nitrosation of the Zn2+-tetrathiolate as the primary source of Sirt1 inhibition upon S-nitrosoglutathione treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2536475271,"Land application of swine manure in commercial hog farms is an integral part of their waste management system which recycles the nutrients back to the soil. However, manure application can lead to the dissemination of bacterial pathogens in the environment and pose a serious public health threat. The aim of this study was to determine the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella in the environment due to manure application in commercial swine farms in North Carolina (n = 6) and Iowa (n = 7), two leading pork producing states in the US. We collected manure and soil samples twice on day 0 (before and after manure application) from four distinct plots of lands (5 soil samples/plot) located at 20 feet away from each other in the field. Subsequent soil samples were collected again on days 7, 14, 21 from the same plots. A total of 1,300 soil samples (NC = 600; IA = 700) and 130 manure samples (NC = 60; IA = 70) were collected and analyzed in this study. The overall Salmonella prevalence was 13.22% (189/1,430), represented by 10.69% and 38.46% prevalence in soil and manure, respectively. The prevalence in NC (25.45%) was significantly higher than in IA (2.73%) (P<0.001) and a consistent decrease in Salmonella prevalence was detected from Day 0-Day 21 in all the farms that tested positive. Salmonella serotypes detected in NC were not detected in IA, thereby highlighting serotype association based on manure storage and soil application method used in the two regions. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by the broth microdilution method to a panel of 15 antimicrobial drugs. A high frequency of isolates (58.73%) were multidrug resistant (resistance to three or more class of antimicrobials) and the most frequent resistance was detected against streptomycin (88.36%), sulfisoxazole (67.2%), and tetracycline (57.67%). Genotypic characterization by pulse field gel electrophoresis revealed clonally related Salmonella in both manure and soil at multiple time points in the positive farms. Our study highlights the potential role of swine manure application in the dissemination and persistence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2533684507,"This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between primary and secondary oral health care in Brazil. For this purpose, data from the National Program for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care were used. Dentists from 12,403 oral health teams (OHTs) answered a structured questionnaire in 2012. The data were analyzed descriptively and by cluster analysis. Of the 12,387 (99.9%) OHTs that answered all the questions, 62.2% reported the existence of Dental Specialties Centers (DSCs) to which they could refer patients. The specialties with the highest frequencies were endodontics (68.4%), minor oral surgery (65.8%), periodontics (63.0%), radiology (46.8%), oral medicine (40.2%), orthodontics (20.5%) and implantology (6.2%). In all percentiles, the shortest wait time for secondary care was for radiology, followed by oral medicine and the other specialties. In the 50th percentile, the wait for endodontics, periodontics, minor oral surgery and orthodontics was 30 days, while for implantology, the wait was 60 days. Finally, in the 75th percentile, the wait for endodontics, orthodontics and implantology was 90 days or more. Two clusters, with different frequencies of OHT access to specialties, were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 7,913) included the OHTs with lower frequencies in all specialties except orthodontics and implantology compared with Cluster 2 (n = 4,474). Of the Brazilian regions, the South and Southeast regions had the highest frequencies for Cluster 2, with better rates for the relationship between primary and secondary care. This study suggests certain difficulties in the relationship between primary and secondary care in specific specialties in oral health, with a great number of OHTs with limited access to DSCs, in addition to different performance in terms of OHT access to DSCs across Brazilian regions."
https://openalex.org/W2558997250,"We previously reported that delivery of a microRNA-138 mimic or siRNA against SIN3A to cultured cystic fibrosis (ΔF508/ΔF508) airway epithelia partially restored ΔF508-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated cAMP-stimulated Cl− conductance. We hypothesized that dissecting this microRNA-138/SIN3A-regulated gene network would identify individual proteins contributing to the rescue of ΔF508-CFTR function. Among the genes in the network, we rigorously validated candidates using functional CFTR maturation and electrolyte transport assays in polarized airway epithelia. We found that depletion of the ubiquitin ligase SYVN1, the ubiquitin/proteasome system regulator NEDD8, or the F-box protein FBXO2 partially restored ΔF508-CFTR-mediated Cl− transport in primary cultures of human cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. Moreover, knockdown of SYVN1, NEDD8, or FBXO2 in combination with corrector compound 18 further potentiated rescue of ΔF508-CFTR-mediated Cl− conductance. This study provides new knowledge of the CFTR biosynthetic pathway. It suggests that SYVN1 and FBXO2 represent two distinct multiprotein complexes that may degrade ΔF508-CFTR in airway epithelia and identifies a new role for NEDD8 in regulating ΔF508-CFTR ubiquitination."

https://openalex.org/W2538965960,"Accurate counts of animals are critical for prioritizing conservation efforts. Past research, however, suggests that observers on aerial surveys may fail to detect all individuals of the target species present in the survey area. Such errors could bias population estimates low and confound trend estimation. We used two approaches to assess the accuracy of aerial surveys for African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) in northern Botswana. First, we used double-observer sampling, in which two observers make observations on the same herds, to estimate detectability of elephants and determine what variables affect it. Second, we compared total counts, a complete survey of the entire study area, against sample counts, in which only a portion of the study area is sampled. Total counts are often considered a complete census, so comparing total counts against sample counts can help to determine if sample counts are underestimating elephant numbers. We estimated that observers detected only 76% ± SE of 2% of elephant herds and 87 ± 1% of individual elephants present in survey strips. Detectability increased strongly with elephant herd size. Out of the four observers used in total, one observer had a lower detection probability than the other three, and detectability was higher in the rear row of seats than the front. The habitat immediately adjacent to animals also affected detectability, with detection more likely in more open habitats. Total counts were not statistically distinguishable from sample counts. Because, however, the double-observer samples revealed that observers missed 13% of elephants, we conclude that total counts may be undercounting elephants as well. These results suggest that elephant population estimates from both sample and total counts are biased low. Because factors such as observer and habitat affected detectability of elephants, comparisons of elephant populations across time or space may be confounded. We encourage survey teams to incorporate detectability analysis in all aerial surveys for mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2533810592,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), also called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), converts arachidonic acid to PGH2. PGHS-2 is a conformational heterodimer composed of allosteric (Eallo) and catalytic (Ecat) subunits. Fatty acids (FAs) bind to Arg-120 of Eallo increasing to different degrees, depending on the FA, the Vmax of its Ecat partner. We report here that movement of helical residues 120–122 and loop residues 123–129 of Eallo underlies the allosteric effects of FAs and allosteric COX-2 inhibitors, including naproxen and flurbiprofen. An S121P substitution in both PGHS-2 monomers yields a variant (S121P/S121P PGHS-2) that has 1.7–1.8 times the Vmax of native PGHS-2 and is relatively insensitive to activation by FAs or inhibition by allosteric inhibitors. The S121P substitution in Eallo is primarily responsible for these effects. In X-ray crystal structures, the Cα atoms of helical residues 119–122 of S121P/S121P PGHS-2 are displaced from their normal positions. Additionally, the S121P/S121P PGHS-2 variants in which Pro-127 and Ser-541 are replaced by cysteines spontaneously forms Cys-127 to Cys-541 cross-links between monomers. This is unlike the corresponding native PGHS-2 variant and suggests that S121P substitutions also unhinge the loop involving residues 123–129. We conclude the following: (a) the region involving residues 120–129 of unoccupied Eallo tonically inhibits Ecat; (b) binding of an activating FA (e.g. arachidonic, palmitic, or oleic acid) to Eallo or an S121P substitution in Eallo repositions this region to increase Ecat activity; and (c) allosteric COX inhibitors act by preventing FA binding to Eallo and additionally by relocating Eallo residues to inhibit Ecat."

Larson T. et al.Acyl-lipid metabolism.The Arabidopsis Book. 2013; (10.1199/tab.0161)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast and other eukaryotic cells, the established pathways for PC biosynthesis are the CDP-choline pathway and the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation pathways. Once formed, the common pathway for PC turnover is the hydrolysis of acyl groups by phospholipases of the A or B type. Hydrolysis by an A type enzyme results in free fatty acid and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). The remaining acyl group of LPC can be hydrolyzed by phospholipases of the A or B type to yield free fatty acids and glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC). GPC is known to be catabolized to free choline and glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) (3.Cheng L. Bucciarelli B. Liu J. Zinn K. Miller S. Patton-Vogt J. Allan D. Shen J. Vance C.P.

Weiss S.B. The function of cytidine coenzymes in the biosynthesis of phospholipides.J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, direct acylation of GPC by an acyl-CoA-dependent activity was recently demonstrated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-free extracts and microsomal preparations (7.Stålberg K. Neal A.C. Ronne H. Ståhl U. Identification of a novel GPCAT activity and a new pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1794-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The putative enzyme carrying out the acylation of GPC was named GPC acyltransferase (GPCAT) (see Fig. 1). Recently, GPCAT activities were also demonstrated in microsomal preparations from developing seeds from different plant species as well as in Arabidopsis roots and shoots (8.Lager I. Glab B. Eriksson L. Chen G. Banas A. Stymne S. Novel reactions in acyl editing of phosphatidylcholine by lysophosphatidylcholine transacylase (LPCT) and acyl-CoA:glycerophosphocholine acyltransferase (GPCAT) activities in microsomal preparations of plant tissues.Planta. 2015; 241: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To a varying extent, the different microsomal preparations incorporated radioactive [14C]GPC into both LPC and PC even in the absence of acyl-CoA (8.Lager I. Glab B. Eriksson L. Chen G. Banas A. Stymne S. Novel reactions in acyl editing of phosphatidylcholine by lysophosphatidylcholine transacylase (LPCT) and acyl-CoA:glycerophosphocholine acyltransferase (GPCAT) activities in microsomal preparations of plant tissues.Planta. 2015; 241: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this work, we screened a yeast deletion library to identify the yeast gene encoding GPCAT, which we have termed GPC1. 3The yeast gene name GPC1 has been approved by the Saccharomyces genome database (SGD). By homology search, we have also identified GPCAT encoding genes from plant species. In addition, we report that not only can GPCAT enzymes utilize acyl-CoA to acylate GPC, but they can also catalyze the transacylation of acyl groups from LPC to GPC. The latter reaction explains the earlier reported incorporation of GPC into lipids in the absence of added acyl-CoA in assays with microsomal preparation from developing oil seeds (8.Lager I. Glab B. Eriksson L. Chen G. Banas A. Stymne S. Novel reactions in acyl editing of phosphatidylcholine by lysophosphatidylcholine transacylase (LPCT) and acyl-CoA:glycerophosphocholine acyltransferase (GPCAT) activities in microsomal preparations of plant tissues.Planta. 2015; 241: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The GPCAT does not show any significant homology to other known acyl transferases and constitutes an enzyme family on its own with homologues represented in major eukaryotic organism groups but absent in prokaryotes. A subset of the yeast knock-out collection was used to screen for the GPCAT-encoding gene. Only strains carrying deletions in genes with no known or putative function and with a size of at least 500 bp were included. This group contained ∼600 strains. Yeast extracts from the deletion strains were incubated with [14C]choline-labeled GPC, acyl-CoA and, as a control, [14C]G3P; the lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized on an Instant Imager electronic autoradiograph. In the reaction, the putative GPCAT utilized acyl-CoA to convert GPC to LPC, which was further acylated to PC by the endogenous Ale1p. G3P was added to the assay as an internal control to validate the quality of the yeast extract and to provide a ratio of G3P to GPC acylation activity for detecting decreased GPCAT activity. G3P is acylated to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by the enzymes Gat1p and Gat2p, and the formed LPA is converted to phosphatidic acid (PA) by Slc1p (Fig. 2A). We identified a deletion strain lacking GPCAT activity, but exhibiting G3P acylation after ∼200 screened strains, and the remaining strains were not screened (Fig. 2B). The identified strain bears a deletion in ORF YGR149W, here named GPC1, which is annotated as a putative protein of unknown function in the Saccharomyces Genome Database. The gene was amplified, cloned into a pYES-based yeast vector, and expressed in the identified deletion strain. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, GPC1 complemented the deletion strain. GPC1 contains only one defined domain of no known function (DUF2838) and has no known acyl binding domains. The S. cerevisiae GPCAT (ScGPCAT) or Gpc1p is a protein of 52 kDa that is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with eight transmembrane helices by the TMHMM server (9.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden Markov model: application to complete genomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2D) of a V5 epitope-tagged version of Gpc1p under the control of the GAL1 promoter (GAL1-GPC1-V5) reveals a protein of the expected molecular weight in cells grown in the presence of galactose. Database searches revealed a wide distribution of GPCAT homologues in eukaryotes with generally singletons or dual paralogs being present in each species analyzed (Fig. 3). No significant protein hits were found in prokaryotes, but homologues were found in major eukaryotic organism groups like fungi, animals, plants, algae, and several protist clades. However, homologues were not found in, for example, alveolates or heterokonts nor in animal subclades like chordates and arthropods. In the maximum likelihood tree (Fig. 3), proteins from animals, fungi, and Streptophyta (plants and Charophyta) grouped separately, as supported by significant bootstrap values. For other eukaryotes, basal resolution was not observed. Chlorophyta (green algae) separated into two groups, one of which was associated (bootstrap value of 90%) with Bodo saltans (a euglenozoa belonging to Excavata). Significant groups were also observed for some Amobozoa proteins. GPCAT was found present in all analyzed major groups of plants. However, the plant clade was characterized by displaying a very small sequence divergence as compared with other organism groups. The plant group revealed a significant group containing seed plants, separate from the moss Physcomitrella patens and the lycopod Selaginella moellendorffii. The monocot proteins were weakly associated (bootstrap value of 64%), but the major groups of other plants were not resolved. The ScGPCAT activities were assayed with [14C]GPC and non-radioactive 18:1-CoA in microsomal preparations from wild type (WT; BY4741), gpc1Δ, ale1Δ, and ale1Δ gpc1Δ yeast strains expressing GPC1 either under the control of the GAL1 promoter or transformed with empty vector (Fig. 4). In WT, the main radioactivity in lipids was found in PC (85%), and the remaining radioactivity was found in LPC. Membranes from ale1Δ transformed with empty vector incorporated about the same amount of total radioactivity into lipid as WT, but only 21% of the radioactivity was found in PC with the remaining activity in LPC, indicating that Ale1p is primarily responsible for LPC acylation. Membranes from gpc1Δ bearing empty vector did not incorporate radioactivity into lipids, whereas membranes from gpc1Δ cells expressing GPC1 incorporated about 30 times more radioactivity into lipids than WT. When GPCAT activity was measured in membranes from ale1Δ gpc1Δ harboring GPC1, the total radioactivity incorporated into lipid was reduced ∼25% as compared with the gpc1Δ background, and the activity now accumulated primarily in LPC (93%), demonstrating again that Ale1p is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of radioactive PC from LPC in these assays. The dependence of GPCAT activity on GPC concentration was determined in microsomal membranes prepared from ale1Δ gpc1Δ transformed with GAL1-GPC1 using 18:1-CoA as the acyl donor (Fig. 5A). The Km for GPC was found to be 0.45 mm with a Vmax of 87 nmol/min. The linearity of the reaction was tested with 18:1-CoA at optimal GPC concentration and was found to be essentially linear during 16 min of incubation under the incubation condition used (data not shown). The ScGPCAT accepted all of the acyl-CoA species tested with a preference for 16:0-CoA, polyunsaturated acyl-CoA, and the hydroxylated ricinoleoyl-CoA (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5.Biochemical characterization of Gpc1p.

The Arabidopsis GPCAT shows 25% protein sequence identity to the yeast GPCAT in a 340-residue conserved part from Asp24 to Ile362 in the A. thaliana sequence (Fig. 6). The three different plant GPCATs were expressed in the yeast gpc1Δale1Δ strain under the GAL1 promoter, and the results were compared with those obtained for ScGPCAT. The specific activity was highest with ScGPCAT (86 nmol/min/mg protein), whereas the plant GPCAT activities ranged from 32 to 52 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 7A). Microsomal preparations from castor bean seeds have high GPCAT activity (8.Lager I. Glab B. Eriksson L. Chen G. Banas A. Stymne S. Novel reactions in acyl editing of phosphatidylcholine by lysophosphatidylcholine transacylase (LPCT) and acyl-CoA:glycerophosphocholine acyltransferase (GPCAT) activities in microsomal preparations of plant tissues.Planta. 2015; 241: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the plant accumulates seed triacylglycerols with about 90% of the fatty acid being the hydroxy acid, ricinoleic acid. This fatty acid is synthesized by hydroxylation of oleoyl groups esterified to the sn-2 position of PC (10.Bafor M. Smith M.A. Jonsson L. Stobart K. Stymne S.

J. 1991; 280: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate the acyl-CoA specificity of the castor GPCAT. Like yeast GPCAT, the castor GPCAT accepted all of the acyl-CoAs tested, including ricinoleoyl-CoA (Fig. 7B), although with somewhat different acyl specificities as compared with the yeast enzyme.FIGURE 7.Enzyme activities of plant GPCATs.

The activity was measured as incorporation of 14C activity from [14C]choline-labeled GPC (4 mm) into chloroform-soluble lipids in the presence of 18:1-CoA (0.2 mm) by microsomal preparations (2 μg (A) and 4 μg (B) of protein) prepared from ale1Δ gpc1Δ yeast cells expressing the different GPCATs. Incubations with microsomes prepared from gpc1Δ transformed with empty vector gave no incorporation of radioactivity into the chloroform phase. Incubation time was 8 min (A) and 4 min (B). Data are given for triplicate assays ± S.D. (error bars). Of the 14C activity incorporated in lipids, 98–99% was recovered as lysophosphatidylcholine, and 1–2% was recovered as phosphatidylcholine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stålberg et al. (7.Stålberg K. Neal A.C. Ronne H. Ståhl U. Identification of a novel GPCAT activity and a new pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1794-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that yeast also possessed acyl-CoA:GPE acyltransferase activity. To test whether this activity was catalyzed by ScGPCAT, we performed assays with [14C]GPE and 18:1 acyl-CoA in microsomal preparations of ale1Δ gpc1Δ strain transformed with GPC1 or empty vector (Fig. 8). No incorporation of radioactivity into lipids was seen with empty vector, but upon expression of GPC1, radioactive lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) accumulated, albeit at about 25% of the amount of LPC formed when [14C]GPC was provided. Thus, Gpc1p also catalyzes the acylation of GPE with acyl-CoA. The incorporation of [14C]choline-labeled GPC into lipid in the absence of exogenous acyl-CoA was assayed in yeast membranes (Fig. 9). Membranes from gpc1Δ did not incorporate any radioactivity into lipids, whereas the WT and the gpc1Δ transformed with pGAL-GPC1 incorporated a similar amount of radioactivity into both LPC and PC. The lack of Ale1p had little or no effect on the incorporation of radioactivity into LPC or PC (Fig. 9). These experiments indicate that GPCAT is responsible for the production of radioactive LPC from [14C]GPC in the absence of exogenous acyl-CoA and that the second acylation step, the acylation of LPC to PC, is independent of Ale1p activity in the absence of exogenous acyl-CoA. Although GPCAT activity was essential for incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]GPC into lipids in the absence of acyl-CoA, its activity did not appear to be a rate-limiting factor in WT because the WT and GPC1-overexpressing strain incorporated similar amounts of radioactivity into lipids. A time course of incorporation of [14C]GPC into lipids in the absence of added acyl-CoA was performed with membranes from ale1Δ gpc1Δ cells transformed with ScGPCAT or RcGPCAT. The two enzymes gave similar incorporation patterns (Fig. 10).FIGURE 10.Transacylation activity of GPCAT over time. Shown is time course incorporation of 14C activity from [14C]choline-labeled GPC (4 mm) into LPC in incubations in the absence of added acyl-CoA by microsomal preparations (40 μg of protein) prepared from yeast ale1Δ gpc1Δ cells overexpressing ScGPCAT (GPC1) (A) or castor bean GPCAT (RcGPCAT) (B). The enzyme rates for ScGPCAT and RcGPCAT in the absence of acyl-CoA were 0.45 and 0.23 nmol/min/mg, respectively, during the first 15 min. Corresponding incubations with microsomes prepared from the gpc1Δale1Δ strain transformed with empty vector gave no incorporation of radioactivity into the chloroform phase, indicated with a star at 90 min of incubation in the graph (A). Data are given for triplicate assays ± S.D. (error bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternative mechanisms could explain the observed incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]choline-GPC into LPC and PC. The simplest explanation is transfer of an acyl group from membrane lipids to the added GPC. Among possible acyl donors for such acylation, we tested non-radioactive LPC in combination with [14C]choline-labeled GPC and found that membranes derived from ale1Δgpc1Δ bearing GAL1-GPC1 rapidly formed radioactive LPC, whereas membranes from cells transformed with empty vector totally lacked this capacity (Fig. 11). When corresponding incubations were performed with membranes prepared from ale1Δ cells expressing EV (containing an endogenous GPC1 gene), radioactive LPC accumulated at about 10% of the rate that occurs when GPC1 is overexpressed with the GAL1-GPC1 plasmid (Fig. 11). This demonstrates that the transacylation rate is a function of the level of GPCAT activity when the LPC concentration is not rate-limiting, as it was in the experiment presented in FIGURE 9., FIGURE 10.. The rate of radioactivity appearing in LPC during the first 10 min with GAL1-GPC1 was as high as 9.5 nmol/min/mg protein, which is 11% of the acylation rate with 18:1-CoA at optimal GPC concentration with the same membranes. Apart from direct acyl transfer from added LPC, there could be other explanations for the formation of radioactive LPC in assays in which unlabeled LPC but no acyl-CoA had been provided. By adding non-radioactive ricinoleoyl-LPC, which could be separated from LPC with non-hydroxylated acyl groups by TLC, we demonstrated that the added [14C]glycerol-labeled GPC received 90% of its acyl groups from the added LPC (Fig. 12A). This experiment gave conclusive evidence that GPCAT catalyzed the transfer of acyl groups from added non-radioactive LPC to [14C]GPC, thus forming non-radioactive GPC and 14C-labeled LPC molecules.FIGURE 12.LPC as donor in transacylation activity.

When the radioactivity in the different PC molecular species was analyzed in incubations with added ricinoleoyl-LPC, species with one ricinoleoyl group had 96% of the activity, with the remainder being [14C]PC with no ricinoleoyl groups (Fig. 12B). These results show that the second acylation step is not using added ricinoleoyl-LPC in an LPC:LPC transacylase reaction but receives acyl groups from some other lipid(s). We investigated whether lysophospholipids other than LPC could serve as acyl donors for the acylation of GPC by Gpc1p (Fig. 13). LPE could donate acyl groups at about 25% of the efficiency with LPC. Incorporation of radioactivity into LPC from added lysophosphatidylserine was low but significantly higher than in the absence of added lysolipids, whereas no increase was seen with added lysophosphatidic acid (Fig. 13). In vivo radiolabeling experiments were performed to examine the role of Gpc1p-mediated GPC acylation in cellular PC biosynthesis. For these studies, the medium contained [3H]GPC and a low concentration of phosphate to induce transcription of the GIT1-encoded permease (11.Almaguer C. Cheng W. Nolder C. Patton-Vogt J.

Patton-Vogt J. Glycerophosphocholine-dependent growth requires Gde1p (YPL110c) and Git1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Following growth to logarithmic phase, cells were separated into membrane and TCA-extractable fractions, and the percentage of radioactivity in each fraction was determined. As shown in Fig. 14, loss of GPC1 (compare WT + empty vector (EV) with gpc1Δ + EV) resulted in less incorporation of [3H]GPC radioactivity into the membrane fraction and a concomitant increase in the intracellular fraction. Importantly, the gpc1Δ strain containing the GAL1-GPC1 plasmid displayed a distribution of radioactivity similar to WT. When GPC1 was overexpressed in the WT strain, there was no change in the distribution of counts as compared with WT containing empty vector. This suggests that expression of GPC1 from its single genomic copy, as occurs in the WT strain, is not rate-limiting for radioactive flux into the membrane fraction under these conditions. As expected, a gde1Δ mutant lacking the glycerophosphodiesterase responsible for GPC hydrolysis (see Fig. 1) (5.Fisher E. Almaguer C. Holic R. Griac P. Patton-Vogt J. Glycerophosphocholine-dependent growth requires Gde1p (YPL110c) and Git1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36110-36117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) exhibited a greater proportion of counts in the internal fraction as labeled GPC (Table 1) as compared with WT (compare WT + EV to gde1Δ + EV). In contrast to the WT strain, overexpression of GPC1 in gde1Δ did result in an increase in membrane counts and a decrease in intracellular counts as compared with the empty vector control. This suggests that in the presence of high intracellular levels of substrate (as engendered by loss of Gde1p), GPC1 expression from the single genomic copy is rate-limiting for incorporation of [14]GPC into membrane. In all cases, the radioactivity in the membrane fraction was found only in PC, suggesting that the LPC produced under these conditions is either rapidly converted to PC or deacylated back to GPC. The TCA-extractable fractions consisted of GPC and free choline (Table 1). These results confirm a cellular role for Gpc1p in the synthesis of PC via acylation of GPC.TABLE 1Values for intracellular percentages are derived from Fig. 14StrainCholineGPCIntracellular percentage%%%WT + EV142135WT + GAL1-GPC1112132gpc1Δ + EV23 ± 3.237 ± 2.160gpc1Δ + GAL1-GPC116 ± 425 ± 5.641gde1Δ + EV2 ± 0.282 ± 8.884gde1Δ + GAL1-GPC1′2 ± 0.367 ± 9.769 Open table in a new tab Stålberg et al.

https://openalex.org/W2534914339,"Soil acidity is a major constraint on plant productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi support plant colonization in acidic soil, but soil acidity also constrains fungal growth and diversity. Fungi in extreme environments generally evolve towards specialists, suggesting that AM fungi in acidic soil are acidic-soil specialists. In our previous surveys, however, some AM fungi detected in strongly acidic soils could also be detected in a soil with moderate pH, which raised a hypothesis that the fungi in acidic soils are pH generalists. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pH-manipulation experiment and also analyzed AM fungal distribution along a pH gradient in the field using a synthesized dataset of the previous and recent surveys. Rhizosphere soils of the generalist plant Miscanthus sinensis were collected both from a neutral soil and an acidic soil, and M. sinensis seedlings were grown at three different pH. For the analysis of field communities, rhizosphere soils of M. sinensis were collected from six field sites across Japan, which covered a soil pH range of 3.0-7.4, and subjected to soil trap culture. AM fungal community compositions were determined based on LSU rDNA sequences. In the pH-manipulation experiment the acidification of medium had a significant impact on the compositions of the community from the neutral soil, but the neutralization of the medium had no effect on those of the community from the acidic soil. Furthermore, the communities in lower -pH soils were subsets of (nested in) those in higher-pH soils. In the field communities a significant nestedness pattern was observed along the pH gradient. These observations suggest that the fungi in strongly acidic soils are pH generalists that occur not only in acidic soil but also in wide ranges of soil pH. Nestedness in AM fungal community along pH gradients may have important implications for plant community resilience and early primary succession after disturbance in acidic soils."

The aim of the current study is the functional analysis for systematic identification of S. lycopersicum ALDH gene superfamily. We performed genome-based ALDH genes identification and functional classification, phylogenetic relationship, structure and catalytic domains analysis, and microarray based gene expression. Twenty nine unique tomato ALDH sequences encoding 11 ALDH families were identified, including a unique member of the family 19 ALDH. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 13 groups, with a conserved relationship among ALDH families. Functional structure analysis of ALDH2 showed a catalytic mechanism involving Cys-Glu couple. However, the analysis of ALDH3 showed no functional gene duplication or potential neo-functionalities. Gene expression analysis reveals that particular ALDH genes might respond to wounding stress increasing the expression as ALDH2B7. Overall, this study reveals the complexity of S. lycopersicum ALDH gene superfamily and offers new insights into the structure-functional features and evolution of ALDH gene families in vascular plants. The functional characterization of ALDHs is valuable and promoting molecular breeding in tomato for the improvement of stress tolerance and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2533956363,"Cat's AB blood group system (blood types A, B, and AB) is of major importance in feline transfusion medicine. Type A and type B antigens are Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac, respectively, and the enzyme CMAH participating in the synthesis of Neu5Gc from Neu5Ac is associated with this cat blood group system. Rare type AB erythrocytes express both Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac. Cat serum contains naturally occurring antibodies against antigens occurring in the other blood types. To understand the molecular genetic basis of this blood group system, we investigated the distribution of AB blood group antigens, CMAH gene structure, mutation, diplotypes, and haplotypes of the cat CMAH genes. Blood-typing revealed that 734 of the cats analyzed type A (95.1%), 38 cats were type B (4.9%), and none were type AB. A family of three Ragdoll cats including two type AB cats and one type A was also used in this study. CMAH sequence analyses showed that the CMAH protein was generated from two mRNA isoforms differing in exon 1. Analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the 16 exons including the coding region of CMAH examined in the 34 type B cats and in the family of type AB cats carried the CMAH variants, and revealed multiple novel diplotypes comprising several polymorphisms. Haplotype inference, which was focused on non-synonymous SNPs revealed that eight haplotypes carried one to four mutations in CMAH, and all cats with type B (n = 34) and AB (n = 2) blood carried two alleles derived from the mutated CMAH gene. These results suggested that double haploids selected from multiple recessive alleles in the cat CMAH loci were highly associated with the expression of the Neu5Ac on erythrocyte membrane in types B and AB of the feline AB blood group system."

DNA microarray analysis revealed that the gene levels for cholesterol transport (LDL receptor and NPC2) as well as cholesterol biosynthesis (mevalonate pathway enzymes) are increased after exposure to 3 mm l-Nor for ∼6 h. Concomitant with this observation, the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, SREBP-2, is activated by l-Nor. The increase in cholesterol uptake as well as biosynthesis is not accompanied by an increase in cholesterol in the plasma membrane, but rather by aberrant accumulation in cytoplasmic compartments. We also found that cell death by l-Nor can be suppressed by nec-1s, an inhibitor of a regulated form of necrosis, necroptosis. Abrogation of SREBP-2 activation by the small molecule inhibitor betulin or by overexpression of dominant-negative SREBP-2 efficiently reduces cell death by l-Nor. The mobilization of cellular cholesterol in the presence of cyclodextrin also suppresses cell death. These results were also observed in primary culture of striatum neurons. Taken together, our results indicate that the excessive uptake as well as synthesis of cholesterol should underlie neuronal cell death by l-Nor exposure, and suggest a possible link between lysosomal cholesterol storage disorders and the regulated form of necrosis in neuronal cells."

To investigate how nucleosomes affect Cas9 cleavage at off-target sites in vitro, we used a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that has been previously shown to efficiently direct Cas9 cleavage at the edge of the strongly positioned 601 nucleosome. Our data indicate that single mismatches between the sgRNA and DNA target have relatively little effect on Cas9 cleavage of naked DNA substrates, but strongly inhibit cleavage of nucleosome substrates, particularly when the mismatch is in the sgRNA seed region. These findings indicate that nucleosomes may enhance Cas9 specificity by inhibiting cleavage of off-target sites at the nucleosome edge."
https://openalex.org/W2532148917,"Background Oxidative stress is a major cause of cardiovascular disease. Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) is an antioxidant that protects against oxidative stress. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variations such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or haplotypes within the SOD gene are reportedly associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. However, it remains to be determined whether SOD1 variability is associated with cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in the general population. Methods and Results This prospective cohort study included 2799 subjects who participated in a community-based health study with a 10-year follow-up. We genotyped 639 SNPs and found the association of SNP rs1041740 and rs17880487 within a SOD1 gene with cardiovascular mortality. There were 193 deaths during the follow-up period including 57 cardiovascular deaths. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that the homozygous T-allele of rs1041740 was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular deaths after adjusting for confounding factors. The net reclassification index was significantly improved by adding rs1041740 as a cardiovascular risk factor. On the other hand, cardiovascular death was not observed in homozygous T-allele carriers of rs17880487. Haplotype analysis identified the haplotype with T-allele of rs1041740 and that with T-allele of rs17880487 as increasing and decreasing susceptibility for cardiovascular mortality, and it had complementary SNP sequences. Conclusion Variation in the SOD1 gene was associated with cardiovascular deaths in the general population."

A hypothetical protein from P. luminescens was identified, purified from the native source, and characterized as an l-fucose-binding lectin, named P. luminescens lectin (PLL). Glycan array and biochemical characterization data revealed PLL to be specific toward l-fucose and the disaccharide glycan 3,6-O-Me2-Glcβ1–4(2,3-O-Me2)Rhaα-O-(p-C6H4)-OCH2CH2NH2. PLL was discovered to be a homotetramer with an intersubunit disulfide bridge. The crystal structures of native and recombinant PLL revealed a seven-bladed β-propeller fold creating seven putative fucose-binding sites per monomer. The crystal structure of the recombinant PLL·l-fucose complex confirmed that at least three sites were fucose-binding. Moreover, the crystal structures indicated that some of the other sites are masked either by the tetrameric nature of the lectin or by incorporation of the C terminus of the lectin into one of these sites.

https://openalex.org/W2535550104,"The lateral transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in linking the carbon cycles of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Neglecting the lateral flow of dissolved organic carbon can lead to an underestimation of the organic carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems. It is thus necessary to integrate DOC concentrations and flux into carbon cycle models, particularly with regard to the development of models that are intended to directly link terrestrial and ocean carbon cycles. However, to achieve this goal, more accurate information is needed to better understand and predict DOC dynamics. In this study, we compiled an inclusive database of available data collected from the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Pearl River in China. The database is collected based on online literature survey and analysed by statistic method. Overall, our results revealed a positive correlation between DOC flux and discharge in all three rivers, whereas the DOC concentration was more strongly correlated with the regional net primary productivity (NPP). We estimated the total DOC flux exported by the three rivers into the China Sea to be approximately 2.73 Tg yr-1. Specifically, the annual flux of DOC from the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Pearl River was estimated to be 1.85 Tg yr-1, 0.06 Tg yr-1 and 0.82 Tg yr-1, respectively, and the average annual DOC concentrations were estimated to be 2.24 ± 0.53 mg L-1, 2.70 ± 0.38 mg L-1 and 1.51 ± 0.09 mg L-1, respectively. Seasonal variations in DOC concentrations are greatly influenced by the interaction between temperature and precipitation. NPP is significantly and positively related to the DOC concentration in the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. In addition, differences in climate and the productivity of the vegetation may influence both the flux and concentrations of DOC transported by the rivers and thus potentially affect estuarine geochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2530496880,"Shroom-mediated remodeling of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is a critical driver of cellular shape and tissue morphology that underlies the development of many tissues including the neural tube, eye, intestines, and vasculature. Shroom uses a conserved SD2 domain to direct the subcellular localization of Rho-associated kinase (Rock), which in turn drives changes in the cytoskeleton and cellular morphology through its ability to phosphorylate and activate non-muscle myosin II. Here, we present the structure of the human Shroom-Rock binding module, revealing an unexpected stoichiometry for Shroom in which two Shroom SD2 domains bind independent surfaces on Rock. Mutation of interfacial residues impaired Shroom-Rock binding in vitro and resulted in altered remodeling of the cytoskeleton and loss of Shroom-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Additionally, we provide the first direct evidence that Shroom can function as a Rock activator. These data provide molecular insight into the Shroom-Rock interface and demonstrate that Shroom directly participates in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, adding to its known role in Rock localization."

https://openalex.org/W2537698654,"This study investigated the association between interpersonal conflicts and the trajectory of self-esteem from adolescence to mid-adulthood. The directionality of effects between self-esteem and interpersonal conflicts was also studied. Participants of a Finnish cohort study in 1983 at age 16 (N = 2194) were followed up at ages 22 (N = 1656), 32 (N = 1471) and 42 (N = 1334) using postal questionnaires. Measures covered self-esteem and interpersonal conflicts including, conflicts with parents, friends, colleagues, superiors, partners, break-ups with girl/boyfriends, and divorces. Participants were grouped using latent profile analysis to those having “consistently low”, “decreasing”, or “increasing” number of interpersonal conflicts from adolescence to adulthood. Analyses were done using latent growth curve models and autoregressive cross-lagged models. Among both females and males the self-esteem growth trajectory was most favorable in the group with a consistently low number of interpersonal conflicts. Compared to the low group, the group with a decreasing number of interpersonal conflicts had a self-esteem trajectory that started and remained at a lower level throughout the study period. The group with an increasing number of interpersonal conflicts had a significantly slower self-esteem growth rate compared to the other groups, and also the lowest self-esteem level at the end of the study period. Cross-lagged autoregressive models indicated small, but significant lagged effects from low self-esteem to later interpersonal conflicts, although only among males. There were no effects to the opposite direction among either gender. Our results show that those reporting more and an increasing number of interpersonal conflicts have a lower and more slowly developing self-esteem trajectory from adolescence to mid-adulthood. While the result was expected, it does not seem to imply an effect from interpersonal conflicts to low self-esteem. Rather, if anything, our results seem to suggest that those with low self-esteem are more prone to later interpersonal conflicts."
https://openalex.org/W2532300028,"Osteoclasts are giant bone-resorbing cells originating from monocytes/macrophages. During their differentiation, they overexpress two lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin K and TRAP, which are secreted into the resorption lacuna, an acidified sealed area in contact with bone matrix where bone degradation takes place. Here we report that the acid hydrolase HYAL1, a hyaluronidase able to degrade the glycosaminoglycans hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate, is also upregulated upon osteoclastogenesis. The mRNA expression and protein level of HYAL1 are markedly increased in osteoclasts differentiated from RAW264.7 mouse macrophages or primary mouse bone marrow monocytes compared to these precursor cells. As a result, the HYAL1-mediated HA hydrolysis ability of osteoclasts is strongly enhanced. Using subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate that HYAL1 proteins are sorted to the osteoclast lysosomes even though, in contrast to cathepsin K and TRAP, HYAL1 is poorly mannose 6-phosphorylated. We reported previously that macrophages secrete HYAL1 proforms by constitutive secretion, and that these are recaptured by the cell surface mannose receptor, processed in endosomes and sorted to lysosomes. Present work highlights that osteoclasts secrete HYAL1 in two ways, through lysosomal exocytosis and constitutive secretion, and that these cells promote the extracellular residency of HYAL1 through downregulation of the mannose receptor. Interestingly, the expression of the other main hyaluronidase, HYAL2, and of lysosomal exoglycosidases involved in HA degradation, does not increase similarly to HYAL1 upon osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, these findings point out the predominant involvement of HYAL1 in bone HA metabolism and perhaps bone remodeling via the resorption lacuna."
https://openalex.org/W2532548950,"Background Central obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes but many obese individuals never develop diabetes, suggesting the presence of important effect modifiers. Depression has emerged as a key risk factor for poor glycemic control, but to our knowledge, no previous work has investigated whether depression amplifies the effect of central obesity on glucoregulation. Methods and Findings We used a national sample of adults without prevalent diabetes (MIDUS; N = 919) to test for synergy between central obesity and depression in the development of diabetes 10 years later. We found that depression amplified the association of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with incident diabetes adjusted for age, race, gender, education, physical activity, and sleep problems (p = 0.01 for test of interaction). The relative risk for incident diabetes per every 0.1 increment in WHR was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.31; 2.33) in those without depression and 3.78 in those with depression (95% CI: 2.14; 6.66). Conclusions These results confirm the role of depression as a robust risk factor for the development of diabetes and for the first time, demonstrate a synergy between depression and central obesity. Identifying and addressing depression could prove to be an effective approach to preventing diabetes in at risk individuals. Ultimately, elucidating the interplay among risk factors from different domains will be key to understanding multifactorial diseases such as diabetes and informing theory-based, patient-centered interventions aimed at reducing diabetes risk."

A set of the F1, F2 and F2:3 populations from the cross of the resistant PI 672538 with the susceptible line L1034 were used to conduct genetic analysis of powdery mildew resistance and construct a high-density linkage map of the Pm40 gene. We constructed a high-density linkage genetic map with a total length of 6.18 cM and average spacing between markers of 0.48 cM.Pm40 is flanked by Xwmc335 and BF291338 at genetic distances of 0.58 cM and 0.26 cM, respectively, in deletion bin C-7BS-1-0.27. Comparative genomic analysis based on EST-STS markers established a high level of collinearity of the Pm40 genomic region with a 1.09-Mbp genomic region on Brachypodium chromosome 3, a 1.16-Mbp genomic region on rice chromosome 8, and a 1.62-Mbp genomic region on sorghum chromosome 7. We further anchored the Pm40 target intervals to the wheat genome sequence. A putative linear index of 85 wheat contigs containing 97 genes on 7BS was constructed. In total, 9 genes could be considered as candidates for the resistances to powdery mildew in the target genomic regions, which encoded proteins that were involved in the plant defense and response to pathogen attack. These results will facilitate the development of new markers for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection of Pm40 in wheat breeding programs."

Several trends were observed: influenza circulates throughout the year with two peaks; the major one from September to November and a minor one from March to June. The predominant strains of influenza varied over the years: Seasonal Influenza A(H3) virus was predominant from 2008 to 2009 and from 2012 to 2014; Influenza A(H1N1)pdm01 was dominant in 2010; and Influenza B virus was dominant in 2011. The peaks generally coincided with times of higher humidity, lower temperature, and higher rainfall.Influenza circulated throughout the year in Uganda with two major peaks of outbreaks with similar strains circulating elsewhere in the region.

https://openalex.org/W2538739303,"Myeloid-derived cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages are at the heart of the immune effector function in an inflammatory response. But because of the lack of an efficient imaging system to trace these cells live during their migration and maturation in their native environment at sub-cellular resolution, our knowledge is limited to data available from specific time-points analyzed by flow cytometry, histology, genomics and other immunological methods. Here, we have developed a ratiometric imaging method for measuring monocyte maturation in inflamed mouse lungs in situ using real-time using 2-photon imaging and complementary methods. We visualized that while undifferentiated monocytes were predominantly found only in the vasculature, a semi-differentiated monocyte/macrophage population could enter the tissue and resembled more mature and differentiated populations by morphology and surface phenotype. As these cells entered and differentiated, they were already selectively localized near inflamed airways and their entry was associated with changes in motility and morphology. We were able to visualize these during the act of differentiation, a process that can be demonstrated in this way to be faster on a per-cell basis under inflammatory conditions. Finally, our in situ analyses demonstrated increases, in the differentiating cells, for both antigen uptake and the ability to mediate interactions with T cells. This work, while largely confirming proposed models for in situ differentiation, provides important in situ data on the coordinated site-specific recruitment and differentiation of these cells and helps elaborate the predominance of immune pathology at the airways. Our novel imaging technology to trace immunogenic cell maturation in situ will complement existing information available on in situ differentiation deduced from other immunological methods, and assist better understanding of the spatio-temporal cellular behavior during an inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2538019201,"The biliary trematode Pseudamphistomum truncatum parasitizes a wide range of fish-eating mammals, including humans. Here we report the emergence of this parasite in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the Baltic Sea. One hundred eighty-three of 1 554 grey seals (11.9%) examined from 2002–2013 had detectable hepatobiliary trematode infection. Parasite identification was confirmed as P. truncatum by sequencing the ITS2 region of a pool of five to 10 trematodes from each of ten seals collected off the coast of seven different Swedish counties. The proportion of seals parasitized by P. truncatum increased significantly over time and with increasing age of seals. Males were 3.1 times more likely to be parasitized than females and animals killed in fishery interactions were less likely to be parasitized than animals found dead or hunted. There was no significant difference in parasitism of seals examined from the Gulf of Bothnia versus those examined from the Baltic Proper. Although the majority of infections were mild, P. truncatum can cause severe hepatobiliary disease and resulted in liver failure in at least one seal. Because cyprinid fish are the second intermediate host for opisthorchiid trematodes, diets of grey seals from the Baltic Sea were analysed regarding presence of cyprinids. The proportion of gastrointestinal tracts containing cyprinid remains was ten times higher in seals examined from 2008 to 2013 (12.2%) than those examined from 2002 to 2007 (1.2%) and coincided with a general increase of trematode parasitism in the host population. The emergence and relatively common occurrence of P. truncatum in grey seals signals the presence of this parasite in the Baltic Sea ecosystem and demonstrates how aquatic mammals can serve as excellent sentinels of marine ecosystem change. Investigation of drivers behind P. truncatum emergence and infection risk for other mammals, including humans, is highly warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2553634923,"HIV, type 1 overcomes host restriction factor apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) proteins by organizing an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex together with viral infectivity factor (Vif) and a host transcription cofactor core binding factor β (CBFβ). CBFβ is essential for Vif to counteract APOBEC3 by enabling the recruitment of cullin 5 to the complex and increasing the steady-state level of Vif protein; however, the mechanisms by which CBFβ up-regulates Vif protein remains unclear. Because we have reported previously that mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is an E3 ligase for Vif, we hypothesized that CBFβ might protect Vif from MDM2-mediated degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Vif mutants that do not bind to CBFβ preferentially interact with MDM2 and that overexpression of CBFβ disrupts the interaction between MDM2 and Vif. Knockdown of CBFβ reduced the steady-state level of Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells. Cycloheximide chase analyses revealed that Vif E88A/W89A, which does not interact with CBFβ, degraded faster than wild-type Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells, suggesting that Vif stabilization by CBFβ is mainly caused by impairing MDM2-mediated degradation. We identified Vif R93E as a Vif variant that does not bind to MDM2, and the virus with this substitution mutation was more resistant to APOBEC3G than the parental virus. Combinatory substitution of Vif residues required for CBFβ binding and MDM2 binding showed full recovery of Vif steady-state levels, supporting our hypothesis. Our data provide new insights into the mechanism of Vif augmentation by CBFβ."

Patients with suspected tuberculous pericarditis were enrolled consecutively between August 2011 and December 2015. T-SPOT.TB was performed on both pericardial effusion mononuclear cells (PEMCs)and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive value (PV), and likelihood ratio (LR) of T-SPOT.TB on PEMCs and PBMCs were analyzed. Among the 75 patients enrolled, 24 patients (32%) were diagnosed with tuberculous pericarditis, 38 patients (51%) with nontuberculous pericarditis, and 13 patients (17%) were clinically indeterminate and were excluded from the final analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive PV (PPV), negative PV (NPV), positive LR (LR+), and negative LR (LR-) of T-SPOT.TB on PEMCs was 92%,92%,88%,95%,11.61, and 0.09, respectively, compared to 83%, 95%, 91%, 90%,15.83, and 0.18, respectively of T-SPOT.TB on PBMCs. In patients with tuberculous pericarditis, the median frequencies of spot-forming cells (SFCs) of T-SPOT.TB on PEMCs and PBMCs was 172SFCs/106MCs (IQR 39~486), and 66 SFCs/106MCs (IQR 24~526), respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.183).

Personality is a stable form of behavioural diversity which has been observed in the aggregation process, but neither the reasons for its stability nor its effects on consensus decisions are well understood. By using an agent-based model of invertebrate aggregation, it is found that diverse personalities have only limited benefits to the experimental consensus decision-making process, but may have a more valuable role in natural settings. Importantly, although certain personalities may ostensibly have potential drawbacks at the individual level, such as choosing to rest in unfavourable places, all individuals are likely to benefit from maintaining a constant personality, which promotes group stability. These findings help to improve understanding of consensus decision-making and the prevalence of stable personality."
https://openalex.org/W2537570597,"Many features of mitochondrial genomes of animals, such as patterns of gene arrangement, nucleotide content and substitution rate variation are extensively used in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. Nearly 6,000 mitochondrial genomes of animals have already been sequenced, covering the majority of animal phyla. One of the groups that escaped mitogenome sequencing is phylum Kinorhyncha—an isolated taxon of microscopic worm-like ecdysozoans. The kinorhynchs are thought to be one of the early-branching lineages of Ecdysozoa, and their mitochondrial genomes may be important for resolving evolutionary relations between major animal taxa. Here we present the results of sequencing and analysis of mitochondrial genomes from two members of Kinorhyncha, Echinoderes svetlanae (Cyclorhagida) and Pycnophyes kielensis (Allomalorhagida). Their mitochondrial genomes are circular molecules approximately 15 Kbp in size. The kinorhynch mitochondrial gene sequences are highly divergent, which precludes accurate phylogenetic inference. The mitogenomes of both species encode a typical metazoan complement of 37 genes, which are all positioned on the major strand, but the gene order is distinct and unique among Ecdysozoa or animals as a whole. We predict four types of start codons for protein-coding genes in E. svetlanae and five in P. kielensis with a consensus DTD in single letter code. The mitochondrial genomes of E. svetlanae and P. kielensis encode duplicated methionine tRNA genes that display compensatory nucleotide substitutions. Two distant species of Kinorhyncha demonstrate similar patterns of gene arrangements in their mitogenomes. Both genomes have duplicated methionine tRNA genes; the duplication predates the divergence of two species. The kinorhynchs share a few features pertaining to gene order that align them with Priapulida. Gene order analysis reveals that gene arrangement specific of Priapulida may be ancestral for Scalidophora, Ecdysozoa, and even Protostomia."
https://openalex.org/W2537528816,"Patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic kidney disease often have increased angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and cachexia. We previously demonstrated that Ang II, via its type 1 receptor, causes muscle protein breakdown and apoptosis and inhibits satellite cell (SC) proliferation and muscle regeneration, likely contributing to cachexia in CHF and chronic kidney disease. In contrast, Ang II, via its type 2 receptor (AT2R) expression, is robustly induced during SC differentiation, and it potentiates muscle regeneration. To understand the mechanisms regulating AT2R expression and its potential role in muscle regeneration in chronic diseases, we used a mouse model of CHF and found that muscle regeneration was markedly reduced and that this was accompanied by blunted increase of AT2R expression. We performed AT2R promoter reporter analysis during satellite cell differentiation and found that the 70 bp upstream of the AT2R transcription start site contain a core promoter region, and regions upstream of 70 bp to 3 kbp are dispensable for AT2R induction. Instead, AT2R intron 2 acts as a transcriptional enhancer during SC differentiation. Further deletion/mutation analysis revealed that multiple transcription factor binding sites in the +286/+690 region within intron 2 coordinately regulate AT2R transcription. Importantly, +286/+690 enhancer activity was suppressed in CHF mouse skeletal muscle, suggesting that AT2R expression is suppressed in CHF via inhibition of AT2R intronic enhancer activity, leading to lowered muscle regeneration. Thus targeting intron 2 enhancer element could lead to the development of a novel intervention to increase AT2R expression in SCs and potentiate skeletal muscle regenerative capacity in chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2538843585,"While RNAs are well known to possess complex structures, functionally similar RNAs often have little sequence similarity. While the exact size and spacing of base-paired regions vary, functionally similar RNAs have pronounced similarity in the arrangement, or topology, of base-paired stems. Furthermore, predicted RNA structures often lack pseudoknots (a crucial aspect of biological activity), and are only partially correct, or incomplete. A topological approach addresses all of these difficulties. In this work we describe each RNA structure as a graph that can be converted to a topological spectrum (RNA fingerprint). The set of subgraphs in an RNA structure, its RNA fingerprint, can be compared with the fingerprints of other RNA structures to identify and correctly classify functionally related RNAs. Topologically similar RNAs can be identified even when a large fraction, up to 30%, of the stems are omitted, indicating that highly accurate structures are not necessary. We investigate the performance of the RNA fingerprint approach on a set of eight highly curated RNA families, with diverse sizes and functions, containing pseudoknots, and with little sequence similarity-an especially difficult test set. In spite of the difficult test set, the RNA fingerprint approach is very successful (ROC AUC > 0.95). Due to the inclusion of pseudoknots, the RNA fingerprint approach both covers a wider range of possible structures than methods based only on secondary structure, and its tolerance for incomplete structures suggests that it can be applied even to predicted structures.

We identified five dominant bacteria in AFF: Coprinus atramentarius, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus licheniformis, Weissella and B. subtilis. The greatest number of bacterial species were observed in the rhizosphere of control matrix (water treated), and the lowest diversity appeared in the rhizosphere soil treated with 108 cfu/mL B. licheniformis alone. Combining AFF plus B. licheniformis in one treatment resulted in the largest leaf area, plant height, root length, plant weight, and the markedly higher activities of antioxidant enzymes. We conclude that a combination of AFF plus B. licheniformis treatment to matrix can increase antioxidant enzymes activities in strawberry seedlings, optimize the status of rhizosphere microbial, and promote plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2536413203,"Increased eutrophication in the recent years has resulted in considerable research focus on identification of methods for preventing cyanobacterial blooms that are rapid and efficient. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of dihydroartemisinin and artemether on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa and to elucidate its mode of action. Variations in cell density, chlorophyll a, soluble protein, malondialdehyde, extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, ETR, rapid light curves, fast chlorophyll fluorescence curves on fluorescence intensity, and relative variable fluorescence) were evaluated by lab-cultured experiments. Our results demonstrated that both dihydroartemisinin and artemether inhibited the growth of M.aeruginosa by impairing the photosynthetic center in photosystem II and reducing extracellular APA, with a higher sensitivity exhibited toward artemether. The inhibitory effects of dihydroartemisinin on M.aeruginosa increased with concentration, and the maximum growth inhibitory rate was 42.17% at 24 mg·L-1 after 120h exposure, whereas it was 55.72% at 6 mg·L-1 artemetherafter 120h exposure. Moreover, the chlorophyll fluorescence was significantly inhibited (p<0.05) after 120h exposure to 12 and 24 mg·L-1 dihydroartemisinin. Furthermore, after 120h exposure to 6 mg·L-1 artemether, Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, ETR and rETRmax showed a significant decrease (p<0.01) from initial values of 0.490, 0.516, 17.333, and 104.800, respectively, to 0. One-way analysis of variance showed that 6 mg·L-1 artemether and 24 mg·L-1 dihydroartemisinin had significant inhibitory effects on extracellular APA (p<0.01). The results of this study would be useful to further studies to validate the feasibility of dihydroartemisinin and artemether treatment to inhibit overall cyanobacterial growth in water bodies, before this can be put into practice."
https://openalex.org/W2539204893,"Jumonji Domain-Containing Protein 3 (JMJD3)/lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) is an epigenetic modulator that removes repressive histone marks on genes. Expression of KDM6B mRNA is elevated in leukocytes from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and has been suggested to be the reason for higher proteinase 3 (PR3) mRNA expression in these cells due to derepression of PRTN3 gene transcription. MicroRNA-941 (miR-941) has been shown to target KDM6B mRNA and inhibit JMJD3 production. We therefore investigated whether polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) from patients suffering from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) have lower expression of miR-941 than healthy control donors as a biological cause for higher JMJD3 levels. We found no significant difference in the degree of maturation of PMNs from GPA patients (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 11) as determined from cell surface expression of the neutrophil maturation marker CD16 and gene expression profile of FCGR3B. The expression of PRTN3 and KDM6B mRNAs and miR-941 was not significantly different in GPA patients and healthy controls. Transfection of pre-miR-941 into the neutrophil promyelocyte cell line PLB-985 cells did not result in reduction of the KDM6B mRNA level as shown previously in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The amount of PR3 in PMNs from GPA patients and healthy controls was comparable. In conclusion, we found that PRTN3 mRNA, KDM6B mRNA, and miR-941 expression levels in PMNs do not differ between GPA patients and healthy controls, and that miR-941 does not uniformly regulate KDM6B mRNA levels by inducing degradation of the transcript. Thus, decreased miR-941 expression in PMNs cannot be part of the pathogenesis of GPA."
https://openalex.org/W2536825572,"The objective of this study is to observe whether cyclosporine A (CsA) inhibits the expression of dectin-1 in human corneal epithelial cells infected with Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) and to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition.Immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and VDR inhibitor for 1 h, and then they were pretreated with CsA for 12h. After these pretreatments, the HCECs were stimulated with A. fumigatus and curdlan respectively, and the expression of dectin-1 and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) were detected by RT-PCR, western blot and ELISA.Dectin-1 mRNA and dectin-1 protein expression increased when HCECs were stimulated with A. fumigatus or curdlan, and CsA inhibited the dectin-1 expression both in mRNA and protein levels specifically. Dectin-1 and proinflammatory cytokine expression levels were higher when HCECs were pretreated with VDR inhibitor and CsA compared to pretreatment with CsA alone, while dectin-1 and proinflammatory cytokine levels were lower when HCECs were pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and CsA compared to pretreatment with CsA alone.These data provide evidence that CsA can inhibit the expression of dectin-1 and proinflammatory cytokines through dectin-1 when HCECs are stimulated by A. fumigatus or curdlan. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, and VDR signaling pathway regulate the inhibition of CsA. The inhibition is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3, and the VDR inhibitor suppresses the inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2534700289,"The mature mammalian organ of Corti does not regenerate spontaneously after injury, mainly due to the absence of cell proliferation and the depletion of otic progenitors with age. The polycomb gene B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1) promotes proliferation and cell cycle progression in several stem cell populations. The cell cycle inhibitor p16ink4a has been previously identified as a downstream target of Bmi1. In this study, we show that Bmi1 is expressed in the developing inner ear. In the organ of Corti, Bmi1 expression is temporally regulated during embryonic and postnatal development. In contrast, p16ink4a expression is not detectable during the same period. Bmi1-deficient mice were used to investigate the role of Bmi1 in cochlear development and otosphere generation. In the absence of Bmi1, the postnatal organ of Corti displayed normal morphology at least until the end of the first postnatal week, suggesting that Bmi1 is not required for the embryonic or early postnatal development of the organ of Corti. However, Bmi1 loss resulted in the reduced sphere-forming capacity of the organ of Corti, accompanied by the decreased cell proliferation of otic progenitors in otosphere cultures. This reduced proliferative capacity was associated with the upregulation of p16ink4a in vitro. Viral vector-mediated overexpression of p16ink4a in wildtype otosphere cultures significantly reduced the number of generated otospheres in vitro. The findings strongly suggest a role for Bmi1 as a promoter of cell proliferation in otic progenitor cells, potentially through the repression of p16ink4a."
https://openalex.org/W2536165057,"Postpartum heammorrhage (PPH), defined as blood loss greater than or equal to 500 ml within 24 hours after birth, is the leading cause of maternal deaths globally and in India. Misoprostol is an important option for PPH management in setting where oxytocin (the gold standard for PPH prevention and treatment) in not available or not feasible to use. For the substantial number of deliveries which take place at home or at lower level heatlh facilities in India, misoprostol pills can be adminstered to prevent PPH. The standard approach using misoprostol is to administer it prophylactically as primary prevention (600 mcg). An alternative strategy could be to administer misoprostol only to those who are at high risk of having PPH i.e. as secondary prevention.This study reports on the relative cost per person of a strategy involving primary versus secondary prevention of PPH using misoprostol. It is based on a randomized cluster trial that was conducted in Bijapur district in Karnataka, India between December 2011 and March 2014 among pregnant women to compare two community-level strategies for the prevention of PPH: primary and secondary. The analysis was conducted from the government perspective using an ingredient approach.The cluster trial showed that there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two study arms. However, the results of the cost analysis show that there is a difference of INR 6 (US$ 0.1) per birth for implementing the strategies primary versus secondary prevention. In India where 14.9 million births take place at sub-centres and at home, this additional cost of INR 6 per birth translates to an additional cost of INR 94 (US$ 1.6) million to the government to implement the primary prevention compared to the secondary prevention strategy.As clinical outcomes did not differ significantly between the two arms in the trial, taking into account the difference in costs and potential issues with sustainability, secondary prevention might be a more strategic option."
https://openalex.org/W2533878402,"The mammalian Caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) plays a key role in the homeobox regulatory network and is essential in regulating the expression of several homeobox (HOX) genes during embryonic development, particularly in the gut. Genome-wide CDX2 chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and expression data from Caco2 cells also suggests a role for CDX2 in the regulation of HOXB4 gene expression in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether HOXB4 gene expression is regulated by CDX2 in the intestinal epithelium. We demonstrated binding of CDX2 to four different CDX2 binding sites in an enhancer region located upstream of the HOXB4 transcription start site. Mutations in the CDX2 binding sites reduced HOXB4 gene activity, and knock down of endogenous CDX2 expression by shRNA reduced HOXB4 gene expression. This is the first report demonstrating the CDX2 regulation of HOXB4 gene expression in the developed intestinal epithelium, indicating a possible role for HOXB4 in intestinal homeostasis."
