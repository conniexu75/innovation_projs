https://openalex.org/W2093596311,"van der Waals heterostructures assembled from atomically thin crystalline layers of diverse two-dimensional solids are emerging as a new paradigm in the physics of materials. We used infrared nanoimaging to study the properties of surface phonon polaritons in a representative van der Waals crystal, hexagonal boron nitride. We launched, detected, and imaged the polaritonic waves in real space and altered their wavelength by varying the number of crystal layers in our specimens. The measured dispersion of polaritonic waves was shown to be governed by the crystal thickness according to a scaling law that persists down to a few atomic layers. Our results are likely to hold true in other polar van der Waals crystals and may lead to new functionalities."

More than half of cis-eQTLs identified, involving hundreds of genes and associated pathways, are detected specifically in stimulated monocytes. Induced innate immune activity reveals multiple master regulatory trans-eQTLs including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), coding variants altering enzyme and receptor function, an IFN-β cytokine network showing temporal specificity, and an interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) transcription factor-modulated network. Induced eQTL are significantly enriched for genome-wide association study loci, identifying context-specific associations to putative causal genes including CARD9, ATM, and IRF8. Thus, applying pathophysiologically relevant immune stimuli assists resolution of functional genetic variants."

Here, we show that all colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs) express CD44v6, which is required for their migration and generation of metastatic tumors. CD44v6 expression is low in primary tumors but demarcated clonogenic CR-CSC populations. Cytokines hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), osteopontin (OPN), and stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF-1), secreted from tumor associated cells, increase CD44v6 expression in CR-CSCs by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which promotes migration and metastasis. CD44v6− progenitor cells do not give rise to metastatic lesions but, when treated with cytokines, acquire CD44v6 expression and metastatic capacity. Importantly, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition selectively killed CD44v6 CR-CSCs and reduced metastatic growth. In patient cohorts, low levels of CD44v6 predict increased probability of survival. Thus, the metastatic process in colorectal cancer is initiated by CSCs through the expression of CD44v6, which is both a functional biomarker and therapeutic target.

Thus, the metastatic process in colorectal cancer is initiated by CSCs through the expression of CD44v6, which is both a functional biomarker and therapeutic target. Due to the extreme difficulties to cure distant metastasis, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in Western countries (Jemal et al., 2011Jemal A. Bray F. Center M.M. Ferlay J. Ward E. Forman D. Global cancer statistics.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2011; 61: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30255) Google Scholar). The complex mechanisms leading to cancer metastasis are far from being completely understood, and it is still unclear which cell subset is able to migrate, survive, and grow at the metastatic site (Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011Chaffer C.L. Weinberg R.A. A perspective on cancer cell metastasis.Science. 2011; 331: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar). In recent years, a growing body of evidence has provided support for the existence of cellular hierarchies within many tumor types where cancer stem cells (CSCs), commonly identified by their cell-surface-marker expression, are the unique source of all tumor cells and responsible for tumor propagation and relapse (Valent et al., 2012Valent P. Bonnet D. De Maria R. Lapidot T. Copland M. Melo J.V. Chomienne C. Ishikawa F. Schuringa J.J. Stassi G. et al.Cancer stem cell definitions and terminology: the devil is in the details.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). CSCs, defined by their capacity for self-renewal and resistance to conventional chemotherapies, are believed to remain after cancer therapy to initiate the metastatic process (Brabletz et al., 2005Brabletz T. Jung A. Spaderna S. Hlubek F. Kirchner T. Opinion: migrating cancer stem cells - an integrated concept of malignant tumour progression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), and their ability to do so has been reported for several forms of cancers. Human pancreatic CSCs expressing the putative stem cell marker CD133 and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 lost their metastatic activity when the CXCR4+ population was depleted, suggesting that CSCs may hijack cytokine-regulated migration-signaling pathways to initiate metastasis (Hermann et al., 2007Hermann P.C. Huber S.L. Herrler T. Aicher A. Ellwart J.W. Guba M. Bruns C.J. Heeschen C. Distinct populations of cancer stem cells determine tumor growth and metastatic activity in human pancreatic cancer.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 313-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, ectopic expression of Twist and Snail, two transcription factors directly involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis development, lead to increased expression of stem cells markers and enhanced tumorigenesis, indicating that a tight connection between EMT activation and CSC phenotype drives the metastatic process (Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M. Reinhard F. Zhang C.C. Shipitsin M. et al.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells.Cell. 2008; 133: 704-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6750) Google Scholar). More recently, a CD26+ CSC population present in both primary colorectal tumors and liver metastasis was demonstrated to give rise to metastatic lesions in the liver when orthotopically injected in immunocompromised mice (Pang et al., 2010Pang R. Law W.L. Chu A.C. Poon J.T. Lam C.S. Chow A.K. Ng L. Cheung L.W. Lan X.R. Lan H.Y. et al.A subpopulation of CD26+ cancer stem cells with metastatic capacity in human colorectal cancer.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 603-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These studies provide a few examples of cancers where CSCs isolated from both primary and metastatic tumors were demonstrated to have the capacity to initiate metastasis. However, whether the cell-surface markers that identify CSCs play a functional role in the molecular events within the tumor environment that drive tumorigenesis and result in the cancer spreading to other organs has been difficult to pinpoint for most CSC populations identified to date. This is an important goal for the field, because understanding whether the cell-surface phenotype of CSC is mechanistically linked with the metastatic process may help develop effective therapeutic agents targeting CSCs. CD44 is a widely expressed polymorphic integral membrane adhesion molecule that binds hyaluronic acid and contributes to cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, cell growth and trafficking, EMT, and tumor progression (Orian-Rousseau, 2010Orian-Rousseau V. CD44, a therapeutic target for metastasising tumours.Eur. J. Cancer. 2010; 46: 1271-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The vast majority of tumors express CD44, whose detection in combination with other antigens is able to enrich for CSCs in several different tumor types (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S.

CD44 transcripts undergo complex alternative splicing, resulting in functionally different isoforms expressed primarily on epithelial cells (Tölg et al., 1993Tölg C. Hofmann M. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Splicing choice from ten variant exons establishes CD44 variability.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the expression of standard isoform (CD44s) has been more extensively studied, the variant isoforms (CD44v) seem restricted to subpopulations endowed with stem cell potential and cancer development. This seems to be particularly true in the gut. Although intestinal stem cells express both standard and variant CD44 isoforms, CD44v, but not CD44s, isoforms promote the generation of gut adenoma in mouse models of familial adenomatous polyposis (Zeilstra et al., 2014Zeilstra J. Joosten S.P. van Andel H. Tolg C. Berns A. Snoek M. van de Wetering M. Spaargaren M. Clevers H. Pals S.T. Stem cell CD44v isoforms promote intestinal cancer formation in Apc(min) mice downstream of Wnt signaling.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Among CD44v isoforms, CD44v6 seems to play a major role in cancer progression for its ability to bind hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), osteopontin (OPN), and other major cytokines produced by tumor microenvironment (Orian-Rousseau, 2010Orian-Rousseau V. CD44, a therapeutic target for metastasising tumours.Eur. J. Cancer. 2010; 46: 1271-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The major role of CD44v6 involves cell migration and invasion. CD44v6 interacts with hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) in the presence of HGF and potentiates its signaling (Orian-Rousseau et al., 2002Orian-Rousseau V. Chen L. Sleeman J.P. Herrlich P. Ponta H. CD44 is required for two consecutive steps in HGF/c-Met signaling.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3074-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). CD44v expression is downstream of the Wnt signaling and induced by the β-catenin/Tcf-4 signaling pathway (Wielenga et al., 2000Wielenga V.J. van der Neut R. Offerhaus G.J. Pals S.T. CD44 glycoproteins in colorectal cancer: expression, function, and prognostic value.Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 169-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear β-catenin accumulates in the undifferentiated CRC cells at the invasive front, whereas a gradual loss is detected in the well-differentiated tumor areas, suggesting its role as marker predictor for cancer metastasis (Brabletz et al., 2005Brabletz T. Jung A. Spaderna S. Hlubek F. Kirchner T. Opinion: migrating cancer stem cells - an integrated concept of malignant tumour progression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The interaction between tumor and its microenvironment is critical for cancer progression, which is promoted by different cytokines produced by stroma or accessory cells present in proximity to the tumor lesion (Whiteside, 2008Whiteside T.L. The tumor microenvironment and its role in promoting tumor growth.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5904-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). OPN is a cytokine produced by fibroblasts and immune and endothelial cells that is involved in several biological processes during bone turnover, tumorigenesis (Rangaswami et al., 2006Rangaswami H. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. Osteopontin: role in cell signaling and cancer progression.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), inflammation, and immune response (Cantor and Shinohara, 2009Cantor H. Shinohara M.L. Regulation of T-helper-cell lineage development by osteopontin: the inside story.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In CRC, elevated CXCR4 expression correlated with advanced tumor stages III/IV and may help identify patients with higher probability to metastasize to the liver (Schimanski et al., 2005Schimanski C.C. Schwald S. Simiantonaki N. Jayasinghe C. Gönner U. Wilsberg V. Junginger T. Berger M.R. Galle P.R. Moehler M. Effect of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 on the metastatic behavior of human colorectal cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Likewise, the functional expression of MET and HGF has been shown to provide a selective growth advantage to neoplastic cells at different stages of tumor progression (Di Renzo et al., 1995Di Renzo M.F. Olivero M. Giacomini A. Porte H. Chastre E. Mirossay L. Nordlinger B. Bretti S. Bottardi S. Giordano S. et al.Overexpression and amplification of the met/HGF receptor gene during the progression of colorectal cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether mechanisms regulating CD44 isoforms during developmental process would be mirrored by colorectal (CR)-CSCs during tumorigenesis and metastatic spread. We show that CR-CSCs are included in the CD44v6+ population and that such CD44v6 expression confers metastatic potential to all CR-CSCs. Engagement of MET and its coreceptor CD44v6 in CR-CSCs activates an EMT program that promotes cell motility, invasiveness, and metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HGF, OPN, and stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF-1) induce CD44v6 expression in CRC progenitor cells, which increase the tumorigenic activity while acquiring the ability to produce metastasis. Our data indicate CD44v6 as a molecule that could be clinically exploited both as a biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC. We and others previously demonstrated that CR-CSCs are enriched in tumor spheres or freshly isolated CD133+ cells (O’Brien et al., 2007O’Brien C.A. Pollett A. Gallinger S. Dick J.E. A human colon cancer cell capable of initiating tumour growth in immunodeficient mice.Nature. 2007; 445: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar, Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007Ricci-Vitiani L.

Colon cancer stem cells dictate tumor growth and resist cell death by production of interleukin-4.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 389-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Given that CD44 has been reported as a CR-CSC marker (Dalerba et al., 2007Dalerba P. Dylla S.J. Park I.K. Liu R. Wang X. Cho R.W. Hoey T. Gurney A. Huang E.H. Simeone D.M. et al.Phenotypic characterization of human colorectal cancer stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10158-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate whether expression of CD44 variants might stratify CR-CSCs into subpopulations with distinct functional properties. Although several of the variable CD44 exons were uniformly translated across patient-derived CRC subsets, mRNA levels of CD44v5 and CD44v6 appeared considerably higher in sphere-propagated CSCs and in freshly purified CD133+cells relative to sphere-derived differentiated progeny and bulk primary cells (Figure S1A available online). Analysis of CD44v5 mRNA in CD44v6+ cells purified from patient tumors or spheres further suggested that CD44v5 and CD44v6 are translated in the same subset of CRC cells (Figure S1B). Interestingly, CD44v6 is significantly higher expressed in metastatic lesions than in their corresponding primary tumors (Figure 1A). In contrast, we found that CD44+-expressing cells were equally present across CRC sphere cells and differentiated progeny and in primary and metastatic tumors (Figure S1C). Although MET, which is known to interact with CD44v6, was prominently expressed in both primary and metastatic CRCs (Figure S1D), subsets of CRC cells enriched in stem-like cells, such as CD133+, CD166+, Lgr5+, EphB2bright, and tumor spheres, all contain a small but consistently present CD44v6+ population (Figures 1B, S1E, and S1F). Intriguingly, immunofluorescence analysis of tumor sections indicated that CD44v6+ cells were mainly located as tumor buds at the invasion front of aggressive tumors and largely express CD133 (Figure 1C). Both CD44v6+ and CD44v6− CRC sphere cells displayed tumorigenic potential in vivo. However, CD44v6− cells generated only small orthotopic tumors, whereas the CD44v6+ cell fraction robustly generated metastatic lesions in the gut, liver, and lung (Figures 1D, 1E, S2A, and S2B). Likewise, whereas freshly isolated CD44v6+ cells were able to generate both orthotopic tumors and metastasis, their negative counterparts grew locally as small tumors, without forming distant lesions (Figures 1F–1H, and S2C). The tumorigenic capacity of the CD44v6− population was entirely lost in secondary recipients, suggesting that CD44v6− cells include transient amplifying progenitors and more differentiated nontumorigenic cells whereas metastatic CR-CSCs are confined to the small CD44v6+ population (Figure S2D). CD26 has been reported as a marker of invasive and metastatic CR-CSCs (Pang et al., 2010Pang R. Law W.L. Chu A.C. Poon J.T. Lam C.S. Chow A.K. Ng L. Cheung L.W. Lan X.R. Lan H.Y. et al.A subpopulation of CD26+ cancer stem cells with metastatic capacity in human colorectal cancer.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 603-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although more than 50% of the CD44v6+/MET+/CD133+ cells express CD26 (Figure S2E), CD44v6+/CD26− CR-CSCs showed considerable metastatic potential in the orthotopic model (Figure S2F), indicating that CD26 expression is not informative for metastatic activity of the CD44v6 population. To analyze the CD44v6+ and CD44v6− cells in more detail, we investigated their invasive and clonogenic potential. In vitro migration analysis confirmed that the invasion capability resided entirely in the CD44v6+subset (Figure 1I), in which Twist and Snail are translated (Figure S2G). Invading CRC cells also showed MET phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, complete loss of E-cadherin, and acquisition of vimentin expression (Figures S2H–S2J). Moreover, limiting dilution analysis showed that the clonogenic activity of CD44v6+ and migrating cells was significantly increased relative to bulk sphere cells, whereas CD44v6− and nonmigrating cells were poorly clonogenic (Figure 1J). We next evaluated whether cytokines known to promote cancer cell migration would affect tumorigenic properties and levels of CD44v6 expression in CD44v6− CRC populations. In CRC sphere cells, exposure to HGF, OPN, and SDF-1 promoted the expression of CD44v6 with a minimal induction of CD44v5, while concomitantly enhancing cell migration and metastatic activity without altering MET expression (Figures 2A–2C and S3A–S3C). Likewise, in the presence of these cytokines, CD44v6− progenitor cells acquired CD44v6 expression and gained in vivo metastatic potential together with a more aggressive phenotype (Figures 2D–2F and S3D). Consequently, freshly isolated primary CRC samples formed distant lesions, which appeared as micrometastasis 3 months after injection only from cells that had been exposed to HGF, OPN, or SDF-1 (Figures 2G, 2H, and S3E). However, when primary CRC cells from CD44v6− samples were exposed to HGF, OPN, or SDF-1 (Figure S3F), CD44v6 expression remained low in the vast majority of cells, suggesting that only transiently amplified CD44v6− progenitors can be converted to CD44v6+ cells. Whereas HGF binds to CD44v6 and MET, SDF-1 binds to CXCR4, which is expressed by both CD44v6− and CD44v6+ in parental and CRC sphere cells (Figure S3G). We found that blocking SDF-1 activity with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 in sphere cells reduced their invasive capability (Figure 2I). Interestingly, SDF-1 blockage also abrogated the upregulation of CD44v6 induced by HGF and OPN (Figure S3H). Because both HGF and OPN are known to upregulate CXCR4 and SDF-1, it is likely that both HGF and OPN act via the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis in CD44v6− cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key players in the tumor microenvironment known to secrete compounds that potentiate tumor malignancy (Hanahan and Coussens, 2012Hanahan D. Coussens L.M. Accessories to the crime: functions of cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from CAFs (CAF-CM) increased the clonogenic activity of sphere-cultured CRC cells, enhanced the migration of CD44v6+ cells, and turned nonmigrating CD44v6− cells into migrating CD44v6+ cells, demonstrating that CAFs secrete compounds that increase self-renewal and invasion potential of CRC cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). Both constitutive and cytokine-induced CD44v6 expression was significantly reduced in CRC spheres treated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figures 3C and S4A), suggesting that the absence of serum allows CAF-CM to promote the expression of CD44v6 in undifferentiated CRC cells. Whereas short-term exposure to CAF-CM or cytokines resulted in a transient induction of CD44v6 in CD44v6− sphere cells, a prolonged stimulation maintained CD44v6 expression for several weeks, so that cells became functionally similar to CD44v6+ cells (Figures S4B and S4C). We found that both CD44v6+ and CD44v6− CRC sphere cells, when treated with CAF-CM or cotransplanted subcutaneously with CAFs, gave rise to larger primary and secondary tumors (Figures 3D, 3E, and S4D). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HGF, OPN, and SDF-1 could only be detected in xenografts formed by CD44v6− cells coinjected with CAFs (Figure S4E), suggesting that these compounds are secreted by CAFs during CRC tumorigenesis. Accordingly, primary cultured CAFs and freshly isolated CD90+ cells from tumor specimens produced significantly higher levels of HGF, OPN, SDF-1, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) than sphere-cultured CRC subsets (Figures 3F and 3G). To confirm that CD44v6 is required for migration of tumorigenic cells, we compared the inhibitory effect of CD44v6, HGF, or MET targeting on CR-CSCs. Transduction of spheres with lentiviral vectors encoding for specific CD44v6 and MET small hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences significantly reduced their mRNA and protein levels, respectively (Figures S5A, S5B, and S5C), while abolishing cell migration (Figure 4A). A similar inhibitory effect was obtained using a blocking CD44v6 antibody or shCD44v6, whereas HGF neutralization was slightly less effective (Figure 4A). We next investigated whether MET silencing in CD44v6+ CSCs could have in vivo therapeutic benefits. Purified and depleted CD44v6 cells from CRC spheres transduced with shCD44v6 or inducible shMET were allowed to orthotopically grow into the mouse caecum. MET and CD44v6 knockdown abrogated tumor metastasis outgrowth, indicating that CSCs need both molecules for tumor spreading (Figures 4B, 4C, and S5D), whereas exogenous expression of CD44v6 restored the migration of CD44v6− cells (Figures 4D, S5E, and S5F). To determine whether CD44v6 is required for the metastatic activity of CRC cells in a syngeneic model, enriched and depleted CD44v6 cells from the mouse colon-26 line were implanted into BALB/c mice spleens and analyzed for their migration ability. Again, CD44v6− cells were unable to colonize the liver, whereas CD44v6+ cells were readily detected into the liver 30 min after spleen injection (Figures 4E and S5G). Of note, exposure to neutralizing antibody against CD44v6 was able to prevent tumor spreading sustained by freshly isolated cells without affecting the orthotopic engraftment (Figure 4F), indicating that CD44v6 may act as a functional marker of cells with metastatic potential in CRC. Because CD44v6 and CD44v5 are coexpressed (Figures 4G, S1A, and S1B), we evaluate the involvement of CD44v5 in the metastatic activity of CR-CSCs. Exogenous expression of CD44v5 in CD44v5−/CD44v6− CRC sphere cells promoted the expression of CD44v6 (Figures S5H and S5I), allowing the cells to become metastatic in the spleen-liver assay (Figure 4H). Altogether, these results suggest that CD44v6 could be a promising therapeutic target to prevent metastasis formation in CRC. The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the hallmark of CR-CSCs. CD133+ CRC cells expanded in culture as tumor spheres contain a subset of tumorigenic cells with constitutively high Wnt signaling, which can be detected by a β-catenin/GFP reporter (Vermeulen et al., 2010Vermeulen L. De Sousa E Melo F. van der Heijden M. Cameron K. de Jong J.H. Borovski T. Tuynman J.B. Todaro M. Merz C. Rodermond H. et al.Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). By flow cytometry analysis, we also found that the vast majority of CD44v6+ cells in CRC spheres display high β-catenin activity (Figure 5A), in line with the high tumorigenic activity of these cells. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis of tumor sections indicated that CD44v6+ cells at the invasion front of aggressive tumors largely express nuclear β-catenin (Figure 5B). Of note, Wnt3a was able to increase expression levels of CD44v6 and clonogenic and migration activity of CRC stem and progenitor cells (Figures 5C–5E). Moreover, the analysis of CD44v6− transduced with CD44v5 showed that the acquisition of CD44v6 paralleled the activation of β-catenin (Figure 5F), confirming the prominent role of the Wnt signaling pathway in this system. In accordance with the functional differences observed in CD44v6+ and CD44v6− cells, cytokines able to upregulate CD44v6 promoted the expression of Wnt-, EMT-, and metastasis-related genes (Figure 5G). Each of these cytokines was able to activate the β-catenin pathway in CRC spheres (Figure 5H), in line with their ability to promote a prometastatic phenotype in CD44v6− CRC sphere cells. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and BMP2 are produced by differentiated CRC cells and are absent in cancer stem and progenitor cells (Hardwick et al., 2004Hardwick J.C. Van Den Brink G.R.

Because BMP4 promotes the differentiation of CR-CSCs and antagonizes the Wnt pathway, we hypothesized that BMPs could repress the expression of CD44v6. CD44v6+ cells gradually decreased their β-catenin activity in presence of BMP4 (Figure 5I). Cytokine- and CAF-CM-induced CD44v6 expression was significantly reduced in CRC spheres treated with BMP2 or BMP4 (Figure 5J), suggesting that the absence of differentiating agents allows HGF, OPN, and SDF-1 to promote the expression of CD44v6 in undifferentiated CRC cells. Thus, the ability of BMPs to promote the differentiation and loss of tumorigenic activity of CR-CSCs is paralleled by the repression of CD44v6 expression promoted by Wnt pathway. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the metastatic behavior of CR-CSCs, we analyzed the posttranslational modifications of the proteins commonly related to the metastatic signaling pathways. Immunoblot analysis revealed a significant downregulation of PTEN and a considerable upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and activation of AKT in CRC sphere cells treated with HGF, OPN, and SDF-1, whereas a constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway was observed in CD44v6+ cells (Figures 6A, 6B, and S6A). Inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway in CRC spheres caused a significant reduction of cell viability, particularly in samples bearing PI3K mutation (Figure S6B), and hampered the expression of CD44v6 induced by HGF, OPN, and SDF-1 on CD44v6− cells (Figures 6C and S6C). Of note, CD44v6+ cells were the major subset dying in vitro after PI3K inhibition (Figure 6D). Moreover, the analysis of early signaling showed that BMP4 upregulated the expression of PTEN and impaired the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway promoted by HGF, OPN, and SDF-1 (Figures 6E and S6D). To investigate whether the dependence of CD44v6+ cells to the PI3K/AKT pathway may be exploited to prevent or reduce metastasis formation in CRC, we determined the effect of treatment with the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 on the"
https://openalex.org/W1975052733,"Introduction River networks, the backbone of most landscapes on Earth, collect and transport water, sediment, organic matter, and nutrients from upland mountain regions to the oceans. Dynamic aspects of these networks include channels that shift laterally or expand upstream, ridges that migrate across Earth’s surface, and river capture events whereby flow from one branch of the network is rerouted in a new direction. These processes result in a constantly changing map of the network with implications for mass transport and the geographic connectivity between species or ecosystems. Ultimately, this dynamic system strives to establish equilibrium between tectonic uplift and river erosion. Determining whether or not a river network is in equilibrium, and, if not, what changes are required to bring it to equilibrium, will help us understand the processes underlying landscape evolution and the implications for river ecosystems. Methods We developed the use of a proxy, referred to as χ, for steady-state river channel elevation. This proxy is based on the current geometry of the river network and provides a snapshot of the dynamic state of river basins. Geometric equilibrium in planform requires that a network map of χ exhibit equal values across all water divides (the ridges separating river basins). Disequilibrium river networks adjust their drainage area through divide migration (geometric change) or river capture (topologic change) until this condition is met. We constructed a numerical model to demonstrate that this is a fundamental characteristic of a stable river network. We applied this principle to natural landscapes using digital elevation models to calculate χ for three, very different, systems: the Loess Plateau in China, the eastern Central Range of Taiwan, and the southeastern United States. Results The Loess Plateau is close to geometric equilibrium, with χ exhibiting nearly equal values across water divides. By contrast, the young and tectonically active Taiwan mountain belt is not in equilibrium, with numerous examples of actively migrating water divides and river network reorganization. The southeastern United States also appears to be far from equilibrium, with the Blue Ridge escarpment migrating to the northwest and the coastal plain rivers reorganizing in response to this change in boundary geometry. Major reorganization events, such as the capture of the headwaters of the Apalachicola River by the Savannah River, are readily identifiable in our maps. Discussion Disequilibrium conditions in a river network imply greater variation of weathering, soil production, and erosion rates. Disequilibrium also implies more frequent river capture with implications for exchange of aquatic species and genetic diversification. Transient conditions in river basins are often interpreted in terms of tectonic perturbation, but our results show that river basin reorganization can occur even in tectonically quiescent regions such as the southeastern United States."
https://openalex.org/W2101321540,"Neuroinflammation is one of the most striking hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a master regulator of inflammation, is upregulated in spinal cords of ALS patients and SOD1-G93A mice. In this study, we show that selective NF-κB inhibition in ALS astrocytes is not sufficient to rescue motor neuron (MN) death. However, the localization of NF-κB activity and subsequent deletion of NF-κB signaling in microglia rescued MNs from microglial-mediated death in vitro and extended survival in ALS mice by impairing proinflammatory microglial activation. Conversely, constitutive activation of NF-κB selectively in wild-type microglia induced gliosis and MN death in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data provide a mechanism by which microglia induce MN death in ALS and suggest a novel therapeutic target that can be modulated to slow the progression of ALS and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases by which microglial activation plays a role."

Altogether, these data suggest that in the glioma perivascular niche, osteopontin promotes stem cell-like properties and radiation resistance in adjacent tumor cells via activation of CD44 signaling. Despite intensive treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)—the highest-grade glioma and most aggressive brain tumor—invariably recurs as an incurable lesion (Huse and Holland, 2010Huse J.T.

Recurrence is tightly coupled to increased resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, hallmark features of stem-like glioma cells (Pietras, 2011Pietras A. Cancer stem cells in tumor heterogeneity.Adv. Cancer Res. 2011; 112: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stem-like glioma cells have been enriched experimentally based on expression of stem cell markers such as CD133 (Singh et al., 2003Singh S.K. Clarke I.D. Terasaki M. Bonn V.E. Hawkins C. Squire J. Dirks P.B. Identification of a cancer stem cell in human brain tumors.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5821-5828PubMed Google Scholar) and CD44 (Anido et al., 2010Anido J. Sáez-Borderías A. Gonzàlez-Juncà A.

Like stem cells in the normal brain subventricular zone, stem-like glioma cells reside in a perivascular niche (PVN) thought to maintain the stem cell character of adjacent tumor cells (Calabrese et al., 2007Calabrese C. Poppleton H. Kocak M. Hogg T.L. Fuller C. Hamner B. Oh E.Y. Gaber M.W. Finklestein D. Allen M. et al.A perivascular niche for brain tumor stem cells.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 69-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Indeed, we previously showed that nitric oxide from PVN endothelial cells activates Notch signaling in glioma cells, leading to increased stem cell characteristics (Charles et al., 2010Charles N. Ozawa T. Squatrito M. Bleau A.M. Brennan C.W. Hambardzumyan D. Holland E.C. Perivascular nitric oxide activates notch signaling and promotes stem-like character in PDGF-induced glioma cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how niche factors are involved in maintaining aggressive glioma cell phenotypes may help identify novel potential targets for enhancing the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. CD44, a glycoprotein transmembrane receptor, is a marker of stem cells from a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues (Zöller, 2011Zöller M. CD44: can a cancer-initiating cell profit from an abundantly expressed molecule?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). As a receptor for extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and osteopontin (OPN), most described functions for CD44 are as an adhesion molecule. CD44-mediated adhesion is thought to be important, among other things, for stem cell homing to the niche, and indeed both HA and OPN have been described as components of stem cell niches (Haylock and Nilsson, 2005Haylock D.N. Nilsson S.K. Stem cell regulation by the hematopoietic stem cell niche.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Beyond adhesion, CD44 itself can act as an intracellular signaling molecule. The C-terminal intracellular domain (CD44ICD) initiates signaling by interacting with proteins like c-Src while membrane bound (Bourguignon et al., 2001Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W. CD44 interaction with c-Src kinase promotes cortactin-mediated cytoskeleton function and hyaluronic acid-dependent ovarian tumor cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7327-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, CD44 is subject to proteolytic activation similar to that of Notch receptors: extracellular cleavage followed by γ-secretase-dependent release of CD44ICD (Murakami et al., 2003Murakami D. Okamoto I. Nagano O. Kawano Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. De Strooper B. Yumoto E. Saya H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Once released, CD44ICD localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, but the mechanisms underlying its signaling as well as its functions remain poorly understood. In glioma, CD44 is expressed highly in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM (Phillips et al., 2006Phillips H.S. Kharbanda S. Chen R. Forrest W.F. Soriano R.H. Wu T.D. Misra A. Nigro J.M. Colman H. Soroceanu L. et al.Molecular subclasses of high-grade glioma predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and resemble stages in neurogenesis.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 157-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), and its expression has been used to enrich for stem-like cells (Anido et al., 2010Anido J. Sáez-Borderías A. Gonzàlez-Juncà A. Rodón L. Folch G. Carmona M.A. Prieto-Sánchez R.M. Barba I. Martínez-Sáez E.

Here, we found that Cd44−/− and Cd44+/− mice survived longer than Cd44+/+ mice with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-driven gliomas, indicating that CD44 actively contributes to aggressive glioma growth. We found that the CD44 ligand OPN shared a perivascular expression pattern with CD44 in PDGF-driven glioma and OPN enhanced stemness of glioma cells, including increasing the SP and radiation resistance. CD44ICD was sufficient to induce these stem cell characteristics in glioma cells and potentiated aggressive tumor growth in PDGF-induced gliomas in vivo. We found that CD44ICD enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) function in a CBP/p300-dependent manner and HIF-2α mediated downstream effects of CD44ICD on stemness. In human GBM, CD44 expression correlated with aggressive growth and poor survival in the proneural subtype and CD44 expression was significantly correlated with hypoxia-induced gene signatures. Taken together, our data identify OPN as a stem cell-promoting extracellular factor in the GBM PVN and demonstrate that CD44 signaling via its intracellular domain promotes aggressive growth and stem cell characteristics by enhancing HIF-2α activity. Proneural GBM is characterized by elevated PDGF receptor signaling and can be modeled by overexpressing PDGF in Nestin-expressing stem cells in the mouse brain. Specifically, we employed the RCAS/tv-a system (Holland et al., 1998Holland E.C. Hively W.P. DePinho R.A. Varmus H.E. A constitutively active epidermal growth factor receptor cooperates with disruption of G1 cell-cycle arrest pathways to induce glioma-like lesions in mice.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and infected Nestin-tv-a (Ntv-a) mice in a wild-type (generating a spectrum of low- to high-grade gliomas) or Ink4a/Arf−/− (generating exclusively GBM) background with RCAS-PDGF. The resulting tumors displayed minimal detectable CD44 expression in the tumor bulk and high-restricted expression in cells of the PVN (Figure 1A). We then generated gliomas in Ntv-a mice crossed into a Cd44−/− and Cd44+/− background. The resulting gliomas were largely indistinguishable from Cd44+/+ tumors by hematoxylin and eosin staining but lacked any evidence of CD44 expression (Figure 1B). Wild-type tumors were scored as either low- or high-grade gliomas based on histological features. Interestingly, in the Ntv-a Ink4a/Arf+/+ background, Cd44+/+ animals developed significantly more high-grade gliomas compared to Cd44+/− and Cd44−/− mice (Figure 1C). In the Ntv-a Ink4a/Arf−/− background, there was a significant survival difference between groups, with Cd44+/+ (n = 10) tumors being the most aggressive, Cd44−/− (n = 10) the least aggressive, and Cd44+/− (n = 16) tumors falling in between (Figure 1D). These data support that CD44 actively contributes to tumor aggressiveness in proneural GBM. We next stained murine gliomas for CD44 and the CD44 ligand OPN by dual immunofluorescence and found perivascular colocalization of OPN and CD44 with little detectable expression in the tumor bulk (Figure 2A), suggesting that OPN could bind CD44 in the proneural GBM PVN. Because of the PVN localization of OPN and CD44 and because CD44 is a marker of stem-like cells, we asked whether activation of CD44 by OPN could induce the stem-like phenotype. Throughout the study, we chose two functional assays with clear clinical implications, the drug efflux-based SP assay that was previously demonstrated to enrich for stem-like tumor-initiating cells in human and murine glioma (Bleau et al., 2009Bleau A.M. Hambardzumyan D. Ozawa T. Fomchenko E.I. Huse J.T. Brennan C.W. Holland E.C.

First, culturing PDGF-induced glioma primary cultures (PIGPCs), human U251, and human T98G glioma cells in the presence of 400 ng/ml OPN for 48 hr induced an increase in the SP (Figure 2B). Conversely, treating PIGPCs with the IM7 anti-CD44 blocking antibody that blocks CD44-ligand interactions, including that of CD44 and OPN (Weiss et al., 2001Weiss J.M. Renkl A.C. Maier C.S. Kimmig M. Liaw L. Ahrens T. Kon S. Maeda M. Hotta H. Uede T. Simon J.C. Osteopontin is involved in the initiation of cutaneous contact hypersensitivity by inducing Langerhans and dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), resulted in a marked decrease in the SP (Figure 2C), suggesting that CD44 function is necessary for the SP phenotype. CD44 blocking similarly reduced the SP of primary human proneural GBM cells and primary murine GBM neurosphere cultures (Figure 2C). Of note, Cd44 levels were significantly higher in sorted SP cells as compared to main population cells (Figure S1A available online). Second, the stem cell markers Nanog, Sox2, Oct4, and Id1 were all upregulated in OPN-treated PIGPCs as well as primary human GBM cells, as shown by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Figures 2D and 2E). Finally, PIGPCs treated with OPN formed more colonies than control cells in a colony-formation assay following a single dose of 2 Gy irradiation (Figure 2F). Together, these data suggest that OPN acts as a PVN factor to induce the stem-like state of PVN GBM cells. We next tested the tumor-initiating capacity of PIGPCs pretreated or not with OPN in vitro prior to intracranial injection in recipient mice and found no significant difference between groups in tumor formation or survival (Figure S1B). These data are in line with recent advances separating stemness from tumor-initiating ability specifically in GBM (Barrett et al., 2012Barrett L.E. Granot Z. Coker C. Iavarone A. Hambardzumyan D. Holland E.C. Nam H.S. Benezra R. Self-renewal does not predict tumor growth potential in mouse models of high-grade glioma.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CD44 can be activated by proteolytic cleavage in a two-step process dependent on γ-secretase, resulting in the release of a CD44 intracellular domain (CD44ICD). Because of the well-documented inhibitory effects of γ-secretase inhibition on brain tumor stemness (at least partially mediated through inhibition of Notch) (Fan et al., 2006Fan X. Matsui W. Khaki L. Stearns D. Chun J. Li Y.M. Eberhart C.G. Notch pathway inhibition depletes stem-like cells and blocks engraftment in embryonal brain tumors.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7445-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), we speculated that CD44ICD release may be involved downstream of OPN. To test this hypothesis, we treated PIGPCs with OPN in the presence of a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI; MK-003) or control and measured expression of our panel of stem cell markers. Notably, γ-secretase inhibition was sufficient to inhibit the effect of OPN on either marker in the panel (Figure 2G), suggesting that γ-secretase-dependent release of CD44ICD could indeed be involved downstream of OPN-CD44. To test whether cleavage of CD44 is induced by OPN, we blotted for CD44 using an antibody recognizing the C-terminal end of the protein. Because this antibody recognizes human CD44, we utilized human U251 glioma cells. Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C and the best-described inducer of CD44ICD generation, was used to generate a positive control sample, and TPA treatment in combination with γ-secretase inhibitor was used as a negative control. As expected, TPA induced a CD44 band slightly smaller than 15 kDa corresponding to CD44ICD (Figure 2H). TPA in combination with γ-secretase inhibitor diminished this band and instead resulted in accumulation of a band slightly larger than 15 kDa corresponding to CD44EXT (CD44 after extracellular cleavage, before CD44ICD release). OPN treatment of U251 cells also resulted in increased CD44ICD release as compared to untreated control after 24 hr (Figure 2H, long exposure). Quantification of band intensities across several experiments revealed on average a 2-fold significant induction of CD44ICD by OPN treatment (Figure 2H). An intracellular role for CD44 in glioma was supported by staining murine gliomas with an antibody detecting C-terminal CD44. Stainings revealed cells with CD44 expression in the nucleus (left panel, black arrow), membrane (middle panel, white arrow), and cytoplasm (right panel, gray arrow) (Figure 3A), indicating that CD44 expression reflects the potential to be spontaneously activated in vivo. To study effects of CD44ICD release more carefully, we created a fusion protein with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused to the human CD44ICD N terminus (EGFP-CD44ICD; Figure 3B). When expressed in PIGPCs, EGFP-CD44ICD localized throughout the cell in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figure 3C). We inserted the EGFP-CD44ICD fusion gene into the RCAS vector and injected N-tva Ink4a/Arf−/− mice with RCAS-PDGF in combination with either RCAS-EGFP-CD44ICD or RCAS-GFP to study effects of CD44ICD in glioma in vivo. Tumors formed after coinjection of PDGFB with EGFP-CD44ICD contained a larger proportion of cells staining positive for intracellular/nuclear CD44 as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an antibody recognizing the C-terminal end and quantified using ImageJ (Figure 3D; Figure S2). Importantly, PDGFB/EGFP-CD44ICD-induced tumors were more aggressive, because mice injected with PDGFB/GFP (n = 8) survived significantly longer than those injected with PDGFB/EGFP-CD44ICD (n = 6) (Figure 3E). These data indicate that CD44ICD alone can contribute to aggressive tumor growth in glioma. Together with the finding that mice with Cd44−/− GBM survived longer than those with Cd44+/+ GBM (Figure 1D), these data further establish CD44 as an active contributor to aggressive growth in PDGF-induced GBM. To test whether CD44ICD alone could mimic the phenotype induced by OPN, we expressed EGFP-CD44ICD or control in a TetOn doxycycline (Dox)-inducible system where CD44ICD expression could be rapidly controlled in T98G glioma cells and subjected them to the same analyses to quantify stemness as in the OPN set of experiments. First, EGFP-CD44ICD expression resulted in a 4-fold increase in the SP as compared to EGFP-expressing controls (Figure 4A), indicating that CD44ICD is sufficient to induce the SP phenotype in a subset of glioma cells. CD44ICD expression similarly increased the SP of PIGPCs (Figure 4A). To test whether effects of CD44 blockade could be rescued by CD44ICD, we expressed CD44ICD stably in PIGPCs. Importantly, PIGPCs expressing EGFP-CD44ICD no longer underwent reduction of the size of SP by CD44-blocking antibodies as shown earlier (Figure 4B), strongly arguing that CD44 blockade acts by inhibiting the release of CD44ICD. Second, we tested whether expression of CD44ICD could induce expression of our panel of stem cell markers. Indeed, Nanog, Sox2, Oct4, and Id1 expression was increased by CD44ICD expression in PIGPCs, primary human GBM cells, and human U251 glioma cells (Figures 4C–4E). NANOG and SOX2 expression was significantly induced by EGFP-CD44ICD in T98G cells, whereas expression of OCT4 and ID1 was unaffected in this cell line (Figure 4F). Finally, we tested the colony-forming ability of cells expressing EGFP-CD44ICD after a single dose of irradiation. After 1, 2, or 4 Gy irradiation, EGFP-CD44ICD-expressing T98G cells formed more colonies than controls (Figure 4G), thus again mimicking the effect of OPN. Together, these data indicate that CD44ICD can drive parts of the stem cell phenotype in the PVN of PDGF-induced GBM. Saya and colleagues demonstrated that CD44ICD could potentiate transactivation mediated by the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 (Okamoto et al., 2001Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. Proteolytic release of CD44 intracellular domain and its role in the CD44 signaling pathway.J.

Although CBP/p300 can potentiate transcription by a wide range of transcription factors, one such family of CBP/p300-dependent transcription factors known to regulate glioma stemness are the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) (Li et al., 2009Li Z.

We speculated that CD44ICD promoted stemness by enhancing HIF-dependent transcription and transfected T98G cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-CD44ICD with a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE)-luciferase reporter in the presence of control or the hypoxia-mimetic 2,2-dipyridyl (DIP) to stabilize HIFs. DIP-treated EGFP-expressing cells displayed on average a 10-fold induction of HRE-luciferase as compared to control cells (Figure 5A). Strikingly, EGFP-CD44ICD-expressing cells treated with DIP indeed had a 2- to 3-fold-higher induction of HRE-luciferase as compared to DIP-treated control cells (Figure 5A), thus supporting the hypothesis that CD44ICD potentiated HIF activation. Similarly, CD44ICD expression significantly enhanced HRE activation even at normoxic conditions in primary human proneural GBM cells and U251 glioma cells (Figures 5B and 5C). DIP stabilizes both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, so to elucidate whether this potentiation was dependent on HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or both, we overexpressed oxygen-insensitive versions of the HIFs (Yan et al., 2007Yan Q. Bartz S. Mao M. Li L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. The hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domains cooperate to promote renal tumorigenesis in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2092-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) together with EGFP or EGFP-CD44ICD. In EGFP-expressing control cells, HIF-1α and HIF-2α both induced the HRE-luciferase reporter to a similar extent (Figure 5D). Intriguingly, however, CD44ICD potentiated induction of HRE-luciferase only together with HIF-2α, with no potentiation of HIF-1α-dependent HRE-activation in T98G cells (Figure 5D). In U251 cells, in contrast, CD44ICD enhanced HRE activation both by HIF-1α and HIF-2α (Figure 5E). However, knocking down HIF1A (Figure S4A) in U251 cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) had no effect on the potentiated HRE activation by CD44ICD, whereas knockdown of HIF2A entirely diminished the difference between EGFP and CD44ICD-expressing cells (Figure 5F), indicating that even in these cells, HIF2A was the primary HIF involved in CD44ICD signaling. Finally, genes of the stemness panel were induced by hypoxia in a HIF2A-dependent manner in U251 cells (Figure S3). To test whether HIF-2α mediated the stemness-promoting effect of CD44ICD, we treated T98G TetOn-CD44ICD cells with control or two independent siRNAs targeting HIF2A (Figure S4B) and then cultured them with either DIP (to stabilize HIFs) or Dox (to induce CD44ICD expression). DIP treatment induced mRNA expression of the CD44ICD-induced stem cell markers SOX2 and NANOG (Figure 5G). This induction was mediated by HIF-2α, because DIP did not induce these genes in HIF2A-knockdown cells (Figure 5G). Importantly, SOX2 and NANOG induction by CD44ICD (Figure 4F) was also HIF-2α dependent, because knockdown of HIF2A abrogated any effect of CD44ICD on these genes (Figure 5G). Expression of the stem cell markers OCT4 and ID1, which were not induced by CD44ICD in T98G cells (Figure 4F), was unaffected both by DIP and Dox treatment in these cells (Figure 5G). We further tested expression of the well-described hypoxia-induced gene VEGF. As expected, VEGF was induced by DIP. However, this induction was not mediated by HIF-2α, because HIF2A knockdown did not affect VEGF induction by DIP (Figure 5H). In agreement with CD44ICD acting through HIF-2α, CD44ICD induction did not affect VEGF expression (Figure 5H). We next asked whether the induction of SP by CD44ICD was also dependent on HIF-2α and again treated cells transfected with siRNAs targeting HIF2A or control, with or without Dox. SP analysis revealed that whereas cells expressing nontargeting control siRNA induced the SP upon EGFP-CD44ICD expression, cells transfected with two independent siRNAs targeting HIF2A did not (Figure 5I). Taken together, these data establish CD44ICD as an enhancer of HIF-2α function and demonstrate that the stemness-promoting effects of CD44ICD are mediated by HIF-2α in these cells. To investigate the mechanism by which CD44ICD enhanced HIF-2α, we treated T98G TetOn-CD44ICD cells with DIP (to stabilize HIFs) and/or Dox (to induce CD44ICD expression) and measured HIF2A mRNA levels. Neither DIP nor Dox resulted in significantly altered HIF2A transcript levels (Figure 6A; Figure S5). On the other hand, T98G TetOn-CD44ICD cells expressed higher HIF-2α protein levels when treated with both DIP and Dox together as compared to DIP alone (Figure 6B), suggesting that CD44ICD helps stabilize HIF-2α by inhibiting degradation rather than by increased transcription. Because CD44ICD was previously demonstrated to potentiate CBP/p300-mediated transcription, we speculated that CD44ICD potentiation of HIF-2α was dependent on CBP and/or p300. To test this hypothesis, we transfected siRNAs targeting control, CBP, or p300 (Figures S4C and S4D) and expressed EGFP or CD44ICD in T98G cells and measured HRE-luciferase activity in the presence of DIP. Interestingly, in EGFP-expressing cells, knockdown of CBP had no effect on HRE-luciferase activity, whereas p300 knockdown significantly decreased the HRE-luciferase signal (Figure 6C). Strikingly, however, both CBP and p300 siRNA significantly blunted the increase in HRE-luciferase activity induced by CD44ICD (Figure 6C). Thus, CD44ICD potentiates HIF-2α signaling in a CBP/p300-dependent manner. We next asked to what extent HIF-2α mediated CD44ICD-induced gene expression changes globally and performed microarray analysis on T98G TetOn-CD44ICD cells treated with or without Dox and transfected with either nontargeting control or HIF2A siRNA. Strikingly, principal component analysis (PCA) mapping showed that whereas control-siRNA-transfected samples grouped separately based on CD44ICD expression, there was essentially no difference between groups in the HIF2A-siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 6D). These data suggest that the vast majority of CD44ICD-induced gene expression changes are mediated by HIF-2α. Finally, we stained a series of human GBM samples for CD44 protein expression by IHC and divided them according to their expression profile into the proneural, mesenchymal, or classical GBM subtype (Phillips et al., 2006Phillips H.S. Kharbanda S. Chen R. Forrest W.F. Soriano R.H. Wu T.D. Misra A. Nigro J.M. Colman H.

Whereas mesenchymal and classical tumors expressed CD44 at high levels throughout the tumor, CD44 expression in proneural tumors was restricted to the PVN (Figures 7A–7C), similar to CD44 expression in our murine PDGF-induced gliomas (Figure 1A).

One fundamental question concerns whether the hippocampus represents specific objects or assigns context-dependent representations to objects. Here, we used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis of fMRI data during retrieval of learned object sequences to systematically investigate hippocampal coding of object and temporal context information. Hippocampal activity patterns carried information about the temporal positions of objects in learned sequences, but not about objects or temporal positions in random sequences. Hippocampal activity patterns differentiated between overlapping object sequences and between temporally adjacent objects that belonged to distinct sequence contexts. Parahippocampal and perirhinal cortex showed different pattern information profiles consistent with coding of temporal position and object information, respectively. These findings are consistent with models proposing that the hippocampus represents objects within specific temporal contexts, a capability that might explain its critical role in episodic memory."

This work provides insight into the distinct properties of GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers, which are presumably the most abundant NMDA receptors in the adult forebrain. NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that are critically involved in many processes in the central nervous system (CNS), including neuronal development, memory, and learning (Traynelis et al., 2010Traynelis S.F. Wollmuth L.P. McBain C.J. Menniti F.S. Vance K.M. Ogden K.K. Hansen K.B. Yuan H. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Glutamate receptor ion channels: structure, regulation, and function.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 405-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). However, they are also implicated in a multitude of psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, as well as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Alzheimer’s diseases (Paoletti et al., 2013Paoletti P.

NMDA receptors are therefore widely considered as important targets for therapeutic intervention in many diseases of the CNS. Seven NMDA receptor subunits have been cloned: GluN1, GluN2A–D, and GluN3A–B. The majority of native NMDA receptors are tetrameric assemblies of two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 subunits (Traynelis et al., 2010Traynelis S.F. Wollmuth L.P. McBain C.J. Menniti F.S. Vance K.M.

Rev. 2010; 62: 405-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). GluN3 can also assemble with GluN1 and GluN2, but the stoichiometry of GluN3-containing receptors is unknown. Studies on recombinant NMDA receptors almost exclusively describe diheteromeric receptors that are assembled from GluN1 and only one type of GluN2. However, at least two different GluN2 subunits have been identified in most, if not all, NMDA receptor-expressing cells. Furthermore, a compelling body of evidence shows that a large proportion of native NMDA receptors are triheteromers assembled from two GluN1 and two different GluN2 subunits. In particular, it has been demonstrated that GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers account for >50% of the total NMDA receptors in hippocampus and cortex of the adult rodent brain (Al-Hallaq et al., 2007Al-Hallaq R.A.

Despite the prevalence of triheteromeric NMDA receptors in vivo, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of their function and pharmacology because of our inability to faithfully express these triheteromeric receptors in heterologous expression systems without accompanying diheteromeric receptors (Chazot et al., 1994Chazot P.L.

Coexpression of GluN1 with two different GluN2 subunits (e.g., GluN2A and GluN2B) in heterologous systems generates three populations of functional NMDA receptors consisting of two different diheteromeric receptors (e.g., GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B), as well as triheteromeric receptors (e.g., GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B). Expression of three receptor populations confounds studies on the properties of triheteromeric receptors. To mitigate this problem, we exploited the trafficking control system of the G protein-coupled GABAB receptors that are heterodimers composed of GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits (Bettler et al., 2004Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mosbacher J. Gassmann M. Molecular structure and physiological functions of GABA(B) receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 835-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The GABAB1 subunit possesses a retention signal (RXR motif) in the intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) that retains the subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thus prevents expression of homomeric GABAB1 at the cell surface (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. A trafficking checkpoint controls GABA(B) receptor heterodimerization.Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). However, the retention signal is masked through a coiled-coil interaction with GABAB2 between leucine zipper motifs within in the CTDs, allowing trafficking of the heterodimer to the cell surface (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. A trafficking checkpoint controls GABA(B) receptor heterodimerization.Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). With some modifications, the GABAB receptor trafficking system has been utilized to express heterodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptors in heterologous systems upon transfer of the intracellular GABAB subunit CTDs (Kniazeff et al., 2004Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Closed state of both binding domains of homodimeric mGlu receptors is required for full activity.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the GABAB receptor leucine zipper motifs and engineered C-terminal peptide tags that were used to selectively express recombinant triheteromeric receptors at the cell-surface without confounding coexpression of diheteromeric receptors. Thus, this approach enables quantitative evaluation of functional and pharmacological properties of GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromeric receptors. In order to selectively express triheteromeric NMDA receptors at the cell surface, we engineered two different C-terminal peptide tags composed of the leucine zipper motifs from GABAB1 and GABAB2 (LZ1 and LZ2, respectively) immediately followed by C-terminal dilysine KKXX ER retention/retrieval motifs (Figure 1A; Figure S1 available online). The leucine zipper motifs of GABAB1 and GABAB2 can interact to form a parallel heterodimeric coiled-coil structure (Kammerer et al., 1999Kammerer R.A. Frank S. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Heterodimerization of a functional GABAB receptor is mediated by parallel coiled-coil alpha-helices.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13263-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The KKXX motifs at the distal C termini will localize the subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Zerangue et al., 2001Zerangue N. Malan M.J. Fried S.R. Dazin P.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Schwappach B. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum trafficking signals by combinatorial screening in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) unless masked by coiled-coil formation between LZ1 and LZ2 (Brock et al., 2005Brock C. Boudier L. Maurel D. Blahos J. Pin J.P. Assembly-dependent surface targeting of the heterodimeric GABAB receptor is controlled by COPI but not 14-3-3.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, we added a peptide linker (L4) to the N termini to generate the tags L4-LZ1-KKXX and L4-LZ2-KKXX (hereafter, C1 and C2, respectively). The L4 peptide linker was composed of four repeats of amino acids EAAAK, which will generate a rigid α-helical rod (Arai et al., 2004Arai R. Wriggers W. Nishikawa Y. Nagamune T. Fujisawa T. Conformations of variably linked chimeric proteins evaluated by synchrotron X-ray small-angle scattering.Proteins. 2004; 57: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fusing C1 and C2 to the intracellular C termini of GluN2 subunits should allow selective surface expression of NMDA receptors composed of two GluN1, one C1-tagged GluN2, and one C2-tagged GluN2 (Figure 1B). To avoid potential incompatibility between trafficking signals present in GluN2A and GluN2B CTDs and between CTD structures and spatial requirements for the C1/C2 interaction, we replaced the CTD of GluN2B with that of GluN2A (Figure 1A). The functional properties of GluN2B subunits containing the CTD of GluN2A are indistinguishable from those of wild-type GluN2B (Maki et al., 2012Maki B.A. Aman T.K. Amico-Ruvio S.A. Kussius C.L.

Influence of the intracellular GluN2 C-terminal domain on NMDA receptor function.Neuropharmacology. 2012; 62: 1985-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated C1- and C2-tagged GluN2A and GluN2B subunits (2AC1, 2AC2, 2BAC1, and 2BAC2) that only differ in the intracellular CTDs by the leucine zipper motifs (LZ1 and LZ2). The amino acid sequences for the C1 and C2 peptide tags are shown in Figure S1. Coexpression of 2AC1 and 2BAC2 (as well as GluN1) in Xenopus oocytes produced robust current responses activated by glutamate plus glycine that increased in amplitude on days 1–3, following cRNA injection, and remained constant on days 4–6 (Figures 1C and 1D). In theory, the glutamate/glycine-activated currents from oocytes coexpressing 2AC1, 2BAC2, and GluN1 are mediated by NMDA receptors composed of one 2AC1 and one 2BAC2 with masked retention signals, as well as two GluN1 subunits (hereafter, 2AC1/2BAC2). However, some 2AC1/2AC1 and 2BAC2/2BAC2 receptors that may have escaped ER retention could also contribute to the measured current responses. To evaluate the fraction of the total current response that is mediated by escaped receptors (i.e., “escape” current), we generated 2AC1 and 2BAC2 subunits with mutations in the agonist binding pocket that abolish glutamate binding (R518K + T690I in 2AC1(RK+TI) and R519K + T691I in 2BAC2(RK+TI)) (Erreger et al., 2007Erreger K.

Coexpression of 2AC1 and 2BAC2(RK+TI) produces only one population of receptors that can be activated by 100 μM glutamate, namely, escaped 2AC1/2AC1, because agonist occupancy at two GluN2 subunits are required for NMDA receptor activation (Benveniste and Mayer, 1991Benveniste M.

Thus, comparison of current responses from oocytes expressing 2AC1/2BAC2 with responses from oocytes coexpressing 2AC1/2BAC2(RK+TI) allows estimation of the fractional current mediated by escaped 2AC1/2AC1. Similarly, comparison to current responses from oocytes expressing 2AC1(RK+TI)/2BAC2 allows estimation of the fractional current mediated by escaped 2BAC2/2BAC2 (Figures 1C and 1D). The sum of the fractional currents from escaped 2AC1/2AC1 and 2BAC2/2BAC2 assessed using this approach will provide an estimate of the percent “escape” current in oocytes coexpressing 2AC1 and 2BAC2 that is mediated by receptors other than triheteromeric 2AC1/2BAC2. For the 2AC1/2BAC2 subunit combination, the percent “escape” current was between 3%–7% on days 2–4 of expression (five batches of oocytes, n = 6 oocytes each day for each batch) (Figure 1E). Similar results were obtained for 2AC1/2AC2 and 2BAC1/2BAC2 subunit combinations (Figure 1E; see also Figure S1). To provide an alternative evaluation of the efficiency by which the engineered peptide tags express a homogenous population of triheteromeric receptors, we introduced a mutation in the agonist binding pocket that reduces glutamate potency (H485A in GluN2A and H486A in GluN2B) (Anson et al., 1998Anson L.C.

If there is observable “escape” current, then glutamate concentration-response data from oocytes coexpressing wild-type and mutated subunits will have three components mediated by receptors with one binding site mutated as well as escaped wild-type and double mutant receptors. Thus, this approach will allow evaluation of an “escape” current in individual oocytes by assessing the fractional sizes of the components in the glutamate concentration-response data (see Figures S2 and S3; Table S1). The results obtained using this approach to evaluate the efficiency of the peptide tags were consistent with “escape” currents estimated using the “RK+TI” mutations. In summary, we have engineered peptide tags (C1 and C2) that upon fusion to the C terminus of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits facilitate selective expression of NMDA receptors with a defined subunit combination at the cell-surface, thereby enabling experiments on a homogenous population of triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptors. The lack of information regarding properties of triheteromeric receptors has been a major obstacle in studies using subtype-selective antagonists to assess the physiological roles of native NMDA receptors. Moreover, the inability to study triheteromeric NMDA receptors that are abundant in the adult brain complicates clinical development of subunit-selective modulators. By controlling the subunit composition of cell-surface-expressed receptors using the engineered peptide tags, we can begin to quantitatively evaluate the activity of subunit-selective modulators at GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers. We examined the GluN2A-selective antagonist TCN-201, which is a negative allosteric modulator of glycine binding to GluN1 (Bettini et al., 2010Bettini E. Sava A. Griffante C. Carignani C. Buson A.

Subunit-selective allosteric inhibition of glycine binding to NMDA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 6197-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The presence of the peptide tags in the CTD did not alter potency and maximal inhibition for TCN-201 at 2AC1/2AC2 compared to wild-type 2A/2A, and TCN-201 did not display any activity at wild-type 2B/2B and 2BAC1/2BAC2 receptors (Figure 2A; Table 1). However, the IC50 of TCN-201 increased from 370 ± 30 nM at wild-type 2A/2A (n = 8) to 1,350 ± 130 nM at 2AC1/2BAC2 triheteromers (n = 10) and maximal inhibition was reduced from 91% ± 1% to 72% ± 4% (Figure 2A; Table 1). Thus, the presence of a single GluN2A subunit in triheteromers reduces TCN-201 inhibition compared to receptors with two GluN2A subunits. TCN-201 inhibition of 2AC1/2BAC2 and 2AC2/2BAC1 triheteromers (i.e., the C1- and C2-tags were swapped between the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits) was not significantly different (Figure S4).Table 1Concentration Response Data for NMDA Receptor ModulatorsWT 2A/2A2AC1/2AC22AC1/2BAC2IC50 (nM)Max % InhibitionHill SlopenIC50 (nM)Max % InhibitionHill SlopenIC50 (nM)Max % InhibitionHill SlopenTCN-201370 ± 3091 ± 11.38360 ± 2094 ± 11.4101,350 ± 13072 ± 41.58Zn2+ (pH 7.8)62 ± 429 ± 11.110nd–––63 ± 730 ± 11.0aIndicates that the Hill slope was fixed to one during fitting of the data.10Zn2+ (pH 7.3)61 ± 457 ± 21.01869 ± 559 ± 30.91058 ± 249 ± 10.828Zn2+ (pH 6.8)47 ± 293 ± 20.86nd–––57 ± 565 ± 10.810WT 2B/2B2BAC1/2BAC22AC1/2BAC2Ifenprodil72 ± 888 ± 21.0871 ± 788 ± 21.06450 ± 3032 ± 11.116Ifenprodil (+Zn2+)54 ± 388 ± 21.06nd–––200 ± 2050 ± 21.18CP-101,60661 ± 389 ± 11.5871 ± 587 ± 21.67220 ± 2029 ± 21.49CP-101,606 (+Zn2+)46 ± 390 ± 11.36nd–––120 ± 1058 ± 21.68Data were generated using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of responses from Xenopus oocytes coexpressing GluN1, together with wild type (WT 2A/2A and WT 2B/2B) or C1- and C2-tagged GluN2 subunits.

Extracellular Zn2+ can inhibit NMDA receptors at low nanomolar concentrations in a voltage-independent manner by binding to a high-affinity site in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of GluN2A (Choi and Lipton, 1999Choi Y.B.

In addition, Zn2+ inhibition can occur through binding to the GluN2B ATD, albeit at higher micromolar concentrations (Karakas et al., 2009Karakas E. Simorowski N. Furukawa H.

Extracellular Zn2+ can also produce a nonspecific voltage-dependent channel block through binding to the NMDA receptor ion channel pore (Williams, 1996Williams K.

Despite a significant role of Zn2+ as an endogenous NMDA receptor modulator (Nozaki et al., 2011Nozaki C. Vergnano A.M. Filliol D. Ouagazzal A.M. Le Goff A. Carvalho S. Reiss D. Gaveriaux-Ruff C.

One previous study reported inhibition of triheteromers by extracellular Zn2+ in the nanomolar range but could not provide robust values for potency and efficacy (Hatton and Paoletti, 2005Hatton C.J. Paoletti P. Modulation of triheteromeric NMDA receptors by N-terminal domain ligands.Neuron. 2005; 46: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because inhibition by extracellular Zn2+ is considered relevant for the physiological function of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors (Sensi et al., 2011Sensi S.L. Paoletti P. Koh J.Y. Aizenman E. Bush A.I. Hershfinkel M. The neurophysiology and pathology of brain zinc.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 16076-16085Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we decided to determine the potency and efficacy at triheteromers. To minimize the voltage-dependent, low-affinity component of Zn2+ inhibition, we recorded at a holding potential of −20 mV and Zn2+ concentrations were kept below 300 nM. Under these conditions, we did not observe differences between Zn2+ inhibition of wild-type 2A/2A and 2AC1/2AC2, as well as wild-type 2B/2B and 2BAC1/2BAC2, supporting the idea that neither the GluN2A CTD in GluN2B nor the peptide tags change receptor properties (Figure 2B; Table 1). At physiological pH 7.3, Zn2+ displayed high-potency inhibition of wild-type 2A/2A with an IC50 value of 61 ± 4 nM and a maximal inhibition of 57% ± 2% (n = 18), consistent with previous reports (Low et al., 2000Low C.M.

At a concentration of 265 nM, extracellular Zn2+ reduced responses from wild-type 2B/2B to 80% ± 1% (n = 6) of control (Figure 2B; Table 1), consistent with minimal voltage-dependent channel block and inhibition primarily mediated through binding to the GluN2B ATD (Karakas et al., 2009Karakas E.

The presence of only a single high-affinity GluN2A binding site in the 2AC1/2BAC2 triheteromers did not change the potency of Zn2+ inhibition at physiological pH 7.3 compared to wild-type 2A/2A (Figures 2D, 2F, and 2G; Table 1). The IC50 of extracellular Zn2+ at 2AC1/2BAC2 triheteromers was 58 ± 2 nM (n = 28) compared to 61 ± 4 nM (n = 18) at wild-type 2A/2A. However, there was a reduction in the fitted maximal Zn2+ inhibition of 2AC1/2BAC2 triheteromers (49% ± 1%) compared to wild-type 2A/2A (57% ± 2%). Zn2+ inhibition of 2AC1/2BAC2 and 2AC2/2BAC1 triheteromers (i.e., the C1- and C2-tags were swapped) was not significantly different (Figure S4). The high-potency and efficacious inhibition of triheteromers by extracellular Zn2+ was unexpected and suggest that not only GluN1/GluN2A diheteromers but also GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers in the adult brain are modulated by endogenous Zn2+. Binding of Zn2+ to the GluN2A ATD increases proton inhibition of the NMDA receptor, and Zn2+ binding presumably inhibits the receptor by increasing proton affinity and thereby the fraction of protonated, nonfunctional receptors (Choi and Lipton, 1999Choi Y.B.

The episodic memory system allows us to flexibly relive past events through the recovery of details such as the people that were present, the setting in which the event took place, and the temporal relationships that structured the event. The ability to mnemonically navigate a past experience, bringing to mind a series of events in the order in which they occurred, highlights the intuition that temporal information is a fundamental organizing principle of episodic memories (Tulving, 1983Tulving E. Elements of Episodic Memory. Oxford University Press, New York1983Google Scholar). However, while it is clear that experiences unfold over time, it is less clear how the memory system handles this ebb and flow of experience. In particular, the mechanisms that support the encoding of temporally extended events are relatively underexplored. Prior work has investigated the perception and online segmentation of temporally extended events (Zacks et al., 2007Zacks J.M. Speer N.K. Swallow K.M. Braver T.S. Reynolds J.R. Event perception: a mind-brain perspective.Psychol. Bull. 2007; 133: 273-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) as well as some aspects of how memory is influenced by event boundaries (DuBrow and Davachi, 2013DuBrow S. Davachi L.

Gen. 2013; 142: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Ezzyat and Davachi, 2011Ezzyat Y. Davachi L. What constitutes an episode in episodic memory?.Psychol.

However, there has been less focus on how the memory system codes temporally extended experiences such that the temporal structure can later be recovered. Furthermore, we can remember details from past events that spanned minutes or even hours, which raises questions about how mnemonic associations are formed between event details separated in time. Thus, a more complete understanding of episodic memory will require a mapping of the mechanisms by which temporally extended events become integrated into episodic memory representations. Theoretical models of hippocampal function have emphasized its role in binding representationally distinct elements of an experience, including temporally separated events (Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993Cohen N.J. Eichenbaum H.B. Memory, Amnesia, and the Hippocampal System. MIT Press, Cambridge1993Google Scholar, Davachi, 2006Davachi L. Item, context and relational episodic encoding in humans.Curr. Opin.

Such models are motivated in part by the finding that hippocampal lesions result in impaired performance on a range of tasks, including trace conditioning (Clark and Squire, 1998Clark R.E.

In humans, fMRI has been used to show that the hippocampus is differentially activated when people are asked to bind (spatially or temporally) separated elements of an experience (Hales and Brewer, 2010Hales J.B.

However, these effects have been examined only on short timescales with the to-be-bound stimuli presented within single trials and have not been related to temporal memory. Computational models have proposed that a time-varying representation of temporal context might serve as a substrate for linking events across time (Estes, 1955Estes W.K. Statistical theory of spontaneous recovery and regression.Psychol. Rev. 1955; 62: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These models propose that items encountered in close temporal proximity share more similar temporal context representations than items that are further apart; the more similar the shared context, the more likely items are to temporally cluster during recall (Howard and Kahana, 2002Howard M.W. Kahana M.J. A distributed representation of temporal context.J. Math. Psychol. 2002; 46: 269-299Crossref Scopus (723) Google Scholar, Polyn et al., 2009Polyn S.M. Norman K.A. Kahana M.J. A context maintenance and retrieval model of organizational processes in free recall.Psychol. Rev. 2009; 116: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recent results from hippocampal neurophysiological recordings in animals have indicated the presence of encoding signals that are consistent with a representation of temporal context. One study reported that population activity in the hippocampus becomes more dissimilar as time passes, perhaps representing a time-drifting context signal (Mankin et al., 2012Mankin E.A. Sparks F.T. Slayyeh B. Sutherland R.J. Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Neuronal code for extended time in the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 19462-19467Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The level of dissimilarity in hippocampal population activity during encoding of two odors has also been shown to predict later recency discrimination performance in rodents, supporting the notion that such a signal may serve to organize temporal information in a behaviorally meaningful way (Manns et al., 2007Manns J.R. Howard M.W. Eichenbaum H. Gradual changes in hippocampal activity support remembering the order of events.Neuron. 2007; 56: 530-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Beyond patterns of population activity, recent work has also identified single-unit responses in rodents (MacDonald et al., 2011MacDonald C.J. Lepage K.Q. Eden U.T. Eichenbaum H. Hippocampal “time cells” bridge the gap in memory for discontiguous events.Neuron. 2011; 71: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) that appear to code for specific temporal “moments” between behaviorally salient events. Although it is not clear whether the single-unit and population data represent the same or distinct mechanisms, they suggest possible means by which the hippocampus may associate temporally separated events. Despite prior animal work, there is little evidence for a relationship between a hippocampal context signal during an experience and later temporal memory in humans. One prior experiment has shown that the magnitude of hippocampal blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activation during single trials is related to later memory for temporal information presented on those trials (Tubridy and Davachi, 2011Tubridy S. Davachi L. Medial temporal lobe contributions to episodic sequence encoding.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but it is not known how the hippocampus contributes to the mnemonic binding of events beyond the confines of single trials. Moreover, in our everyday experience the passage of time between events is often accompanied by other changes in context—new locations, people, and objects. To date it remains unknown how such contextual changes might influence the hippocampal mechanisms of associative memory across time. The present study was designed to investigate how stability in the pattern of hippocampal activation across trials is related to temporal memory for information encountered during those same trials. Specifically, we asked whether multivoxel patterns of BOLD activation across the hippocampus might be a substrate for encoding the temporal structure of events. Participants were scanned using fMRI while they encoded trial-unique faces and objects each presented with a scene. The scene stimuli were repeated across two or four consecutive trials, serving as our manipulation of “environmental” context across trials and capturing the intuition that context varies slowly across time. After encoding, participants made temporal memory judgments in which they indicated the temporal proximity of two items (a face and an object) from the encoding phase. Pairs of tested trials were divided based on whether or not they were encountered with an intervening scene change (context boundary), or whether they were encountered with no intervening scene change (same context). If the similarity of encoding activity patterns is a substrate for linking temporally separated events, we predicted that pattern similarity should be higher for pairs of trials later rated as having occurred closer in time. Our design also allowed us to compare how fMRI activity patterns differentially relate to temporal memory in situations of stable compared to changing environmental context. On each encoding trial, participants were instructed to imagine the face/object in the paired scene (Figure 1A). Participants reported successful imagery on a majority of encoding trials (M = 88.6% ± 2.0%), indicating that they were able to generate mental images for the object/face and scene pairings. The proportion of “yes” imagery responses did not differ based on whether the item was an object or face (object M = 88.4% ± 2.1%; face M = 88.4% ± 1.9%; F < 1) but was higher for repeated-presentation scenes relative to first-presentation scenes (repeated M = 0.89 ± 0.02; first M = 0.88 ± 0.02; F(1,19) = 4.42, p < 0.05; interaction F < 1). Participants were marginally faster to make “yes” responses on object trials relative to face trials (object M = 719 ± 27 ms; face M = 740 ± 27 ms; F(1,19) = 3.92, p < 0.07) and were significantly faster at making “yes” responses for repeated-presentation scenes relative to first-presentation scenes (repeated M = 717 ± 25 ms; first M = 741 ± 27 ms; F(1,19) = 5.37; p < 0.04; interaction F < 1). We also examined whether response times were faster on the third and fourth trials of same context quartets relative to the third and fourth trials of context boundary quartets. This was important in order to determine whether the time devoted to processing the stimuli at encoding differed across conditions, which could lead to differences in “subjective” time between items that could influence responses on the later temporal memory test. However, a direct comparison of response times on the second half of context boundary and same context quartets did not reveal any significant differences (context boundary M = 731 ± 26 ms; same context M = 718 ± 26 ms; t(19) = 1.20, p > 0.24). Responses from the temporal distance memory test were analyzed to examine whether the context boundary manipulation influenced participants’ later subjective mnemonic ratings of distance. On each trial, participants were asked to indicate the temporal distance between two items from the encoding phase (see Experimental Procedures). Critically, the actual distance between the presented items was always the same: at encoding, there were always two intervening trials between the presented retrieval probes. Thus, any differences in temporal distance responses across conditions reflect subjective mnemonic assessments of distance. Participants were significantly more likely to label same context pairs close compared to far (t(19) = 4.28, p < 0.002; interaction: F(1,19) = 16.5, p < 0.0007), but there was no difference between the proportion of close and far responses in the boundary condition (p > 0.80). Importantly, the proportion of pairs labeled close in the same context condition was higher than the proportion of pairs labeled close in the boundary condition (same context close M = 0.67 ± 0.05; boundary close M = 0.49 ± 0.04; t(19) = 4.06, p < 0.0007). Further, the proportion of pairs labeled far was greater in the context boundary compared to the same context condition (boundary far M = 0.51 ± 0.04; same context far M = 0.33 ± 0.05; t(19) = 4.06, p < 0.0007) (Figure 2A). Response times on the temporal distance memory test were also analyzed to look for evidence of context boundary-related modulations. We predicted that participants would be slower to make decisions about the temporal distance between items when they had been separated by a context boundary, compared to items in the same context condition. A context condition (boundary/same) × response (close/far) ANOVA revealed that participants were slower to make responses to boundary pairs relative to same context pairs (boundary M = 3,044 ± 266 ms; same context M = 2,818 ± 253 ms; F(1,19) = 7.35, p < 0.02). Planned comparisons showed that, for close responses, participants were significantly slower to respond for boundary pairs compared to same context pairs (boundary close M = 2,916 ± 262 ms; same context close M = 2,629 ± 199 ms; t(19) = 2.34, p < 0.04), indicating an influence of the boundary when the response was matched across conditions (Figure 2B). Collapsing across context condition, participants were also significantly slower when labeling a pair of items as far compared to close (far M = 3,089 ± 300 ms; close M = 2,773 ± 224 ms; F(1,19) = 6.01, p < 0.03). After four study-test runs of the encoding and temporal memory tasks, participants were removed from the scanner and administered a surprise source memory test for the association between the trial-unique stimuli (faces and objects) and their associated scenes. The overall proportion correct was significantly above chance (M = 0.77 ± 0.03; t(19) = 10.4, p < 10−8). We analyzed source memory as a function of temporal memory response and context condition to determine any relationship between source memory, temporal memory, and context. A context condition × temporal memory response ANOVA showed a marginal interaction (F(1,19) = 4.26, p < 0.06) and no main effects. Planned comparisons revealed this to be driven by marginally higher source memory for same context pairs rated close compared to far (same context close M = 0.80 ± 0.03; same context far M = 0.75 ± 0.02; t(19) = 2.05, p < 0.06; Figure S1 available online). These data are consistent with the idea that participants may be more likely to rely on source memory (i.e., the two items were paired with the same scene) to make temporal memory decisions in the same context condition than in the context boundary condition (see Discussion). We used pattern similarity (PS) as a measure of the extent to which stable patterns of activation were seen across trials and investigated whether hippocampal PS is related to context condition and temporal memory response. A context condition × memory response ANOVA in left hippocampus (see Experimental Procedures for region of interest [ROI] definition) showed that PS was significantly higher for pairs subsequently rated as close compared to far (close z = 0.047 ± 0.012, far z = 0.021 ± 0.014; F(1,16) = 4.7, p < 0.025 one tailed; Figure 3A). This effect was not evident in the right hippocampus, where PS did not vary with memory response (p > 0.35) or context condition (p > 0.48). Planned comparisons revealed greater PS for pairs later labeled close compared to far in the context boundary condition (t(16) = 1.91, p < 0.04 one tailed; Figure 3B) but not in the same context condition (p > 0.46), although there was not a significant interaction between factors (p < 0.3). A complementary logistic regression analysis (LaRocque et al., 2013LaRocque K.F. Smith M.E. Carr V.A. Witthoft N. Grill-Spector K. Wagner A.D. Global similarity and pattern separation in the human medial temporal lobe predict subsequent memory.J.

Neural similarity between encoding and retrieval is related to memory via hippocampal interactions.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 23: 2818-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) also showed that hippocampal PS predicted temporal memory in the context boundary condition and revealed that PS was a significantly better predictor of temporal memory than mean activation on either trial (see Supplemental Information). The PS and logistic regression analyses are consistent with the idea that PS in left hippocampus across trials is related to later temporal memory and suggest a distinct role for the similarity measures in temporal memory beyond the overall level of univariate activation. To test whether univariate hippocampal activation was related to other forms of memory (Davachi et al., 2003Davachi L. Mitchell J.P. Wagner A.D.

USA. 2003; 100: 2157-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, Kirwan and Stark, 2004Kirwan C.B. Stark C.E.L.

Dissociable correlates of recollection and familiarity within the medial temporal lobes.Neuropsychologia. 2004; 42: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), we conducted a general linear model (GLM) analysis in which each encoding trial was modeled according to whether the participant later showed correct high-confidence memory for the association between the presented stimulus (face or object) and scene (Univariate Source Memory Analysis; see Experimental Procedures). A contrast of source correct > source misses revealed a cluster in anterior left hippocampus (Figure S1) and suggests that, at least in our task, univariate activation in hippocampus was related to successful associative binding of representations presented within trials, while PS in hippocampus was related to later temporal memory for information presented across trials (full list of regions in Table S1). To determine whether the relationship between PS and later temporal memory is specific to the hippocampus, we investigated whether PS was modulated by context condition and temporal memory in category-selective ventral temporal and occipital cortical ROIs. Because of its known responsiveness to images of scenes, we first analyzed PS in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998Epstein R. Kanwisher N. A cortical representation of the local visual environment.Nature. 1998; 392: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). All effects were the same in right and left PPA, so the data are collapsed in Figure S2. Interestingly, we did not see any evidence that PS in PPA differed by context condition (left PPA: boundary z = 0.149 ± 0.047, same context z = 0.171 ± 0.043; p > 0.41; right PPA: boundary z = 0.206 ± 0.048, same context z = 0.212 ± 0.367; p > 0.80). There was also no difference in PS in left or right PPA based on participants’ subsequent temporal memory responses (p > 0.13). Several other stimulus category-selective functional ROIs were also defined (fusiform face area [FFA], lateral occipital cortex [LO], and retrosplenial cortex [RSC]; see Experimental Procedures). The majority of these regions in both the left and right hemispheres showed a pattern of results similar to that shown by PPA, that is, no significant PS differences as a function of context condition or memory (see Figure S2). The one exception was left LO (Malach et al., 1995Malach R. Reppas J.B. Benson R.R. Kwong K.K. Jiang H. Kennedy W.A. Ledden P.J. Brady T.J. Rosen B.R. Tootell R.B. Object-related activity revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging in human occipital cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), a region known to be sensitive to both objects and faces, the trial-unique memoranda employed in the current paradigm. A context condition × memory ANOVA revealed a main effect of memory such that close pairs showed higher PS relative to far pairs (close z = 0.054 ± 0.021; far z = 0.019 ± 0.026; F(1,12) = 3.28, p < 0.05 one tailed; Figure 3C). LO also showed a main effect of context condition such that PS was significantly higher for same context pairs (z = 0.075 ± 0.030) compared to boundary pairs (z = −0.002 ± 0.026; F(1,12) = 4.76, p < 0.025 one tailed). There was also an interaction between conditions (F(1,12) = 7.67, p < 0.02; Figure 3D) driven by significantly greater PS for close pairs (z = 0.128 ± 0.031) compared to far pairs (z = 0.022 ± 0.038) within the same context condition (t(12) = 3.18, p < 0.004 one tailed), but not the boundary condition (p > 0.13). Thus, PS was greater for trials remembered to be in close temporal proximity if the trials occurred in the same context but not if they were separated by a context boundary. A complementary logistic regression analysis also showed that PS in LO was a significant predictor of temporal memory in the same context condition and revealed that PS was a significantly better predictor of temporal memory than mean activation on either trial (see Supplemental Information). Finally, we also examined univariate activation in left LO for a relationship with source memory. Using an ROI-based approach in which data were extracted and averaged across left LO, we did not observe any difference in encoding activity between subsequent source correct and source miss trials (p > 0.79). The PS results in LO are distinct from those in the hippocampus, where greater PS was related to later temporal distance judgments for items separated by a context boundary. To statistically test this distinction, a comparison of PS effects in left LO and left hippocampus revealed a significant region × context condition × memory interaction (F (1,11) = 7.75, p < 0.03), showing that PS in these regions differentially contributes to mnemonic judgments of temporal distance depending on the presence or absence of shared context across trials (i.e., the context boundary/same context manipulation). Follow-up tests comparing the two regions showed that the difference in PS for close and far trials was significantly greater in hippocampus in the context boundary condition (t(11) = 2.27, p < 0.05), while the reverse was true in the same context condition (t(11) = 2.35, p < 0.04). In other words, PS in left LO appears to be more related to how close participants remember stimuli that occurred within the same context, while the same measure in the left hippocampus is more related to how close participants remember stimuli that occurred in distinct contexts. As a final step to determine the specificity of the effects described above in hippocampus and LO, we performed a searchlight analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2006Kriegeskorte N. Goebel R. Bandettini P. Information-based functional brain mapping.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 3863-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) on the whole brain designed to reveal other clusters showing similar effects. We first ran the searchlight to identify regions showing differential PS for boundary compared to same context pairs. This analysis revealed several regions in which PS was higher for context boundary pairs compared to same context pairs, including right intraparietal sulcus (Figure 4A), as well as multiple regions showing enhanced PS for same context pairs relative to context boundary pairs as observed in LO, including right medial PFC (Figure 4B; full list in Table S2). However, none of these regions showed PS effects that differentially predicted later temporal memory judgments in either context condition. We next used the searchlight to identify regions showing enhanced PS for close pairs relative to far pairs (collapsed across context condition) as observed in hippocampus and LO. At a mapwise-corrected threshold of p < 0.05, no regions emerged showing significantly greater PS for close pairs compared to far pairs. We then conducted a searchlight analysis looking for differences between close and far pairs within each of the context boundary and same context conditions individually. Again, at a corrected threshold, no regions showed significant differences between close/far PS in either context condition (see Supplemental Information). Because we used repeating scenes as our context manipulation, we investigated repetition suppression (RS) effects in the regions of interest to ask whether RS was related to our PS results. In particular, it is possible that differences in RS between the context boundary and same context conditions might be related to our observation of PS differences across these conditions, particularly in scene-responsive regions such as hippocampus. Thus, we conducted two analyses to quantify any relationship between PS and RS in our regions of interest. The first compared RS effects in hippocampus and LO; the second examined whether there was any trial-by-trial relationship between the level of RS and the level PS. In left hippocampus, there was marginal evidence for RS (S1 beta = 0.034, S2 beta = 0.019; F(1,17) = 3.77; p < 0.07) and a follow-up t test showed that RS was higher in the same context condition (same context S1 beta = 0.028, same context S2 beta = 0.003; t(17) = 2.02; p < 0.03 one tailed); however, there was no interaction between factor"

The mammalian brain generates a multitude of coexisting electrical oscillations that, by providing a multiplexed temporal framework for circuit operations, support a variety of cognitive functions (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G.

In particular, neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30–100 Hz) are instrumental in sensory processing (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F.

How does this intricate system of oscillations emerge from neuronal circuits? The mechanisms of gamma generation have been studied in detail using in vitro models (Fisahn et al., 1998Fisahn A.

These studies revealed that in hippocampal slices parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) basket cells, innervating the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells, are the key players in the genesis of pharmacologically evoked gamma frequency rhythms (Fisahn et al., 2004Fisahn A.

The diversity of GABAergic cell types with input-layer-specific axonal and dendritic distributions and cell-type-specific theta phase firing preference (reviewed in Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) represents a hallmark of the hippocampus and cortex. Could the diversity of GABAergic cells be involved in the generation of independent gamma oscillations occurring in the same structure? To address this, we concurrently recorded firing of identified PV+ basket cells, and local field potentials (LFPs) from multiple input layers in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus in vivo. Due to volume conduction, LFPs at any location are considered an unknown mixture of extracellular potentials originating from different, potentially distant sources (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G. Anastassiou C.A. Koch C. The origin of extracellular fields and currents—EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes.Nat. Rev.

How local is the local field potential?.Neuron. 2011; 72: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the nature, intensity, and temporal dynamics of localized electrical processes, we analyzed the spike timing relative to current-source-density (CSD) traces, which, unlike the LFP, are largely devoid of volume-conducted components. To explore the spatiotemporal organization of distinct gamma oscillations, we simultaneously recorded LFP from 16 linearly arranged sites on a single-shank silicon probe with 100 μm contact spacing, stereotactically inserted approximately perpendicular to the input layers of the dorsal CA1 hippocampus of anaesthetized rats (Figure 1; Figure S1 available online). In these experiments (n = 37), the positioning of the probe was guided by variations in the electrophysiological signals to cover all input layers of the CA1 and was confirmed by histological analysis (Figures 2B and S1A). We analyzed gamma oscillations during theta oscillations. LFP recordings from stratum pyramidale confirmed earlier observations on the preferential occurrence of transient gamma oscillations on the peak of the theta cycle (Figures 1A and S1B) (Bragin et al., 1995Bragin A. Jandó G. Nádasdy Z. Hetke J. Wise K. Buzsáki G. Gamma (40-100 Hz) oscillation in the hippocampus of the behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 47-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, dynamics of more localized CSD recordings revealed theta rhythmic alternation of CSD gamma oscillations in stratum pyramidale and lacunosum-moleculare (Figures 1A and S1B), a phenomenon inconsistent with a single gamma oscillator. CSD gamma oscillations in the pyramidal layer (Figure 1A, red shading) were found to be enhanced on the trough of theta oscillations and appeared to have higher frequency than CSD gamma oscillations in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figure 1A, blue shading), which occurred mostly on theta peaks. The similar frequency and theta modulation of LFP gamma oscillations in stratum pyramidale and LFP and CSD gamma oscillation in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figures 1B and S1B) imply that LFP in the pyramidal layer, which has been the most frequent way of detecting hippocampal gamma oscillations, is dominated by volume-conducted gamma oscillations from elsewhere, most likely from stratum lacunosum-moleculare.Figure 2Spikes of an Identified Parvalbumin-Expressing Basket Cell Are Selectively Phase Coupled to Gammaperisomatic, but Not Gammaapical tuft OscillationsShow full caption(A) Silicon probe recordings of LFP from stratum pyramidale and gamma-filtered (20–80 Hz) CSD from stratum lacunosum-moleculare and pyramidale, and extracellular (glass electrode) recording of spikes of an identified parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) basket cell (B96b).

We analyzed CSD (or LFP) gamma oscillation amplitude as a function of input layer, frequency (20–100 Hz), and theta phase (from pyramidal layer LFP; Figure 1B). This analysis (n = 22 for CSD, and n = 6 for LFP) showed that CSD in stratum lacunosum-moleculare was dominated by an ∼30 Hz gamma oscillation waxing and waning in concert with the peak of the theta cycle (Figure 1B, right, filled blue arrowhead), while pyramidal layer CSD was dominated by a faster, ∼50 Hz gamma oscillation that was preferentially activated around the trough of the theta cycle (Figure 1B, right, filled red arrowhead). These characteristic patterns were not restricted to strata pyramidale and lacunosum-moleculare, but extended into stratum oriens and the proximal ∼200 μm of the stratum radiatum (the perisomatic zone) and into the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the distal part of the stratum radiatum, and occasionally the alveus (distal dendritic zone), respectively (Figures 1B, 2E, and 7C). In CSD analysis, patterns characteristic of pyramidal layer and stratum lacunosum-moleculare were not observed in stratum lacunosum-moleculare and the pyramidal layer, respectively (Figure 1B, right, open red and blue arrowheads). Thus, we define two CSD gamma oscillations, one centered on the pyramidal layer that we will call “perisomatic gamma” (gammaperisomatic) and another localized to distal dendrites that we will call “apical tuft gamma” (gammaapical tuft) oscillations. The distinct character of the two could not be revealed in LFP recordings (Figure 1B, left), and therefore, we based all further analyses of gamma oscillations on CSD analysis. We also performed recordings with a linear 16-site silicon probe with 50 μm contact spacing inserted into the dorsal CA1 hippocampus of drug-free, head-fixed mice (n = 3). The spatiotemporal distribution of CSD gamma oscillations was qualitatively consistent with that observed in urethane-anaesthetized rats, with the gamma oscillations in strata lacunosum-moleculare and radiatum preferentially occurring on the peak and gamma oscillations around stratum pyramidale preferentially occurring on the trough/descending phase of theta oscillations (Figure 1C). How does the activity of PV+ basket cells, reported to generate gamma oscillations in vitro, correlate with distinct hippocampal CSD gamma oscillations in space and time? We corecorded identified PV+ basket cells with extracellular glass electrodes and LFPs from the silicon probe placed nearby. Based on the characteristic enrichment of axon terminals in the pyramidal layer and its immediate vicinity (Figure 2B) and PV immunoreactivity (Figure 2C), we identified five juxtacellularly labeled CA1 cells as PV+ basket cells (Figure 2B). Dendrites of PV+ basket cells had radial orientation and spanned strata oriens and radiatum, but they extended little into stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figure 2B) (Tukker et al., 2013Tukker J.J. Lasztóczi B. Katona L. Roberts J.D. Pissadaki E.K. Dalezios Y. Márton L. Zhang L. Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Distinct dendritic arborization and in vivo firing patterns of parvalbumin-expressing basket cells in the hippocampal area CA3.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 6809-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All PV+ basket cells successfully tested were immunonegative for neuropeptide Y (n = 3) and somatostatin (n = 1) and immunopositive for PV (n = 5), Erb4 (n = 1), and the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor (n = 1). Upon visual inspection during theta oscillations, spikes of PV+ basket cells appeared to be coincident with increased gamma oscillation amplitude in CSD recordings from the perisomatic zone (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E). By contrast, CSD gamma oscillations in the distal dendritic zone were found to decrease in amplitude when PV+ basket cells were active (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E). These correlations were a consequence of concerted theta phase modulation of gammaperisomatic, gammaapical tuft, and the firing of PV+ basket cells (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E). The firing of the cell B96b (Figure 2) was significantly (p << 0.001; Rayleigh test; n = 4,450 spikes) biased to the descending phase of the LFP theta cycle in stratum pyramidale (mean phase angle was 326°) (Figure 2E) (Klausberger et al., 2003Klausberger T. Magill P.J. Márton L.F. Roberts J.D. Cobden P.M. Buzsáki G. Somogyi P. Brain-state- and cell-type-specific firing of hippocampal interneurons in vivo.Nature. 2003; 421: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), when gammaperisomatic was strong and gammaapical tuft was weak (red arrowheads in Figure 2E). Firing of the PV+ basket cells was not only positively correlated"

Each individual's attitude to probability, sometimes called risk proneness or aversion, has been assumed to be static. Behavioral ecological studies, however, suggest such attitudes are dynamically modulated by the context an organism finds itself in; in some cases, it may be optimal to pursue actions with a low probability of success but which are associated with potentially large gains. We show that human subjects rapidly adapt their use of probability as a function of current resources, goals, and opportunities for further foraging. We demonstrate that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) carries signals indexing the pressure to pursue unlikely choices and signals related to the taking of such choices. We show that dACC exerts this control over behavior when it, rather than ventromedial prefrontal cortex, interacts with posterior cingulate cortex."

Our results reveal a regulatory mechanism critical to NR2B function that can be targeted for the development of cognitive enhancers. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors that exhibit broad expression within the nervous system and are critically involved in neuronal processes such as synaptic plasticity and learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar, Martin et al., 2000Martin S.J. Grimwood P.D. Morris R.G. Synaptic plasticity and memory: an evaluation of the hypothesis.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 649-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). Functional NMDARs are obligate heterotetrameric complexes formed by two glycine-binding GluN1 subunits assembled with two of several isoforms of the glutamate-binding GluN2 (A, B, C, or D subtypes) or glycine-binding GluN3 (A or B subtypes) (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G.

Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). The biophysical properties of NMDARs are dependent on their subunit composition (Morrisett, 1997Morrisett R. Electrophysiologic characteristics of heteromeric recombinant NMDA receptors.in: Monaghan D.T. Wenthold R.J. The Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa1997Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, NMDAR subunit composition varies greatly between different synapses and neurons, as well as during neuronal development (Monyer et al., 1994Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Developmental and regional expression in the rat brain and functional properties of four NMDA receptors.Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar, Sheng et al., 1994Sheng M.

Changing subunit composition of heteromeric NMDA receptors during development of rat cortex.Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Therefore, precise spatiotemporal regulation of NMDAR subunit expression, composition, trafficking, and localization is critical for proper neuronal function. Brain regions involved in mnemonic functions rely predominantly upon GluN2A (NR2A) and GluN2B (NR2B) subunit-containing NMDARs. During postnatal development, NR2B expression steadily decreases, whereas NR2A levels rise. Compared to NR2A-containing NMDARs, receptors that include NR2B inactivate more slowly and, consequently, have been associated with increased levels of synaptic plasticity (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G. Leszkiewicz D.N. Role of distinct NMDA receptor subtypes at central synapses.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, Lau and Zukin, 2007Lau C.G. Zukin R.S. NMDA receptor trafficking in synaptic plasticity and neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Consistently, upregulation of NR2B expression in mice improves synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C. Malenka R.C. A critical period for long-term potentiation at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1995; 375: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Tang et al., 1999Tang Y.P. Shimizu E. Dube G.R.

Numerous animal models that feature elevated NR2B levels via altered synthesis, transport, or degradation exhibit improved synaptic plasticity and memory (Lee and Silva, 2009Lee Y.S. Silva A.J. The molecular and cellular biology of enhanced cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Hence, targeting NR2B and its regulatory machinery has been singled out as an attractive approach for cognitive enhancement (Bibb et al., 2010Bibb J.A. Mayford M.R. Tsien J.Z. Alberini C.M.

One possible strategy to increase NR2B levels involves induction of its de novo synthesis, for example, via cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated gene expression or chromatin remodeling (Fujita et al., 2012Fujita Y.

The molecular machinery regulating trafficking, subcellular localization, and degradation of NMDAR subunits is not yet well understood, but it has been recognized that phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits including NR2B is important for the regulation of such processes (Chen and Roche, 2007Chen B.S.

One protein kinase implicated in the metabolism of NR2B is Cdk5 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 5), although no direct phosphorylation of NR2B by Cdk5 has been reported (Hawasli et al., 2007Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A.

Cdk5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that is activated upon interaction with the neuron-specific cofactors p35 or p39 (Dhavan and Tsai, 2001Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. A decade of CDK5.Nat.

Cdk5 has been implicated in numerous CNS processes, including cortical layer formation, neurotransmission, and mnemonic functions (Angelo et al., 2006Angelo M. Plattner F. Giese K.P. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a previous study showed that Cdk5 conditional knockout (cKO) mice have improved synaptic plasticity and learning and memory via regulation of NR2B degradation by calpain (Hawasli et al., 2007Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 governs learning and synaptic plasticity via control of NMDAR degradation.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing the truncated Cdk5 activator p25 also exhibit enhanced plasticity and memory formation (Angelo et al., 2003Angelo M. Plattner F. Irvine E.E. Giese K.P. Improved reversal learning and altered fear conditioning in transgenic mice with regionally restricted p25 expression.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Angelo et al., 2006Angelo M. Plattner F. Giese K.P. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.J.

Opposing roles of transient and prolonged expression of p25 in synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory.Neuron. 2005; 48: 825-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced Cdk5 expression or displacement from physiological substrates potentiates synaptic remodeling processes. Despite these results indicating a close mechanistic relationship between NR2B and Cdk5 in the control of mnemonic functions, the underlying molecular processes remain unknown. Here we show that Cdk5 directly phosphorylates NR2B at Ser1116 and that the phosphorylation state of this serine residue is specifically regulated by physiological neuronal activity. Cdk5-dependent Ser1116 phosphorylation prevents cell surface expression of NR2B-containing NMDAR and thus attenuates synaptic transmission. Disrupting the Cdk5-mediated regulation of NR2B via small interfering peptides (siPs) to block protein-protein interactions reduces this phosphorylation, increases NR2B surface levels, facilitates neurotransmission, and improves hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, suggesting that this regulatory mechanism may indeed be a suitable target for the development of cognitive enhancers. Cdk5 has been previously shown to contribute to synaptic plasticity and memory formation through its control of NR2B (GluR2B) levels via calpain-mediated degradation (Hawasli et al., 2007Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 governs learning and synaptic plasticity via control of NMDAR degradation.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because Cdk5 directly associates with this receptor, we investigated whether it could phosphorylate NR2B. To identify novel Cdk5 phosphorylation sites, we employed a PhosphoScan approach utilizing antibody-based enrichment of phospho-peptides from mouse brain with a phospho-specific Cdk5 substrate antibody followed by tandem mass spectrometry (Rush et al., 2005Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Immunoaffinity profiling of tyrosine phosphorylation in cancer cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). This approach identified Ser1116 within the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal of NR2B as a novel Cdk5 phosphorylation site (Figures 1A and 1B ). To monitor physiological changes in Ser1116 NR2B phosphorylation, a phosphorylation state-specific antibody was generated. The phospho-Ser1116 (P-S1116) NR2B antibody detected time-dependent in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant NR2B at Ser1116 by Cdk5 (Figure 1C). Analysis of various mouse brain regions, namely cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum, further revealed that NR2B is phosphorylated at Ser1116 in vivo (Figures S1A and S1B available online), indicating that this NR2B phosphorylation functions broadly throughout the brain. Treatment of acute mouse hippocampal slices with the specific Cdk5 inhibitor CP681301 caused dose-dependent P-S1116 NR2B reduction (Figure 1D). Moreover, Cdk5 inhibitor-induced reduction of NR2B phosphorylation at Ser1116 followed a similar time course as did the reduction of phospho-Thr75 DARPP-32, a well-established Cdk5 substrate (Figure S1C; Bibb et al., 1999Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.-H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. et al.Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by Cdk5 modulates dopamine signalling in neurons.Nature. 1999; 402: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Finally, P-S1116 NR2B levels were markedly reduced in hippocampal lysate of Cdk5 cKO mice (Hawasli et al., 2007Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 governs learning and synaptic plasticity via control of NMDAR degradation.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Figure 1E). Together, these results demonstrate that Ser1116 of NR2B is a physiological Cdk5 phosphorylation site and raise the question of how this posttranslational modification might affect NR2B function. NMDARs are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum, trafficked along the secretory pathway, and delivered to the postsynaptic plasma membrane (Lau and Zukin, 2007Lau C.G. Zukin R.S. NMDA receptor trafficking in synaptic plasticity and neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, Wenthold et al., 2003Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Trafficking of NMDA receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery underlying NMDAR trafficking and subcellular localization is not yet well characterized, but it has been recognized that phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits including NR2B is important for the regulation of such processes (Chen and Roche, 2007Chen B.S. Roche K.W. Regulation of NMDA receptors by phosphorylation.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 53: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, Ma and Jan, 2002Ma D. Jan L.Y.

Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Trafficking of NMDA receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We noted that Ser1116 of NR2B occurs adjacent to a putative ER retention signal, RXR (Ma and Jan, 2002Ma D. Jan L.Y. ER transport signals and trafficking of potassium channels and receptors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (i.e., NH2-…RRRPPRS∗PDHK…COOH), and, therefore, investigated whether Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of NR2B at Ser1116 affected its subcellular localization. The effect of Cdk5 inhibition on NR2B cell surface levels was assessed in cultured hippocampal neurons overexpressing NR2B tagged with extracellular N-terminal green-fluorescent protein (GFP-NR2B). Immunofluorescence staining via anti-GFP antibody thus enabled visualization of cell surface GFP-NR2B. Surface-stained GFP-NR2B exhibited a punctate pattern within dendritic processes (Figure 1F). Counterlabeling with Homer-1, a marker of postsynaptic densities (PSDs), demonstrated that the cell surface fraction of GFP-NR2B localized in proximity to PSDs. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with the Cdk5 inhibitor CP681301 increased surface expression of NR2B in dendritic processes approximately 1.3-fold (Figures 1F and 1G), suggesting that NR2B phosphorylation by Cdk5 modulates NR2B surface levels. The abundance of postsynaptic NMDARs is a major determinant of synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Lee and Silva, 2009Lee Y.S. Silva A.J. The molecular and cellular biology of enhanced cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Tang et al., 1999Tang Y.P. Shimizu E. Dube G.R. Rampon C. Kerchner G.A. Zhuo M. Liu G. Tsien J.Z. Genetic enhancement of learning and memory in mice.Nature. 1999; 401: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Thus, blocking Cdk5-dependent retention of NR2B from the cell surface could be important in regulating its contribution to NMDAR function. To assess this directly, mouse hippocampal brain slices were treated with either CP681301 or vehicle (Figure 2A). Cdk5 inhibition increased cell surface expression of NR2B 3.5-fold with concomitant reduction in P-S1116 levels to approximately 30% of untreated controls. The effect appeared specific for NR2B because no changes in surface levels of NR2A or the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 were observed (Figures S2A and S2B). To evaluate the impact of Cdk5-dependent regulation of NR2B surface levels on physiological function, whole-cell voltage-clamp recording of synaptically evoked NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were conducted in CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices treated with the Cdk5 inhibitor CP681301 (Figures 2B–2D). Administration of CP681301 increased the NMDAR-EPSC amplitude by approximately 1.5-fold. Furthermore, application of the NR2B-specific inhibitor ifenprodil had a greater attenuating effect on NMDAR-EPSCs in CP681301-treated slices (33% reduction) in comparison to controls (20% reduction) (Figure 2C), suggesting that the NR2B component of NMDAR-EPSCs was increased by Cdk5 inhibition. The deactivation kinetics of NMDAR EPSCs was increased in CP681301-treated slices (170.7 ± 19.4 ms) as compared to untreated slices (112.1 ± 10.5 ms) (Figure 2D). This result is consistent with increased NR2B function in response to CP681301 treatment, because NR2B-containing NMDARs inactivate more slowly than receptors composed of other subunits (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G. Leszkiewicz D.N. Role of distinct NMDA receptor subtypes at central synapses.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that Cdk5 regulates the subcellular localization of NMDAR via NR2B phosphorylation at Ser1116, thereby controlling the level of functional NR2B-containing NMDARs within the synaptic membrane and modulating NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents. NMDARs are central to glutamatergic neurotransmission (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar) and are controlled by complex molecular machinery integrating various postsynaptic signaling cascades (Husi et al., 2000Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Proteomic analysis of NMDA receptor-adhesion protein signaling complexes.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, Newpher and Ehlers, 2008Newpher T.M. Ehlers M.D. Glutamate receptor dynamics in dendritic microdomains.Neuron. 2008; 58: 472-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To better understand how Cdk5-dependent NR2B phosphorylation might be regulated and contribute to NR2B function in plasticity and memory formation, the effect of glutamatergic neurotransmission on P-S1116 NR2B was assessed ex vivo and in vivo. Treatment of acute mouse hippocampus slices with NMDA dose-dependently attenuated P-S1116, when normalized to total NR2B levels (Figure 3A). NMDA treatment also reduced total NR2B levels, consistent with previous reports of NMDA-induced, calpain-mediated NR2B degradation (Guttmann et al., 2001Guttmann R.P. Baker D.L. Seifert K.M. Cohen A.S. Coulter D.A. Lynch D.R. Specific proteolysis of the NR2 subunit at multiple sites by calpain.J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Hawasli et al., 2007Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 governs learning and synaptic plasticity via control of NMDAR degradation.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The ability of NMDA to reduce P-S1116 in hippocampal slices was attenuated by treatment with the PP2A/PP1 inhibitor okadaic acid (Figure S2C), indicating that some of the NMDAR-induced effect on P-S1116 is mediated via serine/threonine phosphatase activity. In agreement with the attenuating effect of NMDA on P-S1116, induction of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal area CA1 also reduced P-S1116. Tetanic stimulation of mouse Schaffer commissural-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in vivo caused a significant increase in fEPSP slope (1.4-fold as compared to baseline) that was maintained for 1 hr poststimulus (Figure 3B). One hour after LTP induction, P-S1116 was reduced to approximately 40% of the level in control CA1 lysates (Figure 3C), demonstrating the physiological regulation of P-S1116 in synaptic plasticity. In contrast, induction of long-term depression (LTD) did not affect P-S1116 levels (Figures 3D and 3E). Because excitatory activation of hippocampal NMDAR is integral to learning and memory (Nakazawa et al., 2004Nakazawa K. McHugh T.J. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S. NMDA receptors, place cells and hippocampal spatial memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we also assessed the involvement of Cdk5-dependent NR2B phosphorylation in mnemonic processes by evaluating P-S1116 levels after contextual fear conditioning. One hour after training, P-S1116 was reduced in CA1 lysates of fear-conditioned mice to 80% of the levels in nonshocked context-exposed controls (Figure 3F). Foot shock in the absence of context had no effect on P-S1116. Taken together, these results show that NR2B phosphorylation at Ser1116 is regulated by glutamatergic neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory, suggesting an important role for this signaling mechanism in cognition. NR2B and Cdk5 form a complex both in vitro and in vivo (Hawasli et al., 2007Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 governs learning and synaptic plasticity via control of NMDAR degradation.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To identify physiological protein-protein interaction sites between NR2B and Cdk5, overlapping eight amino acid peptide cassettes of the NR2B carboxy-terminal domain were synthesized on a peptide microarray microchip (Gao et al., 2004Gao X.B. Pellois J.P. Na Y. Kim Y. Gulari E. Zhou X. High density peptide microarrays. In situ synthesis and applications.Mol. Divers. 2004; 8: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that was then probed for Cdk5 binding via recombinant Cdk5 followed by immunodetection with anti-Cdk5 antibody (Figure 4A). Four motifs exhibiting high Cdk5 binding were identified by this approach (Figure 4B). To determine whether these motifs were actual NR2B-Cdk5 interaction sites, peptides corresponding to these motifs were synthesized and tested for their ability to interfere with NR2B-Cdk5 binding. In this screen, the peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1111–1127 (RRPPRSPDHKRYFRDKE; NR2B small interfering peptide [NR2B siP]) most potently blocked the pull-down of Cdk5 by recombinant GST-tagged NR2B in vitro (Figure 4C). Moreover, the NR2B siP dose-dependently inhibited in vitro phosphorylation of Ser1116 NR2B by Cdk5 (Figure 4D). In contrast, a scrambled control peptide (RRRSYFHKEDRPPRDK) did not attenuate Ser1116 phosphorylation in vitro. Interestingly, the NR2B siP did not inhibit the in vitro phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 (Figure S3A), a well-defined Cdk5 substrate (Nguyen et al., 2007Nguyen C. Nishi A. Kansy J.W. Fernandez J. Hayashi K. Gillardon F. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Bibb J.A. Regulation of protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16511-16520Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that the inhibition of Ser1116 NR2B phosphorylation by NR2B siP was specific. To further assess the efficacy and consequences of targeting Cdk5-NR2B protein interactions by small interfering peptides ex vivo and in vivo, cell-permeabilizing polyarginine or penetratin N-terminal tags were included in the NR2B siP and control peptides. These tags are commonly used to deliver peptides across the cell membrane into the cytosol of neurons (Joliot and Prochiantz, 2004Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Transduction peptides: from technology to physiology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effects observed in vitro, application of the NR2B siP to hippocampal slices decreased P-S1116 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figures 4E and S3B). Treatment with the NR2B siP did not alter levels of NR2B or Cdk5 expression (Figures 4E and S3B). The specificity of NR2B siP observed in vitro was retained in vivo; it had no effect on the phosphorylation state of the well-characterized Cdk5 site Thr75 DARPP-32 (Bibb et al., 1999Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.-H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. et al.Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by Cdk5 modulates dopamine signalling in neurons.Nature. 1999; 402: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), but it time-dependently reduced P-S1116 in acute mouse striatal slices (Figures S3C and S3D). These data show selective modulation of P-S1116 by siP and also that this mechanism may be targeted in multiple limbic structures mediating learning and memory. Furthermore, NR2B siP treatment of hippocampal slices effectively blocked subsequent coimmunoprecipitation of Cdk5 and NR2B (Figure 4F), indicating that siP disrupts Cdk5-NR2B protein-protein interactions. In contrast, treatment with scrambled control or the Cdk5 inhibitor CP681301 did not affect Cdk5-NR2B interactions. Consistent with our data that Cdk5 regulates NR2B cell surface expression, the siP induced a 3.3-fold increase in NR2B cell surface levels in hippocampal slices (Figure 4G). Finally, cell surface GFP-NR2B levels i"

Here we report the structure of CarC in complex with its substrate and biophysical dissection of its reaction to reveal the stereoinversion mechanism. An Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate abstracts the hydrogen (H•) from C5, and tyrosine 165, a residue not visualized in the published structures of CarC lacking bound substrate, donates H• to the opposite face of the resultant radical. The reaction oxidizes the Fe(II) cofactor to Fe(III), limiting wild-type CarC to one turnover, but substitution of the H•-donating tyrosine disables stereoinversion and confers to CarC the capacity for catalytic substrate oxidation."

In the rodent vibrissa system, an ideal observer analysis of cortical activity measured using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in anesthetized animals was combined with behavioral detection and discrimination tasks, thalamic recordings from awake animals, and computational modeling to show that spatial discrimination performance was improved following adaptation, but at the expense of the ability to detect weak stimuli. Together, these results provide direct behavioral evidence for the trade-off between detectability and discriminability, that this trade-off can be modulated through bottom-up sensory adaptation, and that these effects correspond to important changes in thalamocortical coding properties."

https://openalex.org/W2050868489,"Dendrites from the same neuron usually develop nonoverlapping patterns by self-avoidance, a process requiring contact-dependent recognition and repulsion. Recent studies have implicated homophilic interactions of cell surface molecules, including Dscams and Pcdhgs, in self-recognition, but repulsive molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report a role for the secreted molecule Slit2 and its receptor Robo2 in self-avoidance of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Both molecules are highly expressed by PCs, and their deletion leads to excessive dendrite self-crossing without affecting arbor size and shape. This cell-autonomous function is supported by the boundary-establishing activity of Slit in culture and the phenotype rescue by membrane-associated Slit2 activities. Furthermore, genetic studies show that they act independently from Pcdhg-mediated recognition. Finally, PC-specific deletion of Robo2 is associated with motor behavior alterations. Thus, our study uncovers a local repulsive mechanism required for self-avoidance and demonstrates the molecular complexity at the cell surface in dendritic patterning."

Here we describe the subcellular localization of CB1 cannabinoid receptors and eCB synthetic machinery at glutamatergic synapses in the CeA and find that CeA neurons exhibit multiple mechanistically and temporally distinct modes of postsynaptic eCB mobilization. These data identify a prominent role for eCBs in the modulation of excitatory drive to CeA neurons and provide insight into the mechanisms by which eCB signaling and exogenous cannabinoids could regulate stress responses and emotional learning."

Our studies also point to a possible role of SAMe in establishing the aberrant DNA methylation patterns in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy, implicating SAMe in the pathogenesis of this disease.

https://openalex.org/W2077121920,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease resulting from immune dysregulation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important in the prevention of psoriasis. Traditionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be implicated in the progression of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, but many recent studies suggested the protective role of ROS in immune-mediated diseases. In particular, severe cases of psoriasis vulgaris have been reported to be successfully treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), which raises tissue level of ROS. Also it was reported that Treg function was closely associated with ROS level. However, it has been only investigated in lowered levels of ROS so far. Thus, in this study, to clarify the relationship between ROS level and Treg function, as well as their role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we investigated imiquimod-induced psoriatic dermatitis (PD) in association with Treg function both in elevated and lowered levels of ROS by using knockout mice, such as glutathione peroxidase-1−/− and neutrophil cytosolic factor-1−/− mice, as well as by using HBOT or chemicals, such as 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and N-acetylcysteine. The results consistently showed Tregs were hyperfunctional in elevated levels of ROS, whereas hypofunctional in lowered levels of ROS. In addition, imiquimod-induced PD was attenuated in elevated levels of ROS, whereas aggravated in lowered levels of ROS. For the molecular mechanism that may link ROS level and Treg function, we investigated the expression of an immunoregulatory enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which is induced by ROS, in PD lesions. Taken together, it was implied that appropriately elevated levels of ROS might prevent psoriasis through enhancing IDO expression and Treg function."
https://openalex.org/W1968083515,"Background In a rapidly changing world, it is of fundamental importance to understand processes constraining or facilitating adaptation through microevolution. As different traits of an organism covary, genetic correlations are expected to affect evolutionary trajectories. However, only limited empirical data are available. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigate the extent to which multivariate constraints affect the rate of adaptation, focusing on four morphological traits often shown to harbour large amounts of genetic variance and considered to be subject to limited evolutionary constraints. Our data set includes unique long-term data for seven bird species and a total of 10 populations. We estimate population-specific matrices of genetic correlations and multivariate selection coefficients to predict evolutionary responses to selection. Using Bayesian methods that facilitate the propagation of errors in estimates, we compare (1) the rate of adaptation based on predicted response to selection when including genetic correlations with predictions from models where these genetic correlations were set to zero and (2) the multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection to the average evolvability in random directions of the phenotypic space. We show that genetic correlations on average decrease the predicted rate of adaptation by 28%. Multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection was systematically lower than average evolvability in random directions of space. These significant reductions in the rate of adaptation and reduced evolvability were due to a general nonalignment of selection and genetic variance, notably orthogonality of directional selection with the size axis along which most (60%) of the genetic variance is found. Conclusions These results suggest that genetic correlations can impose significant constraints on the evolution of avian morphology in wild populations. This could have important impacts on evolutionary dynamics and hence population persistence in the face of rapid environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2028941604,"Scar formation following skin injury can be a major psychosocial and physiological problem. However, the mechanisms of scar formation are still not completely understood. Previous studies have shown that wound healing in oral mucosa is faster, associates with a reduced inflammatory response and results to significantly reduced scar formation compared with skin wounds. In the present study, we hypothesized that oral mucosal fibroblasts from human gingiva are inherently distinct from fibroblasts from breast and abdominal skin, two areas prone to excessive scar formation, which may contribute to the preferential wound healing outcome in gingiva. To this end, we compared the phenotype of human gingival and skin fibroblasts cultured in in vivo-like three-dimensional (3D) cultures that mimic the cells' natural extracellular matrix (ECM) niche. To establish 3D cultures, five parallel fibroblast lines from human gingiva (GFBLs) and breast skin (SFBLs) were seeded in high density, and cultured for up to 21 days in serum and ascorbic acid containing medium to induce expression of wound-healing transcriptome and ECM deposition. Cell proliferation, morphology, phenotype and expression of wound healing and scar related genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemical methods. The expression of a set of genes was also studied in three parallel lines of human abdominal SFBLs. Findings showed that GFBLs displayed morphologically distinct organization of the 3D cultures and proliferated faster than SFBLs. GFBLs expressed elevated levels of molecules involved in regulation of inflammation and ECM remodeling (MMPs) while SFBLs showed significantly higher expression of TGF-β signaling, ECM and myofibroblast and cell contractility-related genes.

https://openalex.org/W2083221109,"About 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harbour mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3, mostly internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations of the second tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). It was the aim of this study to comprehensively analyze clinical and functional properties of various FLT3 mutants. In 672 normal karyotype AML patients FLT3-ITD, but not FLT3-TKD mutations were associated with a worse relapse free and overall survival in multivariate analysis. In paired diagnosis-relapse samples FLT3-ITD showed higher stability (70%) compared to FLT3-TKD (30%). In vitro, FLT3-ITD induced a strong activating phenotype in Ba/F3 cells. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutations and other point mutations--including two novel mutations--showed a weaker but clear gain-of-function phenotype with gradual increase in proliferation and protection from apoptosis. The pro-proliferative capacity of the investigated FLT3 mutants was associated with cell surface expression and tyrosine 591 phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor. Western blot experiments revealed STAT5 activation only in FLT3-ITD positive cell lines, in contrast to FLT3-non-ITD mutants, which displayed an enhanced signal of AKT and MAPK activation. Gene expression analysis revealed distinct difference between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD for STAT5 target gene expression as well as deregulation of SOCS2, ENPP2, PRUNE2 and ART3. FLT3-ITD and FLT3 point mutations show a gain-of-function phenotype with distinct signalling properties in vitro. Although poor prognosis in AML is only associated with FLT3-ITD, all activating FLT3 mutations can contribute to leukemogenesis and are thus potential targets for therapeutic interventions."

This study examines the separate and inter-related associations of education and household wealth in relation to obesity in women in a representative sample of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).The seven largest national surveys were selected from a list of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) ordered by decreasing sample size and resulted in a range of country income levels. These were nationally representative data of women aged 15-49 years collected in the period 2005-2010. The separate and joint effects, unadjusted and adjusted for age group, parity, and urban/rural residence using a multivariate logistic regression model are presented.In the four middle-income countries (Colombia, Peru, Jordan, and Egypt), an interaction was found between education and wealth on obesity (P-value for interaction <0.001). Among women with no/primary education the wealth effect was positive whereas in the group with higher education it was either absent or inverted (negative). In the poorer countries (India, Nigeria, Benin), there was no evidence of an interaction. Instead, the associations between each of education and wealth with obesity were independent and positive. There was a statistically significant difference between the average interaction estimates for the low-income and middle-income countries (P<0.001).The findings suggest that education may protect against the obesogenic effects of increased household wealth as countries develop. Further research could examine the factors explaining the country differences in education effects."
https://openalex.org/W2152709750,"Tau alterations are now considered an executor of neuronal demise and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mouse models combining amyloidosis and tauopathy and their parental counterparts are important tools to further investigate the interplay of abnormal amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau species in pathogenesis, synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Here, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with 5 early-onset familial AD mutations (5xFAD) and TauP301S (PS19) transgenic mice, denoted F+/T+ mice, and phenotypically compared them to their respective parental strains, denoted F+/T– and F–/T+ respectively, as controls. We found dramatically aggravated tauopathy (~10-fold) in F+/T+ mice compared to the parental F–/T+ mice. In contrast, amyloidosis was unaltered compared to the parental F+/T– mice. Tauopathy was invariably and very robustly aggravated in hippocampal and cortical brain regions. Most important, F+/T+ displayed aggravated cognitive deficits in a hippocampus-dependent spatial navigation task, compared to the parental F+/T– strain, while parental F–/T+ mice did not display cognitive impairment. Basal synaptic transmission was impaired in F+/T+ mice compared to nontransgenic mice and the parental strains (≥40%). Finally, F+/T+ mice displayed a significant hippocampal atrophy (~20%) compared to nontransgenic mice, in contrast to the parental strains. Our data indicate for the first time that pathological Aβ species (or APP/PS1) induced changes in Tau contribute to cognitive deficits correlating with synaptic deficits and hippocampal atrophy in an AD model. Our data lend support to the amyloid cascade hypothesis with a role of pathological Aβ species as initiator and pathological Tau species as executor.—Stancu, I.-C., Ris, L., Vasconcelos, B., Marinangeli, C., Goeminne, L., Laporte, V., Haylani, L.

https://openalex.org/W2128321922,"Exposure to microgravity results in cardiovascular deconditioning, and cerebrovascular oxidative stress injury has been suggested to occur. To elucidate the mechanism for this condition, we investigated whether simulated microgravity induces mitochondrial dysfunction in rat arteries. Four-week hindlimb unweighting (HU) was used to simulate microgravity in rats. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR), MnSOD/GPx activity and expression, and mitochondrial malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined in rat cerebral and mesenteric VSMCs. Compared with the control rats, mitochondrial ROS levels, mPTP opening, and MDA content increased significantly (P< 0.001, P<0.01, and P<0.01, respectively), Δψm, RCR, MnSOD/GPx activity (P<0.001 for Δψm and RCR; P<0.05 for MnSOD; and P< 0.001 for GPx activity) and protein abundance of mitochondrial MnSOD/GPx-1 decreased (P<0.001 for MnSOD and GPx-1) in HU rat cerebral but not mesenteric arteries. Chronic treatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTempol promoted recovery of mitochondrial function in HU rat cerebral arteries, but exerted no effects on HU rat mesenteric arteries. Therefore, simulated microgravity resulted in cerebrovascular mitochondrial dysfunction, and crosstalk between NADPH oxidase and mitochondria participated in the process.—Zhang, R., Ran, H.-H., Cai, L.-L, Zhu, L., Sun, J.-F., Peng, L., Liu, X.-J., Zhang, L.-N., Fang, Z., Fan, Y.-Y., Cui, G.

https://openalex.org/W2108463155,"The conserved Blm10/PA200 activators bind to the proteasome core particle gate and facilitate turnover of peptides and unfolded proteins in vitro. We report here that Blm10 is required for the maintenance of functional mitochondria. BLM10 expression is induced 25-fold upon a switch from fermentation to oxidative metabolism. In the absence of BLM10, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells exhibit a temperature-sensitive growth defect under oxidative growth conditions and produce colonies with dysfunctional mitochondria at high frequency. Loss of BLM10 leads to reduced respiratory capacity, increased mitochondrial oxidative damage, and reduced viability in the presence of oxidative stress or death stimuli. In the absence of BLM10, increased fragmentation of the mitochondrial network under oxidative stress is observed indicative of elevated activity of the mitochondrial fission machinery. The degradation of Dnm1, the main factor mediating mitochondrial fission, is impaired in the absence of BLM10 in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the mitochondrial functional and morphological changes observed are related to elevated Dnm1 levels. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that cells that constitutively overexpress DNM1 display the same mitochondrial defects as blm10Δ cells. The data are consistent with a model in which Blm10 proteasome-mediated turnover of Dnm1 is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and provides cytoprotection under conditions that induce increased mitochondrial damage and programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2095310851,"Glycosidases are widespread among bacteria. The opportunistic human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis encodes several putative glycosidases but little is known about their functions. The identified endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase EndoE has activity on the N-linked glycans of the human immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this report we identified the human glycoprotein lactoferrin (hLF) as a new substrate for EndoE. Hydrolysis of the N-glycans from hLF was investigated using lectin blot, UHPLC and mass spectrometry, showing that EndoE releases major glycoforms from this protein. hLF was shown to inhibit biofilm formation of E. faecalis in vitro. Glycans of hLF influence the binding to E. faecalis, and EndoE-hydrolyzed hLF inhibits biofilm formation to lesser extent than intact hLF indicating that EndoE prevents the inhibition of biofilm. In addition, hLF binds to a surface-associated enolase of E. faecalis. Culture experiments showed that the activity of EndoE enables E. faecalis to use the glycans derived from lactoferrin as a carbon source indicating that they could be used as nutrients in vivo when no other preferred carbon source is available. This report adds important information about the enzymatic activity of EndoE from the commensal and opportunist E. faecalis. The activity on the human glycoprotein hLF, and the functional consequences with reduced inhibition of biofilm formation highlights both innate immunity functions of hLF and a bacterial mechanism to evade this innate immunity function. Taken together, our results underline the importance of glycans in the interplay between bacteria and the human host, with possible implications for both commensalism and opportunism."
https://openalex.org/W2022380179,"Degradation-specific processes and variation in laboratory protocols can bias the DNA sequence composition from samples of ancient or historic origin. Here, we identify a novel artifact in sequences from historic samples of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), which forms interrupted palindromes consisting of reverse complementary sequence at the 5' and 3'-ends of sequencing reads. The palindromic sequences themselves have specific properties - the bases at the 5'-end align well to the reference genome, whereas extensive misalignments exists among the bases at the terminal 3'-end. The terminal 3' bases are artificial extensions likely caused by the occurrence of hairpin loops in single stranded DNA (ssDNA), which can be ligated and amplified in particular library creation protocols. We propose that such hairpin loops allow the inclusion of erroneous nucleotides, specifically at the 3'-end of DNA strands, with the 5'-end of the same strand providing the template. We also find these palindromes in previously published ancient DNA (aDNA) datasets, albeit at varying and substantially lower frequencies. This artifact can negatively affect the yield of endogenous DNA in these types of samples and introduces sequence bias."
https://openalex.org/W2081609900,"This study analysed the temporal pattern of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) spawning in the Balearic spawning ground and examined its reproductive performance after years in captivity. Furthermore, ABFT hatching time at different on-site temperatures was determined for the first time. Spawning surveys were carried out in 4 spawning seasons (2009-2012) aboard tuna transport vessels. Three groups of spawners were monitored: a captive group transported to the spawning region and monitored throughout the four spawning seasons and two wild groups caught in 2009 and 2010 which were transferred to a monitoring transport cage immediately after being caught. Surface plankton samples were collected nightly, beginning immediately after the first purse seine catches were made and concluding after spawning was observed to have ended. All groups displayed the same spawning hours, restricted between 2:00-5:00 a.m. The captive group, as they got older, shifted towards the earliest hour, suggesting an age influence on reproductive time. The onset of spawning varied annually from the end of May to the beginning of June at temperatures around 19 °C-20 °C, ending by the second week of July. The peak of spawning was consistently around the summer solstice, June 15th-30th. The results showed the negative effect of unstable oceanographic conditions in the spawning process which might influence the annual reproductive success of ABFT. The influence of temperature on hatching time was higher than that observed in other tuna species, twice as fast at 26 °C (23 h) as at 19.5 °C (49 h). Overall, this study shows the strength of the internal mechanism in ABFT that controls spawning traits. Spawning in ABFT is cyclical and highly synchronised on diel and annual scales. We consider that the timing of spawning is rather influenced by day length and its adaptive significance is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2070047227,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is one of the most prevalent yet underrated disorders worldwide. High heritability estimates of CVD indicate prominent genetic components in its etiology and pathology. Mutations in human forkhead box C2 (FoxC2) gene are strongly associated with valve failure in saphenous and deep veins of lower extremities. We explored the association of genetic variants of FoxC2 as well as FoxC2 mRNA and protein expression levels with CVD of lower limbs. We systematically sequenced the single coding exon, 5' and 3' flanking regions of FoxC2 gene in 754 study subjects which includes 382 patients with CVD and 372 healthy subjects. Four novel and three reported polymorphisms were identified in our cohort. Three variants in 5' flanking region and one in 3' flanking region of FoxC2 gene were significantly associated with CVD risk. FoxC2 mRNA in vein tissues from 22 patients was 4±1.42 fold increased compared to saphenous veins from 20 normal subjects (p<0.01). FoxC2 protein was also significantly upregulated in varicose veins compared to control samples. The c.-512C>T (rs34221221: C>T) variant which is located in the FoxC2 putative promoter region was further analyzed. Functional analysis of c.-512C>T revealed increased mRNA and protein expression in patients with homozygous TT genotype compared to heterozygous CT and wild CC genotypes. Luciferase assay indicated higher transcriptional activity of mutant compared to wild genotype of this variant. These findings suggested that c.-512C>T variant of FoxC2 was strongly associated with susceptibility to CVD and also that this variant resulted in FoxC2 overexpression. To obtain a mechanistic insight into the role of upregulated FoxC2 in varicosities, we overexpressed FoxC2 in venous endothelial cells and observed elevated expression of arterial markers Dll4 and Hey2 and downregulation of venous marker COUP-TFII. Our study indicates altered FoxC2-Notch signaling in saphenous vein wall remodeling in patients with varicose veins."
https://openalex.org/W2143291306,"This paper describes the generation, characterisation and potential applications of a panel of novel anti-prion protein monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The mAbs were generated by immunising PRNP null mice, using a variety of regimes, with a truncated form of recombinant ovine prion protein spanning residues 94–233. Epitopes of specific antibodies were mapped using solid-phase Pepscan analysis and clustered to four distinct regions within the PrP molecule. We have demonstrated the utility of these antibodies by use of Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in tissues from a range of different species affected by transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). In comparative tests against extensively-used and widely-published, commercially available antibodies, similar or improved results can be obtained using these new mAbs, specifically in terms of sensitivity of detection. Since many of these antibodies recognise native PrPC, they could also be applied to a broad range of immunoassays such as flow cytometry, DELFIA analysis or immunoprecipitation. We are using these reagents to increase our understanding of TSE pathogenesis and for use in potential diagnostic screening assays."
https://openalex.org/W2022205249,"Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a conserved group of structural membrane proteins that form special cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich compartments, especially in adipocytes. Recently, it has been reported that CAV1 is an important target protein in sex hormone-dependent regulation of various metabolic pathways, particularly in cancer and diabetes. To clarify distinct roles of CAV1 in sex-dependent obesity development, we investigated the effects of high fat diet (HFD) and sex steroid hormones on CAV1 expression in adipose tissues of male and female rats. Results of animal experiments revealed that estrogen (17-β-estradiol, E2) and androgen (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) had opposite effects on body weight gain as well as on the regulation of CAV1, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in adipose tissues. Furthermore, sex hormone receptors and aromatase were differentially expressed in a sex-dependent manner in response to E2 and DHT treatments. In vivo data were confirmed using 3T3-L1 and HIB1B cell lines, where Cav1 knock down stimulated lipogenesis but suppressed sex hormone receptor signaling proteins. Most importantly, co-immunoprecipitation enabled the identification of previously unrecognized CAV1-interacting mitochondrial or lipid oxidative pathway proteins in adipose tissues. Taken together, current data showed that CAV1 may play important preventive role in the development of obesity, with more prominent effects in females, and proved to be an important target protein for the hormonal regulation of adipose tissue metabolism by manipulating sex hormone receptors and mitochondrial oxidative pathways. Therefore, we can report, for the first time, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of sex steroid hormones in the sex-dimorphic regulation of CAV1."
https://openalex.org/W2079541165,"High mating success in animals is often dependent on males signalling attractively with high effort. Since males should be selected to maximize their reproductive success, female preferences for these traits should result in minimal signal variation persisting in the population. However, extensive signal variation persists. The genic capture hypothesis proposes genetic variation persists because fitness-conferring traits depend on an individual's basic processes, including underlying physiological, morphological, and biochemical traits, which are themselves genetically variable. To explore the traits underlying signal variation, we quantified among-male differences in signalling, morphology, energy stores, and the activities of key enzymes associated with signalling muscle metabolism in two species of crickets, Gryllus assimilis (chirper: <20 pulses/chirp) and G. texensis (triller: >20 pulses/chirp). Chirping G. assimilis primarily fuelled signalling with carbohydrate metabolism: smaller individuals and individuals with increased thoracic glycogen stores signalled for mates with greater effort; individuals with greater glycogen phosphorylase activity produced more attractive mating signals. Conversely, the more energetic trilling G. texensis fuelled signalling with both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism: individuals with increased β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and increased thoracic free carbohydrate content signalled for mates with greater effort; individuals with higher thoracic and abdominal carbohydrate content and higher abdominal lipid stores produced more attractive signals. Our findings suggest variation in male reproductive success may be driven by hidden physiological trade-offs that affect the ability to uptake, retain, and use essential nutrients, although the results remain correlational in nature. Our findings indicate that a physiological perspective may help us to understand some of the causes of variation in behaviour."

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis plays a role in embryonic and postnatal growth and tissue repair. Elevated levels of IGFs, low levels of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) and over-expression of IGF receptor (IGFR-I) were associated with several stages of cancer. Here, the prevalence of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6214 in the IGF type I (IGF-I) gene and rs6898743 in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene in patients with GI cancer and controls was studied.In this Dutch case-control study, DNA isolated from blood of 1,457 GI cancer patients; 438 patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), 475 with esophageal cancer (EC) and 544 with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 1,457 matched controls, was used to determine the rs6214 and rs6898743 genotypes by polymerase chain reaction. The association between these SNPs and GI cancer, HNC, esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) and proximal or distal CRC was studied. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated via unconditional logistic regression.Overall for GI cancer, the ORs for SNPs rs6214 and rs6898743 were approximately 1.0 (p-value>0.05), using the most common genotypes GG as reference. An OR of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.27) was found for EC for genotype AA of rs6214. The ORs for EAC were 1.45 (95% CI, 1.04-2.01) and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.10-2.68), for genotypes GA and AA, respectively. Genotype GC of rs6898743 showed an OR of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.26-0.86) for ESCC.The A allele of SNP rs6214 in the IGF-I gene was associated with EAC, and with HNC in women.

Two prodrugs were synthesized, and the beneficial effects on dystrophic phenotype were studied. Nerve excitability abnormalities detected in saline-treated mice were almost totally rescued in animals treated at low doses (50–100 mg/kg/d). Force and fatigue resistance were improved ≈60% and 3.5-fold, respectively, and the percentage of necrosis in heart sections was reduced ≈90% in the treated mice. A decrease of >50% in serum creatine kinase indicated an overall improvement in the muscles. Restoration of membrane integrity was studied directly by measuring the reduction (≈74%) of Evans blue incorporation in the limb muscles of the treated animals, the increase in utrophin level, and the normalization of lipid composition of the heart. In cultures of human myotubes (primary cells and cell line), both prodrugs and HDAC inhibitors increased by 2- to 4-fold the utrophin level, which was correctly localized at the membrane. β-Dystroglycan and embryonic myosin protein levels were also increased. Finally, a 50% reduction in the number of spontaneous Ca2+ spikes was observed after treatment with NO synthase substrate and HDAC inhibitors. Overall, the beneficial effects were obtained with doses 10 (in vivo) and 5 (in vitro) times lower than those of the salt formulation. Altogether, these data constitute proof of principle of the beneficial effects of low doses of arginine butyrate derivatives on muscular dystrophy, enhancing the NO pathway and inhibiting HDAC.—Vianello, S., Consolaro, F., Bich, C., Cancela, J.-M., Roulot, M., Lanchec, E., Touboul, D., Brunelle, A., Israël, M., Benoit, E., de la Porte, S.

https://openalex.org/W2034950853,"Background Transposable elements (TEs) are the most abundant genomic components in eukaryotes and affect the genome by their replications and movements to generate genetic plasticity. Sweet potato performs asexual reproduction generally and the TEs may be an important genetic factor for genome reorganization. Complete identification of TEs is essential for the study of genome evolution. However, the TEs of sweet potato are still poorly understood because of its complex hexaploid genome and difficulty in genome sequencing. The recent availability of the sweet potato transcriptome databases provides an opportunity for discovering and characterizing the expressed TEs. Methodology/Principal Findings We first established the integrated-transcriptome database by de novo assembling four published sweet potato transcriptome databases from three cultivars in China. Using sequence-similarity search and analysis, a total of 1,405 TEs including 883 retrotransposons and 522 DNA transposons were predicted and categorized. Depending on mapping sets of RNA-Seq raw short reads to the predicted TEs, we compared the quantities, classifications and expression activities of TEs inter- and intra-cultivars. Moreover, the differential expressions of TEs in seven tissues of Xushu 18 cultivar were analyzed by using Illumina digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling. It was found that 417 TEs were expressed in one or more tissues and 107 in all seven tissues. Furthermore, the copy number of 11 transposase genes was determined to be 1–3 copies in the genome of sweet potato by Real-time PCR-based absolute quantification. Conclusions/Significance Our result provides a new method for TE searching on species with transcriptome sequences while lacking genome information. The searching, identification and expression analysis of TEs will provide useful TE information in sweet potato, which are valuable for the further studies of TE-mediated gene mutation and optimization in asexual reproduction. It contributes to elucidating the roles of TEs in genome evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2083591671,"Purpose To compare a novel combined acquisition technique (CAT) of turbo-spin-echo (TSE) and echo-planar-imaging (EPI) with conventional TSE. CAT reduces the electromagnetic energy load transmitted for spin excitation. This radiofrequency (RF) burden is limited by the specific absorption rate (SAR) for patient safety. SAR limits restrict high-field MRI applications, in particular. Material and Methods The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. T2- and PD-weighted brain images of n = 40 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients were acquired by CAT and TSE at 3 Tesla. Lesions were recorded by two blinded, board-certificated neuroradiologists. Diagnostic equivalence of CAT and TSE to detect MS lesions was evaluated along with their SAR, sound pressure level (SPL) and sensations of acoustic noise, heating, vibration and peripheral nerve stimulation. Results Every MS lesion revealed on TSE was detected by CAT according to both raters (Cohen’s kappa of within-rater/across-CAT/TSE lesion detection κCAT = 1.00, at an inter-rater lesion detection agreement of κLES = 0.82). CAT reduced the SAR burden significantly compared to TSE (p<0.001). Mean SAR differences between TSE and CAT were 29.0 (±5.7) % for the T2-contrast and 32.7 (±21.9) % for the PD-contrast (expressed as percentages of the effective SAR limit of 3.2 W/kg for head examinations). Average SPL of CAT was no louder than during TSE. Sensations of CAT- vs. TSE-induced heating, noise and scanning vibrations did not differ. Conclusion T2−/PD-CAT is diagnostically equivalent to TSE for MS lesion detection yet substantially reduces the RF exposure. Such SAR reduction facilitates high-field MRI applications at 3 Tesla or above and corresponding protocol standardizations but CAT can also be used to scan faster, at higher resolution or with more slices. According to our data, CAT is no more uncomfortable than TSE scanning."
