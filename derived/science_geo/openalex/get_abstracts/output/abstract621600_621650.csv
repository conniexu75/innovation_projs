https://openalex.org/W2898394368,"Focal radiation therapy enhances systemic responses to anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in preclinical studies and in some patients with melanoma1-3, but its efficacy in inducing systemic responses (abscopal responses) against tumors unresponsive to CTLA-4 blockade remained uncertain. Radiation therapy promotes the activation of anti-tumor T cells, an effect dependent on type I interferon induction in the irradiated tumor4-6. The latter is essential for achieving abscopal responses in murine cancers6. The mechanisms underlying abscopal responses in patients treated with radiation therapy and CTLA-4 blockade remain unclear. Here we report that radiation therapy and CTLA-4 blockade induced systemic anti-tumor T cells in chemo-refractory metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where anti-CTLA-4 antibodies had failed to demonstrate significant efficacy alone or in combination with chemotherapy7,8. Objective responses were observed in 18% of enrolled patients, and 31% had disease control. Increased serum interferon-β after radiation and early dynamic changes of blood T cell clones were the strongest response predictors, confirming preclinical mechanistic data. Functional analysis in one responding patient showed the rapid in vivo expansion of CD8 T cells recognizing a neoantigen encoded in a gene upregulated by radiation, supporting the hypothesis that one explanation for the abscopal response is radiation-induced exposure of immunogenic mutations to the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2898587007,"The anti-hyperglycemic effect of metformin is believed to be caused by its direct action on signaling processes in hepatocytes, leading to lower hepatic gluconeogenesis. Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile acid glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts in part through a B. fragilis–GUDCA–intestinal FXR axis to improve metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia. Metformin decreases the levels of Bacteroides fragilis while increasing the bile acid GUDCA to antagonize intestinal FXR and improves the metabolic health of humans and mice."

Here we report a broad comparative study of 81 genomes of parasitic and non-parasitic worms. We have identified gene family births and hundreds of expanded gene families at key nodes in the phylogeny that are relevant to parasitism. Examples include gene families that modulate host immune responses, enable parasite migration though host tissues or allow the parasite to feed. We reveal extensive lineage-specific differences in core metabolism and protein families historically targeted for drug development. From an in silico screen, we have identified and prioritized new potential drug targets and compounds for testing. This comparative genomics resource provides a much-needed boost for the research community to understand and combat parasitic worms."
https://openalex.org/W2898224297,"Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes exist in three distinct, final-form assemblies: canonical BAF (cBAF), PBAF and a newly characterized non-canonical complex (ncBAF). However, their complex-specific targeting on chromatin, functions and roles in disease remain largely undefined. Here, we comprehensively mapped complex assemblies on chromatin and found that ncBAF complexes uniquely localize to CTCF sites and promoters. We identified ncBAF subunits as synthetic lethal targets specific to synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumours, which both exhibit cBAF complex (SMARCB1 subunit) perturbation. Chemical and biological depletion of the ncBAF subunit, BRD9, rapidly attenuates synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumour cell proliferation. Importantly, in cBAF-perturbed cancers, ncBAF complexes maintain gene expression at retained CTCF-promoter sites and function in a manner distinct from fusion oncoprotein-bound complexes. Together, these findings unmask the unique targeting and functional roles of ncBAF complexes and present new cancer-specific therapeutic targets."

Three pivotal trials testing 4-month regimens failed to meet non-inferiority margins; however, approximately four-fifths of participants were cured. Through a pooled analysis of patient-level data with external validation, we identify populations eligible for 4-month treatment, define phenotypes that are hard to treat and evaluate the impact of adherence and dosing strategy on outcomes. In 3,405 participants included in analyses, baseline smear grade of 3+ relative to <2+, HIV seropositivity and adherence of ≤90% were significant risk factors for unfavorable outcome. Four-month regimens were non-inferior in participants with minimal disease defined by <2+ sputum smear grade or non-cavitary disease. A hard-to-treat phenotype, defined by high smear grades and cavitation, may require durations >6 months to cure all. Regimen duration can be selected in order to improve outcomes, providing a stratified medicine approach as an alternative to the 'one-size-fits-all' treatment currently used worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W2898972432,"Phagocytosis is required for a broad range of physiological functions, from pathogen defense to tissue homeostasis, but the mechanisms required for phagocytosis of diverse substrates remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed a rapid magnet-based phenotypic screening strategy, and performed eight genome-wide CRISPR screens in human cells to identify genes regulating phagocytosis of distinct substrates. After validating select hits in focused miniscreens, orthogonal assays and primary human macrophages, we show that (1) the previously uncharacterized gene NHLRC2 is a central player in phagocytosis, regulating RhoA-Rac1 signaling cascades that control actin polymerization and filopodia formation, (2) very-long-chain fatty acids are essential for efficient phagocytosis of certain substrates and (3) the previously uncharacterized Alzheimer’s disease–associated gene TM2D3 can preferentially influence uptake of amyloid-β aggregates. These findings illuminate new regulators and core principles of phagocytosis, and more generally establish an efficient method for unbiased identification of cellular uptake mechanisms across diverse physiological and pathological contexts. Eight genome-wide CRISPR screens identify genes required for substrate-specific phagocytosis. The study highlights roles for NHLRC2 in filopodia formation, very-long-chain fatty acids in substrate-specific phagocytosis and TM2D3 in uptake of amyloid-β aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2799113375,"Quantum error correction will be essential for realizing the full potential of large-scale quantum information processing devices. Fundamental to its experimental realization is the repetitive detection of errors via projective measurements of quantum correlations among qubits, and correction using conditional feedback. Performing these tasks repeatedly requires a system in which measurement and feedback decision times are short compared to qubit coherence times, where the measurement reproduces faithfully the desired projection, and for which the measurement process has no detrimental effect on the ability to perform further operations. Here we demonstrate up to 50 sequential measurements of correlations between two beryllium-ion qubits using a calcium ion ancilla, and implement feedback which allows us to stabilize two-qubit subspaces as well as Bell states. Multi-qubit mixed-species gates are used to transfer information from qubits to the ancilla, enabling quantum state detection with negligible crosstalk to the stored qubits. Heating of the ion motion during detection is mitigated using sympathetic recooling. A key element of the experimental system is a powerful classical control system, which features flexible in-sequence processing to implement feedback control. The methods employed here provide a number of essential ingredients for scaling trapped-ion quantum computing, and provide new opportunities for quantum state control and entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology."
https://openalex.org/W2899078837,"Genetic analyses have linked microRNA-137 (MIR137) to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. miR-137 plays important roles in neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, but the impact of miR-137 loss-of-function in vivo remains unclear. Here we show the complete loss of miR-137 in the mouse germline knockout or nervous system knockout (cKO) leads to postnatal lethality, while heterozygous germline knockout and cKO mice remain viable. Partial loss of miR-137 in heterozygous cKO mice results in dysregulated synaptic plasticity, repetitive behavior, and impaired learning and social behavior. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that the miR-137 mRNA target, phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a), is elevated in heterozygous knockout mice. Treatment with the Pde10a inhibitor papaverine or knockdown of Pde10a ameliorates the deficits observed in the heterozygous cKO mice. Collectively, our results suggest that MIR137 plays essential roles in postnatal neurodevelopment and that dysregulation of miR-137 potentially contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2898307788,"Human microbiome studies have revealed the intricate interplay of host immunity and bacterial communities to achieve homeostatic balance. Healthy skin microbial communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation1-3, mainly bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited. Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding of microbial-host interactions. Primary immunodeficient patients manifest with various viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, including skin infections4. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility5. DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues such as skin6. Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity compared with healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection."
https://openalex.org/W2900168944,"Background The consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased mortality from chronic diseases, and as a result, it has been classified by the World Health Organization as carcinogenic (processed meat) and probably carcinogenic (red meat) to humans. One policy response is to regulate red and processed meat consumption similar to other carcinogens and foods of public health concerns. Here we describe a market-based approach of taxing red and processed meat according to its health impacts. Methods We calculated economically optimal tax levels for 149 world regions that would account for (internalize) the health costs associated with ill-health from red and processed meat consumption, and we used a coupled modelling framework to estimate the impacts of optimal taxation on consumption, health costs, and non-communicable disease mortality. Health impacts were estimated using a global comparative risk assessment framework, and economic responses were estimated using international data on health costs, prices, and price elasticities. Findings The health-related costs to society attributable to red and processed meat consumption in 2020 amounted to USD 285 billion (sensitivity intervals based on epidemiological uncertainty (SI), 93–431), three quarters of which were due to processed meat consumption. Under optimal taxation, prices for processed meat increased by 25% on average, ranging from 1% in low-income countries to over 100% in high-income countries, and prices for red meat increased by 4%, ranging from 0.2% to over 20%. Consumption of processed meat decreased by 16% on average, ranging from 1% to 25%, whilst red meat consumption remained stable as substitution for processed meat compensated price-related reductions. The number of deaths attributable to red and processed meat consumption decreased by 9% (222,000; SI, 38,000–357,000), and attributable health costs decreased by 14% (USD 41 billion; SI, 10–57) globally, in each case with greatest reductions in high and middle-income countries. Interpretation Including the social health cost of red and processed meat consumption in the price of red and processed meat could lead to significant health and environmental benefits, in particular in high and middle-income countries. The optimal tax levels estimated in this study are context-specific and can complement the simple rules of thumb currently used for setting health-motivated tax levels."
https://openalex.org/W2898239048,"Organelle biogenesis requires proper transport of proteins from their site of synthesis to their target subcellular compartment1–3. Lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic through the Golgi complex before being transferred to the endolysosomal system4–6, but how they are transferred from the ER to the Golgi is unknown. Here, we show that ER-to-Golgi transfer of lysosomal enzymes requires CLN8, an ER-associated membrane protein whose loss of function leads to the lysosomal storage disorder, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 8 (a type of Batten disease)7. ER-to-Golgi trafficking of CLN8 requires interaction with the COPII and COPI machineries via specific export and retrieval signals localized in the cytosolic carboxy terminus of CLN8. CLN8 deficiency leads to depletion of soluble enzymes in the lysosome, thus impairing lysosome biogenesis. Binding to lysosomal enzymes requires the second luminal loop of CLN8 and is abolished by some disease-causing mutations within this region. Our data establish an unanticipated example of an ER receptor serving the biogenesis of an organelle and indicate that impaired transport of lysosomal enzymes underlies Batten disease caused by mutations in CLN8. di Ronza et al. identify CLN8 as a cargo receptor for lysosomal enzymes required for their endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi transport, linking Batten disease caused by CLN8 mutations to defects in organelle biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2900083515,"We developed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm and applied it to big corneal parameters to identify and monitor keratoconus stages. A big dataset of corneal swept source optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of 12,242 eyes acquired from SS-1000 CASIA OCT Imaging Systems in multiple centers across Japan was assembled. A total of 3,156 eyes with valid Ectasia Status Index (ESI) between zero and 100% were selected for the downstream analysis. Four hundred and twenty corneal topography, elevation, and pachymetry parameters (excluding ESI Keratoconus indices) were selected. The algorithm included three major steps. 1) Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to linearly reduce the dimensionality of the input data from 420 to eight significant principal components. 2) Manifold learning was used to further reducing the selected principal components nonlinearly to two eigen-parameters. 3) Finally, a density-based clustering was applied to the eigen-parameters to identify eyes with keratoconus. Visualization of clusters in 2-D space was used to validate the quality of learning subjectively and ESI was used to assess the accuracy of the identified clusters objectively. The proposed method identified four clusters; I: a cluster composed of mostly normal eyes (224 eyes with ESI equal to zero, 23 eyes with ESI between five and 29, and nine eyes with ESI greater than 29), II: a cluster composed of mostly healthy eyes and eyes with forme fruste keratoconus (1772 eyes with ESI equal to zero, 698 eyes with ESI between five and 29, and 117 eyes with ESI greater than 29), III: a cluster composed of mostly eyes with mild keratoconus stage (184 eyes with ESI greater than 29, 74 eyes with ESI between five and 29, and 6 eyes with ESI equal to zero), and IV: a cluster composed of eyes with mostly advanced keratoconus stage (80 eyes had ESI greater than 29 and 1 eye had ESI between five and 29). We found that keratoconus status and severity can be well identified using unsupervised machine learning algorithms along with linear and non-linear corneal data transformation. The proposed method can better identify and visualize the keratoconus stages."
https://openalex.org/W2898448758,"Epigenomics regulates gene expression and is as important as genomics in precision personal health, as it is heavily influenced by environment and lifestyle. We profiled whole-genome DNA methylation and the corresponding transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from a human volunteer over a period of 36 months, generating 28 methylome and 57 transcriptome datasets. We found that DNA methylomic changes are associated with infrequent glucose level alteration, whereas the transcriptome underwent dynamic changes during events such as viral infections. Most DNA meta-methylome changes occurred 80–90 days before clinically detectable glucose elevation. Analysis of the deep personal methylome dataset revealed an unprecedented number of allelic differentially methylated regions that remain stable longitudinally and are preferentially associated with allele-specific gene regulation. Our results revealed that changes in different types of ‘omics’ data associate with different physiological aspects of this individual: DNA methylation with chronic conditions and transcriptome with acute events."
https://openalex.org/W2900330125,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to global health. To increase public awareness about AMR and encourage the prudent use of antimicrobials is one of the goals of the National Action Plan in Japan.A nationwide online cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate the existing knowledge and perception of AMR in Japan, based on the Antimicrobial Resistance Eurobarometer Survey. Participants included Japanese adults aged 20-69 years, who were not medical professionals.Among a total of 3,390 participants, about half had taken antibiotics over the past 12 months, and majority of them obtained the antimicrobials from healthcare institutions for the common cold. While 11.7% of the participants kept leftover antibiotics, 23.6% of them have adjusted doses by themselves. About 10% of the participants have requested antibiotics from their doctors, and nearly 30% of them preferred doctors who prescribed antibiotics when had a cold. The common informational sources were TV news and newspapers, and more than 40% of the participants reported receiving some information over the past year. However, approximately 80% of the participants did not know that antibiotics do not kill viruses and that antibiotics are ineffective against cold and flu.Not many Japanese have adequate information about antimicrobials and AMR, and many have taken antimicrobials inappropriately. Greater educational interventions are, therefore, necessary to increase public awareness and develop effective countermeasures against AMR in Japan."

https://openalex.org/W2899758772,"Liquid–liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids into membraneless organelles (MLOs) spatially organizes cellular components and reactions. The RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNPA2) carries mRNA targets in MLOs called transport granules in neurons and oligodendrocytes. At sites of local translation, hnRNPA2 is phosphorylated by the tyrosine protein kinase Fyn, releasing the mRNA for translation. Fyn recognizes targets through its SH3 domain (Fyn-SH3). However, hnRNPA2 lacks canonical SH3-binding sequences, raising the question of how Fyn-SH3 binds hnRNPA2 in phase-separated transport granules. Here, we characterize the structural details of the interaction of the hnRNPA2 low-complexity domain (LC) with Fyn-SH3 and the effect of Fyn-SH3 on hnRNPA2 phase separation. We combined in vitro microscopy and solution NMR spectroscopy to evaluate assembly of hnRNPA2 and Fyn-SH3 into in vitro phase-separated granules and probe the structural details of their interaction. We observed that Fyn-SH3 induces hnRNPA2 LC phase separation and that Fyn-SH3 is incorporated into in vitro hnRNPA2 LC granules. Moreover, we identified hnRNPA2 LC interaction sites on the surface of Fyn-SH3. Our data offer a structural view of how hnRNPA2 LC may interact with Fyn. To our knowledge, our study provides the first example of a single globular domain inducing phase separation of a disordered MLO scaffold protein."
https://openalex.org/W2900158221,"Objectives This study aims to describe the prevalence and transitions of frailty among rural-community dwelling older adults in Malaysia and to analyse factors associated with different states of frailty transition. Frailty was conceptualized using modified Fried phenotype from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Design This is a prospective longitudinal study with 12-months follow up among older adults in Malaysia. Setting Kuala Pilah, a district in Negeri Sembilan, which is one of the fourteen states in Malaysia. Participants 2,324 community-dwelling older Malaysians aged 60 years and older. Results The overall prevalence of frailty in this study was 9.4% (95% CI 7.8–11.2). The prevalence increased at least three-fold with every 10 years of age. This increase was seen higher in women compared to men. Being frail was significantly associated with older age, women, and respondents with a higher number of chronic diseases, poor cognitive function and low socioeconomic status (p<0.05). During the 12-months follow-up, our study showed that the transition towards greater frailty states were more likely (22.9%) than transition toward lesser frailty states (19.9%) while majority (57.2%) remained unchanged. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that presence of low physical activity increased the likelihood of worsening transition towards greater frailty states by three times (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.2–3.7) and lowered the likelihood of transition towards lesser frailty states (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2–0.4). Conclusion Frailty is reported among one in every eleven older adults in this study. The prevalence increased across age groups and was higher among women than men. Frailty possesses a dynamic status due to its potential reversibility. This reversibility makes it a cornerstone to delay frailty progression. Our study noted that physical activity conferred the greatest benefit as a modifiable factor in frailty prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2898249830,"Here we performed a systematic search to identify breast-cancer-specific small noncoding RNAs, which we have collectively termed orphan noncoding RNAs (oncRNAs). We subsequently discovered that one of these oncRNAs, which originates from the 3′ end of TERC, acts as a regulator of gene expression and is a robust promoter of breast cancer metastasis. This oncRNA, which we have named T3p, exerts its prometastatic effects by acting as an inhibitor of RISC complex activity and increasing the expression of the prometastatic genes NUPR1 and PANX2. Furthermore, we have shown that oncRNAs are present in cancer-cell-derived extracellular vesicles, raising the possibility that these circulating oncRNAs may also have a role in non–cell autonomous disease pathogenesis. Additionally, these circulating oncRNAs present a novel avenue for cancer fingerprinting using liquid biopsies. A novel orphan noncoding RNA species with tumor-specific expression across breast cancer subtypes promotes metastatic progression and holds potential for patient diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2899712660,"The resistance problem of dengue vectors to different classes of insecticides that are used for public health has raised concerns about vector control programmes. Hence, the discovery of alternative compounds that would enhance existing tools is important for overcoming the resistance problem of using insecticides in vectors and ensuring a chemical-free environment. The larvicidal effects of Azolla pinnata extracts by using two different extraction methods with methanol solvent against Aedes in early 4th instar larvae was conducted.The fresh Azolla pinnata plant from Kuala Krai, Kelantan, Malaysia was used for crude extraction using Soxhlet and maceration methods. Then, the chemical composition of extracts and its structure were identified using GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu). Next, following the WHO procedures for larval bioassays, the extracts were used to evaluate the early 4th instar larvae of Aedes mosquito vectors.The larvicidal activity of Azolla pinnata plant extracts evidently affected the early 4th instar larvae of Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors. The Soxhlet extraction method had the highest larvicidal effect against Ae. aegypti early 4th instar larvae, with LC50 and LC95 values of 1093 and 1343 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, the maceration extraction compounds were recorded with the LC50 and LC95 values of 1280 and 1520 mg/L, respectively. The larvae bioassay test for Ae. albopictus showed closely similar values in its Soxhlet extraction, with LC50 and LC95 values of 1035 and 1524 mg/L, compared with the maceration extraction LC50 and LC95 values of 1037 and 1579 mg/L, respectively. The non-target organism test on guppy fish, Poecilia reticulata, showed no mortalities and posed no toxic effects. The chemical composition of the Azolla pinnata plant extract has been found and characterized as having 18 active compounds for the Soxhlet method and 15 active compounds for the maceration method.Our findings showed that the crude extract of A. pinnata bioactive molecules are effective and have the potential to be developed as biolarvicides for Aedes mosquito vector control. This study recommends future research on the use of active ingredients isolated from A. pinnata extracts and their evaluation against larvicidal activity of Aedes in small-scale field trials for environmentally safe botanical insecticide invention."
https://openalex.org/W2900358418,"Objective We investigated the association between bacterial microbiota in breast milk and the infant mouth. The influence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection on infant oral microbiota was also assessed. Material and methods Altogether 35 breast milk and 35 infant oral samples with known HPV status were selected from the Finnish Family HPV Study cohort. In total, there were 31 mother-infant pairs. The microbiota composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region). Results HPV DNA was present in 8.6% (3/35) of the breast milk and 40% (14/35) of the infant oral samples. Eight shared genera between breast milk and infant oral were found; these included Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Unclassified Gemellaceae, Rothia, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium. HPV status was not associated with either microbiota richness or diversity in the infant mouth. However, the infant oral microbiota clustered in different groups according to HPV status. We detected higher abundance of Veillonella dispar (p = 0.048) at species level in HPV negative infant oral samples. We did not detect differences in the breast milk microbiota composition related to HPV infection due to only three HPV positive milk samples. Conclusions HPV infection is associated with distinct oral bacterial microbiota composition in infants. The direction of causality underlying the phenomenon remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2899707301,"The majority of environmental DNA (eDNA) assays for vertebrate species are based on commonly analyzed regions of the mitochondrial genome. However, the high degree of mitochondrial similarity between two species of charr (Salvelinus spp.), southern Dolly Varden (S. malma lordii) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), precludes the development of a mitochondrial eDNA assay to distinguish them. Presented here is an eDNA assay to detect bull trout based on the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITSI), a nuclear marker. This assay successfully detects bull trout and avoids detecting Dolly Varden as well as brook trout (S. fontinalis), Arctic char (S. alpinus), and lake trout (S. namaycush). In addition, this assay was compared with an extensively used mitochondrial bull trout assay and it was found that the ITSI-based assay produced higher detectability. Our results suggest this assay should out-perform the published mtDNA assay across the range of bull trout, while the added specificity allows reliable bull trout detection in areas where bull trout co-occur with other charr such as Dolly Varden. While clearly a superior assay in this instance, basing assays on ITSI is not without problems. For vertebrates, there are fewer ITSI sequences available than commonly sequenced regions of the mitochondrial genome. Thus, the initial in silico screening of candidate assays must be preceded by much more extensive sampling and sequencing of sympatric or closely related taxa. Further, all copies of the internal transcribed spacers within an individual may not be identical, which can lead to complications. Lastly, the copy number for ITSI varies widely across taxa; the greater detectability associated with this assay cannot be assumed for other species."
https://openalex.org/W2899568731,"Oilseed crops, including several mustards, are cultivated as biofuel sources worldwide. However, common mustard crops (e.g., the rapeseed Brassica napus) grow naturally in mesic temperate regions, which are expected to be impaired by global warming and increased aridity. In particular, increased aridity is predicted to reduce the oil concentration and seed yield of rapeseed crops. There is therefore an urgent need to identify alternative bioenergy crops that are preadapted to future climatic conditions. An alternative to conventional Brassica species for biodiesel production is the white mustard Sinapis alba, which is native to the circum-Mediterranean region and has a high seed lipid content. S. alba grows spontaneously in olive groves and other widespread Mediterranean crops; accordingly, it could be easily cultivated by companion planting to improve ecosystem function by decreasing soil loss, controlling microbial disease, and assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity. In this study, using species distribution modeling, we predicted climatically suitable areas for the cultivation of S. alba in Western Europe across the Mediterranean Basin under present climatic conditions and several climate change scenarios. We show that current climatically suitable areas for S. alba cultivation do not overlap with those for B. napus. Unlike B. napus, S. alba could be cultivated throughout most of the circum-Mediterranean region. According to our models, increases in aridity and annual mean temperatures will expand the climatically suitable areas for S. alba in the Mediterranean Basin. However, suitable areas for the cultivation of B. napus will decrease significantly in Western Europe. Our results indicate that S. alba is a strong, environmentally safe candidate for biofuel production throughout the Mediterranean Basin and other Western European countries, especially under climate change scenarios that are expected to impair current oilseed crops."
https://openalex.org/W2899960047,"Introduction Association has been reported between ambient fine particulate matter (PM) and adverse outcomes of cerebrovascular events. However, it remains unclear that whether short-term exposure to PM relates to stroke and the lag of health effects. This triggers us to examine the relationship between PM and population stroke morbidity in Chengdu. Methods The daily average concentration of atmospheric pollutants and meteorological factors and daily morbidity of stroke in Chengdu (2013–2015) were collected. Based on time series analysis-generalized additive models (GAM), single-pollutant, two-pollutant and multi-pollutant model were established. The effects of atmospheric PM2.5 (defined as PM less than 2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter), PMc(defined as PM less than 10μm and more than 2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter) and PM10 (defined as PM less than 10μm in aerodynamic diameter) concentration on the daily mortality of stroke were analyzed, respectively. Results The three-year mean concentrations of PM2.5, PMc and PM10 for air pollutants were 75.9, 43.9 and 119.7 μg/m3, respectively. PM2.5 on the current day (lag0) and with a moving average of 0–1 days were significantly associated with the increasing risk of stroke morbidity, and PM2.5 with a lag of 0–1 days had greater association, whereas for PMc and PM10 there were no significant association observed. In our study, every 10μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 was associated with 0.69% percent change in stroke morbidity (95%CI: 0.01~1.38). For females, every 10μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 contributes to 0.80% percent change of onset. And for the group of age less than 65, we observed 0.78% higher risk every 10μg/m3 increase of PM2.5. Conclusions These findings suggest that short-term exposure to PM2.5 within 1 day is associated with the onset of stroke, and the younger people (age<65) and females are more sensitive than older people and males."
https://openalex.org/W2950352272,"Accurate predictions of T-cell epitopes would be useful for designing vaccines, immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and improved protein therapies. The humoral immune response involves uptake of antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs), APC processing and presentation of peptides on MHC class II (pMHCII), and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of pMHCII complexes. Most in silico methods predict only peptide-MHCII binding, resulting in significant over-prediction of CD4 T-cell epitopes. We present a method, ITCell, for prediction of T-cell epitopes within an input protein antigen sequence for given MHCII and TCR sequences. The method integrates information about three stages of the immune response pathway: antigen cleavage, MHCII presentation, and TCR recognition. First, antigen cleavage sites are predicted based on the cleavage profiles of cathepsins S, B, and H. Second, for each 12-mer peptide in the antigen sequence we predict whether it will bind to a given MHCII, based on the scores of modeled peptide-MHCII complexes. Third, we predict whether or not any of the top scoring peptide-MHCII complexes can bind to a given TCR, based on the scores of modeled ternary peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes and the distribution of predicted cleavage sites. Our benchmarks consist of epitope predictions generated by this algorithm, checked against 20 peptide-MHCII-TCR crystal structures, as well as epitope predictions for four peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes with known epitopes and TCR sequences but without crystal structures. ITCell successfully identified the correct epitopes as one of the 20 top scoring peptides for 22 of 24 benchmark cases. To validate the method using a clinically relevant application, we utilized five factor VIII-specific TCR sequences from hemophilia A subjects who developed an immune response to factor VIII replacement therapy. The known HLA-DR1-restricted factor VIII epitope was among the six top-scoring factor VIII peptides predicted by ITCall to bind HLA-DR1 and all five TCRs. Our integrative approach is more accurate than current single-stage epitope prediction algorithms applied to the same benchmarks. It is freely available as a web server (http://salilab.org/itcell)."

The current study employs 538 students of mathematics education program; 483 (89.8%) of whom are male and 55 (10.2%) are aged from 18 years old to 22 years old. The study follows a correlational research design to investigate and measure the degree of relationship amongst mathematical modeling competencies, achievement goals and metacognition. Results indicate that achievement goals and metacognition positively influence mathematical modeling competency. Moreover, four metacognition dimensions including awareness, planning, cognitive strategy and self-checking are positive partial mediators because they increase the association between achievement goals and mathematical modeling competency. In conclusion, metacognition and achievement goals positively affect students’ mathematical modeling competency."
https://openalex.org/W2899970519,"Although it is well-established how nutrients, growth factors, and hormones impact functional β-cell mass (BCM), the influence of the central nervous system in this regard, and especially in the context of islet immune modulation, has been understudied. Here we investigated the expression and activity of pancreatic islet α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) in islet anti-inflammatory and prosurvival signaling. Systemic administration of α7nAChR agonists in mice improved glucose tolerance and curtailed streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia by retaining BCM, in part through maintaining Pdx1 and MafA expression and reducing apoptosis. α7nAChR activation of mouse islets ex vivo led to reduced inflammatory drive through a JAK2–STAT3 pathway that couples with CREB/Irs2/Akt survival signaling. Because the vagus nerve conveys anti-inflammatory signals to immune cells of the spleen and other nonneural tissues in the viscera by activating α7nAChR agonists, our study suggests a novel role for β-cell α7nAChR that functions to maintain β-cell survival and mass homeostasis through modulating islet cytokine and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–dependent signaling pathways. Exploiting these pathways may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2899527225,"Introduction Walking speed has been associated with many clinical outcomes (e.g., frailty, mortality, joint replacement need, etc.). Accurately measuring walking speed (stride length x step count/time) typically requires significant clinician/staff time or a gait lab with specialized equipment (i.e., electronic timers or motion capture). In the present study, our goal was to measure “step count” via smartphones through novel software and to compare with step tracking software that come standard with iOS and Android smartphones as a first step in walking speed measurement. Methods A separate calibration and validation data collection was performed. Individuals in the calibration collection (n = 5) walked 20m at normal and slow speed (<1.0 m/s). Appropriate settings for the novel mobile application were chosen to measure step count. Individuals in the validation (n = 52) collection walked at 6m, 10m, and 20m at normal and slow walking speeds. We compared step difference (absolute difference) from observed step counts to native step tracking software and our novel software derived step counts. We used generalized estimated equation adjusted (participant level) negative binomial regression models of absolute step difference from observed step counts, to determine optimal settings (calibration) and subsequently to gauge performance of the shake algorithm settings and native step tracking software across different distances and speeds (validation). Results For iOS/iPhone 6, when compared to observed step count, the shake service (software driven approach) significantly outperformed the embedded native step tracking software across all distances at slow speed, and for short distance (6m) at normal speed. On the Android phone, the shake service outperformed the native step tracking software at slow speed at 6 meters and 20 meters, while its performance eclipsed the native step tracking software only at 20 meters at normal speed. Discussion Our software based approach outperformed native step tracking software across various speeds and distances and carries the advantage of having adjustable measurement parameters that can be further optimized for specific medical conditions. Such software applications will provide an effective way to capture standardized data across multiple commercial smartphone devices, facilitating the future capture of walking speed and other clinically important performance parameters that will influence clinical and home care in the era of value based care."

No effective measures are available to control CWD. We hypothesized that active vaccination with homologous and aggregation-prone recombinant prion protein (PrP) could overcome self-tolerance and induce autoantibody production against the cellular isoform of PrP (PrPC), which would be protective against CWD infection from peripheral routes. Five groups of transgenic mice expressing elk PrP (TgElk) were vaccinated with either the adjuvant CpG alone or one of four recombinant PrP immunogens: deer dimer (Ddi); deer monomer (Dmo); mouse dimer (Mdi); and mouse monomer (Mmo). Mice were then challenged intraperitoneally with elk CWD prions. All vaccinated mice developed ELISA-detectable antibody titers against PrP. Importantly, all four vaccinated groups survived longer than the control group, with the Mmo-immunized group exhibiting 60% prolongation of mean survival time compared with the control group (183 versus 114 days post-inoculation). We tested for prion infection in brain and spleen of all clinically sick mice. Notably, the attack rate was 100% as revealed by positive CWD signals in all tested tissues when assessed with Western blotting, real-time quaking-induced conversion, and immunohistochemistry. Our pilot study in reindeer indicated appreciable humoral immune responses to Mdi and Ddi immunogens, and the post-immune sera from the Ddi-vaccinated reindeer mitigated CWD propagation in a cell culture model (CWD-RK13).

A recent study described a potential CWD vaccine consisting of a nonreplicating human adenovirus that expresses a truncated rabies glycoprotein G fused with postulated disease-specific epitopes, named the rigid loop region (hAd5:tgG-RL).

Type B CpG oligonucleotide (CpG) was used as adjuvant based on previous data that indicate that using CpG as adjuvant was efficient in breaking self-tolerance against PrP. All mice were subjected to one priming dose (100 μg of protein) and four boosting doses (50 μg of protein) applied subcutaneously, with 3-week intervals, before inoculating them with elk CWD prions via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (Fig. 1A). We kept boosting the mice every 6 weeks (two boosts) after challenging them. Testing the reactivity of the post-immune sera against deer recombinant PrP using ELISA showed high antibody titers in all vaccinated groups (Fig. 1B). The lowest titers were found in the Ddi-vaccinated group. The Ddi immunogen is more a self-antigen than is the respective mouse PrP-derived immunogen (Mdi), indicating better efficiency of nonself-immunogens in breaking self-tolerance against cellular PrP in this model. The post-immune sera detected elk PrP (total PrP (−PK) and PrPSc (+PK)) in immunoblot, with sera from the Mmo-vaccinated group showing the best detection (data not shown). Taken together, all four immunogens used in our study could successfully break self-tolerance for PrP in TgElk mice and produce high-antibody titers reactive against recombinant and authentic cervid PrP. The high-antibody titers in the post-immune sera of all vaccinated groups encouraged us to investigate the protective effect of these antibodies against CWD challenge in vivo. For this purpose, we challenged the immunized mice with elk CWD. The rationale for our vaccine approach is interfering in peripheral prion replication, before the process of neuroinvasion is completed. This aligns with the fact that antibodies are not crossing the blood–brain barrier under normal conditions (36Klyubin I. Nicoll A.J. Khalili-Shirazi A. Farmer M. Canning S. Mably A. Linehan J.

Consequently, this prompted us to use the i.p. route for inoculating the mice, a peripheral route of infection that simulates the natural infection situation better than the i.c. infection. After the fourth booster dose, all vaccinated and control TgElk mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1% brain homogenate (BH) from terminally ill TgElk mice infected with elk CWD. The mean survival times are displayed in Table 1. All vaccinated groups displayed markedly improved survival times compared with the adjuvant-only group (CpG). The Mmo-vaccinated group exhibited 60% prolongation in their mean survival time compared with the CpG control group (Fig. 2A), which is statistically significant (p = 0.0002). The Dmo- and Ddi-vaccinated groups showed 28.4 and 24.1% prolongation, respectively, in mean survival time compared with the CpG group (Fig. 2, A and B). The extension of survival time for the Ddi-vaccinated group was statistically significant (p = 0.031) compared with the control group; however, the survival of the Dmo group was not significant when compared with the CpG group (p = 0.0509). The Mdi group showed only a 15.9% prolongation, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.198). Notably, all inoculated mice showed progressive clinical symptoms, including severe weight loss, kyphosis, very slow movement, ataxia, disorientation, and dragging the hind limbs.Table 1Mean survival time and attack rate of the TGElk vaccinated groupsVaccination groupsAttack rateSurvival time (dpi) (mean ± S.E.)CpG10/10114.8 ± 10.0Mmo10/10183.6 ± 8.8Mdi10/10133.1 ± 15.0Dmo9/9147.4 ± 13.4Ddi8/8142.5 ± 5.8 Open table in a new tab In summary, all vaccinated TgElk mice showed prolongation in the survival after CWD challenge compared with the control group, and this prolongation reached 60% in the Mmo-vaccinated group. However, once the mice reached the terminal stage, mice from all groups displayed very comparable clinical signs. To the best of our knowledge, studies reporting the intraperitoneal infection of TgElk mice are lacking. This led us to assess the infection in the brain of the terminally sick mice using various readouts to confirm the complete clinical attack rate. The brain homogenates from all terminally sick TgElk mice demonstrated prion conversion activity as shown by RT-QuIC assay (Fig. 3, C–G). The mock brain homogenate from the uninfected TgElk mouse was used as negative control, and brain homogenate of intracerebrally CWD-infected and terminally sick TgElk mouse was used as a positive control. Notably, the crude brain homogenate from the vaccinated and intraperitoneally infected TgElk mice in our study initially showed only weak positive signals in RT-QuIC assay (Fig. S1), which was strongly increased after sodium phosphotungstic acid purification (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). Moreover, immunoblot analysis of PK-digested brain homogenates from i.p.-infected TgElk mice demonstrated a PrPSc signature comparable with the CWD inoculum PrPSc pattern (Fig. 3H). Of note, spleen homogenates isolated from all the CWD clinically sick TgElk mice showed remarkable conversion activity in the RT-QuIC assay, which was comparable with the spleen homogenates isolated from i.c.-infected TgElk mice, even without sodium phosphotungstic acid enrichment (Fig. S2, A–G). In addition, PK-digested spleen homogenates from i.p.-infected TgElk mice showed PK-resistant PrP in immunoblot (Fig. S2H). This denotes substantial amounts of infectivity in the spleen of the i.p.-infected TgElk mice. For further confirmation of complete attack rate in i.p.-infected TgElk mice, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for PrPSc in brain sections from both vaccinated and unvaccinated mice (CpG-only). The IHC images of both Mmo-vaccinated and CpG-control mouse brain sections showed positive staining in the brain with PrPSc aggregates found mainly in prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes, and occipital lobe (Fig. 3, I and K). H&E staining of the brain sections showed spongiform pathological changes that were comparable in both vaccinated and nonvaccinated mice (Fig. 3, J and L). Given that all the mice were sacrificed at the terminal stage, we could not detect any characteristic differences in the distribution of PrPSc deposits in their brains. Taken together, we demonstrate clear signs of prion infection in brains of i.p.-infected TgElk mice by RT-QuIC, immunoblot, and IHC analysis. The successful vaccination of TgElk mice with recombinant PrP immunogens prompted us to assess the immunogenicity of the dimeric recombinant PrPs in reindeer, as a relevant large-animal model. The Prnp genotypes of the reindeer used in this study are displayed in Table 2. Seven reindeer were vaccinated with either Mdi (n = 4) or Ddi (n = 3). They were immunized subcutaneously with 500 μg of protein/animal, and CpG was used as an adjuvant. Each reindeer received three doses with 4-week intervals, and blood samples were drawn before the priming dose and 3 weeks after the last booster dose (Fig. 4A). PrP-specific antibody titers were determined in sera of the vaccinated reindeer using PrP-coated ELISA. All Mdi-immunized reindeer sho"

Our aims were to assess attitudes and behaviors related to reproductive health education (RHE) among diabetes healthcare providers and adolescent girls with diabetes, and to pilot a brief clinic-based RHE intervention.We surveyed 29 providers and 50 adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes about RHE experiences, attitudes, and behaviors. We piloted the RHE intervention with 9 adolescent-parent dyads.50% of providers were very uncomfortable discussing pregnancy or contraception. Most (72%) did not proactively initiate RHE; common barriers included insufficient time and subject knowledge. Fewer than 10% recommended long-acting reversible contraceptives. A minority (10%) of adolescents had discussed pregnancy or contraception with a provider. RHE sessions lasted a median of 16 (range 13-24) minutes, and there were promising trends for changes in adolescents' self-efficacy and intentions to use contraception and seek preconception counseling and in their knowledge of reproductive health.Adolescent girls with diabetes rarely receive education on pregnancy and contraception due to provider discomfort, limited knowledge, and limited time. RHE using easily-accessible materials with an educator may help address this gap in care."

Given that hydroxychloroquine has anti-thrombotic properties in lupus, we hypothesized that it could reduce endothelial dysfunction in an animal model of antiphospholipid syndrome. We evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine in preventing endothelial dysfunction in a mouse model of antiphospholipid syndrome.Antiphospholipid syndrome was induced by an injection of monoclonal anti-beta-2-GPI antibodies. Vascular reactivity was evaluated in mesenteric resistance arteries isolated from mice 3 weeks (APL3W) after receiving a single injection of anti-beta-2-GPI antibodies and after 3 weeks of daily oral hydroxychloroquine treatment (HCQ3W) compared to control mice (CT3W). We evaluated endothelial dysfunction by measuring acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation. A pharmacological approach was used to evaluate NO synthase uncoupling (tetrahydrobiopterin) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (Tempol).Impaired acetylcholine-mediated dilation was evidenced in mice 3 weeks after anti-beta-2-GPI antibodies injection compared to CT3W, by reduced maximal dilation (p<0.0001) and sensitivity (pKd) (p = 0.01) to acetylcholine. Hydroxychloroquine improved acetylcholine-dependent dilation, on pKd (p = 0.02) but not maximal capacity compared to untreated mice. The addition of tetrahydrobiopterin (p = 0.02) and/or Tempol (p = 0.0008) improved acetylcholine-mediated dilation in APL3W but not in HCQ3W.We demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction in mouse resistance arteries persisted at 3 weeks after a single injection of monoclonal anti-beta-2-GPI antibodies, and that hydroxychloroquine improved endothelium-dependent dilation at 3 weeks, through improvement of NO synthase coupling and oxidative stress reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2900224610,"Archaeologists often need to date and group artifact types to discern typologies, chronologies, and classifications. For over a century, statisticians have been using classification and clustering techniques to infer patterns in data that can be defined by algorithms. In the case of archaeology, linear regression algorithms are often used to chronologically date features and sites, and pattern recognition is used to develop typologies and classifications. However, archaeological data is often expensive to collect, and analyses are often limited by poor sample sizes and datasets. Here we show that recent advances in computation allow archaeologists to use machine learning based on much of the same statistical theory to address more complex problems using increased computing power and larger and incomplete datasets. This paper approaches the problem of predicting the chronology of archaeological sites through a case study of medieval temples in Angkor, Cambodia. For this study, we have a large dataset of temples with known architectural elements and artifacts; however, less than ten percent of the sample of temples have known dates, and much of the attribute data is incomplete. Our results suggest that the algorithms can predict dates for temples from 821–1150 CE with a 49-66-year average absolute error. We find that this method surpasses traditional supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches for under-specified portions of the dataset and is a promising new method for anthropological inquiry."

All individuals were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11024102 in PLEKHA7, rs3753841 in COL11A1, rs1015213 located between PCMTD1 and ST18, rs3816415 in EPDR1, rs1258267 in CHAT, rs736893 in GLIS3, rs7494379 in FERMT2, and rs3739821 mapping between DPM2 and FAM102A) using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique. Allelic and genotypic frequency differences were evaluated using a logistic regression model. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) analysis was conducted for association testing between genotypes and ocular biometric parameters. False discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was employed, and the statistical power was calculated via power and sample size calculation.Four of the eight SNPs, rs3753841, rs1258267, rs736893 and rs7494379, were associated with PACG (p = 0.007, 0.0016, 0.0045, 0.045, respectively), and only rs3753841, rs1258267 and rs736893 surpassed the FDR correction. For subgroup analysis, only rs1258267 could withstand multiple testing correction in the Han nationality (p = 0.00571).

The association between chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and uric acid levels has rarely been investigated. We aimed to evaluate the levels of serum uric acid in CHC patients. Methods Three hundred and seventy-three histologically confirmed CHC patients who were scheduled to receive antiviral therapy were consecutively enrolled, and 746 age- and sex-matched uninfected controls were included for comparison. Hyperuricemia was defined as a uric acid level > 7 mg/dL in men and > 6.0 mg/dL in women. Results Hyperuricemia was identified in 15.8% of the CHC patients. The uric acid levels did not differ between the CHC patients and the controls (5.54 ± 1.20 mg/dL vs. 5.45 ± 1.45 mg/dL, P = 0.3). Among the 373 CHC patients, the factors associated with hyperuricemia included body mass index (BMI) (OR/CI: 1.13/1.04–1.21, P = 0.003) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR/CI: 0.98/0.97–1.00, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors associated with hyperuricemia in male patients included BMI (OR/CI: 1.12/1.05–1.30, P = 0.006) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4) (OR/CI: 0.27/0.09–0.83, P = 0.02), whereas the factors associated with hyperuricemia in female patients included eGFR (OR/CI: 0.97/0.95–0.99, P = 0.02) and diabetes (OR/CI: 3.03/1.11–8.25, P = 0.03). There was a significant decreasing trend of serum uric acid levels with the progression of fibrotic stages among male patients (6.21 ± 1.03 mg/dL 5.82 ± 1.16 mg/dL and 5.44 ± 1.28 mg/dL in stages F0-2, F3, and F4, respectively, trend P = 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W2899867087,"Irrigated agriculture is a key activity in water resources management at the river basin level in arid and semi-arid areas, since this sector consumes the largest part of the water resources overall. The current study proposes a methodology to evaluate the water footprint (WF) of the irrigated agriculture sector at the river basin level, through a simulation of the anthropised water cycle combining a hydrological model and a decision support system. The main difference from the approaches that have already been used is that the new methodology includes the limitations of the system for the exploitation of water resources where the irrigated areas are located, and it considers the hydrological principles governed by the law of continuity of mass. Water footprint accounting was carried out for the Segura River Basin (South-eastern Spain), applying the methodology proposed and another that is usually applied. The results of the two methodologies were compared, revealing significant differences in the values of the WF, basically due to the blue component. The methodology that is usually applied overestimated the WF of the agriculture in the basin since supply deficits were not taken into account, providing results that would only be possible if there were no spatial or temporal restrictions to water use. So, in order to make the WF indicator useful in water resources management plans, it is necessary to adapt the computations to the main characteristics of the water exploitation system of the whole basin under study, respecting the hydrological principles of the water cycle: regulation and transport infrastructure, the real water resources available and the priority of access to water between concurrent water uses."

Methods To develop community-tailored videos that could be used for future interventions, we conducted Photovoice and digital storytelling workshops with community health workers (CHW) and mothers from 13 rural communities in the Parinari district. Through Photovoice we recognized local barriers to healthy pregnancies. Participants (n = 28) were trained in basic photography skills and ethics. They captured photos representing perceived pregnancy-related road-blocks and supports, and these photos identified central themes. Participants recorded personal stories and “storyboarded” to develop digital stories around these themes, and a Digital Story Curriculum called Nuestras Historias (Our Stories), was created. An acceptability survey of the digital stories was then conducted including 47 men (M) and 60 women (F). Results According to the PhotoVoice workshops, pregnancy-related problems included: lack of partner support, domestic violence, early pregnancies, difficulty attending prenatal appointments, and complications during pregnancy and delivery. Over 30 stories on these themes were recorded. Seven were selected based on clarity, thematic relevance, and narrative quality and were edited by a professional filmmaker. The acceptability survey showed that local participants found the digital stories novel (M = 89.4%, F = 83.3%), relatable (M = 89.4%, F = 93.2%), educational (M = 91.5%, F = 93.3%) and shareable (M = 100%, F = 100%). Over 90% of respondents rated the digital stories as “Excellent” or “Good”, found the videos “Useful” and considered them “Relevant” to their communities. Conclusions The digital stories address community-specific problems through narrative persuasion using local voices and photography. This combination had a high acceptability among the target population and can serve as a model for developing educational strategies in a community-tailored manner. This package of seven videos will be further evaluated through a cluster randomized trial."

In the present fMRI study, we wanted to replicate and extend previous findings on the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Specifically, we aimed to: (a) replicate the finding that different neural mechanisms are associated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation, (b) replicate the finding that adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective decreases emotion explosiveness and accumulation at the level of self-report, and (c) examine whether adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective similarly modulates activity in the brain regions associated with emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Participants in an fMRI scanner were asked to adopt a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective while reading and thinking about negative social feedback, and to report on felt changes in negative affect during that period using an emotion intensity profile tracking approach. We replicated previous findings showing that emotion explosiveness and accumulation were related to activity in regions involved in self-referential processing (such as the medial prefrontal cortex) and sustained visceral arousal (such as the posterior insula), respectively. The finding that adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective lowers emotion explosiveness and accumulation was also replicated at a self-report level. However, perspective taking did not impact activity in the neural correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2899995256,"This paper explores the mechanism for the harmonic voltage measurement error (HVME) of a capacitor voltage transformer (CVT) in a comprehensive way and develops a practical error correction method to improve the harmonic measurement performance of a CVT. The harmonic equivalent circuit (HEC) of CVTs with different types of dampers are established and the parameter value calculation methods of the circuit elements are presented. Characteristics of the individual inherent resonance mode of the HEC, including the resonant frequency, the resonant type and the circuit elements involved, are analyzed systematically. Centered on resonance mode formulation, an universal error correction method for CVTs in measuring harmonic voltage is proposed based on the piecewise fitting of the transformation ratio. A physical experimental platform available for low-voltage CVTs is developed in laboratory, which utilizes a 10-kV harmonic generator and a step-up transformer to provide harmonic signals with high voltage level. Moreover, a novel experimental scheme for testing the HVME of high-voltage CVTs is proposed based on alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) filters. Experiments are conducted on these experimental platforms to test the HVME of a 35-kV CVT in laboratory and a 525-kV CVT in a back-to-back DC converter station. The experimental results verify the validity of the built HECs of CVTs, the resonant mode analysis results and the resonant frequency calculation method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed harmonic error correction method is proved by several examples."
https://openalex.org/W2900213932,"Land reclamation has become a significant way for the improvement of ecological environment in mining areas. When selecting the optimal land reclamation scheme, LNNs (linguistic neutrosophic numbers) are suitable to describe the complex fuzzy evaluation information through linguistic truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees. Furthermore, the Hamacher aggregation operators are good tools to handle multi-criteria decision making problems. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to extend Hamacher aggregation operators with LNNs and then build a decision making framework for evaluating land reclamation schemes in mining areas. First, new operational laws of LNNs based on Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm are defined. Then, several linguistic neutrosophic Hamacher aggregation operators, including the linguistic neutrosophic Hamacher weighted mean aggregation operators and linguistic neutrosophic Hamacher hybrid weighted mean aggregation operators are developed. Meanwhile, their desirable properties are proved. Thereafter, a method for decision making with linguistic neutrosophic information based on these operators is proposed to deal with complex decision problems. At last, the validity of this method is confirmed by an illustrative example of evaluating the land reclamation schemes in mining areas. In addition, the impact of the parameter in extended Hamacher aggregation operators is discussed. The merits of the proposed method are also highlighted by comparing with other decision making methods. The results show that the proposed linguistic neutrosophic Hamacher aggregation operators have great flexibility and advantages, and can provide powerful ways for the evaluation of land reclamation schemes."

The aim of this study was to discriminate in cardiovascular disease patients between adipocytokines that are produced locally by the heart and those supplied by the circulation. Methods Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to determine levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pBNP), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), leptin, lipocalin-2, neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and adiponectin in venous plasma and pericardial fluid harvested during elective cardio-thoracic surgery (n = 132–152). Results In pericardial fluid compared to plasma, the levels were significantly smaller (p < 0.001) for leptin, lipocalin-2, neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3, hsCRP and adiponectin. For these biomarkers, the ratio of pericardial fluid-to-plasma level ([PF]/[P], median (interquartile range)) was 0.65 (0.47–1.01), 0.78 (0.56–1.09), 0.23 (0.11–0.60), 0.17 (0.09–0.36), 0.14 (0.08–0.35), and 0.25 (0.15–0.34), respectively. In contrast, pericardial fluid was significantly enriched (p < 0.001) in NT-pBNP ([PF]/[P]: 1.9 (1.06–2.73)) and even more so for FABP4 ([PF]/[P]: 3.90 (1.47–9.77)). Moreover, in pericardial fluid, the adipocytokines interrelated all significantly positive and correlated negative to hsCRP, whereas for NT-pBNP only a significantly positive correlation with adiponectin was found. These interrelations were distinct from those in the plasma, as were the correlations of the pericardial biomarkers with patient characteristics compared to plasma. Conclusions In cardiovascular disease patients, the pericardial cavity is a distinct adipocytokine microenvironment in which especially FABP4 is mainly derived from the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2900152620,"Introduction To evaluate outcomes following open reduction and internal fixation of displaced proximal humeral fractures with regards to the surgeon’s experience. Material and methods Patients were included undergoing ORIF by use of locking plates for displaced two-part surgical neck type proximal humeral fractures. Reduction and functional outcomes were compared between procedures that were conducted by trauma surgeons [TS], senior (>2 years after board certified) trauma surgeons [STS] and trauma surgeons performing ≥50 shoulder surgeries per year [SS]. Quality of reduction was measured on postoperative x-rays. Functional outcomes were assessed by gender- and age-related Constant Score (nCS). Secondary outcome measures were complication and revision rates. Results Between 2002–2014 (12.5 years) n = 278 two-part surgical neck type humeral fractures (AO 11-A2, 11-A3) were included. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed with the following educational levels: [TS](n = 68, 25.7%), [STS](n = 110, 41.5%) and [SS](n = 77, 29.1%). Functional outcome (nCS) increased with each higher level of experience and was significantly superior in [SS] (93.3) vs. [TS] (79.6; p = 0.01) vs. [STS] (83.0; p = 0.05). [SS] (7.8%) had significantly less complications compared with [TS] (11.3%; p = 0.003) and [STS](11.7%; p = 0.01) moreover significantly less revision rates (3.9%) vs. [TS](8.2%) and [STS](7.4%) (p<0.001). Primary revision was necessary in 13 cases (4.7%) due to malreduction of the fracture. Conclusion Quality of reduction and functional outcomes following open reduction and internal fixation of displaced two-part surgical neck fractures are related to the surgeon’s experience. In addition, complications and revision rates are less frequent if surgery is conducted by a trauma surgeon performing ≥50 shoulder surgeries per year."
https://openalex.org/W2900436099,"Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) induce the protein to misfold and aggregate. Missense mutations at more than 80 different amino acid positions have been associated with disease. How these mutations heighten the propensity of SOD1 to misfold and aggregate is unclear. With so many mutations, it is possible that more than one mechanism of aggregation may be involved. Of many possible mechanisms to explain heightened aggregation, one that has been suggested is that mutations that eliminate charged amino acids could diminish repulsive forces that would inhibit aberrant protein:protein interactions. Mutations at twenty-one charged residues in SOD1 have been associated with fALS, but of the 11 Lys residues in the protein, only 1 has been identified as mutated in ALS patients. Here, we examined whether loss of positively charged surface Lys residues in SOD1 would induce misfolding and formation of intracellular inclusions. We mutated four different Lys residues (K30, K36, K75, K91) in SOD1 that are not particularly well conserved, and expressed these variants as fusion proteins with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to assess inclusion formation. We also assessed whether these mutations induced binding to a conformation-restricted SOD1 antibody, designated C4F6, which recognizes non-natively folded protein. Although we observed some mutations to cause enhanced C4F6 binding, we did not observe that mutations that reduce charge at these positions caused the protein to form intracellular inclusions. Our findings may have implications for the low frequency of mutations at Lys residues SOD1 in ALS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2899984498,"Background Although hypoalbuminemia is a known risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) following surgery, little is known about its effects following aneurysm clipping surgery. We aimed to investigate the predictors of AKI and overall mortality and assessed the relationship between preoperative albumin and postoperative outcomes after aneurysm clipping surgery. Methods This study included 2,339 patients who underwent aneurysm clipping surgery. According to the criteria updated by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), patients were classified into AKI and no AKI group. Independent AKI predictors were analyzed by multivariate methods, and the influence of AKI on the outcome variables was assessed with by propensity score matching analysis. Survival in relation to AKI was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results The total proportion of patients who developed AKI was 1.9%. The cutoff value of preoperative albumin for predicting AKI was 3.9 g/dL. Multivariate analyses showed that preoperative albumin≤ 3.9 g/dL, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, male sex, phenylephrine use, and hemoglobin were associated with postoperative AKI development. In multivariate analysis, mortality was increased in AKI patients (p< 0.01). After propensity score matching, preoperative albumin≤ 3.9 g/dL was significantly related to AKI and overall mortality. Conclusion Preoperative albumin≤ 3.9 g/dL is associated with postoperative AKI and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2900013469,"This study aimed to understand the impact of iron deficiency anemia in female users of a hematology service in a developing country.Retrospective cross-sectional study of adult and adolescent women with iron deficiency anemia who presented to a hospital department of hematology.A tertiary university hospital inpatient and outpatient hematology service.All female patients who were ≥13 years of age with confirmed iron deficiency anemia and received hospital hematology services.A total of 208 patients were enrolled and analyzed in the registry. The mean age of the patients was 41.4 years (range, 14-82). A total of 195 patients had anemia that was moderate or severe according to the World Health Organization anemia classification with 13 patients having mild anemia. A total of 108 patients had comorbidities, which were primarily endocrine and cardiovascular. Iron deficiency anemia was associated with very heavy (n = 56, 30%) or heavy menses (n = 84, 45%) in 140 patients and was associated with poor (<200 g/week of red meat) (n = 101, 54%) or very poor (vegan, strict vegetarian) nutrition (n = 34, 18%) in 135 patients. A total of 101 patients had a previous pregnancy history with a mean of six previous pregnancies (range, 1-11 pregnancy episodes per patient). Blood film was performed on all patients; only four had a picture consistent with thalassemia minor.Iron deficiency anemia is caused by multiple factors. Heavy menses and low consumption of red meat were found to be associated with the severity of anemia. Our findings may be useful for healthcare planners and policy makers in increasing efforts to reduce the prevalence and severity of iron deficiency anemia among women in Jordan."
https://openalex.org/W2899618728,"Smoking is an extremely lethal act and is associated with many illnesses. Lately, major concerns that passive smokers face the same health risks as (if not higher than) active smokers have been raised. Some studies have shown that active smoking is associated with low serum levels of vitamins and testosterone. Are these facts also valid in passive smokers? This study investigated the levels of cotinine, testosterone, follicle stimulating (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), prolactin and vitamin E in male active smokers and compare these with male passive smokers. Serum levels of cotinine, testosterone, FSH, LH, prolactin and vitamin E were determined in 60 cigarette smokers, 60 passive smokers and 60 non-smokers recruited from Calabar metropolis. The hormones were assayed using ELISA and Vitamin E using high performance liquid chromatography. Socio-demographic and anthropometric indices were obtained and data analyzed using PAWstatistic 18. Cotinine levels were significantly (p<0.05) higher in active smokers than in passive smokers and controls. Vitamin E and testosterone were significantly lower in both active (p<0.05) and passive smokers (p<0.05) when compared to non-smokers. The FSH of the active smokers was significantly higher (p = 0.034) than that of the controls while the passive smokers had the highest LH values (p = 0.0001). However, there were no significant variations in the prolactin levels among the three groups. Both passive and active smoking depletes serum vitamins E and lowers testosterone levels. Lower serum vitamin E is pointer to increased oxidative stress which in conjunction with lower testosterone levels may lead to increased incidence of infertility in both active and passive male smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2899989643,"Automatic image annotation not only has the efficiency of text-based image retrieval but also achieves the accuracy of content-based image retrieval. Users of annotated images can locate images they want to search by providing keywords. Currently most automatic image annotation algorithms do not consider the relative importance of each region in the image, and some algorithms extract the image features as a whole. This makes it difficult for annotation words to reflect salient versus non-salient areas of the image. Users searching for images are usually only interested in the salient areas. We propose an algorithm that integrates a visual attention mechanism with image annotation. A preprocessing step divides the image into two parts, the salient regions and everything else, and the annotation step places a greater weight on the salient region. When the image is annotated, words relating to the salient region are given first. The support vector machine uses particle swarm optimization to annotate the images automatically. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2900155508,"To assess whether lamina cribrosa depth (LCD) reduction and the rate of change in LCD over time (ΔLCD/Δt) is associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and the rate of RNFL thinning over time (ΔRNFL/Δt) to test the hypothesis that, in a long term, RNFL thinning occurs irrespectively to the displacement of the lamina cribrosa following glaucoma surgery.Twenty-nine primary open-angle glaucoma patients underwent glaucoma surgery. Sixteen patients underwent trabeculectomy and 13 patients undertook non-penetrating deep sclerectomy. Images of optic nerve head using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with enhanced depth imaging technology were obtained preoperatively, at one-, three-, six-month and follow-up postoperative visit from 12 to 29 months after surgery (1pv, 3pv, 6pv, and FUpv, respectively). Correspondingly, measurements of the circumpapillary RNFL thickness were acquired.Intraocular pressure decreased from 24.0±8.9 to 10.9±3.9mmHg at 6pv (P<0.001) and to 12.7±4.4mmHg at FUpv (P<0.001). LCD was reduced from 465.3±136.4μm to 402.9±126.4μm at 1pv (P<0.001) and maintained similar position at 6pv (394.3±118.4μm; P = 0.170 with respect to 1pv). A significant decrease in the LCD was noted at FUpv (342.8±90.3μm, P<0.001) with respect to 6pv. RNFL thickness increased significantly to 64.9±19.8μm at 1pv (P = 0.005) and subsequently decreased to baseline level at 3pv. Further statistically significant decrease in RNFL thickness with respect to previous visit was found at 6pv and at FUpv (56.4±15.6μm and 55.0±14.0μm, P = 0.023 and P = 0.045, respectively). A thinner RNFL thickness at FUpv was not related to the LCD at FUpv (P = 0.129) but was correlated with ΔLCD/Δt at FUpv (P = 0.003). The ΔRNFL/Δt at FUpv was statistically significantly correlated with ΔLCD/Δt at FUpv (P<0.001).This is the first study that considers direct correlation between the rate of change in LCD with the rate of RNFL thinning over time. A thinner RNFL thickness following glaucoma surgery was associated with the rate of LCD reduction, not with position of the lamina cribrosa at the FUpv."
https://openalex.org/W2900050226,"Heart failure (HF), is a major public health issue globally. Echocardiography is cost-effective in the diagnosis in expert hands. This study was conducted to estimate the usefulness of Aortic Root Systolic Excursion (ARSE) as a simple and accurate measure to estimate Left Ventricular (LV) function.This was a cross-sectional echocardiographic study among adults aged ≥ 18 years, with or without heart failure, in sinus rhythm, and with no LV out-let obstruction. We studied the correlations of ARSE with some selected indices of LV Systolic Functions. We determined optimal cut-offs of ARSE in detecting LV dysfunction. We generated a simple regression equation to best estimate LV ejection fraction according to the modified Simpson method.Overall 213 echocardiograms were included from 106 males (49.8%), with mean age of the participants being 52.4 (SD: 18.3) years. The rate of LV systolic dysfunction was highest with Teicholz method (17.4%) and lowest with MAPSE method (5.2%). ARSE correlated with the LV functions. This was highest for the Simpson method (r = 0.619, p<0.001), and lowest for the ITV method (r = 0.319, p<0.001). Optimal cut-offs to detect LV systolic dysfunction was ≈ 6.6 mm. For an LV ejection fraction < 55%, the sensitivity was 82.9%, and the specificity was 97.2%, with an AUROC of 91.6%.The logarithmic regression equation was best in predicting LV ejection fraction (AUC: 60.2%), followed by the power model (AUC: 56.7%), and the linear model (AUC: 53.6%).ARSE correlated well with LV systolic function. The cut-off ≤ 6.5 mm suggest LV systolic dysfunction. LV Ejection Fraction was best estimated with the generic equation: LVEF (%) = 29 x In [ARSE]."
https://openalex.org/W4229672136,"Background Key regulators of developmental processes can be prioritized through integrated analysis of ChIP-Seq data of master transcriptional factors (TFs) such as Nanog and Oct4, active histone modifications (HMs) such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and repressive HMs such as H3K27me3. Recent studies show that broad enrichment signals such as super-enhancers and broad H3K4me3 enrichment signals play more dominant roles than short enrichment signals of the master TFs and H3K4me3 in epigenetic regulatory mechanism. Besides the broad enrichment signals, up to ten thousands of short enrichment signals of these TFs and HMs exist in genome. Prioritization of these broad enrichment signals from ChIP-Seq data is a prerequisite for such integrated analysis. Results Here, we present a method named Clustering-Local-Unique-Enriched-Signals (CLUES), which uses an adaptive-size-windows strategy to identify enriched regions (ERs) and cluster them into broad enrichment signals. Tested on 62 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets of Ctcf and Nrsf, CLUES performs equally well as MACS2 regarding prioritization of ERs with the TF’s motif. Tested on 165 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3, CLUES performs better than existing algorithms on prioritizing broad enrichment signals implicating cell functions influenced by epigenetic regulatory mechanism in cells. Most importantly, CLUES helps to confirm several novel regulators of mouse ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency through integrated analysis of prioritized broad enrichment signals of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, Nanog and Oct4 with the support of a CRISPR/Cas9 negative selection genetic screen. Conclusions CLUES holds promise for prioritizing broad enrichment signals from ChIP-Seq data. The download site for CLUES is https://github.com/Wuchao1984/CLUESv1."
