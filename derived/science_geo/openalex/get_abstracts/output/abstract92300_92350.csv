Subjects performed a tracking task in which the discrete displacements of the tracking cursor could be used to elicit event-related brain potentials. As the resource demands of the tracking task were increased, potentials elicited by the task-defined events increased in amplitude, whereas those elicited by secondary task auditory stimuli decreased."
https://openalex.org/W1965381942,"The transport kinetics of the influenza virus hemagglutinin from its site of synthesis to the apical plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, a polarized epithelial cell line, were studied by a sensitive tryptic assay. Hemagglutinin acquired terminal sugars, as judged by sensitivity to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, 10-15 min after synthesis, and first appeared on the apical domain 15 min later. None of the pulse-labeled hemagglutinin accumulated on the basolateral domain. At 20 degrees C, terminal glycosylation continued, but no hemagglutinin was detected on the cell surface within 2 hr. If the incubation temperature was raised from 20 degrees C to 37 degrees C, hemagglutinin was quickly externalized, demonstrating that the inhibition at low temperature was reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2051001991,"We have studied the effect of DNA methylation on human gamma-globin gene expression, using a novel in vitro DNA methylation technique. With this method we have methylated specific segments of the gamma-globin gene and its 5'-flanking region, which were cloned for this purpose in the bacteriophage vector M13mp8. The vitro methylated DNA was introduced into mouse L-cells by cotransfer using the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene as a selective marker. Transformed cell lines were isolated to examine the inheritance of the segmental methylation pattern and its effect on the expression of the gamma-globin gene. Cells transformed with DNA methylated throughout the M13 vector and gamma-globin DNA sequences do not express the gamma-globin gene. Methyl-C residues in either the M13 DNA sequences or the gamma-globin structural gene have, however, no inhibitory effect on globin transcription. In contrast, methylation in the 5' region of the gamma-globin gene (from nucleotides -760 to +100) prevents transcription. These data indicate that DNA methylation in the 5' region of a gene might play a direct role in the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1986356700,"A detailed analysis of the mapping and kinetic properties of oligo(dT)-cellulose bound and unbound transcripts synthesized in HeLa cells has indicated that two distinct transcription events take place in the rDNA region. Of these, one appears to start ∼25 bp upstream of the tRNAPhe gene and to terminate at or near the 3′ end of the 16S rRNA gene, being responsible for the synthesis of the bulk of rRNA. The other transcription event starts near the 5′ end of the 12S rRNA gene, proceeds beyond the 3′ end of the 16S rRNA gene, and results in the synthesis of a polycistronic molecule corresponding to almost the entire H-strand, which is destined to be processed to yield the mRNAs and most of the tRNAs encoded in the heavy strand. The existence of two overlapping transcription units with distinct promoters is probably the basis for the differential regulation of synthesis of the rRNAs and heavy-strand-coded mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2103981303,"Fusion of immortal cell lines with normal human fibroblasts or certain other immortal cell lines yields hybrids having limited division potential. Cellular immortality was found to be a recessive phenotype in hybrids. It was also found that at least two separate events in the normal cell genome can result in immortality. In fusions involving certain immortal parent cells, these events can be complemented to result in hybrids with finite division capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2011116097,"Intracellular recordings from mammalian neuroendocrine cells showed that steady, injected currents can modify and block periodic spike bursts previously associated with increased neurohormone release. Spike afterpotentials could sum to form plateau potentials, which generated bursts and did not depend on axonal conduction or chemical synapses. Therefore, bursting involves a spike-dependent, positive-feedback mechanism endogenous to single neuroendocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1534815799,"The forms of steroid receptors detected in mammalian tissue cytosols vary from a globular fragment, the mero-receptor, with a molecular weight (Mr) of approximately 23,000 to highly asymmetric molybdate-stabilized complexes (Mr approximately 330,000). Our objectives were to investigate the relationships among various receptor forms and mechanisms of stabilization by Na2MoO4, to characterize endogenous proteolytic enzymes, and to evaluate the effects of freezing the tissues on receptor structure and protease activities in the resultant cytosols. Glucocorticoid receptors and proteases were analyzed in cytosols from fresh and frozen rat liver and kidney. Enzymes were assayed fluorometrically at approximately 24 degrees C, with peptidyl tyrosine, lysine, and phenylalanine derivatives of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Rates of cleavage of the tyrosine-containing substrate by crude and partially purified liver cytosol enzymes were markedly suppressed by Na2MoO4. While receptor cleavage by these enzymes has not been demonstrated, these results illustrate the direct inhibition of proteolysis by molybdate. Rates of cleavage of the lysine-containing substrate were 7- to 40-fold higher in cytosols from frozen liver and fresh or frozen kidney, in which the Stokes radius (Rs) of the largest receptor form was 70-74 A, than in fresh liver cytosol, in which Rs was 84 +/- 2 A (n = 20). Filtration of the 84 A complex (Mr approximately 330,000) in hypertonic buffer without Na2MoO4 revealed a 7:3 mixture of forms with Rs of 50-60 A (Mr approximately 90,000) and Rs of 30-40 A (Mr approximately 50,000). The latter are derived from the 50-60 A forms by proteolysis and/or dissociation. We conclude that the 84 A (untransformed) receptor is an oligomer, probably a tetramer, containing the 50-60 A subunits and that purification of the intact structure will require removal or inactivation of contaminating proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2068764665,"The yeast plasmid 2μ and certain hybrid plasmids constructed from it are maintained stably and at high copy number in yeast cells. By examining various mutant hybrid 2μ plasmids, we show that these properties require the integrity of four plasmid loci. Two of these, designated REPI and REP2, are active in trans and correspond to two open coding regions of 2μ. The other two loci are active only in cis and correspond to the origin of replication and to a region, designated REP3, located several hundred bp away from the origin and consisting of direct repeats of a 62 bp sequence. We propose that the REP loci constitute a copy control system that overrides normal cellular restriction on plasmid replication and amplifies the plasmid when copy number is low."
https://openalex.org/W2068964932,"Rats trained on an eight-arm radial maze were challenged by placing the maze in new spatial environments. Administration of opiate antagonists, either naloxone or diprenorphine, after exposure to the new environments significantly improved subsequent performance. The effect of naloxone on spatial memory was attenuated when drug administration occurred 2 hours after maze exposure."
https://openalex.org/W335970234,"An octasaccharide with high affinity for antithrombin, isolated after partial deaminative cleavage of heparin, was previously found to have an L-iduronosyl-N-acetylglucosaminyl-6-O-sulfate nonreducing terminal disaccharide unit. After digestion of this octasaccharide with alpha-L-iduronidase and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, two fractions, with high and low affinity for antithrombin, respectively, were isolated by affinity chromatography on antithrombin-Sepharose. Structural analysis showed that the high affinity fraction contained intact octasaccharide, whereas the low affinity fraction consisted of the expected heptasaccharide, lacking a 6-sulfate group on the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue. Digestion of the octasaccharide with alpha-L-iduronidase only yielded heptasaccharide which was identical with the low affinity species except for the presence of this 6-sulfate group. This less degraded heptasaccharide retained high affinity for antithrombin. It is concluded that the 6-sulfate group on the N-acetylglucosamine residue is of critical importance to the interaction between heparin and antithrombin."
https://openalex.org/W2048951599,"Dissociated cell suspensions, prepared from the substantia nigra and septal regions of rat embryos, can be grafted to the depths of the caudate-putamen and hippocampus of aged rats. The grafts were rich in dopamine-containing and acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons and had produced extensive new dopaminergic and cholinergic terminal networks in the host neostriatum and hippocampus, respectively. The intrastriatal dopaminergic grafts were associated with a significant improvement in motor coordination in the aged rats. This result suggests that the intracerebral grafting technique may provide a new tool for exploring the role of dopaminergic and cholinergic deficits in the neurological and behavioral impairments associated with aging."
https://openalex.org/W1970598318,"A climate of fear now dominates the discussion of environmental issues. The scientific community can help alleviate this fear by making a greater effort to explain to the public the uncertainties involved in estimates of risk. Current statutory mandates designed to protect public health both demand levels of protection that technology cannot achieve and are uncoordinated across government agencies. A common statutory framework for dealing with environmental risks is needed. In addition, care must be taken to separate the scientific process of assessing risk from the use of such assessments, together with economic and policy considerations, in the management of risks through regulatory action."
https://openalex.org/W1598361041,"Horseradish peroxidase catalyzes the anaerobic oxidation of 2-nitropropane (probably as the nitronate R-) by H2O2 via Compounds I and II to form R-R. The oxidation rate is stimulated 10-fold by O2 and the products become acetone and NO-2. The aerobic oxidation of R- is a free radical chain reaction which is initiated by peroxidase and propagated by R because (a) R-R, reasonably, must arise as 2R leads to R-R, (b) over 90% of the enzyme-initiated reaction occurs free in solution, and (c) the Km value for R- is independent of the type of initiator. We present a scheme for initiation, propagation, and termination which explains product structure, the effects of resorcinol, CN-, ascorbate, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, as well as the ping-pong reaction kinetics. We used methanenitronate to investigate the locus of electron transfer from R- into the heme moiety of the enzyme because this donor reacts with Compound II to form an isoporphyrin, which then rearranges to a modified enzyme in which the ferriheme contains the nitromethyl group in covalent linkage at a methine carbon. The modified enzyme is 30-50% as active catalytically as the native enzyme. We argue that reduction of Compound II by R- occurs at the methine carbon by two competing pathways, namely, direct one electron transfer and, at about one-half the frequency, homolytic cleavage of a covalent heme-substrate adduct (isoporphyrin)."
https://openalex.org/W1584392981,"We have used a cDNA probe specific for an aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible form of cytochrome P-450 to analyze the accumulation of enzyme-specific mRNA in wild type Hepa 1c1c7 cells and in variant cells defective in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction. In wild type cells, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) produces a 25-50-fold increase in the steady state concentration of cytochrome P1-450-specific RNA. This RNA binds to oligo(dT)-cellulose and migrates in agarose gels as a single species of about 2900 nucleotides. Dot hybridization analyses of total RNA indicate that half-maximal induction of P1-450 mRNA occurs at about 10 pM TCDD; maximal induction occurs at about 100 pM TCDD. Parallel increases occur in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. RNA induction precedes aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction by 2-4 h. Kinetic analyses of mRNA induction in response to submaximal concentrations of TCDD reveal no change in the degradation of P1-450 mRNA during induction. We detect an increase in P1-450 mRNA 30 min after TCDD administration. Full accumulation of mRNA occurs in cells in which protein synthesis is inhibited by 95-97%. Variant cells with decreased TCDD receptors exhibit decreased basal and inducible levels of P1-450 mRNA. Variant cells with a defect in nuclear localization of the inducer-receptor complex exhibit virtually no basal or inducible levels of P1-450 mRNA. Hybrid cells formed by fusing these different variants contain wild type basal and inducible levels of P1-450 mRNA. We conclude that expression of the cytochrome P1-450 gene is under transcriptional control and requires nuclear localization of the TCDD receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1502816207,"Chymotrypsin cleaves bacteriorhodopsin to two fragments: C-1, amino acids 72-248, and C-2, amino acids 1-71. Denaturation and renaturation of these fragments have been studied. Following denaturation in sodium dodecyl sulfate, both C-1 and C-2 regain secondary structure in phospholipid/cholate/sodium dodecyl sulfate mixed micelles. When combined, they form a complex with a secondary structure resembling that of bacterio-opsin. However, on further incubation in phospholipid/cholate/sodium dodecyl sulfate, separate fragments as well as the C-1 and C-2 complex denature again. Retinal binds tightly to the C-1 and C-2 complex (Kb greater than 10(7) M-1) and stabilizes the folded conformation. The formation of the complex of C-1, C-2, and retinal is maximal at pH 6.0. The ternary complex contains two species: one which absorbs similarly to the light-adapted purple membrane and a second with a lambda max between 450 and 500 nm. The formation of the latter species is favored at higher temperatures and is reversible. Vesicles formed from the ternary complex of C-1, C-2, and retinal translocate protons at a level close to that of intact bacteriorhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1515720480,"An enzymatic activity that synthesizes oligoribonucleotides in lengths of 9-10 nucleotides and multiples thereof has been purified over 10,000-fold from mouse hybridoma cells. The oligoribonucleotides serve as primers to initiate DNA synthesis, and the activity has properties expected of mammalian DNA primase. The most highly purified fraction has two major protein components, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, of 56,000 and 46,000 Da. These proteins co-purify in a 1:1 stoichiometry along with oligoribonucleotide synthesis activity and with an activity that initiates the synthesis of DNA by DNA polymerase alpha. The sedimentation coefficient on glycerol gradients is 5.5 S, and this is consistent with one 56,000- and one 46,000-Da subunit/native enzyme. No DNA polymerase activity was detected in the most highly purified fraction. Poly(dIT) is the most active template, whereas a variety of single-stranded DNA templates are 10-15% as active and double-stranded DNA templates are 10-15% as active and double-stranded DNA is less than 1%. rATP is an absolute requirement as is Mg2+. No ATPase activity was detected with or without addition of DNA, single- or double-stranded. (NH4)2SO4 and NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.6, are inhibitory above 20 mM, whereas KCl is inhibitory above 80 mM. beta-D-arabinose-CTP is a strong inhibitor of primase; approximately 50% inhibition is observed when present at one-fifth the concentration of rCTP."
https://openalex.org/W63150554,"A high affinity binding site for leukotriene C4 (LTC4), one component of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis, has been identified in a membrane preparation from rat lung. As measured by a filtration technique, [3H]LTC4 binding was saturable, specific, reversible, and heat-sensitive. In the presence of 20 mM CaCl2, the dissociation constant (KD) was 41 +/- 9 nM and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) was 31 +/- 10 pmol/mg of protein. Specificity was demonstrated by competition studies in which LTC4 had a Ki of 40 nM against specifically bound [3H]LTC4, whereas leukotriene D4 (LTD4) had a Ki of 4 microM. The stereoisomers (5R, 6R) LTC4, (5S, 6S) LTC4, and (5R, 6S) LTC4 had Ki values 3-, 15-, and 25-fold higher than that of natural (5S, 6R) LTC4. Leukotrienes E4 and B4, several prostaglandins and fatty acids, glutathione, and platelet activating factor were even less effective with Ki values above 10 microM. A slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis antagonist, FPL 55712, which, in some systems, distinguishes LTC4- from LTD4-induced contractions, was a weak competitor with a Ki of 16 microM. Serine-borate complex which inhibits gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, an enzyme responsible for LTC4 metabolism, did not alter binding. In addition, 100 microM FPL 55712 did not reduce metabolism. These observations suggest that the binding observed for LTC4 may represent association with a physiological receptor for this molecule which has a relatively low affinity for LTD4."
https://openalex.org/W250367149,"A protein of Mr = 43,000 (43K protein) is a major component of highly purified postsynaptic membranes isolated from Torpedo electric organ. It can be removed from these membranes by alkaline treatment or with 10 mM lithium diiodosalicylate, conditions which extract peripheral membrane proteins without solubilizing the acetylcholine receptor. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the lithium diiodosalicylate extract shows it to contain several major Mr = 43,000 components of isoelectric points between 7.0 and 8.0 and a minor component of approximately pI 5.6. The pI 5.6 polypeptide co-migrates with skeletal muscle actin on a two-dimensional gel and gives a peptide map pattern very similar to that of actin. The three major spots of pI 7.0-8.0 yield peptide maps which are indistinguishable from one another but quite different from that of actin. The membrane-bound forms of both the basic 43K protein and actin can be iodinated in a lactoperoxidase-catalyzed reaction only if the membrane vesicles are first permeabilized with saponin, a treatment which permits entry of macromolecules to the interior of the vesicles. An immunoblot of a two-dimensional gel shows that a rabbit antiserum made against alkaline extract reacts strongly with the basic 43K protein and to lesser extent with an acidic component of Mr = 55,000 but not with actin. Immunofluorescence studies have shown that this antiserum reacts with the innervated face of Torpedo electrocytes and recognizes a component of rat diaphragm muscle which is highly concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (Froehner, S.C., Gulbrandsen, V., Hyman, C., Jeng, A. Y., Neubig, R. R., and Cohen, J. B. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 5230-5234). Similar experiments on intact rat muscle indicate that, like the 43K protein of Torpedo postsynaptic membranes, the immunologically related component in mammalian muscle endplates is located on the cytoplasmic side of the postsynaptic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1491805377,"There is good agreement between the target molecular weight and the known molecular weight of human leukocyte interferons (about 20,000). The target molecular weight of fibroblast interferon, 31,000 to 42,000, is significantly larger than the monomer molecular weight of 21,000 to 24,000, suggesting that the dimer may be the predominant active functional unit in solution. A range from 63,000 to 73,000 for the target molecular weight of several different fractions of immune interferon (including natural crude as well as the recombinant form) indicates that the functional form of the immune interferon may be a trimer or tetramer. Thus, these studies indicate that the functional unit of leukocyte interferon is the monomer, that of fibroblast interferon is a dimer, and that of immune interferon is probably a tetramer (or trimer)."
https://openalex.org/W2034974057,"An electron micrographic morphometric analysis of nerve endings in substantia nigra of rats repeatedly treated with haloperidol was performed. Although most parameters showed no difference, drug-treated animals exhibited a significant shift in the distribution of relative numbers of axon terminals, suggesting neuroleptic-induced axon-collateral sprouting."
https://openalex.org/W347017852,"The coat protein of the small RNA virus MS2 shows charge heterogeneity in vivo. In most strains there is a basic satellite of the native protein. We have shown that this basic satellite is greatly diminished or absent in strains with the streptomycin-resistant allele, rpsL, a mutation which leads to increased translational accuracy. Further, the satellite is present in cells where the coat protein is encoded by duplex DNA. Tryptic digests of the satellite show that it contains new lysine-containing peptides which appear to be the same as those found in derivatives of coat protein which have a lysine for asparagine substitution. Sequencing of the NH2-terminal 19 amino acids of the satellite protein shows that the asparagine codon AAU at amino acid 12 is misread approximately 8 times more frequently than the AAC at amino acid 3. We conclude that the satellite species is the result of basal level lysine for asparagine substitution. These substitutions are most likely caused by preferential misreading of AAU codons at a frequency of approximately 5 X 10(-3), 10-fold higher than the average error frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1572719474,"Regulation of hexose transport was investigated in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) which develop 4- to 8-fold enhanced hexose transport activity during glucose starvation. The presence of cycloheximide in low (0.5 micrograms/ml) concentrations during starvation largely blocked the enhancement of transport activity. Glucose refeeding of CEF in the starvation state led to a decline in transport to the basal level. This decline was either potentiated or blocked by the presence of cycloheximide in low or high (50 micrograms/ml) concentrations, respectively. Exposure of CEF in the fed state to low concentrations of cycloheximide resulted in a 70% decrease of transport within 6 h, whereas exposure to high concentrations of cycloheximide led to only a modest loss (35% decrease). In the glucose-starved state, CEF had no significant decline of transport when exposed to cycloheximide at either high or low concentrations. The uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by fed, starved, or cycloheximide-treated CEF correlated closely with D-glucose transport activity and [3H]cytochalasin B binding by plasma membranes prepared from CEF exposed to the same conditions. Hexose transport activity of CEF seems to largely depend on the number of functioning carriers in the plasma membrane, which apparently reflect the balance between carrier synthesis and inactivation. These two processes require protein synthesis, but are differentially sensitive to the effects of cycloheximide, such that low concentrations of cycloheximide appear to block primarily synthesis while high concentrations block both processes. Furthermore, during starvation the enhancement of transport appears largely due to decreased carrier inactivation in the face of continued carrier synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1631751954,"N-Acetylglutamate synthetase was purified 33,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from the matrix fraction of rat liver mitochondria. The purification procedure involved treatment of mitochondria with digitonin, ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, Affi-Gel blue chromatography, acetylglutaminyl Bio-Gel chromatography, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and isoelectric focusing. As the enzyme lost activity in contact with a glass surface, glassware coated with silicone was used throughout the purification. Triton X-100 stabilized the enzyme and was included in most buffers at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v). The purified acetylglutamate synthetase has a specific activity of 92.4 mumol min-1 (mg of protein)-1, in the presence of 1 mM L-arginine. The enzyme had a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 8.1 S and its molecular weight was estimated to be about 160,000. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the enzyme migrated as a single protein band with Mr = 57,000, indicating a composition of three subunits of similar size. The purified acetylglutamate synthetase showed a high substrate specificity for L-glutamate and acetyl-CoA, confirming the previous results with a less purified preparation (Shigesada, K., and Tatibana, M. (1978) Eur. J. Biochem. 84, 285-291). Among other 14 acyl-CoAs tested, only propionyl-CoA could substitute for acetyl-CoA, as an acyl donor, with a reaction rate 4.3% of that with acetyl-CoA at 0.5 mM. Among amino acids other than L-glutamate and derivatives or analogues of glutamate tested, the following served as an acyl acceptor: glycine at a rate 2.7% of that with L-glutamate at 1.0 mM, L-glutamine (5.0%), L-glutamate gamma-hydroxamate (15.5%), DL-alpha-aminoadipate (5.2%), and DL-alpha-aminopimelate (4.0%). The purified enzyme is markedly stimulated by L-arginine. The specificity of L-arginine as a low molecular weight activator was strict; only L-argininic acid could activate the enzyme to a lesser extent. Cationic polypeptides, such as protamine, polyarginine and polylysine, also activated the synthetase. The effect was additive to that of arginine."
https://openalex.org/W1514561171,"The molecular dynamics of the collagen backbone in intact connective tissues has been elucidated using 13C line shape analysis. Since one-third of the amino acid residues in collagen are glycines, we have labeled: (a) reconstituted lathrytic (uncross-linked) chick calvaria collagen fibrils; (b) rat tail tendon (cross-linked); and (c) rat calvaria (cross-linked and mineralized) collagen with [1-13C]glycine. The proton-enhanced and normal 90 degrees - t proton-decoupled spectrum of each collagen sample shows an asymmetric chemical shift powder pattern for the glycine carbonyl carbon. The powder line width, delta, (delta = sigma zz - sigma xx) at 22 degrees C for the uncross-linked reconstituted collagen fibril is 108 ppm, whereas the maximum value of delta (140 ppm) is observed for the cross-linked and mineralized collagen fibrils in rat calvaria. The powder line widths for the cross-linked fibrils in tail tendons and demineralized calvaria are 124 and 120 ppm, respectively. However, since the same line shape and line width (145 ppm) are observed for all samples at -35 degrees C, the difference in delta values observed at room temperature is attributed to differences in molecular mobility of collagen in various samples. The line shapes are analyzed using a dynamic model in which azimuthal orientation of the collagen backbone is assumed to fluctuate as a consequence of reorientation about the helix axis. The observed line shapes are sensitive to motions having correlation times less than approximately 10(-4) s and the analysis provides the values of the root mean square fluctuation in azimuthal angle, gamma rms, due to such motions. It is found that gamma rms equals 41 degrees, 33 degrees, and 14 degrees for the uncross-linked, cross-linked, and mineralized collagens, respectively. These results provide the first information about the extent that cross-linking and mineralization restrict molecular motion in collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2413578079,"Essentially all of the DNA polymerase alpha activity in CV-1 monkey cells could be extracted as an enzyme complex that used DNA substrates with a low primer:template ratio, such as denatured DNA, at least 25 times more efficiently than did purified alpha polymerase. This form of the enzyme was rapidly dissociated either by the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 or by chromatography on phosphocellulose to generate alpha polymerase and its protein cofactor complex, C1C2. Both alpha polymerase and C1C2 were then independently purified free of deoxyribonuclease, RNA polymerase, DNA ligase, and ATPase activities, and the C1C2 complex was shown to consist of at least two proteins. Purified C1C2, which exhibited no DNA polymerase activity, completely restored the ability of alpha polymerase to use denatured DNA. Although high concentrations of denatured DNA inhibited the activity of C1C2, which binds tightly to single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA, low concentrations catalyzed reconstitution of alpha polymerase with C1C2. The resulting enzyme complex was chromatographically distinct from alpha polymerase on DEAE-Bio-Gel, was no longer dependent upon addition of C1C2 in order to utilize denatured DNA as effectively as DNase I-activated DNA, and was not inhibited by high concentrations of denatured DNA. These properties of the purified reconstituted enzyme were indistinguishable from those native alpha X C1C2-polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1529764317,"The complete amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta subunits of allophycocyanin from the unicellular rhodophyte, Cyanidium caldarium, were determined by automated Edman degradation of the proteins and peptides derived from them by chemical and enzymatic cleavages. The sequence of the alpha subunit was determined from the sequences of tryptic, endoproteinase lysine-C, and cyanogen bromide peptides and carboxypeptidase A and Y digestion of the protein. The sequence of the beta subunit was determined from the sequences of tryptic, endoproteinase lysine-C, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and cyanogen bromide peptides and in addition, a peptide derived from acid cleavage of an aspartyl-prolyl bond. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of the protein was determined by digestion with carboxypeptidase A. The alpha subunit contains 160 amino acids, one phycocyanobilin chromophore attached at residue 80 by a cysteinyl-thioether linkage, and the Mr calculated from the sequence is 18,160. The beta subunit contains 161 amino acids, one phycocyanobilin chromophore attached at residue 81 by a cysteinyl-thioether linkage, and the Mr calculated from the sequence is 18,125. The amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta subunits of allophycocyanin from C. caldarium are the first complete amino acid sequences of an allophycocyanin from a eukaryotic red alga.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate indicates that the complex is composed of five distinct polypeptides of Mr = 37,000, 33,500, 22,000, 19,000, and 16,500. Only the Mr = 33,500 and 22,000 polypeptides stain for heme. The Mr = 37,000 component in this preparation is absent from cytochrome b-f complex isolated by another procedure (Hurt, E., and Hauska, G. (1981) Eur. J. Biochem. 117, 591-599). The complex described here also differs in its spectrum at 77 K, its stability, and its buoyant density."
https://openalex.org/W1598293249,"Pokeweed antiviral proteins enzymatically inactivate the 60 S subunit of eucaryotic ribosomes in cell-free preparations. Three different species of the enzyme can be isolated from spring leaves, summer leaves, and seeds of pokeweed. Sequence analyses of the NH2-terminal residues show that pokeweed antiviral protein, isolated from spring leaves and seeds, are homologous and differ in 11 of the 28 residues compared. Ricin contains a polypeptide (ricin A chain) that has functional similarities to pokeweed antiviral protein, yet the sequences of the pokeweed proteins show little similarity with ricin A chain. Ricin B chain is responsible for helping ricin A chain across the plasma membrane; since pokeweed antiviral has no counterpart to ricin B chain, it is not nearly as cytotoxic as ricin. However, when pokeweed antiviral protein was covalently coupled to ricin B chain, a cytotoxic species was formed. Pokeweed antiviral protein fails to interact noncovalently with the ricin B chain to produce a cytotoxic species equivalent in function to ricin."
https://openalex.org/W1498196821,"A microsomal glycoprotein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pantetheine to pantothenate and cysteamine was solubilized and purified to homogeneity as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. The enzyme from pig kidney cortex was solubilized on exposure to butanol and purified by heat treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic chromatography, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. The purified enzyme (Mr = 57,000) has a specific activity of 14 mumol of pantothenate produced per min/mg of protein, a value 35 times that previously reported. A method for localizing enzymatic activity on polyacrylamide gels is presented, and enzyme activity, protein, and carbohydrate are shown to migrate identically by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Amino acid analysis indicated an absorbance index E1%1cm (280 nm) of 11.3, and carbohydrate analysis revealed the presence of galactose, mannose, fucose, glucose, galactosamine, and sialic acid for a total carbohydrate composition of 11.8%. The enzymatic hydrolysis of various pantetheine analogs indicated the enzyme had a high specificity for the pantothenate moiety but a low specificity for the cysteamine portion."
https://openalex.org/W1999065373,"Human fetal muscles at ages 110, 125, and 132 days contain a fetal-specific myosin light chain. This light chain is absent in adult human muscle, copurifies with myosin, and is identified as a slow light chain because it reacts with purified antibody to chicken slow muscle light chains and does not react strongly with antibody to fast myosin light chains. This light chain is synthesized in cultures of fetal muscle along with normal myosin light chains. The presence of a fetal light chain in culture provides a marker for studies of human muscle disease in which it is important to know when or if the muscle makes a transition from embryonic or fetal expression to true adult phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1981166736,"We have directly observed the redistribution of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the surface of cultured myotubes, induced by a soluble brain extract. The AChR were fluorescently labeled with rhodamine-conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin and viewed under low incident illumination with a video image intensification system. The results of our sequential observations indicate that AChR aggregates can be assembled rapidly (30-120 min) from mobile, diffuse AChR. This assembly was characterized by the initial formation of microaggregates (less than 1 micron diameter) that increased in number and coalesced or grew to form larger aggregates. The redistribution of fluorescently labeled AChR was completely inhibited by illumination of cells at levels used for conventional fluorescence micrography and could be observed only by using low light levels."
https://openalex.org/W1500716310,"Rabbit reticulocytes were pulsed for 10 s with diferric 59Fe, 125I-labeled transferrin followed without further manipulation by a chase with unlabeled diferric transferrin. The 125I-transferrin and 59Fe were measured in different cell compartments as a function of time thereafter. Immediately after binding, transferrin entered a phase that lasted 60 s, characterized by a slow dissociation of transferrin into the extracellular medium. During this period, most of the iron originally present in transferrin is donated to the cell. The half-time of 59Fe release from transferrin was 43 s. After the initial 60 s, transferrin, now devoid of iron, is released into the medium. The whole transferrin cycle lasted about 4 min. The iron released from transferrin could be transiently found in the cell plasma membrane, the cytosol, and the mitochondria. All these compartments behaved like intermediates in the iron uptake process as their 59Fe content rose, reached a plateau, and gradually fell. Finally, the iron was incorporated into heme with a half-time of incorporation of 173 s. We conclude that the release of iron from transferrin is one of the fastest events occurring after the initial binding of transferrin. The limiting step in the entire process of iron delivery is the dissociation of apotransferrin from its receptor, a step which will enable the latter to undergo another cycle of transferrin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1506640557,"We have studied the kinetics of interaction of N-7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3,diazole)-5-aminopentanoic acid beta-(N-trimethylammonium) ethyl ester with the purified acetylcholine receptor from Electrophorus electricus. By employing a laser stopped flow fluorimeter, the full course of the kinetics was observed. The initial analysis of data yielded the following results. 1) Both association and dissociation kinetics are composed of several overlapping reaction steps. 2) Dissociation of monoliganded receptor is biphasic. This indicates the existence of two forms in equilibrium of the monoliganded receptor. 3) Displacement of fluorescent ligand by competing ligand follows a more complicated pattern. In particular, the late stages of the dissociation kinetics are increasingly slowed down the higher the concentration of competing ligand. This indicates a strictly ordered mode of association and dissociation, i.e. first on-last off for cholinergic ligands and the receptor. These and the previous finding of two agonist binding sites at the receptor (Prinz, H., and Maelicke, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10263-10272) were employed to develop minimal reaction schemes that can account for the experimental data. They require two sites but four different ligand-receptor complexes and a strictly ordered mode of binding. The reaction schemes were used to simultaneously fit whole sets of association and dissociation kinetics. The fits reinforced the conclusions drawn by the initial analysis and also provided the rate constants for all reaction steps considered in the schemes. The following additional results were obtained. 4) One form of the monoliganded and diliganded receptor are formed with very large rate constants (greater than 2 X 10(8) M-1 s-1); the other complexes are formed more slowly. 5) The rapidly formed diliganded receptor (AR-A) has a rather short half-life while the other form of diliganded receptor (AR*A) develops more slowly and dominates at equilibrium. The obtained reaction schemes and rate constants invite comparison with physiological data. For example, the properties of the two forms of diliganded receptor correlate with those of the active and desensitized state of the endplate as defined by electrophysiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W20797539,"We have studied the binding equilibria of two fluorescent ligands and several nonfluorescent cholinergic ligands with the purified acetylcholine receptor from Electrophorus electricus. The assay was based on the specifically cholinergic and reversible quenching of fluorescence observed upon complex formation between the receptor protein and N-7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-5-aminopentanoic acid beta-(N-trimethylammonium) ethyl ester. This way, a large body of accurate, true equilibrium data was obtained. We find 1) all ligands studied compete for the same number of binding sites at the receptor; 2) agonists compete for half of these sites with high affinity and for the other half of these sites with significantly lower affinity; 3) antagonists compete for all of these sites with one affinity; and 4) in the presence of disulfide reducing agents, the binding patterns of some agonists and antagonists are changed in accordance with the electrophysiological changes observed under the same conditions with Rana pipiens Sartorius muscle fibers. Our studies indicate that the mechanism of ligand recognition is still functional at equilibrium and is not subject to the presence of an intact membrane environment. Furthermore, the existence of two types of agonist sites at every receptor molecule excludes most of the presently discussed two-state models as the basis for a mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction. To explain sigmoidal dose-response curves, a two-site model is already sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W1574766581,"Radioiodinated proteins were introduced into hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells by erythrocyte ghost-mediated microinjection, and their degradation was studied. 125I-bovine serum albumin and 125I-lysozyme were degraded with half-lives of about 7 and 11 h, respectively. The process was ATP-dependent. The breakdown of these proteins was not inhibited by the following inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis: NH4Cl, methylamine, chloroquine, leupeptin, or antipain. Methylation of 94% of the amino groups of bovine serum albumin or 99% of the amino groups of lysozyme had little effect on the rates of their degradation in HTC cells. In contrast, methylation almost completely inhibited the ATP-dependent proteolysis of both proteins in reticulocyte lysates. Methylated bovine serum albumin was not detectably demethylated in HTC cells. It is concluded that in HTC cells, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme are degraded by a nonlysosomal pathway which differs from the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system of reticulocytes in that it does not require free amino groups."

Physostigmine markedly reduced the responses to low spatial frequencies, but minimally affected the response to high frequencies. This effect is considered cholinergic since it could be reversed by atropine. These results support at least a two-channel model of spatial frequency responsivity."
https://openalex.org/W1596974079,"Cap 42 (a + b), a Ca2+-dependent, actin-binding and phosphorylatable protein consisting of two distinct subunits a and b of 42,000 Da in Physarum polycephalum, has been identified as a new F-actin-capping protein. It capped or bound to the fast growing ends of actin filaments and blocked actin polymerization at this end. The capping activity residing in subunit a and its Ca2+-dependency were regulated by phosphorylation of subunit b; subunit a required Ca2+ for its capping activity when subunit b was phosphorylated, whereas this activity became Ca2+ independent when subunit b was dephosphorylated. Subunit b contained at least two phosphorylatable threonine residues and probably three additional phosphorylation sites. Like cytochalasins and other F-actin-capping proteins, Cap 42 (a + b) was able to induce a rapid depolymerization of actin filaments at the slow growing end, and also to nucleate actin polymerization. However, unlike Physarum fragmin, Cap 42 (a + b) had no severing activity leading to the fragmentation of actin filaments. Our results indicate that Cap 42 (a + b) is the first Ca2+-dependent F-actin-capping phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation regulates its actin-binding and vice versa. A possible mechanism of the capping action of Cap 42 (a + b) in vitro and also its conceivable role in the regulation of the Ca2+/actin-dependent cytoplasmic streaming in plasmodia are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486808212,"The acid protease which is activated by ATP and which catalyzes production of fragments of parathyroid hormone similar to those produced in vivo was shown to be cathepsin D. Purified cathepsin D from bovine kidney and spleen is activated by ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates, and to a much lesser extent by nucleoside diphosphates and pyrophosphate. These findings suggest that cathepsin D may be involved in parathyroid hormone metabolism in vivo and that this lysosomal enzyme may be regulated by the energy status of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1499974220,"When crude extracts of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum were incubated with ATP and Mg2+ at 35 degrees C, a peptide of approximately 42,000 Da was predominantly phosphorylated. The kinase, separated from the phosphorylatable peptide, phosphorylated neither actin nor fragmin, both proteins of 42,000 Da, the latter known to cap and shorten actin filaments in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The phosphorylatable peptide was phosphorylated only at threonine residue(s), and its phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ in the extracts. The Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation was reversed by the subsequent addition of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid but not by trifluoperazine. The Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation required either actin or another, so far unidentified, protein(s) which is distinct from calmodulin. Fragmin reversed the Ca2+/actin-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation. The Ca2+-dependent actin-binding phosphorylatable protein named Cap 42 (a + b), consisting of two distinct 42,000-Da peptides a and b, was purified to near homogeneity. Peptide b was identified as the phosphorylatable subunit. Substoichiometric amounts of Cap 42 (a + b) reduced the low shear viscosity of F-actin solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1554193678,"The ability of cystamine, bis-N-aminoethyl disulfide, to inactivate cathepsin B by disulfide exchange is considerably enhanced by the addition of hydrophobic residues which apparently occupy secondary binding sites in the extended active center of the protease. For example, a peptidyl cystamine derivative such as symmetrical Gly-Phe-cystamine is substrate-like and promotes the disulfide exchange by affinity labeling. The effectiveness of this type of reagent is dependent on the peptidyl sequence. The inactivation is more rapid with increasing pH in the narrow range studied, pH 5-7, and is completely reversed by added thiols. Immobilization of the peptidyl cystamine derivatives provided an effective and rapid procedure for the covalent chromatography of cathepsin B following ammonium sulfate fractionation of beef spleen or pork liver homogenates, replacing the need for ion exchange chromatography. Pork liver cathepsin B thus obtained was a mixture of single chain and double chain forms as found by other methods."

https://openalex.org/W2086037797,"Isolation of epidermal lamellar bodies has presented a challenge because pressures required to homogenize keratinocytes can destroy these organelles and because the lamellar body readily releases its contents during prolonged isolation procedures. In an attempt to isolate lamellar bodies, sheets of intact stratum corneum and stratum granulosum were obtained from neonatal mice with highly purified staphylococcal epidermolytic toxin, disrupted, and passed through a series of filters. The final filtrate was rich in intact lamellar bodies and contained variable amounts of ribosomes and other vesicular structures. Availability of a highly purified lamellar body preparation from postnatal epidermis should help to clarify the role of this organelle in epidermal function. The technique of selective, sequential filtration represents a new approach to cell fractionation that may have wide applications in cell biology and biochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1040815466,"Abstract Two blood group A-active dodecaglycosylceramides were earlier reported in a mixed fraction isolated from rat small intestine (Breimer, M. E., Hansson, G. C., Karlsson, K.-A., and Leffler, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 906-912). Treatment of these with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase produced two blood group H-type decaglycosylceramides earlier identified in this tissue (Breimer, M. E., Falk, K.-E., Hansson, G.

Proton NMR spectroscopy of the intact dodeca- and decaglycosylceramides and degradation studies established the following two branched-chain species, one (60% of the mixture) with type 1 sequences (Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc) in all three places, and the second (40% of the mixture) identical with this except for a type 2 sequence (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc) in the 6-linked branch."
https://openalex.org/W1552833558,"Purified choline acetyltransferase had a specific activity of 142 mumol of acetylcholine produced min-1 mg-1 and consisted of two proteic forms with Mr = 72,000 and 76,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The separation of more than one peak of enzyme activity on CM-cellulose chromatography was shown to reflect the interaction of choline acetyltransferase with other proteins rather than the resolution of different isoenzymes. Purified choline acetyltransferase exhibited a high degree of stability. Enzyme stability was greatly dependent upon the procedures used to reach a given degree of purity, rather than the degree of purity per se, suggesting that specific proteins may be involved in the mechanism of enzyme inactivation. Use of affinity chromatography over Sepharose-blue dextran early in the preparation produced enzyme which was unstable both to storage and to concentration. Although the addition of other proteins such as bovine serum albumin had no significant stabilizing effect, the presence of acetyl coenzyme A during concentration prevented inhibition. Finally, it was shown that the purified enzyme is representative of the total enzyme present in brain in terms of both specific activity and immunochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1596968551,"Myoblasts and fibroblasts of embryonic skeletal muscle reproducibly form chondrocytes when cultured on demineralized bone in vitro. The transformation occurs in 3 morphologically defined phases, with disappearance of the myoblast phenotype preceding the appearance of fibroblast-like cells and finally chondrocytes. Proteoglycan synthesis in these cultures was investigated by labeling at prechondrogenic (5 days) and postchondrogenic (6-12 days) stages with (35S)sulfate and [6-3H]glucosamine. Labeled material elutes from associative Sepharose CL-2B columns as two major included peaks, which correspond to proteoglycan monomer and a material of lower molecular size. Control cultures, cultured upon gels of type I collagen, fail to synthesize monomer-like material and contain solely a material of lower molecular size. Demineralized bone-derived monomer was rechromatographed under dissociative conditions in an attempt to detect the presence of small aggregates. Again, only a single peak of sulfate and glucosamine-labeled material appears. The data further show that the monomer resembles that of embryonic cartilage in glycosaminoglycan chain size (Mr = 8.6-12.2 X 10(3] and composition (mainly chondroitin 4-sulfate). Aggregated monomer forms a shoulder of the monomeric peak and comprises only 5% of the sulfated material. Fifteen to thirty-four per cent of the monomer elutes as aggregate after addition of rooster comb hyaluronic acid (HA). Failure to aggregate appears to be related to endogenous synthesis of short chain HA. Synthesis of long chain HA may constitute a rate-limiting step in chondrogenesis. Material of lower molecular size, from cultures grown on demineralized bone, bind to exogenous HA, whereas the elution pattern of sulfated material from control cultures remains essentially unchanged. These latter data suggest that proteoglycans of low hydrodynamic size may participate in the early formation of proteoglycan aggregate."
https://openalex.org/W2163717659,"The effect of the structural heterogeneity of the gamma subunit of 7 S nerve growth factor (NGF) on its interaction with a variety of synthetic substrates and natural ligands was studied. The major gamma species, distinguished on the basis of charge under isoelectric focusing conditions, were examined for possible differences in affinity toward basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, beta NGF, and 7 S NGF and differences in activity toward three synthetic arginine substrates, N alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide, p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester. The most proteolytically modified form of the gamma subunit, gamma 3, was found to have an affinity for the natural ligands that was consistently an order of magnitude greater than gamma 1, the least modified form, while gamma 2 was intermediate, tending toward gamma 1. These differences were found to hold true for the activities toward the synthetic substrates as determined by the kcat/Km ratios. The nature of the affinity and activity differences among the major gamma species is discussed in light of a model where the presence or absence of certain basic residues, which along with the presence or absence of specific peptide chain cleavages forming the basis of the gamma subunit structural heterogeneity influence the access of ligand to the active site."

https://openalex.org/W1560652541,"Extensive methylation was found upon reaction of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea with dATP. The products of this reaction were purified by repeated anion exchange column chromatography and were found to consist of adenine deoxyribonucleotides methylated on the base moiety, terminal phosphate, or both. Products methylated on the adenine ring were identified by co-migration of acid-hydrolyzed samples with authentic standards on reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Products methylated on the sugar phosphate moiety were identified by digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphatase, or both followed by polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography. The results demonstrate production of gamma-phosphate-methyldATP, beta-phosphate-methyl-dADP, 1-methyldATP, and gamma-phosphate-methyl-1-methyldATP as well as the relatively unstable products 3-methyldATP and gamma-phosphate-methyl-3-methyl-dATP. The identities and amounts of products formed during this reaction in vitro are consistent with our finding that cellular deoxyribonucleotide pools are a significant target for N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (Topal, M.
