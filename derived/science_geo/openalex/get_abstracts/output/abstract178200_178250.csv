https://openalex.org/W2133051701,"The crystal structure of the kinase domain from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRK) including forty amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal tail has been determined to 2.6-Å resolution, both with and without an EGFRK-specific inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent, erlotinib (OSI-774, CP-358,774, TarcevaTM). The EGFR family members are distinguished from all other known receptor tyrosine kinases in possessing constitutive kinase activity without a phosphorylation event within their kinase domains. Despite its lack of phosphorylation, we find that the EGFRK activation loop adopts a conformation similar to that of the phosphorylated active form of the kinase domain from the insulin receptor. Surprisingly, key residues of a putative dimerization motif lying between the EGFRK domain and carboxyl-terminal substrate docking sites are found in close contact with the kinase domain. Significant intermolecular contacts involving the carboxyl-terminal tail are discussed with respect to receptor oligomerization.

Growth factor interactions with cell surface receptors influence proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The loss of control over these vital cellular processes is a hallmark of oncogenesis (2Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). For instance, aberrant signaling from overexpressed growth factor receptor ErbB2 is causal in approximately 30% of invasive breast cancers (3Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Growth factors bind to a cognate membrane-bound receptor system and mediate changes in the intracellular portion of the receptor, often through the formation of dimers or oligomers of receptors that initiate signal transduction cascades. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, 1The abbreviations used for: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; SH2, Src homology 2; p-Tyr, phosphotyrosine; A-loop, activation loop; DTT, dithiothreitol; P38, mitogen-activated protein kinase p38; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FGFRK, fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase; EGFRK, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase; N-lobe, NH2-terminal lobe; C-lobe, COOH-terminal lobe; r.m.s., root mean square; LCK, lymphocyte tyrosine kinase; p-IRK, insulin receptor kinase-phosphorylated form; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2. also ErbB1 or HER1) and its ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α, are among the earliest characterized members of the growth factor/receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. In contrast to the widely applicable ligand-induced receptor dimerization paradigm, there is evidence that EGFR family members exist as preformed dimers (4Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1011-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and form higher oligomer signaling complexes (5Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). Normal signaling in the EGFR system involves ligand-induced homo-oligomerization or hetero-oligomerization with the closely related RTKs ErbB2 (HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and/or ErbB4 (HER4) (6Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5633) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues within the carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor provides sites for direct interaction with SH2-containing proteins, leading to subsequent signal transduction events. The EGFR system, including receptor homologues and relevant ligands, is complex. There are at least 12 different ligands that bind to the EGF receptor family with partially redundant specificity for certain receptors. Several of the ligands including EGF, transforming growth factor-α, heparin-binding EGF, and betacellulin are reported to bind to EGFR with nanomolar dissociation constants (7Jones J.T. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Betacellulin also binds ErbB4 with high affinity. Similarly, heregulin binds to ErbB3 or ErbB4 with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. So far, a ligand that binds ErbB2 alone has not been identified, although the affinity of an ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer for heregulin is high, ∼1011m (8Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 9Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D.

In addition, the kinase domain of ErbB3 has non-canonical amino acids at some key positions, which render it catalytically inactive (10Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III., K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Taken together, these factors point to a complicated interplay between cross-reacting ligands, functional diversity among receptors, and differential expression in the EGFR signaling system. In the non-signaling state, most RTKs possess low basal kinase activity that increases substantially upon growth factor binding. This results from receptor oligomerization and subsequent transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues within a partner kinase domain. Specifically, initial phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) modification of the “activation loop” (A-loop) generates optimal catalytic activity and subsequent rapid phosphorylation at substrate docking sites elsewhere on the receptor intracellular domain. The EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4 receptors are the only known RTKs that do not require this initial phosphorylation of kinase domain residues for full catalytic competency. This unique feature may partially explain why EGFR family members are frequently involved in cellular transformation. In the RTKs for which crystal structures of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated versions of the kinase domain are available, phosphorylation in the A-loop causes it to undergo a large structural reorganization that relieves steric and/or chemical restraints on the catalytic active site (11Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Distinguishing the EGFR family further is an intracellular dimerization motif that has been roughly assigned to reside between the kinase domain and the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites. The greatest effects on receptor function seem to be concentrated in the Leu955-Val956-Ile957 segment of EGFR (“LVI”) and other ErbB receptors. This motif is necessary for ligand-independent dimerization of EGFR intracellular domains (12Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for transphosphorylation in ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers (13Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, alanine substitutions in this region override mutations in the transmembrane segment of ErbB2 that would otherwise lead to constitutive signaling via non-ligand induced dimerization (14Penuel E. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28468-28473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which these residues influence receptor activity is not well understood. Members of the EGFR family are frequently overactive in solid tumors (15Khazaie K. Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A number of therapeutic approaches that interfere with aberrant EGFR family signaling are being investigated (16Shawver L.K. Slamon D. Ullrich A. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 117-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A relatively new therapeutic approach to kinase inhibition is the use of ATP-competitive small molecules (17Druker B.J. Sawyers C.L. Kantarjian H. Resta D.J. Reese S.F. Ford J.M. Capdeville R.

Several groups have shown that certain 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives are both selective and effective inhibitors of the EGFR kinase (21Woodburn J.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Structural data exist for compounds of this general class bound to the distantly related intracellular kinases CDK2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (P38) (22Shewchuk L. Hassell A. Wisely B.

Many of these inhibitors are being tested for the treatment of cancer including erlotinib (OSI-774, CP-358,774, TarcevaTM), which is currently undergoing Phase III clinical study. Despite extensive study of the EGFR family, only very recently have molecular structures been determined for any fragment. Crystal structures of extracellular domains from EGFR (47Osigo H.

Science. 2002; 297: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) have been reported. X-ray crystal structures of kinase domains of several RTKs have been reported, although unlike EGFRK, all of these kinases require phosphorylation for full activity. Previous computational studies have suggested possible binding modes for the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of inhibitors to the EGFR kinase domain (25Palmer B.D. Trumppkallmeyer S. Fry D.W. Nelson J.M.

Here we present the crystallographic analysis of the EGFR kinase alone and in complex with the inhibitor erlotinib. DNA encoding residues 672–998 was amplified from full-length EGFR cDNA (27Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) by PCR, incorporating an NH2-terminal NheI restriction site and a COOH-terminal stop codon and XhoI site. The product was digested with NheI and XhoI and ligated into the appropriately digested pET-28b (Novagen, Madison, WI). Further PCR was performed on the EGFRK-pET-28b plasmid to acquire the histidine tag and thrombin site using an NH2-terminal primer with a NotI site and a COOH-terminal primer with anXbaI site. The product was digested with NotI andXbaI and ligated into similarly digested pVL1392 (BD Biosciences). Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells, SF9, were transfected with the EGFRK-pVL1392 plasmid using the Baculogold transfection system (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One liter of High FiveTM cells (Invitrogen and Expression Systems, Woodland, CA) in suspension at 5 × 105 cells/ml was inoculated with 8 ml of amplified EGFRK virus and incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 15 min. Cells were frozen on dry ice and then thawed twice. 150 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm benzamidine) was added to the cells. The cells were then mechanically homogenized. The lysate was centrifuged at 25000 ×g for 45 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was passed over a 0.45-μm vacuum filter with pre-filter. Filtrate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was then washed with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) for 10-column volumes. EGFRK protein was eluted from the column with 4 × 1-column volume aliquots of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Fractions containing EGFRK as assayed by SDS-PAGE were pooled, combined with thrombin to remove the histidine tag, and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT. EGFRK was then concentrated to a volume of 500 μl and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing EGFRK as assayed by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmsodium azide, 0.1 mm benzamidine. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the protein lacked any phosphorylation. The EGFRK was then concentrated to ∼8 mg/ml. Typical final yield for each liter of High Five culture was 1–2 mg. Small crystals of EGFRK formed over 1 day in hanging drops when protein was mixed with the reservoir buffer (1.0 m Na/K tartrate, 0.1 m MES, pH 7.0) in a 1:1 ratio. These crystals were used as macro seeds in a 10 μl of sitting drop containing a 1:1 protein:reservoir ratio described as above. Crystals grew to ∼250 μm3 in 1 week. Crystals of EGFRK complexed with erlotinib were obtained by soaking crystals of apo-EGFRK in a solution containing 1.1 m Na/K tartrate, 0.1m MES, pH 7.0, 3 μm erlotinib, for 3 weeks. Crystals with and without the erlotinib treatment were immersed in a reservoir solution with added glycerol (20%) before preservation with liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline 19-ID of the Structural Biology Center (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory) and at beamline 5.0.1 of the Berkeley Center for Structural Biology (Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), extending to 2.6 Å for both apo-EGFRK and EGFRK/erlotinib crystals, respectively (TableI). Data were reduced with HKL2000 and Denzo/Scalepack (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The high symmetry of the crystals affords very high redundancy in a 90°-sweep. We chose the high resolution limit of data used in refinement based on a signal-to-noise criterion (I/ς(I) ≥ 2) rather than on agreement factors.Table IStructure statistics for EGFRK/erlotinib and apo-EGFRKData collection and reductionResolution (Å)N measaNmeas is the total number of observations measured.N refbNref is the number of unique reflections measured at least once.CompletecComplete is the percentage of possible reflections actually measured at least once.I/ςRmergedRmerge = Σ‖ ‖I‖ − ‖〈I〉‖ ‖/Σ‖〈I〉‖ where I is the intensity of a single observation and 〈I〉 the average intensity for symmetry equivalent observations.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) using a polyalanine version of FGFRK (Protein Data Bank code 1fgk) in space group I23 using data to 4.0 Å from an in-house data set (rotating anode (RU-200)/Mar345 scanner) reduced with Denzo/Scalepack. Before refinement, 4% of the data were sequestered for the calculation of Rfree, and the same set was used (and extended to higher resolution) for the synchrotron data sets. Initial phases treated with SIGMAA (30Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) and solvent flattened (DM) produced a map with indications of many buried side chains, especially leucines and tryptophans. Model inspection and adjustment were performed with XtalView (31McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1999Google Scholar), and refinement employed XPLOR98 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The apo-EGFRK structure was used as a starting point for the EGFRK/erlotinib work, and the final stages of refinement were performed similarly. The COOH terminus of our construct lacks structural similarity to any part of the template FGFRK-starting structure. The 13-residue section immediately following His964 is too poorly ordered to be fit. Weak electron density was assigned starting with residue Leu977, which leaves a 7-Å gap for the unassigned amino acids. Alternate connectivities would bridge gaps of 22 or 29-Å. The final section of the COOH terminus is well ordered where it forms intermolecular contacts with two neighboring molecules within the crystal. The activation loop is traced for its entire length. Individual isotropic temperature factors were refined, and a bulk solvent term was included. The average temperature factors are high (∼70 Å2), and the maximum permitted B was 120 Å2 attained by 1–2% of the atoms. Final (F o − F c) electron density maps lack interpretable features. Coordinates of apo-EGFRK and EGFRK/erlotinib are available from the Protein Data Bank (50Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27555) Google Scholar) (PDB accession codes 1M14 and 1M17, respectively). The EGFR kinase domain (EGFRK) adopts the bilobate-fold characteristic of all previously reported protein kinase domains (Fig.1). The NH2-terminal lobe (N-lobe) is formed from mostly β-strands and one α-helix (αC), whereas the larger COOH-terminal lobe (C-lobe) is mostly α-helical. The two lobes are separated by a cleft similar to those in which ATP, ATP analogues, and ATP-competitive inhibitors have been found to bind. Important elements of the catalytic machinery bordering the cleft on the N-lobe include the glycine-rich nucleotide phosphate-binding loop (Gly695-Gly700), whereas the C-lobe contributes the DFG motif (Asp831-Gly833), the presumptive catalytic (general base) Asp813, the catalytic loop (Arg812-Asn818), and the A-loop (Asp831-Val852). The NH2-terminal lobe of EGFRK adopts a tertiary structure similar to previously observed structures of RTKs (r.m.s. deviations for superpositioning C-α atoms with the kinase domain from the fibroblast growth factor receptor is ∼1.2 Å), although a few features distinguish the N-lobe of EGFRK from other kinase domains. The NH2 terminus of our construct begins 25 amino acids before the first glycine of the nucleotide phosphate-binding loop and includes five additional amino acids prior to Ser671 that derive from the expression construct. The first residue we identify in the electron density maps is Gly672 with the succeeding 13 residues adopting an extended conformation. The NH2-terminal nine amino acids are influenced by several intermolecular contacts including H-bonds involving main chain atoms of residues Asn676 and Leu680, although intramolecular H-bonds between Asn676 and both Tyr740 and Ser744also contribute. At Glu685, the polypeptide chain assumes a trace more similar to those of the lymphocyte tyrosine kinase (LCK, PDB code 3lck) (32Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the insulin receptor kinase-phosphorylated form (33Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) (p-IRK, PDB code 1ir3), and the unphosphorylated form of the FGF receptor kinase (34Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (FGFRK, PDB code 1fgk). However, EGFRK lacks the tryptophan-glutamate (“WE”) motif found in these related kinases, and has Arg681-Ile682 instead. In the WE-containing kinases, hydrophobic interactions of the tryptophan and an H-bond between the glutamate and a threonine or serine and the neighboring β-strand tie the NH2-terminal region to the N-lobe. In EGFRK, Arg681 projects into solvent, but Ile682 contacts Leu782 and Ile756 on the neighboring β-strand and thereby affords a similar effect. Among the canonical features characterizing the N-lobes of active forms of kinases is a salt bridge between two highly conserved side chains that interact with the α- and β-phosphates when ATP or a close homologue is present. In both the apo-EGFRK and inhibitor-bound forms of EGFRK, we find such a salt bridge between Lys721and Glu738. Our observation of this salt bridge in apo-EGFRK indicates that EGFR does not require large rearrangements within the N-lobe for catalytic competence. The COOH-terminal domain of EGFRK contains the usual organization of α-helices present in other kinase domain structures. Superpositioning of the C-lobes of kinase domains from both LCK and p-IRK yield a r.m.s. deviation of 1.1 Å. However, as with the N-lobe, a few key features differ from previously elucidated RTK structures. In most protein kinases, the activation loop assumes its catalytically competent conformation only if it first becomes phosphorylated on a Tyr or Thr. For these kinases, the unphosphorylated activation loop is positioned many Angstroms from the active conformation and may include a direct inhibitory element. For instance, the unphosphorylated A-loop in FGFRK is incompatible with substrate binding, and the unphosphorylated insulin receptor kinase A-loop blocks ATP binding as well as the substrate tyrosine site. The A-loop in apo-EGFRK (and EGFRK/erlotinib) differs significantly from other apo-, unphosphorylated A-loop structures. Earlier work has shown that Tyr845 of the EGFRK A-loop, at a position that is phosphorylated in other RTKs, can be replaced by Phe without loss of function (35Gotoh N. Tojo A. Hino M. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we see that the A-loop of EGFRK adopts an “active” conformation similar to the phosphorylated A-loop of p-IRK (Fig.2). Many energetically beneficial interactions stabilize this conformation, most of which are also found in other active kinase A-loops. Tyr845 aligns well structurally with p-Tyr1163 of p-IRK and makes van der Waals contact with the aliphatic part of neighboring Lys836, a residue that occupies the space of Arg1155 in the p-IRK structure. An H-bond between side chains of Tyr845 and Glu848 mimics that between p-Tyr1163 and the main chain nitrogen of Gly1166 in p-IRK, but the electron density supporting this Glu848 side chain conformation is weak (Fig.3). This interaction may be important for the loop conformation, but there is another more significant aspect of Glu848. The relationship between Tyr845 and Arg812 (preceding the catalytic Asp813) is the same as between the analogous residues in p-IRK and other tyrosine kinases. This relationship is central to arranging the catalytic machinery and substrate for phospho-transfer. In p-IRK, Tyr1163 is phosphorylated, and in EGFRK, the Glu848 carboxylate can assume a position closely analogous to that of the phosphate of p-Tyr1163 in p-IRK.Figure 3Representative electron density from the EGFRK/erlotinib structure. Map (2F o −F c contoured at 1.0 r.m.s. deviation) in part of the A-loop with additional residues Arg812 (immediately precedes the catalytic Asp813) and Arg808(H-bonds to main chain of Gly839) is shown. The placement of the Glu848 side chain is not supported by electron density but is among possible low energy conformers. Extra electron density at the Tyr845 hydroxyl suggests that it interacts with a solvent molecule, Glu848, or both. Consistent with expectations from prior studies, mass spectrometry indicates no phosphorylation on the protein. Glu848 in the conformer shown mimics the phosphate of p-Tyr1163 of the activated insulin receptor kinase (Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Anti-parallel β-strand main chain to main chain H-bonds between Lys836-Leu838 and Val810-Arg808 are key anchors for the conformation adopted by the early part of the EGFRK A-loop, and analogous interactions appear in p-IRK. However, in an additional interaction not seen in the p-IRK structure, the side chain of Arg808 H-bonds to the main chain oxygen of Gly839. This interaction lends further stability to the unphosphorylated EGFRK A-loop active conformation, and it is noteworthy that the incidence of arginine at position 808 among kinases is low. Underlying the central part of the A-loop, Tyr867 accepts an H-bond from Arg812. Whereas many kinases have a homologous Arg preceding the catalytic Asp813, its interactions with a homologous Tyr (or sometimes Phe) vary in type. Some are purely hydrophobic, whereas others involve Arg hydrogen atoms and either the hydroxyl oxygen or π-electrons of the tyrosine. Tyr867 π-electrons interact with Arg813 in EGFRK with the details very similar to those found in p-IRK. There are other protein kinases with known molecular structures that do not require phosphorylation in their A-loop for optimal catalytic competence, among them, glycogen phosphorylase kinase (36Owen D.J.

PSs principally occur as high molecular weight protein complexes that contain nicastrin (Nct) and additional so far unidentified components. Recently, PEN-2 has been implicated in γ-secretase function. Here we identify PEN-2 as a critical component of PS1/γ-secretase and PS2/γ-secretase complexes. Strikingly, in the absence of PS1 and PS1/PS2, PEN-2 levels are strongly reduced. Similarly, PEN-2 levels are reduced upon RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of Nct. On the other side, down-regulation of PEN-2 by RNA interference is associated with reduced PS levels, impaired Nct maturation, and deficient γ-secretase complex formation. We conclude that PEN-2 is an integral γ-secretase complex component and that γ-secretase complex components are expressed in a coordinated manner.

Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Following an initial cleavage by β-secretase within the APP ectodomain, γ-secretase cleavage releases the 40–42-amino acid amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) from the membrane (1Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The majority of familial Alzheimer disease cases are associated with mutations in the PS1 gene (1Steiner H. Haass C.

Immunoprecipitations of PEN-2 were carried out in the presence of 0.1% SDS. To analyze PEN-2, PS, and Nct expression levels in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, cell homogenates were subjected to ultracentrifugation, and the pellet fraction was solubilized in the presence of 1% SDS as described (31Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.M. Selkoe D.J. Romig H. Mendla K. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32322-32331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The SDS extracts were diluted 10-fold and analyzed for PEN-2, PSs, and Nct by combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting or immunoblotting as described above.

Homogenates of HEK 293 cells were extracted with 1% Brij-35,1% Lubrol WX, and membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from the postnuclear supernatant fraction and solubilized in DDM-lysis buffer (0.7% DDM, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Following a clarifying spin by ultracentrifugation, DDM-solubilized membrane fractions were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analysis or analyzed for the PS1 complex by blue native PAGE as described (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 32Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies for 1–4 h at 4 °C followed by two washes in DDM-wash buffer (0.5% DDM, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen). To identify endogenous PEN-2, we raised antibody 1638 to the N terminus of human PEN-2. To prove the specificity of this antibody, cell lysates of HEK 293 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody 1638 or the corresponding preimmune serum. HEK 293 cells are known from numerous previous studies to express a γ-secretase activity, which has identical functional and biochemical properties as the γ-secretase activity in neuronal cells or brain tissue (see Ref.33Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and citations therein). As shown in Fig.1 A, robust amounts of the ∼10-kDa PEN-2 were immunoprecipitated with antibody 1638 but not with preimmune serum. To address the question whether PEN-2 is a bona fidecomponent of PS1- and PS2/γ-secretase complexes we first performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses using HEK 293 cells stably transfected with N-terminal hexahistidine-Xpress (H6X)-epitope-tagged PS1 or PS2. γ-Secretase complexes were isolated from DDM-solubilized membrane fractions by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Xpress antibody. As expected, PS1 and PS2 holoproteins and N-terminal fragments were immunoprecipitated, and the corresponding C-terminal fragments were co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 B). Under these conditions endogenous PEN-2 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with PS1 and PS2. In addition, Nct also co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 C, association of PEN-2 with the γ-secretase complex is independent of endoproteolysis of PS1. Upon stable expression of H6X-PS1 Δexon9, which does not undergo endoproteolysis due to the lack of the cleavage site for PS endoproteolysis (34Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), PEN-2 was still co-isolated with the PS1 Δexon9 holoprotein and with Nct (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that PEN-2 is a component of individual PS1/γ-secretase and PS2/γ-secretase complexes. Under these conditions we could only immunoprecipitate very minor amounts of PEN-2 with antibody 1638 (data not shown), whereas mild denaturation with 0.1% SDS was sufficient to robustly immuoprecipitate PEN-2 (see Fig. 1 A). This suggests that PEN-2 is tightly packed within the γ-secretase complex. To confirm that PEN-2 is an integral component of the endogenous γ-secretase complex co-immunoprecipitations were carried out with untransfected HEK 293 cells. DDM-solubilized membrane fractions were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the C terminus of Nct and the N terminus of PS1 or PS2. Immunoblotting with anti-PEN-2 antibody 1638 revealed robust amounts of co-immunoprecipitated PEN-2 demonstrating that PEN-2 is a component of endogenous PS/γ-secretase complexes (Fig. 1 D). As expected, antibodies to the N termini of PS1 or PS2 co-immunoprecipitated the corresponding PS1 and PS2 C-terminal fragments and mature Nct (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that PEN-2 is an integral bona fideγ-secretase complex component. Eliminating PS1 or PS1/PS2 causes reduced levels of the γ-secretase complex and inhibits Nct maturation (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L., Xu, H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover inhibition of Nct expression also strongly reduced PS expression and inhibited γ-secretase complex formation (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This suggested that expression of γ-secretase complex components might be coordinately regulated. We therefore analyzed PEN-2 expression in PS knock-out mice (2De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar, 4Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat.

As expected, robust levels of PEN-2 were observed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from littermate control mice (Fig.2 A). Ablation of PS1 caused a strong reduction of PEN-2 levels, and the absence of PS1/PS2 eliminated PEN-2 expression nearly completely. Compared with the PS1 ablation, ablation of PS2 still allowed significant PEN-2 expression (Fig.2 A). Similar effects of the PS ablations were found on Nct expression. Ablation of PS1 or PS1/PS2 dramatically reduced Nct maturation, whereas ablation of PS2 allowed Nct maturation (Fig.2 A). We next investigated whether PEN-2 expression is also dependent on the presence of Nct. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the siRNA duplex Nct-1045 to down-regulate Nct expression by RNAi (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Nct caused a reduction of PEN-2 levels. Thus, expression of PEN-2 not only requires the presence of PSs (predominantly PS1) but that of Nct as well. To investigate whether lowering PEN-2 levels affects PS and Nct levels, we next transfected HEK 293 cells with the siRNA duplex PEN-2–160. PEN-2-RNAi reduced PEN-2 expression, which was accompanied by reduced levels of PS1 and PS2 (Fig.3 A). RNAi-mediated down-regulation of PEN-2 levels also impaired the maturation of Nct (Fig. 3 A) as had been observed upon inhibition of PS1 or PS1/PS2 (Fig. 2 A). As a consequence of reduced PS expression and impaired Nct maturation, inhibition of PEN-2 expression caused a deficiency in the PS1/γ-secretase complex (Fig. 3 B) as revealed by blue native PAGE analysis (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).Figure 3Down-regulation of PEN-2 by RNAi is associated with reduced PS levels, impaired Nct maturation, and PS1 complex deficiency. A, HEK 293 cells were subjected to two consecutive transfections with siRNA duplex PEN-2–160 as described (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). PEN-2 and Nct were analyzed as in Fig. 2 B, and PSs were analyzed by combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting with antibodies 3027/BI.3D7 (to PS1) and 3711/BI.HF5c (to PS2). Note the altered ratio of mature/immature Nct in cells subjected to PEN-2-RNAi compared with untreated control cells. B, HEK 293 cells were subjected to PEN-2-RNAi as in A. Membrane fractions were solubilized with DDM, subjected to blue native PAGE, and analyzed for the PS1 complex by immunoblotting with antibody 2953. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE to confirm down-regulation of PEN-2 by immunoblotting with antibody 1638.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Taken together our findings demonstrate that at least PS, Nct, and PEN-2 are integral components of the γ-secretase complex. Expression of these γ-secretase complex components is coordinately regulated. Removing any of these three components results in reduced amounts of the γ-secretase complex and consequently in a loss of γ-secretase activity (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc.

We propose that any additional so far unknown γ-secretase complex component may affect PS, Nct, and PEN-2 expression. Obvious candidates for additional γ-secretase complex components are APH-1a and APH-1b, the two human homologues of C. elegans APH-1 (21Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J.

Both act directly at or upstream of γ-secretase activity and apparently affect APH-2 (the C. elegans homologue of Nct) transport to the cell surface (25Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R.

Leptin mediates these effects by binding and activating a cell surface leptin receptor (LR)1; the structure of leptin is homologous to that of the IL-6 family of cytokines, and the LR is a member of the IL-6 receptor family of class I cytokine receptors (3Tartaglia L.A.

Alternative splicing of RNA from a single LR gene produces multiple LR isoforms that share a common ligand-binding extracellular domain (4Chua Jr., S.C. Koutras I.K. Han L. Liu S.M. Kay J. Young S.J.

LRa–d each contain the same transmembrane domain and 29 membrane-proximal amino acids including the highly conserved, proline-rich Box 1 sequence that is required for Jak kinase activation by cytokine receptors. The number and identity of the subsequent amino acids varies among murine LRa–d, as well as the three human LR isoforms. LRb, which is highly conserved across species, contains a 282-amino acid extension (total 301-amino acid intracellular tail), robustly activates intracellular signaling, and is required to mediate the physiologic actions of leptin. Murine LRa, LRc, and LRd are the “short forms” of the leptin receptor with unclear physiological roles; these receptors contain 5, 3, and 11 amino acid extensions for 34-, 32-, and 40-amino acid intracellular tails, respectively. LRb, like other cytokine receptors, signals via associated Jak family tyrosine kinases, which autophosphorylate and become activated upon ligand binding and subsequently mediate phosphorylation of Tyr985 and Tyr1138 on LRb (6Gadina M.

LRb-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 mediates additional phosphotyrosine-dependent signals (11Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). A number of questions surround the issue of LR-Jak kinase interaction, including the specificity of Jak kinase utilization by the LR, the role of other cytokine receptor homology motifs in Jak activation, and the ability of short forms to mediate signaling. Of the three ubiquitously expressed Jak kinases (Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2) (13Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), Tyk2 has not been examined, and overexpression studies have suggested that LRb may signal via both Jak1 and Jak2 (14Bjorbaek C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Furthermore, under similar conditions, LRa may mediate some Jak2 activation and signaling (14Bjorbaek C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), whereas LRc and LRd have not been studied. Indeed, Box 1 (the proline-rich membrane-proximal motif that is conserved among cytokine receptors) is required for the recruitment of all Jak kinase isoforms and is present at intracellular amino acids 6–17 in all transmembrane forms of the LR (4Chua Jr., S.C.

The striking phenotype of db/dbmice, in which LRa replaces LRb, is indistinguishable from that of entirely leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, however (16Chua Jr., S.C. Chung W.K., Wu- Peng X.S. Zhang Y. Liu S.M. Tartaglia L.A. Leibel R.L. Science. 1996; 271: 994-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), suggesting that the short LR forms fail to mediate Jak activation and signaling. Indeed, the Box 2 motif, COOH-terminal to Box 1, may be important for the recruitment of Jak kinases by cytokine receptors (13Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Two Box 2 homologous regions of LRb (both absent in other LR forms) have been proposed (7White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Here we show that Jak2 is the only Jak kinase activated during and required for LRb signaling and that LRb sequences within and immediately surrounding Box 1 are required for the activation of Jak2. Although neither potential Box 2 motif is required, amino acids 31–36 of LRb are essential for Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation. The sequences of the LR isoforms diverge in this region, and none of the short forms mediate activation of Jak2 at physiologic levels of Jak2. Rabbit αLRb has been described previously (11Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar); rabbit αJak2 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 758–770 of murine Jak2. Polyclonal αSTAT3 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant murine IL-3, αTyk2, αJak1, and monoclonal α phosphotyrosine (αPY) (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies directed against the phosphorylated (activated) form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and STAT3 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and BD Biosciences, respectively. Recombinant mouse erythropoeitin (Epo) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Bovine serum albumin fraction V was purchased fromCalbiochem. Protein A-Sepharose 6MB, 125I-Epo, and125I-protein A were from Amersham Biosciences. The ELR chimera in pcDNA3 has been described previously (11Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The ELR chimera consists of the extracellular domain of the Epo receptor joined to the intracellular domain of the long form of the leptin receptor, LRb; the junction occurs at a silent AflII site at the 3′-end of the transmembrane domain-encoding sequence. We generated four sets of ELR deletion mutants. The first set of ELR deletion mutants contained large COOH-terminal deletions: Δ219c, Δ65c, Δ1c (deletions beginning at the indicated intracellular amino acid), and VNV (in which the conserved PNP motif in Box 1 was mutated to VNV). These mutations were made by PCR mutagenesis of the intracellular domain and subcloning into pCDNA3ELR using AflII andNotI as described previously (11Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The second series of ELR constructs also contained large COOH-terminal deletions and included the following mutants: Δ29c, Δ31c, Δ37c, Δ43c, Δ49c, Δ61c, and Δ65c (deletions beginning at the indicated intracellular amino acid). The mutations were generated by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing an AflII site at the 5′-end and the sequence for the intracellular 28 amino acids of LRb. The 3′-oligonucleotide used in this reaction overlapped with the 5′-oligonucleotide by 21 base pairs and contained a sequence complementary to the desired 3′-terminus of that mutation including a stop codon and a NotI site. The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3ELR using AflII andNotI. The third panel of ELR constructs contained six amino acid internal deletions within the mutant Δ65c described previously and included the following mutants: Δ1–6, Δ7–12, Δ13–18, Δ19–24, Δ25–30, Δ31–36, Δ37–42, Δ43–48, Δ49–54, Δ55–60, and Δ61–64. These mutants were generated by PCR using pcDNA3Δ65c as a template and 5′-oligonucleotides containing anAflII site and sequences encoding the first 24 intracellular amino acids of LRb (containing the appropriate deletions). The 3′-oligonucleotides for these reactions contained sequences encoding the next 40 amino acids of LRb (including the appropriate deletions) followed by a NotI site. For each mutant either the 5′- or 3′-oligonucleotide contained an internal deletion of six amino acids. The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3ELR using AflII and NotI. ELR mutants corresponding to the additional isoforms of the murine LR (LRa, LRc, and LRd) were generated by PCR using the same 5′-oligo as for the COOH-terminal deletions and specific 3′-oligos containing a NotI site and sequences specific for each particular isoform. Subcloning was again by AflII andNotI. The identity of each ELR variant was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy system (17He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The ELR cDNA was excised from pcDNA3 and subcloned into pAdTrack-CMV using HindIII andXbaI. The resulting pAdTrack-CMV ELR was linearized and cotransformed with pAdEasy into BJ5183 bacteria by electroporation, and kanamycin-resistant colonies were analyzed for correct recombination. Correctly recombined pAdEasy/Track-CMV ELR was linearized and transfected into 293 cells (as below) for the generation of virus. The resulting adenovirus (AdELR) was propagated in 293 cells, which were harvested 5 days post-infection by scraping and two cycles of freeze/thaw. Clarified supernatants were used to infect cells. All cells were transfected and maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. 32D cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% WEHI-3 conditioned medium (a source of IL-3). 32D cells stably expressing ELR have been described (11Banks A.S.

Jak kinase-deficient fibrosarcoma cell lines (kindly provided by Dr. George Stark, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (18Kohlhuber F.

ELR constructs in pcDNA3 were transiently cotransfected with pcDNA3Jak2 into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen); for the generation of stably expressing clones ELR constructs were transfected alone and split the following day for selection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 750 μg/ml G418. 293 clones expressing ELR on the cell surface were identified for further experiments by125I-Epo binding (11Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Cell surface 125I-Epo binding was also determined in conjunction with each experiment performed to ensure the similar expression cell surface expression of each receptor isoform studied. Briefly, cells were plated to 10-cm dishes in parallel with experimental plates and were treated identically to experimental plates until the time of stimulation, at which time they were instead incubated for 30 min with ∼25,000 counts per minute/dish of125I-Epo for 30 min at room temperature before washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Washed cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a γ-counter. In each experiment, between 10 and 30% of total counts were bound by experimental lines, with the exception of untransfected control cells, which bound less than 1% of total counts. Prior to each experiment, subconfluent cells were made quiescent by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (32D cells, 4 h; 293 and fibrosarcoma cells, overnight) before stimulation with 50 ng/ml Epo at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (lysis buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations of the resulting lysates were determined, and equivalent amounts of protein were added to the appropriate antibodies for immunoprecipitation or denatured in 2× Laemmli buffer for direct resolution by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitates, lysates were incubated with antisera at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer before denaturation in Laemmli buffer and separation by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) in Towbin buffer containing 0.02% SDS and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 (wash buffer) supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin (block buffer). Membranes were incubated in primary antibody in block buffer for 1 h, rinsed three times with wash buffer, and incubated for 30 min in block buffer. Detection was by incubation for 1 h with 125I-protein A in block buffer (preceded by a 1-h incubation with rabbit anti-mouse antisera followed by washing in the case of 4G10 immunoblotting). Blots were rinsed four times in wash buffer before overnight exposure on Kodak X-Omat AR film or a PhosphorImager. To assess the Jak kinase selectivity of the intracellular domain of LRb, we examined the ability of a chimeric protein described previously consisting of the extracellular domain of the Epo receptor and the intracellular domain of LRb (ELR) (11Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the common Jak kinases (Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2). We performed these assays in 32D myeloid progenitor cells stably expressing ELR (32D/ELR cells), because 32D cells abundantly express Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 in addition to functional IL-3 receptors (Fig.1). The IL-3 receptor mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak2, and (weakly) Tyk2 and thus serves as a positive control. Because activation of Jak kinases results in their tyrosyl autophosphorylation, we assayed their stimulation by αPY immunoblotting of αJak1, αJak2, or αTyk2 immunoprecipitates prepared from 32D/ELR cells that had been incubated in the absence or presence of erythropoeitin or IL-3 (Fig. 1,A–C). The activation of STAT3 was also determined by immunoblotting lysates with antisera specific for the tyrosyl-phosphorylated (-activated) form of STAT3 (Fig. 1 D). Although Epo and IL-3 both stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and Jak2, only IL-3 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and (weakly) Tyk2. Thus, of the three common Jak kinases, ELR mediates activation of Jak2 but not Jak1 or Tyk2. To confirm the specificity of and requirement for Jak2 in ELR signaling, we employed mutant human fibrosarcoma cell lines lacking various Jak kinase isoforms (18Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). U1A (lacking Jak1), U4A (lacking Tyk2), and γ2A (lacking Jak2) cells were infected with an adenovirus that co-expresses ELR and green fluorescent protein. Green fluorescent protein fluorescence and 125I-Epo binding confirmed similar infection and cell surface expression in each cell line (data not shown). The various ELR-expressing cells were incubated in the absence or presence of Epo for 5 min, and ELR signaling was assessed by αPY immunoblotting of αELR immunoprecipitates and αSTAT3(PY) immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig.2, A and B). This analysis demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and ELR in Jak1-deficient U1A and Tyk2-deficient U4A cells but not in Jak2-deficient γ2A cells. No signal was detected in uninfected cells (data not shown). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein species that migrated at the approximate molecular weight of Jak proteins was also detected during Epo stimulation in αELR immunoprecipitates from all but γ2A cells (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ELR and STAT3 correlates with the ability to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of associated Jak proteins, presumably Jak2. These data suggest that Jak2 is the unique Jak kinase activated by and required for signaling by the intracellular tail of LRb, and the remainder of our analysis thus focuses on Jak2. To define the approximate region of the intracellular LRb required for Jak2 interaction, we generated a set of mutant ELR constructs containing large COOH-terminal deletions (Fig.3). Mutants include Δ219c, Δ65c, and Δ1c, which contain 218, 64, and 0 amino acids from the 301-amino acid LRb intracellular domain, respectively. Also included is VNV (which substitutes the conserved proline residues in Box 1 with valine residues). 293 cells were co-transfected with Jak2 and these ELR mutants. Cell surface 125I-Epo binding assay demonstrated similar cell surface expression of the ELR isoforms (data not shown). We assessed the ability of each of these receptor forms to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 during ligand stimulation by immunoprecipitating Jak2 from cells incubated in the presence or absence of Epo and analyzing the precipitated protein by αPY immunoblotting (Fig. 3). As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and the associated ELR were detectable during stimulation of ELR-expressing cells. Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and a truncated ELR (retaining Tyr985) were detected during stimulation of Δ219c. Deletion of the entire LRb intracellular domain (Δ1c) or mutation of the conserved proline residues in Box 1 (VNV) abrogated Epo-stimulated Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, whereas Δ65c mediated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. This analysis demonstrated that although intracellular sequences of LRb (and specifically the conserved PNP motif within Box 1) were required for Jak2 activation, the majority of the COOH terminus of LRb, including the potential distal Box 2 motif (intracellular amino acids 202–213 (7White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar)), was not required for activation of Jak2, because Δ219c and Δ65c mediated Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation normally. To assess the requirement for the membrane-proximal potential Box 2 motif (intracellular amino acids 49–60) in the phosphorylation of Jak2 and to more specifically define the sequences of LRb that are required for Jak2 activation, we generated a second panel of ELR mutants containing COOH-terminal deletion mutations (Fig. 4,top panel). In this series of mutants, we serially truncated a small number of amino acids at a time from the COOH terminus beginning with intracellular amino acid 65 (Δ65c, above) (e.g. Δ61c, Δ49c, Δ43c, Δ37c, etc.). To assess the ability of these mutants to activate Jak2, we transiently co-transfected 293 cells with Jak2 and the various ELR mutants and assessed the ability of the various mutants to mediate ligand-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak2 (Fig. 4 A).125I-Epo binding demonstrated similar cell surface expression of the ELR isoforms (Fig. 4 C). We assessed the ability of each of these receptor forms to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 during ligand stimulation by immunoprecipitating Jak2 from cells incubated in the presence or absence of Epo and analyzing the precipitated protein by αPY immunoblotting (Fig. 4 A). Truncation of LRb sequences COOH-terminal to intracellular amino acid 36 in ELR, Δ37c, Δ43c, Δ49c, Δ61c, and Δ65c, did not prevent ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. In contrast, deletion of sequences NH2-terminal to amino acid 37 in Δ29c and Δ31c abrogated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, suggesting an important role for LRb sequences between intracellular amino acids 31–36 in Jak2 activation. Moreover, these data suggest that the LRb sequences COOH-terminal to intracellular amino acid 37, including the membrane-proximal potential Box 2 motif, are not essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. It is possible that in the preceding assay the artificially high intracellular Jak2 levels achieved by transient co-transfection of Jak2 and the various ELR mutants masked a requirement for Box 2 or other sequences COOH-terminal to intracellular amino acid 36. Because transient transfection of ELR alone does not result in ELR expression in a high enough fraction of cells to analyze signaling effectively in the absence of co-expressed Jak2, we generated stably expressing 293 cell lines in which the ELR mutants were expressed in 100% of the cell population to facilitate the analysis of signaling. We confirmed similar cell surface ligand binding of each stably expressing cell line (Fig. 4 D) and repeated the analysis of the COOH-terminal truncations at endogenous levels of Jak2 in these 293 clones (Fig.4 B). The results of this analysis differed importantly from those in 293 cells co-transfected with Jak2 and the various ELR constructs in Fig. 4 A, in that the activation of Jak2 by ELR isoforms Δ37c and Δ43c were greatly reduced; activation by Δ49c remained normal. Similar results were obtained in 32D cell lines expressing the various COOH-terminal truncations (data not shown). These results confirm that the region of LRb between amino acids 31–36 contains a domain that is critical for Jak2 activation. Furthermore, the residues immediately COOH-terminal to amino acids 31–36 (i.e. between 37 and 48) function in Jak2 activation at physiologic levels of Jak2, whereas the region COOH-terminal to intracellular amino acid 48 is not necessary for Jak2 activation even at endogenous levels of Jak2 expression. To identify other potentially important LRb sequences NH2-terminal to intracellular amino acid 37 of LRb, we generated a panel of mutant ELR constructs containing six amino acid internal deletions within the mutant Δ65c (Fig.5, top panel) described previously. We chose this particular deletion size, because six amino acids represents two turns of an α-helix, and the maintenance of helical orientation may be critical for juxtamembrane sequences. Previous work has shown that the addition or deletion of juxtamembrane sequences in multiples of three amino acids does not alter cytokine receptor function, whereas alterations by one or two amino acids inhibit signaling (19Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We transiently co-transfected 293 cells with Jak2 and these ELR mutants. Cell surface 125I-Epo binding assay demonstrated similar cell surface expression of the ELR isoforms (Fig. 5 C). We analyzed the ability of these receptor forms to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 during ligand stimulation by αPY immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated Jak2 from cells incubated in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig.5 A). With the exception of the internal deletions Δ13–18 and Δ19–24, all of these internal deletion mutants were able to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. The normal activation of Jak2 by Δ1–6 confirms that six amino acid deletions in the juxtamembrane region do not alter the conformation of COOH-terminal sequences in a manner that diminishes Jak2 activation. Thus, at high Jak2 levels only amino acids 13–24, the region that contains Box 1, were required to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. Furthermore, these results suggest that there is no role for amino acids downstream of amino acid 24. H"

Using three well established techniques for studying amyloid structure, namely circular dichroism, thioflavin-T fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that oxidation of the Met-35 side chain to a methionine sulfoxide (Met-35ox) significantly hinders the rate of fibril formation for the 42-residue Aβ-(1–42) at physiological pH. Met-35ox also alters the characteristic Aβ fibril morphology and prevents formation of the protofibril, which is a key intermediate in β-amyloidosis and the associated neurotoxicity.

The implications of these results for the biological function and role of Aβ with oxidative stress in AD are discussed. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the abundance of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and the extracellular deposition of the Aβ peptide as amyloid plaques (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Google Scholar). Aβ is a normally secreted soluble peptide that under certain environmental conditions can produce β-sheet aggregates that eventually precipitate as amyloid fibrils. Numerous studies have established that the Aβ peptide becomes neurotoxic to cortical cell cultures when aggregated as β-sheet structures (2Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H.

Additional studies suggest that the longer, 42-residue Aβ-(1–42) is more pathogenic than the shorter, 40-residue Aβ-(1–40) because of its greater in vitro tendency to aggregate and precipitate as amyloid (5Ertekin-Taner N. Graff-Radford N. Younkin L.H. Eckman C. Baker M. Adamson J. Ronald J. Blangero J. Hutton M. Younkin S.G. Science. 2000; 290: 2303-2304Google Scholar). Although the conversion of monomeric Aβ peptide building blocks into multimeric amyloid fibril β-sheet aggregates (β-aggregation) is now considered a seminal event in the progression of AD, 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Met-35ox, methionine sulfoxide; Th-T, thioflavin-T; MS, mass spectroscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Met-35ox, methionine sulfoxide; Th-T, thioflavin-T; MS, mass spectroscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy.x0 the molecular mechanisms associated with these processes remain unknown. Evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress plays an important role in AD neurodegeneration (6Aksenov M.Y. Aksenova M.V. Butterfield D.A. Geddes J.W. Markesbery W.R. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 373-383Google Scholar, 7Head E. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Johnson J.K. Lott I.T. Cotman C.W. Glabe C. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 792-806Google Scholar, 8Aliev G.

Many proteins and DNA undergo oxidation more readily in AD brains, and the exact role that Aβ plays in these processes is not clear (9Varadarajan S. Yatin S. Aksenova M. Butterfield D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 184-208Google Scholar). The binding between Aβ and metals such as copper and zinc accelerates β-aggregation and generates reactive oxygen species and H2O2, which in turn accelerates oxidative damage to other proteins (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar, 11Sayre L.M. Perry G. Atwood C.S. Smith M.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 731-741Google Scholar). In all of these processes, the Met-35 side chain of Aβ is thought to play some critical role because oxidized Met-35 (Met-35ox) is found in variable amounts of post-mortem AD plaques (12Näslund J. Schierhorn A. Hellman U. Lannfelt L. Roses A.D. Tjernberg L.O. Silberring J. Gandy S.E. Winbald B. Greengard P. Nordstedt C. Terenius L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12991-12998Google Scholar) and, for many proteins, the methionine side chains are easily oxidized under physiological conditions (Met → Metox) (14Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Google Scholar, 15Schoneich C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 370-376Google Scholar). Moreover, because oxidized methionine can be reconverted enzymatically back to its reduced state (14Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Google Scholar), it was proposed that, for some proteins, surface-exposed methionine residues may function as antioxidants and protect other amino acids from irreversible oxidative damage (16Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Google Scholar). For Aβ, contradicting reports exist between the Met-35 oxidation state and its effects on β-aggregation, toxicity, fibril morphology, and biological roles. A few reports demonstrate that Met-35ox increases β-aggregation and toxicity (3Seilheimer B. Bohrmann B. Bondolfi L. Muller F. Stuber D. Dobeli H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 59-71Google Scholar, 17Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett L.W. Matayoshi E.D. Huffaker H.J. Krafft G.A. Holzman T.F. Biophys.

The reason for these discrepancies is not clear, although they could be the result of several factors such as differences with the handling of Aβ (the well known lot-to-lot variability) (3Seilheimer B. Bohrmann B. Bondolfi L. Muller F. Stuber D. Dobeli H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 59-71Google Scholar, 22May P. Gitter B. Waters D. Simmons L. Becker G. Small J. Robison P. Neurobiol.

J. 1995; 69: 640-651Google Scholar), (i.e. pH, peptide concentrations, temperature, and the type of peptide employed (Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42)). Because of the importance of the Met-35 side chain in oxidative stress and its possible role as an electron donor for the reduction of Aβ-bound CuII to CuI (15Schoneich C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 370-376Google Scholar, 21Varadarajan S. Kanski J. Aksenova M. Lauderback C. Butterfield D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5625-5631Google Scholar), we undertook our own systematic analysis using the more pathogenic Aβ-(1–42) under native-like conditions (aqueous solution, neutral pH). Here, for the first time we show that oxidation of Met-35 to Met-35ox significantly impedes the rate of amyloid formation and alters the fibril morphology. These results provide support for the hypothesis that oxidative stress and Aβ amyloid formation are intimately related in AD pathology. Thioflavin-T (Th-T) was purchased from Sigma (81K3643), and the Aβ-(1–42) peptide was synthesized and purified as described (25Shao H. Jao S.-C., Ma, K. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 755-773Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence for the amyloid Aβ-(1–42) peptide is the following: H3N+-D 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Met-35ox, methionine sulfoxide; Th-T, thioflavin-T; MS, mass spectroscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy.AEFR5HDSGY10EVHHQ15KLVFF20AEDVG25SNKGA30IIGLM35VGGVV40IA42- COO−. Peptide identity was verified by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Lyophilized Aβ-(1–42) peptide (1.8 mg, 40 μmol) was disaggregated first by thoroughly dissolving the peptide in dilute NaOH solution (1.9 ml, 10 mm) with sonication for 1 min (26Fezoui Y. Hartley D. Harper J. Khurana R. Walsh D. Condron M. Selkoe D. Lansbury P. Fink A. Teplow D. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 166-178Google Scholar). This disaggregation procedure, which removes potential interference from small aggregates (“seeds”), is vital for obtaining consistent results and overcomes many of the lot-to-lot discrepancies frequently encountered with Aβ peptides (23Zagorski M.G. Yang J. Shao H., Ma, K. Zeng H. Hong A. Wetzel R. Amyloid, Prions, and Other Protein Aggregates. 309. Academic Press, New York1999: 189-204Google Scholar). The basic pH solution of Aβ-(1–42) (1.9 ml, 10 mm) was then combined directly with a potassium phosphate-buffered solution (6.1 ml, 10 mm, pH 7.3) to yield a final stock solution (8 ml) with a peptide concentration of 50 μm. The pH of the stock solution was checked and, if needed, carefully adjusted to pH 7.3 with dilute NaOH or trifluoroacetic acid solutions. Met-35 oxidation was done according to methods previously described for the Aβ-(1–40) peptide (19Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12700-12706Google Scholar), which involved the addition of dilute H2O2 (5 μl, 7.5% by weight) to a phosphate-buffered solution of Aβ-(1–42) (1 ml, 50 μm). The reaction was done in 4 h, and a single product was obtained, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS and two-dimensional NMR. 2L. Hou, I. Kang, R. E. Marchant, and M. G. Zagorski, unpublished results. The product was freeze-dried to remove excess H2O2 and redissolved in water. In the MS, the molecular ion of the product had a molecular mass (4531 Da) that was 16 Da higher than the native Aβ-(1–42) (4515 Da). This established that Met sulfoxide was the only product (these results are also consistent with NMR spectral data; not shown). After 1 week, the MS analysis of the peptide solution containing the H2O2 gave identical results, demonstrating that other possible oxidations (such as forming a dityrosine adduct (7Head E. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Johnson J.K. Lott I.T. Cotman C.W. Glabe C. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 792-806Google Scholar, 27Hensley K. Maidt M.L., Yu, Z. Sang H. Markesbery W.R. Floyd R.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8126-8132Google Scholar)) did not take place. For the time-dependent Th-T and CD studies, a fresh 50 μm Aβ-(1–42) stock solution (7.5 ml) in phosphate buffer (10 mm) was partitioned into 5 equal fractions (1.5 ml) and incubated at 22 °C for specific intervals before initiating Met-35 oxidation (Met-35 → Met-35ox). Met-35 → Met-35ox to fractions 2, 3, 4, and 5 was started by the addition of dilute H2O2 (8 μl, 7.5% by weight) at 0.08, 10, 22, and 72 h, respectively. The CD spectra were obtained at 22 °C using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) and a 1-mm path length cell (Hellma). For each sample, five accumulative readings were averaged and acquired with 0.2-nm resolution, a 2-s response time, and 50 nm/min scan speed. Spectra were obtained from 190 to 250 nm. Two methods were used to obtain the percent soluble β-sheet structure: 1) a comparison of the ratios between the β-sheet ellipticities at 195 and 217 nm, and 2) spectral deconvolution using the program CDANAL (28Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Google Scholar). Both methods gave comparable results, and both have been used previously for CD studies of the Aβ (29Pappolla M. Bozner P. Soto C. Shao H. Robakis N.K. Zagorski M.G. Frangione B. Ghiso J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7185-7188Google Scholar, 30Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Google Scholar). The percent soluble β-sheet determined by CDANAL is presented in Fig. 3 D. Images were generated on a Multimode AFM instrument equipped with a Nanoscan III controller (Digital Instruments) using an “E”-type scanner with anxy range of 12.5 μm. Imaging was done at 22 °C under the air-tapping mode with commercially available silicon NanoProbes (Digital Instruments). In general, the scanning parameters were as follows: 2 V, initial root-mean-square amplitude; set point at 80% of the free amplitude; 250–350 kHz, tapping frequency; 2 Hz, scan rate; and 2-μm size (512 × 512-pixel resolution). A three-dimensional rendering was used for processing, with the image tilted by an angle of 5° to allow better visualization of the periodicities. For sample preparation on the mica surface, we generally followed previous AFM methods employed with the Aβ peptides (31Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar), which included diluting the Aβ-(1–42) aliquots (5–10 μl) with an equal volume of water (0.2 μm filtered) immediately before application to the mica surface as required to produce a monolayer. This dilution procedure required <30 s and did not affect the outcome of our study (31Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Varian) using excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm. Fluorescence intensity was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 482 nm, respectively (32LeVine H. Amyloid. 1995; 2: 1-6Google Scholar). At specific time intervals, aliquots (20 μl) were removed from the Aβ-(1–42) peptide solutions, thoroughly mixed with a Th-T solution (1 ml, 4 μm) containing potassium phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4), followed by immediate measurement of the fluorescence. Fig.1 presents the CD spectra for Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox peptide solutions after 0.17 and 48 h of incubation or aging at 22 °C. Because the Aβ structure and aggregational properties are highly concentration-dependent, a 50 μm peptide concentration was selected to allow easy monitoring of conformational changes by CD (concentrations above or below this threshold undergo corresponding changes too quickly or slowly). To ensure that the two solutions were identical, they were prepared from an identical stock solution after which one of the solutions was oxidized immediately. As shown in Fig. 1, after aging for 0.17 h both peptides adopted a predominantly random structure as indicated by the major negative bands at 198 nm. After 48 h of aging, the CD spectra of Aβ-(1–42) demonstrated that a conformational change occurred in which the 198 nm band disappeared, with the appearance of positive and negative bands at 195 and 214 nm, consistent with β-sheet structure. This random → β-sheet conversion agrees with previous observations (24Shen C.-L. Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 640-651Google Scholar, 33Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T.M. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Google Scholar, 34Soto C. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Google Scholar). By contrast, after 48 h Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox remained predominantly random, with a modest reduction in the intensity of the 198 nm band. These results establish that Met-35ox hinders the random → β-sheet conversion associated with the β-aggregation process and Aβ neurotoxicity (2Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 253-265Google Scholar). To test whether Met-35ox affects Aβ fibril morphology, we used AFM, a well established technique for elucidating the fibril structures (31Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar, 35Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.L. Wade W.S. Stewart K. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J.

Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W.L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Google Scholar). For an accurate comparison with the CD data, we used the same peptide solutions aged for 0.17 and 48 h (Fig. 1). After aging for 0.17 h, the Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox solutions gave virtually identical AFM data, with essentially no detectable fibrils and only small aggregates. However, samples aged for 48 h gave a distinct sets of data, with the Aβ-(1–42) producing two well defined fibril types (Fig.2 A) and the Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox producing no fibrils but only small globular structures (Fig. 2 B). These globular structures had smaller dimensions and variable heights (0.7–3.3 nm, centered mostly at 1.4 ± 0.3 nm), appropriate to the assembly of small oligomers into larger conglomerates (51). For the Aβ-(1–42), the two types of fibrils were: large fibrils, brighter and sparsely dispersed (Fig. 2,A and C–E); and smaller, thin filaments. Many of the larger fibrils had average dimensions consistent with the Aβ protofibril, which is believed to be a neurotoxic intermediate formed during β-amyloidosis (39Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M., Ye, C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Google Scholar). These protofibrils had a 3.6 ± 0.6 nm average diameter and 21 ± 4 m periodicities, analogous to previously reported protofibril dimensions (3–4 nm average diameter, 20–22 nm periodicity) (31Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar, 40Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Google Scholar). The second fibril type were thin filaments, also detected by Stine et al. (35Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.L. Wade W.S. Stewart K. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 193-203Google Scholar), that had an 0.65 ± 0.07 average height with no clear periodicity. For the unmodified Aβ-(1–42), incubation times greater than 48 h lead to formation of longer protofibrils, as well as Type 1 and Type 2 mature fibrils (31Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar, 35Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.L. Wade W.S. Stewart K. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J.

Taken together, these data establish that Met-35ox markedly affects Aβ fibril morphology and inhibits production of both the thin filaments and the protofibril. The CD results established that Met-35ox stabilizes the random structure and slows down production of the β-sheet structure found in fibrils (Fig. 1). To explore the possibility that Metox not only slows down β-aggregation as an early event (random → β-sheet) but also at later stages (β-sheet (soluble) → β-sheet (amyloid fibril)), we undertook more detailed studies. These involved initiating Met-35 → Met-35ox at different time points during sample aging and monitoring the secondary structure and β-aggregation rates using CD and the Th-T binding assay (32LeVine H. Amyloid. 1995; 2: 1-6Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 3 A is an outline of the overall procedure. A freshly prepared Aβ-(1–42) solution was split into five equal fractions, and these solutions were then monitored by CD and Th-T for a period of up to 240 h. Fraction 1 represents the control, unoxidized sample, whereas fractions 2, 3, 4, and 5 were oxidized at 0.08, 10, 22, and 72 h of aging, respectively. Representative CD spectra for fractions 1 and 4 are presented in Fig. 3 (B and C) along with the estimated percent β-sheet structure and Th-T results for all five fractions (Fig. 3, D and E). The increases in both the negative and positive ellipticities at 195 and 217 nm (Fig. 3 B) demonstrate that the β-sheet content in unoxidized Aβ-(1–42) gradually increases over time, leveling off at 68–70% at 216–240 h of aging (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, the Met-35ox samples show significantly reduced rates of β-sheet production. For example, with fraction 4 the β-sheet content (48–50%) remained nearly constant between 24 and 96 h followed by a rise at 120 h to 60% β-sheet (Fig. 3,C and D). Regardless of the time in which the Met-35 → Met-35ox was started, all samples showed similar lag phases (70–100 h), and all eventually went on to produce more β-sheet structures (Fig. 3 D). The Th-T data shows comparable sigmoidal β-aggregation curves (Fig. 3 E) in which the oxidized samples have reduced fluorescence because of their lower fibril content. On average, the final levels of β-sheet structure are 20% less with the oxidized samples, irrespective of the oxidation time. These data establish that Met-35ox hinders β-amyloidosis (random → β-sheet (soluble) → β-sheet (fibril)), regardless of the predominant solution conformation. It is now thought that therapeutic approaches for preventing the conformational conversions and fibrillation of Aβ could ameliorate the effects associated with oxidative stress and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's patients. Recent reports have demonstrated that soluble Aβ oligomers interfere with long-term potentiation (8Aliev G. Smith M.A. Seyidov D. Neal M.L. Lamb B.T. Nunomura A. Gasimov E.K. Vinters H.V. Perry G. LaManna J.C. Friedland R.P. Brain Pathol. 2002; 12: 21-35Google Scholar), and another report shows that in vitroapplication of Aβ-derived diffusible ligands formed from synthetic Aβ-(1–42) causes neurological dysfunction in the hippocampus long before neurons degenerate (41Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Google Scholar). It is now evident that the research efforts directed at providing a molecular basis for the biological role of the Aβ and its relationship to oxidative stress, which is extensive and constitutes an early event in AD (42Butterfield D.A. Drake J. Pocernich C. Castegna A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 548-554Google Scholar), will be a key factor in determining the most effective interventions. The present biophysical data demonstrate that Met-35 to Met-35ox oxidation slows down β-aggregation and disrupts the characteristic fibril morphology. The decreased ability of Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox toward β-aggregation could be the result of decreased hydrophobicity of the C-terminal tail, which leads to greater solubility and less hydrophobic induced aggregation (14Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Google Scholar,43Kim Y.H. Berry A.H. Spencer D.S. Stites W.E. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 343-347Google Scholar). A similar rationale was used to account for the decreased fibrillation of methionine-oxidized α-synuclein, a brain protein that is predominantly random but can produce the β-sheet aggregates found in Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (44Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Google Scholar). Similar lag phases for reduced fibrillation in Aβ-(1–42) (Fig. 3), irrespective of whether the major starting conformation is random or β-sheet, suggest that the increased polarity of Met-35ox leads to a nonproductive or alternative β-aggregation association that does not produce the characteristic amyloid-like fibrils. A previous study (18Lorenzo A. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993; 19: 184Google Scholar) reported that Met-35ox inhibits β-aggregation of Aβ-(1–40), whereas another study (20Palmblad M. Westlind-Danielsson A. Bergquist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19506-19510Google Scholar), done in water/acetic acid solution, showed that the Aβ-(1–40)Met-35ox monomer did not aggregate beyond a dimer. Because the Aβ-(1–40)Met-35ox and Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox monomeric structures are predominantly random (45Riek R. Guntert P. Dobeli H. Wipf B. Wuthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5930-5936Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that Met-35oxprevents a random → β-sheet conversion, consistent with our present results with Aβ-(1–42). The discrepancies with previous reports, in which Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox showed no inhibitory effect on β-aggregation or fibril formation (3Seilheimer B. Bohrmann B. Bondolfi L. Muller F. Stuber D. Dobeli H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 59-71Google Scholar, 21Varadarajan S. Kanski J. Aksenova M. Lauderback C. Butterfield D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5625-5631Google Scholar) or Met-35oxshowed enhanced β-aggregation with Aβ-(1–40) (17Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett L.W. Matayoshi E.D. Huffaker H.J. Krafft G.A. Holzman T.F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1216-1228Google Scholar), is probably because of the different solution conditions (such as pH and peptide concentration) and different peptide handling procedures (23Zagorski M.G. Yang J. Shao H., Ma, K. Zeng H. Hong A. Wetzel R. Amyloid, Prions, and Other Protein Aggregates. 309. Academic Press, New York1999: 189-204Google Scholar). In the present work, we addressed these issues by thoroughly disaggregating the Aβ-(1–42) peptide (26Fezoui Y. Hartley D. Harper J. Khurana R. Walsh D. Condron M. Selkoe D. Lansbury P. Fink A. Teplow D. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 166-178Google Scholar) and partitioning this peptide solution into fractions, so that the only difference among the fractions is the Met-35 oxidation state. Our results were reproducible with the same or different Aβ-(1–42) peptide batches, regardless of whether synthetic and recombinant peptide was employed. Interestingly, our data also demonstrate that the inhibition is independent of the predominant solution conformation (random or β-sheet), suggesting that the slightly increased polarity of the Met-35ox side chain prevents intermolecular association of random monomers and/or β-sheet aggregates. This result may have implications for Aβ clearance, as the delay in β-aggregation may allow sufficient time for enzymes to degrade the monomer or dimers for excretion (46Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K., Lu, B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Hama E. Lee H.J. Saido T.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1550-1552Google Scholar). In addition, the present studies are the first to demonstrate a lack of a protofibril for Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox, which has been proposed to be a key intermediate in β-amyloidosis and neurotoxicity (31Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar, 39Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M., Ye, C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Google Scholar, 40Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Google Scholar). This could explain why Met-35ox causes decreased cellular toxicity and lack of protein-induced oxidation (21Varadarajan S. Kanski J. Aksenova M. Lauderback C. Butterfield D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5625-5631Google Scholar). Although Aβ-(1–42)Met-35ox eventually forms β-sheet fibrils, the final levels of β-sheet structure are ∼20% less than the reduced peptide (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the reduced and oxidized peptides may aggregate by alternative pathways, because the β-sheet fibril end points are different. On the basis of the present results, we support the view that Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) peptides, which are both normal physiologic constituents, have a protective effect and under certain conditions function as antioxidants (47Kontush A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1120-1131Google Scholar). Indeed, in normal individuals, low levels of Aβ are potent antioxidants and reduce the levels of oxidative stress, whereas in Alzheimer's patients, elevated Aβ production could be triggered by the increased levels of oxidative stress. Age-related events in the AD brain that either impair the ability of enzymes to promote Met-35ox → Met-35 (48Gabbita S.P. Aksenov M.Y. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1660-1666Google Scholar) or impair the ability of Aβ to function as an antioxidant, may lead to neuronal cell demise by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reduced Aβ, which, according to the present results, is more prone to amyloid formation. We anticipate that additional studies aimed at establishing a more thorough connection between Aβ pro- and anti-oxidative properties and β-amyloidosis would facilitate the development of an appropriate therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's patients.

Ezekowitz A.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). It is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein expressed on most tissue MØs, certain endothelial cells, and in vitro derived dendritic cells (DCs) (2Pontow S.E. Kery V. Stahl P.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 221-244PubMed Google Scholar, 3Linehan S.A. Martinez-Pomares L. Stahl P.D. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4Sallusto F.M. Cella M. Daniella C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). In addition to phagocytosis, the MR mediates the endocytosis of soluble glycoconjugates leading to enhanced uptake of ligands in both MØs and DCs (5Engering A.J. Cella M. Fluitsma D. Brockhaus M. Hoefsmit E.C.M. Lanzavecchia A. Pieters J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2417-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The MR belongs to the Ca2+-dependent lectin family that bind sugars through their carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) (6Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The MR itself has eight CRDs located on a single polypeptide chain. CRDs 4 and 5 of the MR are central to sugar binding, and at least one further CRD proximal to the membrane is necessary for the binding and uptake of multivalent ligands (7Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MR displays a mannose-type binding specificity recognizing monosaccharides in the following order of affinity:d-Man = l-Fuc >d-Glc = d-GlcNAc ≫ d-Gal (6Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The binding of a monosaccharide by the CRD requires the presence of free equatorial hydroxyl groups at both the C3 and C4 positions of hexoses and at the C2 and C3 positions of the 6-deoxyhexose, l-Fuc. With respect to microbial ligands, a high affinity of the MR for polysaccharides displaying numerous terminal d-Man residues, as exemplified by yeast mannan, is well documented. The recognition of other complex microbial polysaccharides, particularly those expressed by bacteria, however, has not been investigated in any depth. In this study, we investigate the binding of the MR to the capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) from different capsular serotype strains ofStreptococcus pneumoniae and to the CPSs and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from different capsular and O-serotype strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both bacterial species are major opportunistic pathogens, and in both cases antibodies directed against their CPSs confer protection. Vaccines currently in use againstS. pneumoniae are either composed of CPS alone or are glycoconjugates based on the conjugation of CPS or oligosaccharides derived from CPS to a protein carrier. In addition to binding through CRDs, the MR also has a second distinct lectin activity located in the N-terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain of the molecule, this time with specificity for host sulfated oligosaccharides (9Fiete D.J.

Sulfated ligands for the CR domain are present in secondary lymphoid tissues, where they are expressed on metallophilic marginal zone MØs in the spleen, on subcapsular sinus MØs in lymph nodes, and also on a subpopulation of DCs (11Martinez-Pomares L.

Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A soluble form of the MR (sMR), released by constitutive proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form by an endogenous cell metalloprotease, is also present in serum (13Martinez-Pomares L.

The CPSs of S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae are high molecular weight polysaccharides, typically 106daltons and greater, and are composed of linear or branched repeating units containing from two to seven monosaccharides. S. pneumoniae CPSs variously contain d-GlcA andd-GalA acid residues and may be substituted withO-acetyl, pyruvate acetal, and glycerol phosphate groups (14Jennings H.J. Pon R.A. Dumitriu S. Polysaccharides in Medicinal Applications. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1996: 443-479Google Scholar). Several resemble teichoic acids in containing ribitol phosphate-linked repeat units. They frequently contain aminosugars, which include different aminohexoses and alsoN-acetyl-d-mannuronic acid. d-Gal,d-Glc, and l-Rha are common components, whereasd-Man is not found in any of these structures. All CPS preparations from S. pneumoniae contain 1–10%, by weight, common cell wall polysaccharide (CW-PS), which is the teichoic acid of this organism. CPSs from K. pneumoniae commonly contain d-Glc,d-Man, d-Gal, and l-Rha.l-Fuc is found in only a very few serotype strains (15Orskov I. Orskov F. Methods Microbiol. 1984; 14: 143-164Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). They all contain one hexuronic acid residue in each repeat unit, which is nearly always d-GlcA acid, and are frequently substituted with pyruvate acetal or O-acetyl groups. Unlike CPSs from S. pneumoniae, phosphate groups, and aminosugars are absent from these polysaccharides. The uptake of K. pneumoniae by alveolar MØs mediated by recognition of CPS via the MR has been reported (16Athamna A. Ofek I. Keisari Y. Markowitz S. Dutton G.G.S. Sharon N. Infect.

In contrast to the CPS of K. pneumoniae, the LPS O-antigens of this species display very limited structural variation with only nine recognized O-serotypes. Three main serotypes consist of linear polymers of α-linked d-mannose residues (serotype 03) and linear polymers of d-galacto-pyranose residues (galactan II) or both d-galacto-pyranose andd-galacto-furanose residues (galactan I) (serotypes O1 and O2) (Table III) (15Orskov I.

The majority of LPSs expressed by isolates of K. pneumoniae are of the 01, 02, and 03 serotypes. In this study, we investigate the interactions between bacterial polysaccharides and the MR in vitro using purified CPS and LPS and the following proteins: (a) CRDs 4–7 of the MR fused to human IgG1 Fc (CRD(4–7)Fc), (b) the CR domain of the MR fused to human IgG1Fc (CR-Fc), and (c) the full-length sMR. Monoclonal antibody MR5D3 was generated by subcutaneous immunization of Fischer rats with 100 μg of CRD(4–7)Fc in complete Freund's adjuvant containing 10 mmCa2+, followed after 14 days by a similar booster with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. A final boost of 50 μg of CRD(4–7)Fc in PBS with 10 mm Ca2+was given intraperitoneally 4 days prior to fusion. The splenic B cells were fused with the Y3 myeloma cell line as described in Ref. 23Galfre G. Milstein C. Wright B. Nature. 1979; 277: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for the presence of anti-MR antibodies in ELISA using CRD(4–7)Fc-coated plates. Of several monoclonal cell lines that were obtained, MR5D3 was chosen for further application due to its performance in immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and immunoprecipitation. 2L. Martinez-Pomares, D. M. Reid, P. R. Taylor, S. A. Linehan, S. Zamze, S. Y. C. Wong, and S. Gordon, manuscript in preparation. MR5D3 was shown to be noninhibitory for the binding of the MR to carbohydrate ligands (data not shown). The fusion proteins, CR-Fc and CRD(4–7)Fc, were obtained as previously described (11Martinez-Pomares L. Kosco-Vilbois M. Darley E. Tree P. Herren S. Bonnefoy J-Y. Gordon S. J. Exp.

The sMR was purified from culture supernatants of NIH 3T3-derived MR transfectants2 by affinity chromatography using MR5D3 as follows. Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine under the selection of G418 (400 μg/ml). Once cells were confluent, this medium was replaced with the same medium containing 3% (v/v) FCS. After 13 days, the supernatants were harvested, centrifuged twice at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, filtered, and precleared using Gammabind PLUS Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The sMR was purified from the medium on a MR5D3 affinity column, prepared by cross-linking of MR5D3 to Gammabind PLUS Sepharose with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). After extensive washing in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.154m NaCl (PBS), bound proteins were eluted with 0.5% (v/v) diethylamine and neutralized using 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Fractions containing sMR were detected by dot blot analysis using MR5D3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Chemicon). Positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmCa2+ and 0.154 m NaCl, aliquoted, and frozen at −20 °C. K. pneumoniae capsular serotype strains, K11, K17, K22, K27, K31, K46, and K60 were obtained from Dr. Harry Deneer (University of Saskatchewan, Canada), and strains K1, K3, K26, K36, K40, and K52 were from the Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark. Rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for the different CPS serotypes of K. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae and for the S. pneumoniae CW-PS were obtained from the Statens Serum Institute. Soluble multivalent monosaccharide or short oligosaccharide ligands attached to a soluble polyacrylamide support (sugar-PAAs) were obtained from Syntesome (Munich, Germany). Yeast mannan fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae was purchased from Sigma. CPS from K. pneumoniae was quantified by measuring the total uronic acid content (one d-GlcA present/polysaccharide repeating unit) (25Knutson C.A. Jeanes A. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 24: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured by the Micro BCA™ assay (Pierce), and nucleic acid was measured by UV absorbance. Total carbohydrate was measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid reaction (26Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39449) Google Scholar). LPS content was measured by a kinetic turbidometric Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay, using reagents from Charles River Endosafe and Escherichia coli055 LPS as standard according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Ref. 27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar. LPS was resolved on 15% (w/v) gels and visualized by silver staining according to Ref.28Tsai C-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar. CPS was resolved on 10% (w/v) gels and visualized by combined Alcian blue and silver staining (29Min H. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Purified CPSs from S. pneumoniae were obtained from Dr. Chris Jones (National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Hertfordshire, UK). These polysaccharides contain less than 1% by weight protein and nucleic acid contaminants. S. pneumoniae CW-PS was obtained from the Statens Serum Institute. K. pneumoniae CPSs were isolated and purified as follows. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C on lactose agar plates to maximize CPS production. The bacterial growth from 20–30 plates was suspended in 25–50 ml of distilled water and heated for 10 min at 100 °C to release capsular material. The CPS was precipitated with 80% (v/v) acetone at 4 °C and recovered by spooling around a glass Pasteur pipette. The precipitate was dried overnight at room temperature and resuspended in PBS, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation twice at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing CPS was then centrifuged for a further 8 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C, and the pellet containing LPS and protein was discarded. CPS was dialyzed against distilled water and freeze-dried. In some cases, the CPS was also digested with ribonuclease type II-B (30 μg/ml) and deoxyribonuclease EC 3.1.2.1 (70 μg/ml) for 24 h, followed by the addition of subtilisin (70 μg/ml) and incubation for a further 24 h. Incubations were carried out in 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 4 mmMg2+ and 0.05% (w/v) thiomersal at an approximate concentration of 500 μg/ml CPS at 37 °C with shaking. Following digestion, samples were dialyzed extensively against distilled water, 25-kDa cut-off membrane, and freeze-dried. A final purification step was carried out by gel filtration chromatography under dissociating conditions on a TSK G5000 PW xl column (300 × 7.5 mm). The buffer used was PBS containing 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Chromatography was carried out at 60 °C at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Absorbance at 205 and 280 nm and refractive index of the eluant were monitored. Fractions were collected at 2-min intervals. Fractions containing carbohydrate were pooled, dialyzed against water, concentrated by freeze drying, and resuspended in ∼5 ml of water. Residual detergent was removed by precipitation of CPS twice from 80% (v/v) ethanol at 4 °C. LPSs from Haemophilus influenzae type b strain Eagen,Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAC1, and K. pneumoniae were obtained by extraction with hot aqueous 45% (w/v) phenol (30Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carb. Chem. 1965; 5: 453-454Google Scholar). LPSs were dialyzed extensively against distilled water followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. The LPS pellet was resuspended in water and quantified by gravimetric measurement.Salmonella typhimurium rough LPS types, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd1, Rd2, and Re were purchased from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (New York, NY). LPSs from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, immunotype L3 and mutant 4 type, were gifts from Dr. S. R. Andersen. The structures of the LPSs from H. influenzae,S. typhimurium, and N. meningitidisare shown in Table IV. The structure of P. aeruginosaPAC1 LPS is not known.Table IVStructures of LPSs tested for binding to the MR Open table in a new tab The binding of the mannose receptor to different polysaccharides was determined by ELISA, either directly by measuring binding to plates coated with different ligands or indirectly by inhibition assays as follows. All washings and incubations were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmCa2+, 0.154 m NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20. Polysaccharides were coated onto the wells of ELISA plates (Nunc; Maxisorb) by incubation in 0.154 m NaCl overnight at 37 °C (50 μl/well). Plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated in a sealed damp box. Bacterial CPSs and LPSs were coated at 50 μg/ml, authentic sugar polyacrylamide substrates at 5 μg/ml, and yeast mannan at 10 μg/ml. After coating, plates were washed five times. The coating efficiency of the different CPSs was confirmed by titration with anti-CPS-specific antisera. CRD(4–7)Fc, CR-Fc, and sMR were incubated in the wells of coated plates at 2 μg/ml (50 μl/well) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed five times. The MR fusion proteins were detected by incubation with anti-human IgG Fc-specific, alkaline phosphatase conjugate, species-absorbed (Jackson Laboratories). Bound sMR was detected by incubation with MR5D3 at 10 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature followed by detection with anti-rat IgG Fc-specific, alkaline phosphatase conjugate, species-absorbed (Jackson). Plates were washed five times and developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm after 30 min. Readings were measured against a blank of uncoated wells incubated with MR protein. Background readings were no more than 0.05 absorbance units higher than the reagent blank. All assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Yeast mannan-coated wells were used as a positive control in assays measuring CRD(4–7)Fc and sMR binding. The inhibition of binding of CRD(4–7)Fc and sMR to ELISA plates coated with different ligands was measured. Inhibition was carried out in a high salt buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm Ca2+, 1 m NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20. All incubations were at room temperature. Either CRD(4–7)Fc or sMR were preincubated at 2 μg/ml with different concentrations of inhibitor, either monosaccharides or polysaccharides, for 30 min followed by incubation for 2 h in the wells of coated ELISA plates. The plates were washed five times, and the detection of bound CRD(4–7)Fc and sMR was carried out as described above. The sMR obtained by affinity chromatography was quantified by the BCA assay and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography. The sMR migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 a) with an apparent molecular mass of ∼180 kDa. The protein similarly eluted as one main peak on gel filtration chromatography (Fig 1 b,peak 2), with an apparent molecular mass just greater than the 158-kDa protein standard consistent with the presence of monomers of the full-length soluble form of the molecule. The presence of a minor higher molecular weight component (peak 1) may represent a very small amount of sMR dimer or aggregate. CPS extracts prior to gel filtration contained on average by weight 10% protein, 5% LPS, and 1% or less nucleic acid. Extensive enzymic digestions with nucleases and protease followed by dialysis reduced the levels of protein and nucleic acid by ∼50%, suggesting a strong association of CPS with protein or peptide fragments. In order to further remove protein and also LPS, further purification was carried out by a gel filtration step under dissociating conditions. All CPSs gave very similar profiles (Fig. 2 a). One main carbohydrate peak (peak a) eluted close to the void volume of the column, molecular mass 2,000 kDa and greater, and a second minor peak of carbohydrate (peak b) eluted, together with the majority of the protein, close to the total volume of the column. Recovery of total carbohydrate was 80% and greater as measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid reaction. Carbohydrate was recovered from both pools as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, b and c). Carbohydrate in pool 1 migrated as a broad high molecular weight band that could be visualized only by using Alcian blue prior to silver staining, confirming the presence and identity of CPS. The carbohydrate in pool 2 gave the characteristic banding pattern of LPS, which was readily visualized by silver staining alone. The CPS recovered in pool 1 was quantified by measuring the total uronic acid content. Protein content was no more than 1%, and LPS content, estimated by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay, was no more than 0.1% by weight. No nucleic acid was detectable. It was also confirmed that there was no reduction in the reaction of CPS with anti-CPS-specific antisera following gel filtration, confirming that no degradation of CPS had taken place during purification. The binding properties and specificities of the proteins, CRD(4–7)Fc, CR-Fc, and sMR, toward authentic ligands were analyzed prior to investigating binding to bacterial polysaccharides. In direct binding assays, both CRD(4–7)Fc and sMR displayed high affinity for terminal d-Man andl-Fuc residues but no binding to d"
https://openalex.org/W2164186503,"Equinatoxin II (EqtII) belongs to a unique family of 20-kDa pore-forming toxins from sea anemones. These toxins preferentially bind to membranes containing sphingomyelin and create cation-selective pores by oligomerization of 3–4 monomers. In this work we have studied the binding of EqtII to lipid membranes by the use of lipid monolayers and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The binding is a two-step process, separately mediated by two regions of the molecule. An exposed aromatic cluster involving tryptophans 112 and 116 mediates the initial attachment that is prerequisite for the next step. Steric shielding of the aromatic cluster or mutation of Trp-112 and -116 to phenylalanine significantly reduces the toxin-lipid interaction. The second step is promoted by the N-terminal amphiphilic helix, which translocates into the lipid phase. The two steps were distinguished by the use of a double cysteine mutant having the N-terminal helix fixed to the protein core by a disulfide bond. The kinetics of membrane binding derived from the SPR experiments could be fitted to a two-stage binding model. Finally, by using membrane-embedded quenchers, we showed that EqtII does not insert deeply in the membrane. The first step of the EqtII binding is reminiscent of the binding of the evolutionarily distant cholesterol-dependant cytolysins, which share a similar structural motif in the membrane attachment domain.

Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which bind to membranes before eliciting their toxic effects via the formation of transmembrane pores. The most studied PFT are bacterial since this group includes important virulence factors. Few examples of eukaryotic PFT have been well characterized, exceptions being the actinoporins, cytolysins found exclusively in sea anemones (10Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Kem W.R. Hessinger D.A. Lenhoff H.M. The Biology of the Nematocyst. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 375-405Google Scholar). Members of this family have properties distinct from other PFT: they are composed of 175–179 amino acids, contain no cysteine residues, have pI>9.5, and show a preference for sphingomyelin (SM)-containing membranes. Actinoporins act on cellular and model lipid membranes by forming cation-selective pores with a hydrodynamic diameter of ∼2 nm. The mechanism of pore formation involves at least two steps: binding of the water soluble monomer to the membrane; and subsequent oligomerization of three to four monomers on the surface of the membrane, leading to the formation of a functional pore (10Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,12Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The number of monomers in the final pore was deduced from cross-linking (12Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and kinetic experiments (16Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amphiphilic α-helix, which is well conserved in actinoporins, has been proposed to participate in formation of the transmembrane channel (17Anderluh G. Pungerčar J. Križaj I. Štrukelj B. Gubenšek F. Maček P. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Biomembr. 1994; 1192: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggestion was recently supported by crystal and NMR structures of equinatoxin II, an actinoporin isolated from the sea anemone Actinia equina (EqtII) (20Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure. 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Hinds M.G. Zhang W. Anderluh G. Hansen P.E. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The EqtII molecule is composed of a hydrophobic β-sandwich core, flanked on each side by α-helices. The first 30 N-terminal residues, including the amphiphilic helix, form the largest segment of the molecule able to adopt a different structure without disrupting the general fold of the molecule. Another interesting feature of the structure is a cluster of exposed aromatic amino acid residues on the surface of the molecule, comprising Tyr-108, Trp-112, Tyr-113, Trp-116, Tyr-133, Tyr-137, and Tyr-138 (Fig. 1 B). These are likely to have a role in membrane recognition and binding since aromatic residues have been shown to have affinity for the lipid-water interface (22Killian J.A. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 429-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 23Kennedy M.W. Beauchamp J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). These observations led to our current hypothesis for EqtII pore formation, which proposes that the toxin initially binds the membrane via the aromatic cluster. In the next step the N-terminal helix translocates from the surface of the β-sandwich to the membrane and, finally, traverses the lipid bilayer forming the cation-selective pore. The actinoporins have no obvious sequence similarity to any other proteins. Structural similarity (with very low sequence similarity) was observed with thaumatin and the fourth (C-terminal) domain of perfringolysin O (PFO) (20Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure. 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These proteins are rich in β-sheet, and their similarity to EqtII is confined within the β-sandwich region (Fig. 1 A). PFO is a representative of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) group of toxins (25Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a 500-residue protein composed of four domains (Fig. 1 A) (26Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). It can form huge pores with a diameter of up to 150 nm, made up of more than 30 monomers. PFO attaches to membranes via domain 4, which contains an undecapeptide sequence (458ECTGLAWEWWR468) extremely conserved among different members of CDC (25Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Heuck A.P. Hotze E.M. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and similar to the EqtII tryptophan-rich region (110YNWYSNWW117). Tryptophans within the undecapeptide motif were shown to have a role in membrane attachment (28Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these tryptophans are not transferred deeply into the lipid bilayer according to fluorescence results using membrane embedded quenchers (27Heuck A.P. Hotze E.M. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although the final steps of pore-formation are different in the two groups of toxins (10Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,25Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the initial membrane interaction might be similar due to similarities both in the structure of the membrane binding domain and the presence of exposed tryptophans. In this work we report the results of studies on the molecular details of the binding of EqtII to model membranes using a range of mutants and biophysical approaches. We show that the most important region for the membrane binding is the aromatic cluster. The mutation of exposed Trp-112 and Trp-116 to phenylalanine significantly reduced binding as viewed by monolayer and SPR experiments. Furthermore, by creating an engineered disulfide bridge, which prevented dislocation of the helix from the body of the molecule, we were able to distinguish between the two binding steps: initial binding to the membranes and insertion into the membrane of the N-terminal helix. The latter provides additional contacts with the membrane and leads to a largely irreversible insertion. According to the fluorescence results, EqtII does not insert deeply in the bilayer. The initial binding step of EqtII is reminiscent of the CDC toxins, thus there exists not only structural, but also functional similarity between the two groups of otherwise unrelated toxins. Brain Sphingomyelin (SM) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) was from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). Brominated lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(9,10)-dibromo- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) was purchased from Fluka. Thiolipids, DP-mercapto-PA (O-(8′-mercapto-3′,6′-dioxaoctyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid), were a gift from Horst Vogel (Lausanne, Switzerland) (29Lang H. Duschl C. Vogel H.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Octyl-POE was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). All other materials were from Sigma, unless specified differently. Wild-type EqtII was isolated from the sea anemones as described earlier (31Maček P. Lebez D. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All EqtII mutants (S114C, V8C/K69C, and tryptophan mutants W116F, W112F* (Trp-45 and Trp-149 were mutated to Phe in addition to Trp-112), and W112.116F) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis as explained earlier (18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,32Anderluh G.

Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They were purified from the Escherichia colicytoplasm exactly as described in (34Anderluh G. Pungerčar J. Štrukelj B. Maček P. Gubenšek F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The fusion between the third domain of TolA (E. coli periplasmic protein) and EqtII was expressed in E .coli by the use of pTolT plasmid. 2G. Anderluh, manuscript in preparation. In this system, the third domain of the E. coli periplasmic TolA protein (amino acids 329–421 of SwissProt P19934) was linked to EqtII by a short flexible linker containing a thrombin cleavage site (GGGSLVPR). The fusion protein also contains six added histidines at the N terminus. Pure protein was prepared from the bacterial cytoplasm by a single purification step using Ni-nitrilotetraacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) (Fig. 3 D) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Specific absorption coefficients were calculated according to the method of Perkins (35Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). They are 1.35 for W112F*, 1.64 for W112.116F, 1.92 for W116F, 1.51 for TolAIII-EqtII fusion, and 2.21 for the wild type and all other mutants. S114C was biotinylated as previously described (18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Excess biotin was removed on a 0.5 × 3 cm Sephadex G-15 column. Pooled active fractions were incubated with avidin (1:1, w/w) for ∼1 h. The mixture was applied to a cation exchange column (SigmaChrom IEX-S, Supelco), and proteins were eluted with a gradient of salt. Biotinylated S114C bound to avidin was resolved as a single peak with a retention time different from biotinylated S114C alone and avidin. Pooled fractions were concentrated using Amicon ultrafilters (Amicon, Millipore). The protein concentration of EqtII-avidin complex was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Hemolytic activity was measured turbidimetrically as reported previously (36Maček P. Lebez D. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine red blood cells were extensively washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (erythrocyte buffer). Toxins were added to a suspension of erythrocytes with A 700 = 0.5 at a final concentration of 3.8 nm, and the decrease in absorbance was followed for 30 min at room temperature. Time needed to achieve A 700 = 0.250,t 50, was determined from the obtained traces. For the erythrocyte binding assays, 0.15 nmol of protein were incubated with 200 μl of bovine red blood cell suspension in erythrocyte buffer with 30 mm polyethylene glycol 3350 (A 700 = 1.0). After 10 min of incubation on ice, erythrocytes with bound toxins were pelleted at 4 °C at 12,000 × g for 5 min using a benchtop centrifuge (Sigma, model 3K30). Supernatant was removed, and electrophoresis buffer was added to the pelleted erythrocytes. No additional washing steps were employed, as proteins were fully bound under these conditions and no nonspecifically bound proteins could be removed with subsequent washes (not shown). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–25% gels using a PHAST system (AmershamBiosciences). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) and blotted with rabbit anti-EqtII serum for 2 h. Bands were stained with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole/H2O2. Membranes were scanned using a commercial scanner, and the intensity of the bands (bound proteins) was estimated using Tina 2.0 software and expressed as a fraction of total applied protein. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared as described previously (33Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, chloroform was removed from the desired lipid mixture by the rotary evaporator. Vesicle buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) was added to the lipid film, and the suspension was vigorously vortex-mixed in the presence of the glass beads. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were converted to SUV by sonication (MSE 150 watts ultrasonic disintegrator) of suspension at room temperature. The SUV suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove titanium particles released from the probe. Supernatant was stored at 4 °C for up to 2 days before use. Fluorescence measurements were performed on Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Unless stated otherwise, measurements were performed at 25 °C in vesicle buffer (see above). To 250 nm EqtII appropriate amounts of SUVs with or without quencher were added and tryptophan emission spectra were recorded from 310–400 nm at 125 nm/min, with excitation and emission slits set at 5 nm. Excitation wavelength was 295 nm. The intensities were corrected for the dilution factor, and the background was subtracted using appropriate blanks with SUV only. Quenching efficiency, E, for quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by bromine was calculated using the integrated area under the spectrum as in Equation 1, E=1−(Fq/F0)Equation 1 where Fq and F0 are, respectively, the values in the presence and absence of the quencher. The fluorescence was integrated between 310–400 nm. The leakage of encapsulated solutes was assayed as described (37Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) prepared as described in Caaveiro et al. (38Caaveiro J.M.M. Echabe I. Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Nieva J.L. Arrondo J.L.R. González-Mañas J.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1343-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were loaded with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6,-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) andp-xylene-bis-pyridiniumbromide (DPX) (both from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Toxins (final 0.67 μmconcentration) were added under constant stirring to the probe-loaded LUVs (at a final 0.1 mm lipid concentration, 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 at 25 °C) to reach a lipid/toxin (L/T) ratio of 150. Changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS-50 spectrofluorometer (Beaconsfield, UK) with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 355 and 530 nm, respectively. An interference filter with a nominal cutoff value of 475 nm was placed in the emission light path to minimize the scattered-light contribution of the vesicles to the fluorescence signal. The percentage of leakage was calculated after all the fluorescent probe was released by the addition of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. Surface pressure measurements were carried out with a MicroTrough S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) at 25 °C and under constant stirring. The aqueous phase consisted of 1.1 ml of 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The lipid, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), was gently spread over the surface and until the desired initial surface pressure was attained. The protein was injected with a Hamilton microsyringe through a hole connected to the subphase. The final protein concentration in the Langmuir trough was 1 μm. The increment in surface pressure versustime was recorded until a stable signal was obtained. A J1 chip (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was cleaned by a freshly made piranha solution (concentrated H2SO4 to which 27.5% H2O2 was added in a ratio of 7:3) for 10 min, extensively washed with water and ethanol and finally dried in the stream of N2. The cleaned chip was docked into the Biacore system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), primed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and equilibrated with running buffer until a stable baseline was achieved. β-mercaptoethanol, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, was passed over the gold surface for 20 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. After a 1-min wash with 0.05% SDS, the thiolipids (0.4 mg/ml), diluted in 1% octyl-POE solution, were injected over the sensor surface for 5 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The prepared thiolipid surface was then washed by a 1-min injection of 0.05% SDS at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. This restricted assembly resulted in 10–20% of the surface being covered with thiolipids. A suspension of SUV was then injected over the chip for 20 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. A spontaneously assembled lipid bilayer was formed, tethered by the previously immobilized thiolipids randomly inserted in the β-mercaptoethanol monolayer (Fig. 2 A). Loosely bound lipids (possibly multiple bilayers) were removed by three 1-min injections of water and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline running buffer with a faster flow rate of 100 μl/min. A stable baseline was then achieved. Binding of the EqtII and mutants to the membrane was measured by injecting a defined concentration of EqtII over the surface followed by a desorption step in the absence of EqtII. In some cases any remaining bound protein was then washed three times with a high salt buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 m NaCl). The reported response values (Fig.2 B) were determined at this stage, i.e. the amount of stably incorporated protein. Similar binding experiments were carried out in a high salt phosphate-buffered saline running buffer, but without subsequent washes. At the end of each measurement the thiolipid chip was regenerated by few washes of 0.5% SDS, which removed the membranes along with bound proteins (Fig. 2 B). When the baseline of the sensorgram returned to the previous level of a mixed β-mercaptoethanol-thiolipid monolayer, a new tethered bilayer was created by the injection of SUV of the required lipid composition for the next binding experiment. A model of EqtII binding to the lipid bilayer can be established with the scheme (Fig. 2 A) as in Equation 2, where T corresponds to the EqtII, L corresponds to the lipid bilayer, TL is the complex of EqtII-lipid on the surface of the bilayer, and TL* is the deeply bound complex. The initial condition and the rate equations of the binding at timet = 0 are: [T] = C, (the concentration of injected EqtII), [TL] = 0, [TL*] = 0. At time t =t, we have Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5. d[L]dt=−ka1[T][L]+kd1[TL]Equation 3 d[TL]dt=(ka1[T][L]−kd1[TL])−(ka2[TL]−kd2[TL*])Equation 4 d[TL*]dt=ka2[TL]−kd2[TL*]Equation 5 These equations are solved for the rate constantsk a and k d using Biacore evaluation software version 3.0.

J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the two parts of the EqtII molecule likely to interact with the membrane are the N-terminal amphiphilic helix and the tryptophan-rich cluster in the middle of the polypeptide chain. Our working hypothesis is that EqtII first attaches to the membrane via the tryptophan-rich cluster thus providing additional contacts with the membrane and secondly transfers its N-terminal helix into the lipid bilayer thus creating the walls of the transmembrane pore. Here we show the role and importance of these two parts in the pore-forming process by using different constructs to block individual stages in the pore formation (Fig. 3 A). In particular, the binding to red blood cells and hemolytic activity were checked. These two represent the first part (binding to erythrocytes membranes) and the last part of the hemolytic process (formation of functional pores). We first tried to block the binding of EqtII to the membranes by attaching a large protein in the vicinity of the aromatic cluster. Binding should be sterically prevented and, consequently, no lysis of erythrocytes should be observed. To this end, mutant S114C was biotinylated and complexed with avidin. Ser-114, which has been shown to interact with membranes (18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is located in the middle of the tryptophan-rich cluster on the exposed loop connecting β-sheets 7 and 8. Avidin does not associate nonspecifically with the wild-type EqtII (18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J.

Membrane binding of the complex was strongly inhibited, only 6% of the total applied bound to erythrocyte membranes (Fig. 3, C and F). In comparison, 92 and 85% of native EqtII and biotinylated S114C, respectively, were bound under the experimental conditions employed. Consequently, we could not measure any hemolytic activity of the EqtII-avidin complex. Minor residual binding of the complex observed on the blot might be due to the interaction of the free N-terminal helix with the"
https://openalex.org/W2015166032,"Physical interaction between transient receptor potential (Trp) channels and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) has been presented as a candidate mechanism for the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry. The role of a human homologue of Drosophila transient receptor potential channel, hTrp1, in the conduction of store-mediated Ca2+ entry was examined in human platelets. Incubation of platelets with a specific antibody, which recognizes the extracellular amino acid sequence 557–571 of hTrp1, inhibited both store depletion-induced Ca2+ and Mn2+ entry in a concentration-dependent manner. Stimulation of platelets with the physiological agonist thrombin activated coupling between the IP3 receptor type II and endogenously expressed hTrp1. This event was reversed by refilling of the internal Ca2+ stores but maintained after removal of the agonist if the stores were not allowed to refill. Inhibition of IP3 recycling using Li+ or inhibition of IP3Rs with xestospongin C or treatment with jasplakinolide, to stabilize the cortical actin filament network, abolished thrombin-induced coupling between hTrp1 and IP3R type II. Incubation with the anti-hTrp1 antibody inhibited thrombin-evoked Ca2+ entry without affecting Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. These results provide evidence for the involvement of hTrp1 in the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry by coupling to IP3R type II in normal human cells. Physical interaction between transient receptor potential (Trp) channels and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) has been presented as a candidate mechanism for the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry. The role of a human homologue of Drosophila transient receptor potential channel, hTrp1, in the conduction of store-mediated Ca2+ entry was examined in human platelets. Incubation of platelets with a specific antibody, which recognizes the extracellular amino acid sequence 557–571 of hTrp1, inhibited both store depletion-induced Ca2+ and Mn2+ entry in a concentration-dependent manner. Stimulation of platelets with the physiological agonist thrombin activated coupling between the IP3 receptor type II and endogenously expressed hTrp1. This event was reversed by refilling of the internal Ca2+ stores but maintained after removal of the agonist if the stores were not allowed to refill. Inhibition of IP3 recycling using Li+ or inhibition of IP3Rs with xestospongin C or treatment with jasplakinolide, to stabilize the cortical actin filament network, abolished thrombin-induced coupling between hTrp1 and IP3R type II. Incubation with the anti-hTrp1 antibody inhibited thrombin-evoked Ca2+ entry without affecting Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. These results provide evidence for the involvement of hTrp1 in the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry by coupling to IP3R type II in normal human cells. store-mediated calcium entry transient receptor potential human Trp inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor d-Phe-Pro-Arg-choromethylketone dihydrochloride thapsigargin ionomycin xestospongin C jasplakinolide HEPES-buffered saline plasma membrane Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 control antigen peptide bis(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid fluorescein isothiocyanate Cytosolic Ca2+ is a ubiquitous modulator of a large number of cellular processes such as contraction, secretion, cell growth, and cell death (for example, Ref. 1Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Elevations in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) can be mediated by release of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ stores and entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane (2Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). In nonexcitable cells, store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE),1 a mechanism regulated by the filling state of the intracellular Ca2+stores, is a major pathway for Ca2+ influx (4Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 5Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1997; 82: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the activation and maintenance of SMCE is not fully understood, and two main questions still remain: elucidation of the mechanism of activation of SMCE after depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores and identification of the channel that mediates extracellular Ca2+ entry. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the activation of SMCE, which fall into two main categories: those suggesting a diffusible messenger that gates plasma membrane channels and those suggesting a conformational coupling between elements in the endoplasmic reticulum (possibly the IP3 receptors) and the plasma membrane (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 6Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Recently, a modification of the conformational coupling model has been proposed to operate in several cell types. This “secretion-like coupling model” is based on the trafficking and coupling of portions of the endoplasmic reticulum with the plasma membrane, where the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role (7Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

Studies aiming to identify the channels involved in the conduction of SMCE have focused attention on human homologues ofDrosophila transient receptor potential (Trp) channels (see Ref. 6Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided evidence that relates Trp proteins to SMCE channels. Functional expression of Trp proteins enhances SMCE in several mammalian cells, including COS cells (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M.J. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) and human salivary gland cells (11Liu X.B. Wang W.C. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A second argument for Trp channels mediating SMCE is provided by antisense studies showing interference with the expression of trp sequences affects the activation of SMCE (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M.J. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Human platelets have been shown to express mRNA for Trp1 and its splice variant Trp1A (12den Dekker E. Molin D.G. Breikers G. van Oerle R. Akkerman J.W. van Eys G.J. Heemskerk J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, Trp1 proteins have been detected in platelets using an anti-hTrp1 antibody specific for the amino acid residues 557–571 (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both Trp1 and Trp1A have been shown to form non-selective cation channels regulated by store depletion in a number of expression systems (14Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Hartneck C. Kalkbrenner F.

J. 1998; 331: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In agreement with the conformational coupling hypothesis, functional IP3receptors (IP3Rs) have been shown to be required for the activation of SMCE (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In human platelets, this coupling is activated by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We report here that physiological agonists also stimulate coupling of IP3 receptors to hTrp1 in human platelets and that incubation with anti-Trp1 antibody resulted in a dramatic decrease in agonist- or store depletion-evoked Ca2+ entry, providing strong evidence for the involvement of Trp1 in the SMCE in normal human cells. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) was from Texas Fluorescence (Austin, TX). Apyrase (grade VII), aspirin, bovine serum albumin, paraformaldehyde, Nonidet P-40, thrombin, HISTOPAQUE-1119, HISTOPAQUE-1077, and thapsigargin (TG) were from Sigma. Xestospongin C (Xest C), ionomycin (Iono), andd-Phe-Pro-Arg-choromethylketone dihydrochloride (PPACK) were from Calbiochem. Dimethyl bis(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA), acetoxymethyl ester, and jasplakinolide (JP) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Anti-hTrp1 polyclonal antibody and control antigen peptide were obtained from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). T1E3 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. David J. Beech (School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Leeds, UK). FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody, anti-IP3R type II polyclonal antibody (C-20), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody and anti-mouse IgG antibody were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Experiments were carried out on human blood platelets or peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers with local ethical committee approval. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g and aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (40 μg/ml) added as described previously (21Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained by gradient density centrifugation using HISTOPAQUE-1119 and 1077 Medium (22Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 9-29PubMed Google Scholar). Fura-2-loaded platelets, co-loaded with dimethyl BAPTA when required, were prepared as described previously (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.45, and supplemented with 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase. Fluorescence was recorded from 200-μl aliquots of platelet suspension (108cells/ml) at 37 °C using a Cairn Research Spectrophotometer (Cairn Research Ltd., Sittingbourne, Kent, UK) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340-nm/380-nm fluorescence ratio and calibrated in terms of [Ca2+]i (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mn2+ influx was monitored as a quenching of fura-2 fluorescence at the isoemissive wavelength, 360 nm, presented on an arbitrary linear scale (24Sage S.O. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thrombin-evoked Ca2+ influx was estimated as the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i above basal for 150 s after addition of thrombin in the presence of external Ca2+, corrected by subtraction of the integral over the same period of stimulation in the absence of external Ca2+(with 100 μm EGTA). When SMCE was stimulated after store depletion using TG, Ca2+ influx was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 150 s after addition of CaCl2. Sr2+ was used to monitor non-capacitative cation entry to avoid complications arising from stimulation of the platelet plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase by thrombin (25Rink T.J. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 393: 513-524Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) since Sr2+ is carried with lower affinity than Ca2+ by the platelet plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (26Graf E. Verma A.K. Gorski J.P. Lopaschuk G. Niggli V. Zurini M. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4511-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sr2+ entry was determined in Ca2+-free HBS containing EGTA (100 μm) to minimize the effects of contaminating Ca2+. Cytosolic Sr2+ was monitored using the fura-2 340-nm/380-nm fluorescence ratio. Samples of platelet suspension (200 μl; 2 × 108 cells/ml) were transferred to 200 μl of ice-cold 3% (w/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h with 1 μg/ml anti-hTrp1 antibody. The platelets were then collected by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.62 mmNa2HPO4, 1.09 mmNaH2PO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, and supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. To detect the primary antibody, samples were incubated with 0.02 μg/ml FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were excited at 496 nm, and emission was at 516 nm. When permeabilized platelets were required, the cells were incubated for 10 min with 0.025% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 detergent. 500-μl aliquots of platelet suspension (2 × 109 cell/ml) were lysed with an equal volume of lysis buffer, pH 7.2, containing 316 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% SDS, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm benzamidine. Aliquots (1 ml) were then immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2 μg of anti-hTrp1 polyclonal antibody (Alomone), 2 μg of T1E3 polyclonal antibody, or 3 μg of anti-IP3R type II polyclonal antibody and protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection of hTrp1 or IP3R type II was achieved using the anti-hTrp1 or T1E3 antibodies diluted 1:200 or 1:600 in TBST, respectively, or with anti-IP3RII diluted 1:500 in TBST for 3 h. To detect the primary antibody, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TBST, washed six times in TBST, and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 1 min. Blots were then exposed to preflashed photographic film. For reprobing, membranes were incubated for 30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 65.5 mm Tris, and 2% SDS, pH 6.7. Membranes were then washed and Western blotting was performed as described previously. Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance combined with the Dunnett test was used. Recent studies have reported expression of hTrp1 mRNA in human platelets and megakaryocytes (12den Dekker E. Molin D.G. Breikers G. van Oerle R. Akkerman J.W. van Eys G.J. Heemskerk J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using a commercial antibody that specifically recognizes the sequence hTrp1557–571, which is present only in hTrp1 and not in other reported hTrp proteins (27Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a single protein band of ∼100 kDa displayed reactivity toward the antibody in human platelets (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and2) (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The specificity of the commercial antibody was tested with the anti-Trp1 antibody T1E3, which has been shown to be a specific and powerful tool in the investigation of mammalian Trp1 proteins (28Xu S.Z. Beech D.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, after immunoprecipitation with the commercial antibody, T1E3 displayed reactivity toward exactly the same protein band, suggesting that both antibodies specifically recognize Trp1 in human platelets. Both antibodies recognized comparable amounts of Trp1 in either resting or store-depleted platelets (Fig. 1 A; n = 4). To further investigate whether these antibodies specifically recognized the same protein, both antibodies were used on the same samples. As shown in Fig. 1 A, after immunoprecipitation with the commercial antibody, probing with the same antibody revealed reactivity against a protein band of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Reprobing with the T1E3 antibody revealed reactivity toward the same protein (Fig. 1 C). Proteins in this or other molecular mass ranges were not detected in human peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.1 D, lanes 2 and 3), where hTrp1 mRNA expression has not been detected (29Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores using thapsigargin stimulates coupling between endogenously expressed hTrp1 and the IP3R type II in human platelets independently of rises in [Ca2+]i (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A (lanes 5 and 6), immunoprecipitation with anti-IP3R type II followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with T1E3 confirmed de novocoupling between hTrp1 and IP3R type II when the intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted using TG. To investigate the physiological significance of this coupling, the effect of thrombin was investigated. Normal platelets or platelets loaded with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator dimethyl BAPTA were stimulated with 0.1 units/ml thrombin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (100 μm EGTA was added) and lysed 3 min later. Control platelets were compared with cells heavily loaded with the Ca2+ chelator dimethyl BAPTA so as to differentiate between Ca2+- and store depletion-dependent responses (30Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 79: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that dimethyl BAPTA loading prevents thrombin-evoked [Ca2+]ielevations (9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation with anti-hTrp1 antibody, Western blotting revealed the presence of IP3R type II in samples from thrombin-treated but not resting platelets (Fig.2 A, upper panel;n = 4). Thrombin-induced coupling between hTrp1 and IP3R type II was independent of elevations in [Ca2+]i since it was also observed in dimethyl BAPTA-loaded platelets. Western blotting with anti-hTrp1 confirmed a similar content of this protein in all lanes (Fig. 2 A,lower panel). We also conducted converse experiments, immunoprecipitating platelet lysates with the anti-IP3R type II antibody and detecting for the presence of hTrp1. Consistent with the above results, after immunoprecipitation with anti-IP3R type II, hTrp1 was detected in samples from thrombin-treated but not resting cells (Fig.2 B, upper panel; n = 4). Again, thrombin evoked coupling in both control and dimethyl BAPTA-loaded platelets. To investigate whether the coupling between IP3RII and hTrp1 is disassembled by removal of thrombin, we have performed a series of experiments in which, after platelet stimulation with thrombin, the agonist was washed away. In HBS containing 1 mm Ca2+, thrombin (0.1 units/ml) evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i in platelets (Fig.3 A, part i) due to release of Ca2+ from the stores and Ca2+ entry. However, after removal of thrombin and incubation of the cells in HBS (1 mm Ca2+ added to allow refilling of the stores), Ca2+ entry was inactivated (Fig. 3 A,part ii). Consistent with this, we found that IP3RII and hTrp1 couple in response to thrombin stimulation, whereas removal of the agonist under conditions that allow refilling of the Ca2+ stores clearly reversed the extent of coupling (Fig. 3 A, part iii). If, after stimulation with thrombin, the agonist was washed away and, in the absence of added Ca2+, the thrombin antagonist PPACK (1 μm, sufficient to completely block any rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by 0.1 units/ml thrombin) was added to inactivate residual traces of the agonist, the coupling was maintained (Fig. 3 A, part iii). We have shown previously that store depletion-induced Ca2+entry and coupling requires both IP3 and activation of IP3Rs and is blocked by stabilization of the cortical actin filaments (9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To examine whether the mechanism of activation of the coupling between IP3RII and hTrp1 by thrombin has the same requirements, we investigated the role of IP3 and IP3R activation by using Li+ or the inhibitor of IP3R function Xest C. As reported previously (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), treatment of human platelets for 30 min with 20 μm Xest C or for 2 h with 10 mm Li+ abolished thrombin-evoked release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. As shown in Fig. 3 B, incubation of human platelets with Xest C or Li+ completely blocked the coupling between IP3RII and hTrp1. These findings confirm that IP3 and functional IP3RII are required for the coupling with the hTrp1 protein. To assess the role of the cortical actin filaments in thrombin-induced coupling between IP3RII and hTrp1, we investigated the effect of JP. We have reported previously that JP reduced thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry without affecting Ca2+ release from the stores (32Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 159-169Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, treatment of human platelets with 10 μm JP for 30 min abolished the coupling between IP3RII and hTrp1 induced by thrombin (Fig. 3 C). The commercial antibody used to perform the majority of our studies specifically recognizes the peptide sequence QLYDKGYTSKEQKDC, which corresponds to the amino acid residues 557–571 of the human hTrp1 protein. This antibody has been shown to be effective in Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunolocalization studies (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J.

Physiol. 283,L144–L155.Google Scholar). The sequence 557–571 has been shown to be located between the transmembrane domains 5 and 6; thus, it would be expected to be located at the external face of the PM (29Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 35Zhu X. Chu P.B. Peyton M. Birnbaumer L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To further investigate the location of the epitope recognized by the anti-hTrp1 antibody, we performed a series of immunofluorescence experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of fixed, non-permeabilized platelets in suspension with 1 μg/ml anti-hTrp1 antibody followed by detection using a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody revealed the presence of hTrp1 proteins in the platelet membranes (Fig. 4, column b;n = 4), indicating that the epitope is located extracellularly. The fluorescence observed was not due to nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody as demonstrated by the lower fluorescence detected in samples incubated with this antibody alone (Fig. 4, column a; n = 4). The increase in fluorescence detected after incubation with the anti-hTrp1 antibody was almost completely prevented when the antibody was incubated previously for 1 h in the presence of the control antigen peptide (CAP) (1 μg/ml; Fig. 4, column e; n = 4), confirming the antibody specificity. To investigate whether store depletion induced increased expression of the hTrp1 protein in the PM, we repeated the experimental protocol using TG-treated cells. Treatment of human platelets with 200 nm TG for 3 min in a Ca2+-free medium slightly increased the detection of hTrp1 in the membrane; however, this rise was not significant (Fig. 4,column c; p = 0.39; n = 4). Similar results were obtained when the studies were performed in cells permeabilized with the detergent Nonidet P-40, confirming that the anti-hTrp1 antibody recognizes an epitope located on the external face of the PM (Fig. 4, column d; p = 0.49;n = 4). Since the sequence 557–571 is located in the pore-forming region between the fifth transmembrane domain and region VII of hTrp1 (29Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 30Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 79: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the antibody to this sequence could block channel function. To assess this, human platelet suspensions were incubated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of the anti-hTrp1 antibody (1.5–15 μg/ml) followed by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores using TG to activate SMCE. In a Ca2+-free medium, TG evoked a prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i in platelets due to leakage of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ (300 μm) to the external medium induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, indicative of SMCE (Fig. 5 A). Incubation with the anti-hTrp1 antibody for 10 min significantly reduced SMCE by 34 ± 3, 46 ± 3, 60 ± 2, and 76 ± 2% (n = 4) at concentrations of 1.5, 5, 10, and 15 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 5 B; p < 0.01). The effect of the highest concentration used in this study (15 μg/ml) was prevented when the antibody was incubated previously for 1 h in the presence of the CAP (15 μg/ml). To investigate the specificity of this assay, the effect of incubation with an antibody directed to a protein not related to hTrp proteins or any other platelet protein was tested. Incubation of platelets for 10 min in the presence of 15 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG antibody following the protocol used for the anti-hTrp1 antibody was unable to block TG-induced Ca2+entry either in the absence or presence of the CAP (15 μg/ml; Fig.5 C; n = 3). SMCE has been widely demonstrated to occur through non-selective cation channels (see Ref. 24Sage S.O. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, we have used Mn2+ to evaluate the effect of incubation with anti-hTrp1 antibody on TG-evoked divalent cation entry. This cation can be used as a surrogate for Ca2+ entry given its quenching effect on fura-2 fluorescence at the isoemissive wavelength, 360 nm (24Sage S.O. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Addition of Mn2+ (300 μm) to platelets with TG-depleted intracellular Ca2+ stores resulted in a sustained quenching of fluorescence (Fig. 5 D, trace a) as compared with undepleted cells (Fig. 5 D, trace f). When platelets were incubated for 10 min with anti-hTrp1 antibody, Mn2+ entry was attenuated. The initial rate of Mn2+-evoked fluorescence quenching in platelets incubated with the antibody and then treated with TG was significantly decreased to 85 ± 4, 67 ± 4, 54 ± 4, and 33 ± 7% (n = 4) of the initial rate observed in cells treated with TG alone, at concentrations of 1.5, 5, 10, and 15 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 5 D; p < 0.01) These results indicate that the anti-hTrp1 antibody blocked divalent cation entry in human platelets in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 6,A and B, incubation of fura-2-loaded human platelets for 10 min with 15 μg/ml anti-hTrp1 antibody resulted in a substantial inhibition of the elevation in [Ca2+]i evoked by the physiological agonist thrombin (0.05 units/ml) in medium containing 1 mmCa2+ (n = 4; p < 0.001). In contrast, incubation with 15 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG antibody did not interfere with thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry (Fig.6 C; n = 3). Since we have recently demonstrated that thrombin is able to activate non-capacitative cation entry in platelets (32Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 159-169Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we used a low concentration of the agonist (0.05 units/ml) to reduce this effect and avoid interference with thrombin-evoked store depletion-mediated Ca2+ entry. As shown in Fig. 6 G, trace b, addition of thrombin (0.05 units/ml) to platelets, in which Sr2+ entry had already been stimulated by complete depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores by treatment with TG (1 μm) and Iono (50 nm), was unable to caused a further Sr2+ entry. In contrast, a higher concentration of thrombin (10 units/ml) induced non-capacitative Sr2+ entry (Fig. 6 G, trace a). Preincubation of platelets with 15 μg/ml anti-hTrp1 antibody clearly reduced store depletion-induced Sr2+ entry without affecting non-capacitative Sr2+ entry stimulated by thrombin (10 units/ml; Fig. 6 G, trace c). The nature of the channels involved in the non-capacitative cation entry by thrombin needs further attention. In the absence of external Ca2+ (100 μm EGTA added), incubation with anti-hTrp1 or anti-mouse IgG antibodies did not alter the thrombin-evoked rise in [Ca2+]i, indicating no effect on the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 6, D–F). These findings suggest that this treatment was selectively blocking Ca2+ entry over internal release. If we consider the entry of Ca2+stimulated by thrombin (correcting the signal for the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (see “Experimental Procedures”)), incubation with anti-hTrp1 antibody significantly inhibited thrombin-induced Ca2+ influx by 77 ± 9% (n = 4; p < 0.001). The mechanism that activates SMCE after depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores is not fully understood, and identification of the channels involved in this process would assist in the advancement of knowledge of this signaling mechanism. Recent studies have presented compelling evidence for the involvement of mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Trp channels in SMCE in certain cells (9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Sinkins W.G. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. Biochem.

S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that hTrp1 couples with the IP3R type II in platelets after depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores using TG (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The anti-hTrp1 antibody used in these studies specifically recognizes the sequence hTrp1557–571, which is present in hTrp1 and no other proteins (27Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this antibody, hTrp1 proteins were detected in human platelets, where hTrp1 mRNA expression has been demonstrated previously (12den Dekker E. Molin D.G. Breikers G. van Oerle R. Akkerman J.W. van Eys G.J. Heemskerk J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but not in human leukocytes lacking hTrp1 mRNA expression (29Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that thrombin was able to induce coupling between the IP3R type II and naturally expressed hTrp1 proteins in human platelets. This coupling was reversed by removal of the agonist and, as for store depletion-induced coupling between IP3R type II and hTrp1 proteins, requires IP3 and functional IP3R and some degree of reorganization of the cortical actin barrier. To our knowledge, this is the first time that agonist-stimulated coupling between hTrp proteins and IP3Rs has been reported, suggesting that direct coupling between hTrp1 and IP3R type II is a physiological mechanism by which SMCE could be activated in platelets. Reports that store depletion results in coupling between hTrp1 and IP3R type II in platelets provide only circumstantial evidence for the involvement of hTrp1 in SMCE. Thus, using an antibody that specifically recognizes the amino acid sequence 557–571 of hTrp1, we have further investigated the involvement of hTrp1 in the mediation of SMCE in platelets. Since the sequence 557–571 is located in the pore region of the hTrp1 channel (29Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), one might expect that binding of this antibody to the hTrp1 channel could interfere with its channel function. Our results showing that incubation of platelets with the anti-hTrp1 antibody inhibits Ca2+ entry provide strong evidence for the involvement of hTrp1 proteins in the normal response of platelets to stimuli that increase IP3 levels and activate store-mediated Ca2+ entry. Human platelets express mRNA for hTrp1 and its splice variant hTrp1A (12den Dekker E. Molin D.G. Breikers G. van Oerle R. Akkerman J.W. van Eys G.J. Heemskerk J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both isoforms contain the sequence hTrp1557–571 (12den Dekker E. Molin D.G. Breikers G. van Oerle R. Akkerman J.W. van Eys G.J. Heemskerk J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and therefore are recognized by the antibody used. hTrp1 and hTrp1A have been shown to form non-selective cation channels regulated by store depletion in different expression systems (14Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Hartneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Lückhoff A. Schiltz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 15Sinkins W.G. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whether hTrp1 or hTrp1A forms the channel alone, or whether the Trp cation channel in platelets might be composed of a multisubunit structure due to the formation of homomultimeric or heteromultimeric Trp1-based channels, remains to be resolved. Since the antibody interferes with the entry of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Mn2+, the channel involving hTrp1 in platelets appears to be a non-selective cation channel. Such a non-selective channel may explain earlier reports that TG evokes a rise in cytosolic [Na+] in human platelets (37Kimura M. Lasker N. Aviv A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 464: 1-13Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Ca2+ entry by the anti-hTrp1 antibody occurs as a result of specific binding to the sequence 557–571 since previous incubation of the antibody with the control antigen peptide prevented both detection of the hTrp1 protein in the PM and the interference with Ca2+ entry. The effect of incubation with anti-hTrp1 antibody is not mediated by nonspecific binding of the antibody to different proteins in the PM since the same treatment performed with an antibody not related to Trp or platelet proteins had no effect. These observations demonstrate that the antibody and the vehicle itself are not acting as Ca2+ chelators or affecting any other component of the Ca2+ entry pathway. In addition, incubation of platelets with the anti-hTrp1 antibody did not alter the ability of thrombin to activate its receptor in the PM, as indicated by the lack of effect of this treatment on thrombin-evoked release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. Moreover, anti-hTrp1 antibody-treated cells retained their ability to respond to Ca2+-mobilizing agents such as TG or IP3generated after stimulation with thrombin, which indicates that this treatment did not affect the ability of platelets to store Ca2+ in intracellular stores or release Ca2+from intracellular stores. In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that naturally expressed hTrp1 channels are components of agonist- and store depletion-activated cation entry channels, which participate in the normal response of platelets to physiological stimuli. In agreement with previous studies in several cell types (19Birnbaumer L. Boulay G. Brown D. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Mikoshiba K. Zhu X. Qin N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 127-161PubMed Google Scholar), including platelets (13Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), activation of this channel might require coupling with the IP3 receptor located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, which might be the sensor and transducer of the Ca2+ content in the intracellular stores (38Irvine R.H.

Our results confirm that a common hydrophobic binding interface of KIX is used to bind either pKID or c-Myb.

We analyzed 81 human liver samples by immunoblotting and found one with a strongly reduced amount of SLC21A6 protein suggesting mutations in theSLC21A6 gene. The SLC21A6 cDNA from this sample contained five base pair changes in one allele; three of the mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions designated SLC21A6-N130D, SLC21A6-P155T, and SLC21A6-L193R. The former two were polymorphisms (SLC21A6*1b and SLC21A6*4), whereas SLC21A6-L193R represents the first naturally occurring mutation identified in one allele of the SLC21A6 gene, which affects protein maturation and organic anion transport. We introduced each of the mutations into the SLC21A6 cDNA and established stably transfected MDCKII cells expressing the respective mutant SLC21A6 protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy and uptake measurements were used to study localization and transport properties of the mutated proteins. Both proteins carrying the polymorphisms were sorted to the lateral membrane like wild-type SLC21A6, but their transport properties for the substrates cholyltaurine and 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol were altered. Importantly, most of the mutant protein SLC21A6-L193R was retained intracellularly, and this single amino acid exchange abolished transport function. The organic anion transporter SLC21A6 (also known as OATP2, OATP-C, or LST-1) is involved in the hepatocellular uptake of a variety of endogenous and xenobiotic substances and drugs. We analyzed 81 human liver samples by immunoblotting and found one with a strongly reduced amount of SLC21A6 protein suggesting mutations in theSLC21A6 gene. The SLC21A6 cDNA from this sample contained five base pair changes in one allele; three of the mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions designated SLC21A6-N130D, SLC21A6-P155T, and SLC21A6-L193R. The former two were polymorphisms (SLC21A6*1b and SLC21A6*4), whereas SLC21A6-L193R represents the first naturally occurring mutation identified in one allele of the SLC21A6 gene, which affects protein maturation and organic anion transport. We introduced each of the mutations into the SLC21A6 cDNA and established stably transfected MDCKII cells expressing the respective mutant SLC21A6 protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy and uptake measurements were used to study localization and transport properties of the mutated proteins. Both proteins carrying the polymorphisms were sorted to the lateral membrane like wild-type SLC21A6, but their transport properties for the substrates cholyltaurine and 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol were altered. Importantly, most of the mutant protein SLC21A6-L193R was retained intracellularly, and this single amino acid exchange abolished transport function.

Whereas the apical,i.e. canalicular, membrane of the hepatocyte contains predominantly members of the ABC1 transporter family of export pumps (1Keppler D. König J. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L.

Variations in genes encoding proteins involved in hepatobiliary elimination have long been recognized as important determinants of drug response and disposition. This may be exemplified by single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding members of the cytochrome P450 family, mediating phase I of drug metabolism. Such variations have been described to alter drug responsiveness and drug toxicity and may be associated with a loss of therapeutic efficacy (12Meyer U.A. Zanger U.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 13Rodrigues A.D. Rushmore T.H. Curr.

In addition, polymorphisms in conjugation enzymes of the phase II reactions have been discussed as reasons for interindividual variability in drug metabolism (15Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). More recently, polymorphisms in genes encoding transport proteins involved in detoxification have become of interest for studies on drug metabolism. Polymorphisms in the human ABC B1 (MDR1) gene encoding the drug resistance-related MDR1 P-glycoprotein have been linked to alterations in fexofenadine (16Kim R.B. Leake B.F. Choo E.F. Dresser G.K.

So far, little is known about polymorphisms in genes encoding uptake transporters. Tirona et al.described the identification of polymorphisms in the SLC21A6gene, their prevalence in different populations, and their consequences for substrate transport (18Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35669-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Most recently, Nozawa et al., (19Nozawa T. Nakajima M. Tamai I. Noda K. Nezu J. Sai Y. Tsuji A. Yokoi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) analyzed the allelic frequency of polymorphisms in theSLC21A6 and the SLC21A9 genes in the Japanese population. Up to now, no information had been available on mutations in uptake transporter genes causing a loss of transport function. In this work, we identified and characterized a haplotype of theSLC21A6 gene encoding a mutant protein of the SLC21A6 transporter. This haplotype contains five base pair exchanges resulting in three amino acid substitutions. One of these substitutions is the first naturally occurring mutation in the SLC21A6 gene leading to impaired protein maturation and insertion into the plasma membrane. We examined the consequences of each of the three amino acid substitutions with respect to cellular localization of the protein and to the transport characteristics in comparison with wild-type SLC21A6. Human liver tissue was obtained from patients of Caucasian origin undergoing liver resection at the Department of Surgery, Campus Virchow-Clinic, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany (20Lang T. Klein K. Fischer J. Nussler A.K. Neuhaus P. Hofmann U. Eichelbaum M. Schwab M. Zanger U.M. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Liver pieces were immediately placed into RNAlater (Ambion, Huntington, UK) for DNA and RNA preparation, incubated for 24 h at 4 °C, and then stored frozen at –80 °C until DNA or RNA preparation. In addition, a liver wedge biopsy was obtained from a subset of these patients and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent. Pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, agar, fetal calf serum, and the protein standard mixture (relative molecular weight of 26,600–180,000) for the SDS-PAGE were from Sigma. RNase inhibitor (RNasin), StrataScript Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, TaqDNA polymerase, and restriction enzymes were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Lysozyme and ampicillin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; agarose was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). The EAG5 antibody was raised in rabbits against the human apical conjugate export pump MRP2 (ABCC2) (21Büchler M. König J. Brom M. Kartenbeck J. Spring H. Horie T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15091-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody ESL was raised against the C terminus, and the monoclonal antibodies mMDQ and mESL against the N-terminal and C-terminal end of the human SLC21A6 protein, respectively (6König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody against desmoplakin (mixture) was purchased from Progen (Heidelberg, Germany). Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). A cDNA fragment covering the entire coding region of the human SLC21A6 gene was amplified using single-stranded cDNA synthesized with SLC21A6-S2 total RNA as template. In detail, 2 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using 2.5 μg of oligo(dT)18 primer as described (22Schaub T.P. Kartenbeck J. König J. Vogel O. Witzgall R. Kriz W. Keppler D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PCR amplification the following primer pair was used: oOATP2–5′.for (5′-TTGTTTCAAACTGACCATCAACAAC–3′, bp –58 to –34) and the reverse primer oOATP2-RT.rev (5′-AACAATGTGTTTCACTATCTGCC-3′, bp 2052 to 2074) with the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. Amplified cDNA fragments (2132 bp) were cloned into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit from AmershamBiosciences and α-35S-labeled dATP according to the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al.(23Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR-2 films (Sigma). This amplification yielded two different plasmids, one (pSLC21A6.TOPO-WT) with an insert corresponding to the wild-type SLC21A6cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AJ132573) and one with five mutations within the SLC21A6 cDNA (pSLC21A6.TOPO-M5). For subcloning of the haplotype SLC21A6-M5 cDNA into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen), the plasmid pSLC21A6.TOPO-M5 was digested with BstX I, and theSLC21A6-M5 cDNA fragment was cloned into theBstX I-digested and dephosphorylated vector pcDNA3.1(+), resulting in the plasmid pSLC21A6-M5.31. Finally, the correctness of the restriction sites of the plasmid and the orientation of the inserted cDNA were verified by sequencing. Mutations were introduced into the vector pOATP2.31 (6König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. In detail, the following primer pairs were used: for the SLC21A6-N130D mutation (allele SLC21A6*1b) the forward primer omutN130D.for (5′-GAAACTAATATCGATTCATCAGAAAAT-3′) and the reverse primer omutN130D.rev (5′-ATTTTCTGAATCGATATTAGTTTC-3′); for the mutation SLC21A6-P155T (allele SLC21A6*4) the forward primer omutP155T.for (5′-CAATAGAGCATCAACTGAGATAGTG-3′) and the reverse primer omutP155T.rev (5′-CACTATCTCAGTTGATGCTCTATTG-3′); and for the mutation SLC21A6-L193R the forward primer omutL193R.for (5′-CCACTGGGGCGTTCTTACATTG-3′) and the reverse primer omutL193R.rev (5′-CAATGTAAGAACGCCCCAGTGG-3′). Successful mutagenesis was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. Semiquantitative PCR analysis of SLC21A6mRNA expression in stably transfected MDCKII cells was performed using the LightCycler SystemTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (24Nies A.T. König J. Pfannschmidt M. Klar E. Hofmann W.J. Keppler D. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with the primer pair oOATP2RT.for (5′-TGCACTTGGAGGCACCTCAC-3′) and oOATP2RT.rev (5′-CTTCATCCATGACACTTCCATTT-3′). The mRNA values in transfected cells expressing the mutant SLC21A6 cDNAs are given as percent of the mRNA value in wild-typeSLC21A6-transfected cells. The HUSAR program (25Senger M. Glatting K.H. Ritter O. Suhai S. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1995; 46: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) based on the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group Program Package (26Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) was used during this study for sequence analyses, sequence alignments, and restriction analyses. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells strain II (MDCKII) were cultured in minimum essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MDCKII cells were transfected with the respective plasmids using the polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) method as described earlier (27Cui Y. König J. Buchholz U. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar). After three weeks of G418 selection (800 μm), single colonies were screened for SLC21A6 expression by immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. For immunofluorescence analysis and transport assays, MDCKII cells were grown on Transwell membrane inserts (6.5-mm diameter for immunofluorescence analysis and 24-mm diameter for transport assays, pore size 0.4 μm, Costar, Cambridge, MA) to confluence for three days and induced with 10 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h to obtain higher levels of the recombinant protein (27Cui Y. König J. Buchholz U. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were diluted with sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before their separation on 4% stacking and 10% resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed using a tank blotting system from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primary antibody (pESL, mESL, or mMDQ) was diluted 1:5000 in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The secondary antibody was either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or a goat anti-mouse IgG (BioRad), both used at a 1:2000 dilution. MDCKII cells were grown and induced as described above. Cells were then fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized for 20 min in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in PBS at the following dilutions: pESL at 1:100, anti-desmoplakin at 1:20, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:200. Membranes were cut from the inserts and mounted onto glass-slides with 50% glycerol in PBS. Confocal laser-scanning immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on a LSM-510 apparatus (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cryosections of human liver samples (5-μm thickness) were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (10König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23161-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28Mayer R. Kartenbeck J. Büchler M. Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Keppler D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). After simultaneous incubation with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature sections were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with the secondary antibodies. Finally, sections were washed three times with PBS, rinsed with distilled water, and then mounted in Moviol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany). The antibodies were used as follows: the mouse mESL antibody as an undiluted hybridoma supernatant, the EAG5 antiserum at a 1:50 dilution in hybridoma supernatant, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG both at a dilution of 1:300 in PBS. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on an Axiovert S100TV microscope (Carl Zeiss) as described (10König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23161-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). [3H]Bromosulfophthalein (0.5 TBq/mmol) was obtained by custom synthesis (Hartmann Analytic, Köln, Germany), [3H]cholyltaurine (73 MBq/mmol), and [3H]E217βG (1.5 TBq/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cells were grown on Transwell membrane inserts and induced with butyrate (27Cui Y. König J. Buchholz U. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar) as described. For transport measurements (29Cui Y. König J. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), MDCKII cells were washed with uptake buffer (142 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmK2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3). Subsequently, 1 ml of uptake buffer without substrate was added to the apical compartment and 1.5 ml of uptake buffer containing the 3H-labeled substrate was added to the basolateral compartment. After 10 min (for BSP and E217βG) or 20 min (for cholyltaurine), the cells were washed three times with cold uptake buffer and lyzed with 2 ml of 0.2% SDS in water. The radioactivity in the lysate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Eighty-one samples from human livers were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody directed against the N-terminal end of the SLC21A6 protein. This antibody detects simultaneously SLC21A6 (OATP2, OATP-C, or LST-1) and SLC21A8 (OATP8) (Fig. 1). In this screening procedure we identified one liver sample, termed SLC21A6-S2, with a strong reduction in the amount of SLC21A6 protein relative to SLC21A8 and compared with the SLC21A6 protein amount in other samples (Fig. 1). The ratio of band intensities of SLC21A6 protein relative to SLC21A8 protein was determined densitometrically to be 1.6 (median, range 1.2 to 3.6, n = 46) in normal liver samples but only 0.6 in liver sample SLC21A6-S2. We amplified and cloned the SLC21A6-encoding cDNA from this liver sample and found that the cDNA from the analyzed clone contained five base pair exchanges in comparison with the SLC21A6 wild-type sequence (GenBank/EMBL accession number AJ132573). To further investigate whether both alleles of theSLC21A6 gene were transcribed and whether both alleles carried the base pair exchanges, four additional clones were sequenced. This sequencing revealed that the cDNAs from two clones corresponded to the wild-type SLC21A6 cDNA sequence and that the cDNAs from two clones carried the five base pair exchanges. These results demonstrated that in liver SLC21A6-S2 both SLC21A6 alleles were transcribed and that only one allele carried the five base pair exchanges. These base pair exchanges resulted in three amino acid substitutions and two silent mutations. We designated this mutant haplotype of the SLC21A6 gene asSLC21A6-M5 and the corresponding protein as SLC21A6-M5. In the topology model of SLC21A6 two of the amino acid exchanges are located in the predicted second extracellular loop and one in the adjacent transmembrane-spanning helix (Fig.2). In a most recent study by Tironaet al. (18Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35669-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) the two amino acid exchanges in the second extracellular loop, SLC21A6-N130D and SLC21A6-P155T, were described as polymorphisms with frequencies of 30 and 16%, respectively, in the European-American population. According to the proposed nomenclature for polymorphisms (30Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 2000; 10: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) these authors designated these polymorphisms as OATP-C*1b for SLC21A6-N130D and OATP-C*4 for SLC21A6-P155T. The third amino acid exchange, L193R, has not been detected previously, and its frequency was analyzed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis using the LightCycler system. In a total of 330 DNA samples only sample SLC21A6-S2 contained the base pair exchange encoding the mutant protein SLC21A6-L193R in a heterozygous form. Estimated from this limited number of 330 samples the allele frequency of homozygous carriers would be extremely rare.Figure 2Mutations and polymorphisms in the haplotype SLC21A6-M5. A two-dimensional model of the amino-proximal half of the human SLC21A6 protein based on several computer-aided transmembrane analysis programs is shown. The haplotypeSLC21A6-M5 cDNA has five base pair exchanges compared with the wild-type SLC21A6 cDNA resulting in three amino acid substitutions and two silent mutations. The following nucleotide exchanges were found: A-388 → G resulting in N130D (green); G-411 → A resulting in the silent mutation S137S (gray); C-463 → A resulting in P155T (red); T-578 → G resulting in L193R (blue); and C-597 → T resulting in the silent mutation F199F (gray). The two amino acid substitutions in the second extracellular loop (loop 2) are described as polymorphisms (18Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol.

Each stably transfected MDCKII cell line expressing the mutant SLC21A6 protein was designated according to the amino acid substitution: SLC21A6-N130D corresponding to the polymorphism SLC21A6*1b, SLC21A6-P155T corresponding to the polymorphism SLC21A6*4, and SLC21A6-L193R corresponding to the mutation Leu193Arg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The localization of normal and mutant SLC21A6 protein in liver sample SLC21A6-S2 was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). Whereas the control liver showed the normal basolateral localization of the SLC21A6 protein (Fig.3 B), the localization of the mutant SLC21A6 protein in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes in the liver sample SLC21A6-S2 was strongly reduced and most, but not all, of the mutant protein was retained intracellularly (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that both alleles of the SLC21A6gene were transcribed, but expression of the normal allele was not sufficient to compensate for the mutant allele with respect to the amount of the SLC21A6 protein localized to the plasma membrane. We introduced each single base pair exchange identified in sample SLC21A6-S2 leading to an amino acid substitution in the SLC21A6 protein into the SLC21A6 cDNA and examined the consequences of this alteration. Furthermore, aSLC21A6 cDNA was constructed that carried all five base pair exchanges representing the haplotypeSLC21A6-M5. The respective SLC21A6 proteins were designated as SLC21A6-WT representing the wild-type form of the SLC21A6 protein (GenBank/EMBL accession number AJ132573), SLC21A6-N130D representing the polymorphism SLC21A6*1b resulting in the substitution of Asn by Asp at position 130, SLC21A6-P155T representing the polymorphism SLC21A6*4 with Pro-155 substituted by Thr, SLC21A6-L193R representing the mutation with Leu-193 substituted by Arg, and SLC21A6-M5 corresponding to the haplotype form carrying the three base pair exchanges encoding the naturally occurring mutant protein. We analyzed the localization of the different recombinant mutant SLC21A6 proteins in stably transfected MDCKII cells. The protein levels in the transfected cell lines were compared by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4). Wild-type SLC21A6, both polymorphisms, and the single mutant protein SLC21A6-L193R were synthesized in comparable amounts. Interestingly, the protein amount of the haplotype form SLC21A6-M5 was decreased despite the fact that the mRNA encoding recombinant SLC21A6-M5 was not reduced in comparison with the mRNAs from the other transfectants as demonstrated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using the LightCycler system. The mRNA amounts relative to the wild-type SLC21A6 (1.0) were 1.2 for the polymorphism SLC21A6-N130D, 1.7 for polymorphism SLC21A6-P155T, 2.7 for the single mutant SLC21A6-L193R, and 1.7 for the haplotype SLC21A6-M5. The different SLC21A6 transfectants were used to study the localization of the respective recombinant protein by immunofluorescence microscopy. These images demonstrated the lateral localization of the wild-type SLC21A6 protein (Fig.5 A) as shown by colocalization with desmoplakin (Fig. 5 C). Both polymorphisms, SLC21A6*1b (Fig. 5, D and F) and SLC21A6*4 (Fig. 5,G and I), were localized similarly as wild-type SLC21A6. However, more SLC21A6*1b and SLC21A6*4 protein appeared to be retained intracellularly as compared with the wild-type SLC21A6. A pronounced change in protein localization was observed after expression of the mutant protein SLC21A6-L193R, which was hardly detectable in the lateral membrane of MDCKII cells and mainly retained intracellularly (Fig. 5, J and L). The small amount of SLC21A6-L193R protein in the lateral membrane was reflected by the weak yellow color in the merged picture (Fig. 5 L). The combination of the polymorphisms SLC21A6*1b and SLC21A6*4 with the mutation SLC21A6-L193R was examined by expression of the haplotype form SLC21A6-M5 (Fig. 5, M and O). Cells synthesizing this mutant protein containing the three amino acid substitutions showed no staining of the lateral membrane of MDCKII cells by the antibody ESL (Fig. 5 M) as demonstrated by laser scanning microscopy and colocalization with desmoplakin (Fig 5 O). The stably transfected MDCKII cells were used to investigate the transport characteristics of the SLC21A6 polymorphisms, of the SLC21A6 mutation, and of the haplotype form SLC21A6-M5 (Fig.6). Uptake was examined using the labeled substrates BSP (Fig. 6 A), E217βG (Fig.6 B), and cholyltaurine (C-tau) (Fig.6 C). In the transfected MDCKII cells neither the single mutant protein SLC21A6-L193R nor the haplotype protein SLC21A6-M5 showed any transport activity. Uptake of BSP was unchanged with polymorphisms SLC21A6*1b (SLC21A6-N130D) and SLC21A6*4 (SLC21A6-P155T) (Fig. 6 A) and was not significantly different from the uptake mediated by wild-type SLC21A6. With E217βG at a substrate concentration of 1 μm only the transport activity of SLC21A6*1b was comparable to wild-type SLC21A6, whereas the polymorphism SLC21A6*4 showed a significantly reduced transport activity (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, the polymorphism SLC21A6*4 did not transport cholyltaurine (Fig. 6 C), and the polymorphism SLC21A6*1b showed a reduced transport of cholyltaurine when compared with wild-type SLC21A6. These results demonstrate that not only the impaired membrane localization of the haplotype form SLC21A6-M5 but also of the single mutant SLC21A6-L193R, which is sorted at least to some extent to the plasma membrane, leads to a loss of transport activity. Moreover, our results suggest that both polymorphisms, SLC21A6*1b and SLC21A6*4, located in the second extracellular loop, may be involved in substrate recognition and that mutations in this loop of the SLC21A6 protein may affect substrate specificity, as shown for the substrates E217βG and cholyltaurine. Uptake of endogenous substances and xenobiotics from blood into hepatocytes is the first step in hepatobiliary elimination and detoxification. To fulfill this important function, the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes is equipped with a number of different uptake transporters. In this study we describe the first naturally occurring mutation in the SLC21A6 gene, which encodes a major uptake transporter for organic anions and bile salts into human liver. In addition, two frequent polymorphisms were detected in the same mutantSLC21A6 allele. Stably transfected MDCKII cells expressing wild-type or mutant SLC21A6 proteins were used to study the effect of the polymorphisms and of the mutation on the localization of the protein and on the transport kinetics. To date, only limited information is available on polymorphisms in genes encoding transporter proteins. So far, mostly polymorphisms in ATP-dependent export pumps have been described and partially characterized. For instance, polymorphisms in the human MDR1 (symbolABCB1) gene encoding the drug resistance mediating MDR1 P-glycoprotein (17Hoffmeyer S. Burk O. von Richter O. Arnold H.P. Brockmöller J. Johne A.

Furthermore, mutations in the ABCC2 gene resulting in the absence of the protein from the canalicular membrane have been described (33Kartenbeck J. Leuschner U. Mayer R. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34König J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys.

Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Tirona et al. have shown that polymorphisms in the SLC21A6 gene vary with respect to their frequency between the European-American and African-American population (18Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35669-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the authors used biotinylation experiments to study surface expression of several SLC21A6 allelic variants. Most recently, the allelic frequencies of polymorphisms in the SLC21A6 andSLC21A9 genes in the Japanese population were analyzed (19Nozawa T. Nakajima M. Tamai I. Noda K. Nezu J. Sai Y. Tsuji A. Yokoi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the localization and functional consequences of two polymorphisms and one mutation in the SLC21A6 protein in stably transfected MDCKII cells. These experiments demonstrated that both polymorphisms, SLC21A6*1b (SLC21A6-N130D) and SLC21A6*4 (SLC21A6-P155T), had only a minor, if any, effect on the localization of the protein as reflected by intracellular retention (Fig. 5). This could be due to an altered interaction with proteins involved in sorting. In addition, the extent of glycosylation of the mutant protein SLC21A6-P155T differs and may affect the quantity detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. A pronounced change in localization was demonstrated for the mutated SLC21A6-L193R (Fig. 5). Most of the SLC21A6-L193R protein was retained intracellularly suggesting an impaired maturation of the protein. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the uptake experiments, MDCKII cells expressing the mutant SLC21A6 protein did not show transport activity with any of the substances tested (Fig. 6). The impaired maturation indicates that the SLC21A6-L193R protein was recognized by the cellular quality control machinery. Studying the localization of the protein SLC21A6-M5 corresponding to the haplotype form no membrane localization of the protein could be detected. In addition to the intracellular retention, the protein amount in transfected MDCKII cells was reduced, despite the fact that the SLC21A6-M5 mRNA was synthesized in a similar amount as in the other transfectants. The altered localization of the haplotype protein observed in vitro after transfection was also detected in the liver in vivo as seen in the localization of SLC21A6 in liver sample SLC21A6-S2 (Fig. 3). Despite the fact that both alleles were transcribed, a pronounced change in the localization of the protein was detected (Fig. 3), in addition to the reduced protein amount (Fig. 1). Most of the liver protein was retained intracellularly and only a weak membrane staining could be detected, possibly resulting from wild-type SLC21A6 (Fig. 3). The donor of liver sample SLC21A6-S2 was not available for detailed studies on hepatobiliary elimination. Due to the fact that this mutation was found in a heterozygous form in only one of 330 DNA samples, one may conclude that a homozygous appearance of this mutation in adults is unlikely or may be lethal to the embryo. The stably transfected cell lines also served to study the transport characteristics of the mutated SLC21A6 proteins. The polymorphisms SLC21A6*1b and SLC21A6*4 differ in amino acids in the predicted second extracellular loop (Fig. 2). These proteins differed in their transport kinetics with all three substrates. Whereas BSP was transported by the SLC21A6*4 protein similar to the wild-type SLC21A6, transport of BSP mediated by the SLC21A6*1b protein was significantly enhanced. In contrast, the transport of E217βG mediated by SLC21A6*1b was comparable to the wild type, whereas the same substrate was transported by SLC21A6*4 with reduced activity. Interestingly, using cholyltaurine as substrate, the transport mediated by the SLC21A6*1b was reduced and no transport of cholyltaurine mediated by the polymorphism SLC21A6*4 was detectable (Fig. 6). These results indicate that amino acid substitutions in extracellular loop 2 of the SLC21A6 protein may affect substrate specificity suggesting that this loop is involved in substrate recognition. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that serine at position 155 in the human SLC21A6 protein is highly conserved among all other human SLC21A family members. Single amino acid substitutions leading to an altered substrate specificity have been described for the conjugate export pump Mrp2 (36Ito K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1034-G1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single amino acid substitution in the rat Mrp2 protein resulted in acquired transport capacity for cholyltaurine, which normally is not a substrate for this transporter (36Ito K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1034-G1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion we have identified a naturally occurring mutation in the SLC21A6 gene leading to an impaired maturation of the protein with reduced membrane localization and abolished transport function. Two frequent polymorphisms located within the second extracellular loop of the SLC21A6 protein were associated with an altered substrate specificity. These results suggest that extracellular loop 2 is involved in substrate recognition. Thus, the detailed analyses of polymorphisms and mutations in the gene encoding the SLC21A6 protein contributes to our understanding of the hepatobiliary elimination of organic anions and possibly to an impairment of the hepatobiliary elimination of drugs and drug candidates.

Here we studied the mechanisms underlying p65PI3K-induced PI3K/PKB activation using cells stimulated via the PDGFR or IL-2R. p65PI3K expression increased both basal and receptor-induced PI3K activation (32Jiménez C.

To examine the cause of the enhanced p110 activation by p65PI3K, we compared p85-p110 and p65PI3K-p110 activation in vitro. The results indicate that in addition to controlling PI3K signal termination, the C-terminal region of p85 regulates sequential PI3K activation by Tyr kinases and by Ras. CTLL2 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 20 units/ml IL-2. CTLL2 cells were transfected by electroporation using 50 μg of each cDNA as described (36Carrera A.C.

Anti-HA (12CA5), -PKB, and -pPKB antibodies were purchased from Babco, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and New England Biolabs, respectively. Anti-human SH3 PI3-kinase, -NT-Lck, -SHP1, -PDGFR and -rat PI3K antisera were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-Ras (Ab3) monoclonal antibody was from Oncogene Science. Recombinant IL-2 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; PDGF was from Calbiochem. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For the association of Ras with PI3K, cells were lysed in Brij 96 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% in Brij 96) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (as above). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Total protein concentration was measured with the Micro BCA kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating lysates (4 °C, 2 h) with the appropriate antibody (2 μl of polyclonal Ab or 1 μg of purified monoclonal Ab), followed by incubation with 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry (AmershamBiosciences) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis (32Jiménez C. Jones D. Rodriguez-Viciana P. González-Garcı́a A. Leonardo E. Wennstrom S. Von Kobbe C. Torán J.L. Rodrı́guez-Borlado L. Calvo V. Copin S. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Dı́ez E. Rodrı́guez-Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martı́nez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Other gels were dried, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. A peptide encompassing H-Ras residues 17–42 (SALTIQLIQNHFVDEYDPTIEDSYRK) was coupled to Actigel ALD superflow beads using ALD coupling solutions (Sterogene Bioseparations). Extracts (500 μg) of p65PI3K- and p85α-expressing CTLL2 cells were incubated with the peptide-specific or a control column (1 h, 4 °C). Beads were washed once with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5m LiCl, and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Control and Ras peptide-coupled beads were boiled in sample buffer, and the retained proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined in a Western blot using anti-p85 antibody. The cDNAs for in vitro transcription/translation were purified by phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) extraction followed by EtOH precipitation. DNA (2 μg) was used to develop the TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate kit (Promega), as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, DNA was mixed with 75 μl of TnT reticulocyte lysate, 6 μl of TnT reaction buffer, 3 μl of an amino acid mixture without methionine, 1 μl of RNasin (40 units/μl), 3 μl of RNA polymerase T7, and 12 μl ofl-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 1 μl of RNase (10 mg/ml) was added (30 min, 37 °C). The reaction was analyzed by immunoprecipitating 10% of this reaction mixture with anti-p85 or anti-Ras antibody. Precipitates were resolved in SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive products were visualized by autoradiography. PKB kinase activity was determined in a Western blot using anti-phospho-Ser-473 PKB Ab or by in vitro kinase assay. Endogenous PKB or recombinant HA-PKB were immunoprecipitated as above. Immunopurified PKB was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and mixed with 2.5 μg of histone H2B, 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor P0300 (Sigma), 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were incubated (20 min, room temperature) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. H2B phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. The PI3K assay was reported previously (32Jiménez C. Jones D. Rodriguez-Viciana P. González-Garcı́a A. Leonardo E. Wennstrom S. Von Kobbe C. Torán J.L. Rodrı́guez-Borlado L. Calvo V. Copin S. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Dı́ez E. Rodrı́guez-Marcos M.A. Downward J.

For assays with in vitro translated PI3K complexes, translation mixtures were purified using anti-SH3 p85 Ab. Similar results were obtained using the anti-rat PI3K antiserum. Immunopurified PI3K was resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mm Hepes containing phosphoinositide (brain extract) micelles (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) as substrate. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of the kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm unlabeled ATP (25 °C, 5 min). The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 m HCl and 200 μl of a methanol/chloroform mixture (1:1 v/v). The extracted phospholipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography (Silica Gel 60; Merck) on plates coated with 1% potassium oxalate and developed in glacial acetic acid/H2O/n-propyl alcohol (4:31:70 v/v/v). The radioactive products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified with the NIH image program. For peptide stimulation (16Holt K.H. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Chanudhuri M. Yakim M. Schaffhausen B. Shoelson S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

In the case of V12-Ras activation of PI3K, the V12-Ras translation reaction was combined with the PI3K translation reaction, and PI3K complexes were immunopurified from this mixture as above. To determine the consequences of p65PI3K expression on p110 activity, we followed the activation of the PI3K effector PKB in CTLL2 cells expressing p65PI3K or p85. PKB activation can be determined by analyzing the phosphorylation status of Ser-473 (39Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Phospho-Ser-473-PKB content was examined prior to and following stimulation with IL-2; results were confirmed by in vitrokinase assays. The two cell lines expressed similar amounts of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged regulatory subunits (Fig.1 A), which were within the range of that of the endogenous p85α molecule (not shown). Although IL-2 addition leads to transient PKB activation in control and HA-p85-expressing cells, HA-p65PI3K-expressing cells showed higher basal PKB phosphorylation, greater phosphorylation increases after IL-2 addition, and slower PKB down-regulation kinetics at later time points (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 cells expressing p85 or p65PI3K and activated with PDGF (Fig. 2, A andB), although in this system the higher activation peak at early time points was less evident. This difference between PDGFR and IL-2R may reflect the distinct PI3K recruitment mechanisms by the two receptors, with IL-2R showing constitutive PI3K association (24González-Garcı́a A. Mérida I.

Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In conclusion, in addition to mediating higher basal PI3K activity in quiescent cells, p65PI3K expression enhances PI3K activation in response to GFR activation (more clearly in IL-2R) and results in prolonged PI3K/PKB activation kinetics.Figure 2Prolonged PI3K/PKB activation in p65PI3K-expressing CTLL2 cells. A, p85- and p65PI3K-expressing NIH3T3 cells were lysed; 30 μg of total cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in Western blot using anti-p85. B, p85- and p65PI3K-expressing NIH3T3 cell lines incubated with 50 ng/ml PDGF for the periods indicated were lysed; 30 μg of total cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in Western blot using anti-phospho-Ser-473-PKB or anti-PKB antibody (indicated). The intensity of the phospho-PKB signal was quantitated using NIH image software and calculated relative to the signal at time 0. The figure illustrates one representative assay of three with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies (31Cuevas B.D., Lu, Y. Watt S. Kumar R. Zhang J. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27583-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) indicated that p85 binds Tyr-phosphorylated SHP-1 phosphatase via the C-SH2 p85 domain and that SHP-1 binding mediates down-regulation of both Tyr phosphorylation and PI3K activation. Other authors (40Paulson R.F. Vesely S. Siminovitch K.A. Bernstein A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) nonetheless showed a contribution by the N-SH2 domain in p85-SHP-1 association. To examine whether the absence of the C-SH2 domain in p65PI3K impaired association to SHP-1, we compared the ability of p65PI3K and p85 to bind to this phosphatase. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding SHP-1 and HA-tagged versions of both regulatory subunits. Transfections were performed in the absence or presence of cDNA encoding a constitutive active version of the Src kinase family member Lck (P505-Lck) (36Carrera A.C. Paradi H. Rodrı́guez-Borlado L. Roberts T.M. Martı́nez-A C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3385-3391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The distinct proteins were expressed to a similar extent in the p65PI3K and p85 samples (Fig.3). Moreover, when p65PI3Kand p85 regulatory subunits were immunopurified with anti-HA Ab, both subunits recruited similar amounts of SHP-1 (Fig. 3). This suggests that p85 binding to SHP-1 is not mediated exclusively by the C-SH2 domain. Minor changes in p65PI3K and p85 association to SHP-1 were observed in the absence or presence of P505-Lck, consistent with the moderate effect on SHP-1-p85 complex formation when Jurkat cells were examined prior to and following T cell receptor ligation, which triggers Lck activation (31Cuevas B.D., Lu, Y. Watt S. Kumar R. Zhang J. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27583-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Considering that p65PI3K binds SHP-1 to a similar extent as p85, the slower PI3K/PKB down-regulation kinetics observed in p65PI3K-expressing cells is not related to defective p65PI3K association to SHP-1. We also examined whether the lack of the C-SH2 domain in p65PI3K could affect the kinetics of binding and detachment of PI3K to the activated PDGFR (9Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 30Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The amount of p65PI3K bound to the receptor at any time point was lower than that of p85 (not shown), confirming that both SH2 domains contribute to mediating PI3K association to PDGFR (9Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas the amount of PDGFR associated to p85 returned to basal levels at 3 h post-stimulation, a small fraction of p65PI3Kremained PDGFR-associated (not shown). This small difference may not account for the significantly more stable activation of PI3K/PKB in cells expressing p65PI3K. Despite the open questions, the distinct PI3K/PKB down-regulation kinetics of p85- and p65PI3K-expressing cells demonstrates that the p85 C-terminal region contributes to control PI3K signal termination. p85-p110 class IA PI3K is activated following stimulation of Tyr kinases and by active forms of Ras (1Vanhaesebroek B.

V12-Ras and P505-Lck increased phospho-PKB content in the three CTLL2 lines analyzed (control and p85- and p65PI3K-expressing cells; Fig. 4 A). V12-Ras nonetheless consistently induced more efficient PI3K/PKB activation in p65PI3K-expressing than in control cells and reduced PKB activation in p85-expressing compared with control cells (Fig.4 A).

Biol. 2001; 21: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ultimate balance between transcriptional activation and repression is determined, to a large extent, by the absolute levels of Myc and MAD proteins, all of which have relatively short half-lives and tend to be expressed oppositely from one another (23Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 24Hurlin P.J. Foley K.P Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Hanahan D. Arbeit J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2487-2501PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the above described heterodimeric interactions, the transcriptional activity of c-Myc is influenced by several non-bHLH-ZIP proteins that associate with its transactivation domain (TAD), which comprises the N-terminal ∼150 amino acids of the protein (25Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2942-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two proteins, Bin-1 and TRRAP, have been the most intensely studied in this regard (27Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 28McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Both interact with a subregion of the TAD, termed “Myc Box II” (MBII) that is highly conserved among all Myc oncoprotein members. MBII is required for c-Myc to properly regulate many of its target genes and to transform fibroblasts in vitro in association with activated ras oncogenes (29Stone J. DeLange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar,30Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Choi H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bin-1 appears to be a negative regulator of c-Myc transformation, whereas TRRAP appears to be a positive regulator (27Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 28McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Bin-1 represses transformation appears complex, but includes effects on the cell cycle and the promotion of apoptosis in response to c-Myc over-expression (26Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2942-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An important aspect of TRRAP1 function may involve its role as a docking site for a complex of proteins that includes one or more of the histone acetylases discussed above (11McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We utilized a yeast two-hybrid approach to screen for proteins that interact with the c-Myc TAD. We describe one such protein, Pag, also known as MSP23 and peroxiredoxin-1. Pag is a 23-kDa protein whose cDNA was originally cloned from ras oncogene-transformed mammary epithelial cells (31Prosperi M.-T. Ferbus D. Karczinski I. Goubin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11050-11056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is up-regulated by serum and by compounds that induce oxidative stress (32Prosperi M.-T. Ferbus D. Rouillard D. Goubin G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pag has also been shown to interact with the Src homology-3 and kinase domains of c-Abl and to reverse the cytostatic effects of c-Abl (33Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the current work, we show that Pag also interacts specifically with the MBII region of the c-Myc TAD both in vitro and in vivo. Pag overexpression promotes a marked increase in cell size and enhances apoptosis, thus mimicking two previously described c-Myc phenotypes. We also show that Pag and c-Myc are each able to protect cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative damage. In contrast, Pag inhibits anchorage-independent growth of c-Myc overexpressing fibroblasts and down-regulates some, but not all, c-Myc target genes. Our results identify Pag as an MBII-binding protein that can differentially regulate certain c-Myc-dependent functions. The ability of Pag to interact with and modulate the activities of both c-Myc and c-Abl strongly supports its candidacy as a tumor suppressor. Standard polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were used to amplify the indicated murine c-Myc sequences from previously described c-Myc expression vectors (30Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Choi H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All PCR primers contained BamHI restriction sites in the 5′ (forward)-primer and BglII sites in the 3′ (reverse)-primer. The initial “bait” plasmid consisted of an ADH1 promoter-driven fusion between codons 1 and 1067 of the human Sos guanyl nucleotide exchange factor and murine c-myc codons 2–147, which encode the TAD. Additional baits consisted of TAD mutants bearing deletions of MBI (codons 43–69), codons 70–130, and MBII (codons 133–147), as well as a full-length wild-type c-myc (codons 2–439). The orientation, sequence, and reading frame of each clone were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a common pSos sequencing primer. pSos plasmids were introduced into the cdc25H yeast strain by the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method, and transformants were selected on SD/Leu− + glucose plates at 25 °C. Successful transformation was confirmed by recovery of each input plasmid in theEscherichia coli XL-1 Blue strain. For cDNA library screening, the strain containing pSos-c-Myc (2–147) was expanded in liquid culture and transformed with a human spleen cDNA library unidirectionally cloned into the pMyr vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Approximately 2 × 106 transformants were initially plated onto SD/Ura−leu− glucose plates and incubated for 2 to 3 days at 25 °C. The barely visible colonies were then replica plates onto SD/Ura−leu− galactose plates and incubated for an addition 5 to 7 days. Approximately 300 colonies >1 mm in size grew under these conditions. For DNA sequencing, 30 pMyr plasmids were recovered in XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene) by selecting for chloramphenicol resistance. Immunoblotting of yeast lysates was performed as described previously (34Langlands K. Prochownik E.V. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody against the Sos protein (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). All pSos and pMyr plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing on an ABI373 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing primers were synthesized to regions ∼150 bp upstream of the polylinker region of each plasmid. All pMyr clones derived from the spleen cDNA library were subjected to GenBankTM BLAST searches, which were used to establish the identity and reading frame of each insert sequence. PCR was used to amplify the region between codons 2 and 219 of either wild-type c-Myc or a deletion MBII mutant. The common 5′ PCR primer contained an engineered EcoRI site, and the 3′ PCR primer contained aBamHI site. PCR products were digested withBamHI, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, digested with EcoRI, and unidirectionally cloned into the EcoRI + XhoI (blunt-ended) digested pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The orientation and reading frame of each insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In all cases, GST fusion proteins of the predicted sizes were induced and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (35Gupta K. Anand G. Yin X.Y. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A Pag cDNA encoding the full-length protein was excised from the original pMyr yeast vector, recloned in pBluescript-SK (Stratagene), and used in a coupled T3 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription/translation reaction in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). One-tenth of the reaction (5 μl) was mixed with 1 μg of each of the above GST proteins in 0.5 ml of NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent (Sigma)). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C with continuous agitation, 20 μl of NETN-washed glutathione-coupled agarose (Bio-Rad) was added, and mixing was continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed five times in NETN buffer before being resuspended and boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed on standard SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography of the dried gel (XAR film, Kodak, Rochester, NY). NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (D-MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% supplemented calf serum (all from Invitrogen). Rat1a fibroblasts were cultured identically except that 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) was used. 32D myeloid cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% conditioned medium from the interleukin-3-producing WEHI-3B cell line. ST486 Burkitt's lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI plus 10% FBS. All cultures were split at least twice weekly to maintain continuous logarithmic growth. Soft agar colony assays for Rat1a transfectants were performed in 60-mm tissue culture plates by mixing 4 × 103 cells in 2 ml of 0.35% molten agarose (Invitrogen) in D-MEM, 10% FBS. The mixture was plated on a 4-ml solidified layer of 0.7% agarose prepared in the same medium. The number and sizes of the resulting colonies were determined by microscopic visualization 12–14 days later. For tumorigenesis assays, 3–4-week-old nude mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Five animals were used in each group. Each animal was inoculated subcutaneously with 107 Rat1a fibroblasts resuspended in 0.1 ml of D-MEM without serum. Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly. The mammalian expression vectors pSVL-neo, pSVL-puro, pSVL-neo-c-Myc, pSVL-neo-c-Myc(delMBI), and pSVL-neo-c-Myc(delMBII) have been described previously (30Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Choi H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pag was expressed as a C-terminal Myc epitope-tagged (MT) protein either in the pSVL-puro vector or in the pCBF vector under the control of a cytomegalovirus early promoter (gift from M. Cole, Princeton University). Plasmid DNAs were purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the directions of the supplier. Transient transfections using supercoiled DNAs were performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The indicated cell lines were plated at 8 × 105 cells/dish in 100-mm tissue culture plates 1 day prior to transfection and were harvested 2 days after transfection. In addition to the indicated plasmids, each plate also received 1 μg of pCMVβgal (Clontech, La Jolla, CA). Lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase, luciferase, and CAT activities as previously described (36Zhang H. Fan S. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17416-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Stable transfections in NIH3T3 and Rat1a fibroblasts were performed using LipofectAMINE essentially as described above except that 2 days after the addition of DNA, cultures were split 1:5 and selected in either puromycin (1 μg/ml, Sigma) or G-418 (750 μg/ml absolute concentration, Invitrogen). After 10–14 days, well isolated colonies were picked and expanded for further characterization. Stable transfections in 32D cells were performed by electroporation with linearized plasmid DNAs, selected 2 days later in the appropriate drug, and either pooled or cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates. For co-immunoprecipitation from transiently transfected cells, 50% confluent 100-mm duplicate plates of COS-7 cells were each transfected with 5 μg of the pSVLneo-c-Myc plasmid, the pSVLneo-c-Myc(delMBI) plasmid, or the pSVL-neo c-Myc(delMBII) plasmid and 3 μg of pSVLpuro-MT-Pag plasmid using LipofectAMINE. Control transfections consisted of the same amounts of each of the individual plasmids described above plus pSVLneo or pSVLpuro parental plasmids. 48 h later, cells were collected by scraping, washed three times in PBS, and resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton-X100 (Sigma) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 10 min on ice, nuclei were concentrated by low speed centrifugation, washed twice, and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. They were then disrupted on ice by a 30-s pulse with the microtip of a Branson sonifier at a setting of 7. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min followed by an additional round of clearing for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of control IgG followed by 50 μl of protein A-agarose (BioRad). After centrifugation, 10 μl of rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody prepared against amino acids 1–262 of the human protein (sc-764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with constant agitation. Immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-agarose for 2 h. After extensive washing, the complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE lysing buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-12% PAGE. After semidry transfer to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, NY), the membrane was blocked for 2 h with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% dry milk. The membrane was then divided in two. The upper half was incubated with a 1:500 dilution of the above mentioned polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibody, and the lower portion was probed with a 1:500 dilution of the 9E10 anti-c-Myc epitope-tagged monoclonal antibody (sc-40, Santa Cruz). Both blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing in PBS-T, the first blot was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz), and the second blot was incubated identically with a 1:500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti mouse IgG. After washing in PBS-T, both blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Renaissance Kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the supplier's directions. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous c-Myc and Pag proteins, 2 × 107 cells from the ST486 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line were lysed and sonicated as described above. The supernatant was then cleared by the addition a 1:200 dilution of control goat serum for 2 h at room temperature followed by 50 μl of staphylococcus A-agarose for an additional 2 h. The supernatant was then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of either control goat IgG or a goat anti-Pag IgG (sc-7380, Santa Cruz) for 2 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein-A agarose. The precipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, divided into two equal fractions, boiled in running buffer, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After Western transfer, one of the duplicate PVDF membranes was probed with a 1:500 dilution of the 9E10 anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody and the second membrane was probed with a control antibody. Both blots were then developed by chemiluminescence. 3T3-neo or 3T3-Pag cell lines were grown in 100-mm plates to ∼80% confluency. To determine the total protein content, triplicate cultures were harvested individually by scraping, and the total number of cells was determined by manual counting using a hemacytometer. Equivalent numbers of cells were then pelleted by low speed centrifugation, lysed, and the protein content determined using BCA reagent (Pierce). The rate of protein synthesis was determined by washing an equivalent set of triplicate plates three times in PBS followed by the addition of 3 ml of cysteine + methionine-free D-MEM (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, 35S-labeled cysteine + methionine (Easy-tag protein labeling mix; specific activity, 1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a final concentration of 200 μCi/ml for 1 h. The cells were then harvested by scraping, washed three times in PBS, and lysed for 30 min in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, plus protease inhibitor mixture. 10 μl of each lysate + 20 μg of carrier bovine serum albumin was precipitated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were collected on 25-mm GF/A glass fiber papers (Whatman), washed exhaustively with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and subjected to scintillation counting. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei was performed on a BD Pharmingen FACSTAR fluorescence-activated cell sorter (8Yin X.Y. Grove L. Datta N. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 2 × 104 cells were analyzed for each assay. Quantitation was performed using single histogram statistics. To identify proteins that interact with the c-Myc TAD, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using the TAD (amino acids 2–147) as the bait. Because this region is highly self-transactivating in conventional two-hybrid assays, 2Z.-M. Mu and E. V. Prochownik, unpublished observation. we utilized the CytoTrapTM system (Stratagene) in which interaction between bait and target proteins reconstitutes the Ras signaling pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A yeast strain expressing the c-Myc TAD in the pSos vector was transformed with a pMyr human spleen cDNA expression library, and 2 × 106 colonies were screened for growth at 37 °C. 30 pMyr plasmids were recovered for DNA sequencing, which showed that six encoded in-frame fusions with Pag. Of these, three initiated at different positions within the 5′-untranslated region or within five codons of the Pag translational start site. Five other pMyr isolates contained in-frame fusions with a cDNA encoding the previously described c-Myc-interacting protein, MM-1 (37Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga T. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We initially verified the specificity of the observed interaction between c-Myc and Pag in yeast. One of the full-length pMyr-Pag plasmids was co-expressed with the original pSos-c-Myc (2–147) TAD vector, pSos encoding a fusion with full-length c-Myc (pSos-c-Myc-(2–439)), or a series of pSos-c-Myc fusions containing deletions within the c-Myc TAD (30Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Choi H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These deletions included Myc Box I (MBI, codons 43–69), codons 70–130, and MBII (codons 133–147). Two additional yeast strains served as independent positive and negative controls for growth at 37 °C. The first contained pSos and pMyr plasmids, each of which expressed the full-length MafB protein. The second contained a pSos-collagenase IV fusion protein and a pMyr-lamin C fusion protein. After selection of Leu + Ura prototrophs at 25 °C, several colonies of each strain were replated and grown at 37 °C. As seen in Fig. 1, yeast containing either the original pSos-c-Myc (2–147) bait or the full-length c-Myc protein readily grew at 37 °C in the presence of co-expressed Pag (lines 5 and 6), thus confirming the original finding as well as indicating that interaction between c-Myc and Pag occurred with the full-length forms of both proteins. Deletions of either MBI or of the region between MBI and MBII (amino acids 70–130) still permitted strong interaction with Pag (lines 7 and8). However, deletion of MBII abolished the interaction (line 9). As expected, growth at 37 °C was seen with yeast harboring the MafB fusion proteins (line 2), whereas no growth was seen in yeast expressing only a single fusion protein (lines 3 and 4) or the pSos-collagenase and pMyr-lamin C combination (line 1). Finally, growth at 37 °C was seen only when the yeast were propagated on galactose-containing plates, thus verifying that both fusion proteins need to be expressed. To confirm the validity of the observed interactions, several of the above yeast strains were propagated in liquid culture and examined by immunoblotting (34Langlands K. Prochownik E.V. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody directed against Sos. As seen in Fig. 1 C, each of the yeast strains expressed a pSos fusion protein of the predicted size. These results indicated that the failure of Pag to interact with the MBII-deleted form of c-Myc was not because of lack of expression of the latter protein. To verify independently the interaction between Pag and c-Myc, we expressed Pag as a 35S-labeled in vitro translation product and performed pull-down experiments with affinity-purified GST fusion proteins containing the first 219 amino acids of c-Myc (GST-c-Myc-(2–219)), the same region containing a MBII deletion (GST-c-Myc-(2–219)delMBII) or GST alone. As seen in Fig.2, a significant portion of the labeled Pag protein interacted with the first fusion protein but with neither of the latter two. These results confirm those of the yeast two-hybrid experiments described above indicating that an intact c-Myc MBII is necessary for the interaction with Pag in vitro. Preliminary Northern and RNA “dot blot” experiments, as well as Western blots, indicated that Pag is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and tissues, with the highest levels occurring in liver and kidney (not shown). To demonstrate the c-Myc-Pag interaction in mammalian cells, we first co-expressed Pag as a c-Myc-epitope-tagged fusion protein in COS-7 cells along with either full-length, wild-type c-Myc or MBI or MBII c-Myc deletions (30Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Choi H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). c-Myc proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates using an antibody directed against the N-terminal half of the protein. Western blots were then probed with the same antibody to confirm expression of the c-Myc proteins, or with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody directed against the Pag c-Myc epitope tag, which is derived from the extreme C terminus of c-Myc. As seen in Fig.3 A, Pag was detected when it was co-expressed with either wild-type (WT) c-Myc or with c-MycdelMBI. In the absence of co-expressed c-Myc or in the presence of c-Myc delMBII, no Pag protein was co-immunoprecipitated. In other experiments, we asked whether endogenous c-Myc and Pag could be co-immunoprecipitated. Preliminary studies determined that the ST486 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line expressed high levels of both proteins (not shown). Therefore, a lysate from this cell line was incubated with an anti-pag antibody or with an equivalent amount of a control antibody. Following the addition of protein A-agarose, the precipitates were divided in two, and each was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to a PVDF membrane. One of the blots was then incubated with the"

We report the 2.3-Å crystal structure of glycogen branching enzyme fromEscherichia coli. The enzyme consists of three major domains, an NH2-terminal seven-stranded β-sandwich domain, a COOH-terminal domain, and a central α/β-barrel domain containing the enzyme active site. While the central domain is similar to that of all the other amylase family enzymes, branching enzyme shares the structure of all three domains only with isoamylase. Oligosaccharide binding was modeled for branching enzyme using the enzyme-oligosaccharide complex structures of various α-amylases and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase and residues were implicated in oligosaccharide binding. While most of the oligosaccharides modeled well in the branching enzyme structure, an approximate 50° rotation between two of the glucose units was required to avoid steric clashes with Trp298 of branching enzyme. A similar rotation was observed in the mammalian α-amylase structure caused by an equivalent tryptophan residue in this structure. It appears that there are two binding modes for oligosaccharides in these structures depending on the identity and location of this aromatic residue.

This is achieved by cleavage of the α-1,4 glucosidic linkage, yielding a non-reducing end oligosaccharide chain, and subsequent attachment of the oligosaccharide to the α-1,6 position. This branching increases the number of non-reducing ends, thus making glycogen more reactive to synthesis and digestion, and is also essential for assuring its solubility in the cell. Accumulation of insoluble glycogen in the cell is known as glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD IV) and is caused by mutations in the gene of BE (1Chen, Y. T., and Burchell, A. (1995) in The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, W. S., and Valle, D., eds) Vol. 1, pp. 935–965.Google Scholar, 2DiMauro, S., and Tsujino, S. (1994) in Myology(Engel, A. G., and Franzini-Armstrong, C., eds) Vol. 2, pp. 1554–1576.Google Scholar). These mutations result in an impaired enzyme, preventing the formation of the branch points in glycogen and producing an insoluble polymer. GSD IV in its different forms affects the liver, muscular tissue, and/or the central and peripheral nervous system. BE belongs to the α-amylase family of enzymes (3Baba T. Kimura K. Mizuno K. Etoh H.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Members of this group include α-amylases, pullulanase/isoamylase, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGT), and branching enzymes. X-ray structures of α-amylases, isoamylase, and CGTs show that these enzymes have a common (α/β) barrel domain that contain the enzyme's catalytic center (5Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Harada W. Kakudo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 6Buisson G. Duee E. Haser R. Payan F.

Based on biochemical data and x-ray structures of apo- and substrate-bound α-amylase and CGT, the catalytic center of these enzymes have been localized to the residues Tyr300, Asp335, His340, Arg403, Asp405, Glu458, His525, and Asp526 in the Escherichia coli branching enzyme numbering (10Uitdehaag J.C. van Alebeek G.J. van Der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved among members of this family and BE from various organisms (Fig.1) (12Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 13Jespersen H.M. MacGregor E.A. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. Biochem.

In an attempt to understand the catalytic relevance of these conserved residues, studies have been performed on maize endosperm BE I and BE II and E. coli BE by using site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. These studies revealed that Tyr300 and Glu459 in E. coli BE and His320, His508, Arg384, Asp386, Asp509, Glu441, and Gln270 in maize endosperm BE II are necessary for branching enzyme's activity (15Binderup K.

Branching enzyme is divided into three domains based on secondary structure prediction and its connection with the amylotic family of enzymes (5Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Harada W. Kakudo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 6Buisson G. Duee E. Haser R. Payan F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These domains include an amino-terminal domain, a carboxyl-terminal domain, and a central (α/β) barrel catalytic domain. Several chimeric mutants were made with the goal of understanding the role that the three domains have in branching enzyme activity (21Kuriki T. Stewart D.C. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies indicate the COOH-terminal domain to be involved in substrate preference and catalytic capacity, while the NH2-terminal domain is involved in determining the size of the chain transferred. This study also established the importance of the amino and carboxyl termini, indicating that the catalytic capacity of BE is not limited to the central (α/β) barrel domain. The unique feature of the action of the branching enzyme lies in its specificity for the length of the glucan chain transferred. Glycogen branching enzyme from E. coli has a preference for transferring shorter chains between 5 and 16 glucose units (22Guan H., Li, P. Imparl-Radosevich J. Preiss J. Keeling P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, maize branching enzyme isoenzyme I has a higher propensity for transferring longer glucose chains up to 30 glucose units with a predominant number of 10 to 13 glucose units long (21Kuriki T. Stewart D.C. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Guan H., Li, P. Imparl-Radosevich J. Preiss J. Keeling P. Arch.

Maize branching enzyme II predominantly transfers glucose chains of 6 to 7 glucose units long (21Kuriki T. Stewart D.C. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Guan H., Li, P. Imparl-Radosevich J. Preiss J. Keeling P. Arch. Biochem.

To gain insight into the structure, mechanism, and specificity of BE, we have determined the structure of E. coli BE lacking its first 113 amino acids (N113BE). Unsuccessful attempts to crystallize the full-length enzyme directed us toward the use of limited proteolysis to identify a more compact and stable form of the enzyme that would be successful in crystallization (24Binderup K. Mikkelsen R. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Branching enzyme fromE. coli was subjected to several proteases with a range of specificities. Almost all proteases displayed similar digestion patterns producing a 71.6-kDa fragment (24Binderup K. Mikkelsen R. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). BE lacking the first 112 residues at the amino terminus (N113BE) was analyzed and its properties compared with the full-length enzyme. Despite the fact that N113BE was only 60% active, its substrate preference and K mvalue were similar to the full-length enzyme. N113BE presents an altered branching pattern with a higher affinity for longer chains of 12 glucose units or more (25Binderup K. Mikkelsen R. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of BE from E. coli truncated at amino acid 112. This is the first three-dimensional structure of BE. The recombinant native and selenium-Met-substituted N113BE enzyme were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described (22Guan H., Li, P. Imparl-Radosevich J. Preiss J. Keeling P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Binderup K. Mikkelsen R. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein homogeneity was verified by SDS-PAGE, and the enzyme activity was determined using three different assays (23Takeda Y. Guan H.-P. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 253-263Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Guan H.P. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 102: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The purified protein was buffer exchanged in 25 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml. The crystals formed at 277 K from a solution containing 100 mm Na-Hepes at a pH of 7.20 following the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (27Abad M.C. Binderup K. Preiss J. Geiger J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystals first appear after 2 weeks and reach maximum size (0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm) in 4 weeks. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% (v/v) MPD, 2% (m/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 100 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5. The crystals were then mounted and quickly frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. A high resolution native data set was collected to a resolution of 2.3 Å at the Structural Biology Center, ID19 at the Advance Photon Source using a single crystal. Diffraction data were indexed and integrated using DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z.M., W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The branching enzyme crystals belong to the P21 space group with unit cell parameters a = 91.44, b= 102.58, c = 185.41 Å, and β = 91.38o. Crystal parameters are listed in TableI.

Open table in a new tab Selenium-Met-substituted protein was crystallized and cryoprotected in the same conditions as the native crystals, and a single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment was performed at the selenium absorption edge. Anomalous data to a resolution of 2.5 Å were collected in a single element 165-mm MAR CCD detector at beamline ID17 in the facilities of the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team (IMCA-CAT) at the Advance Photon Source (Table II). In addition to the SAD data an isomorphous replacement experiment was performed. In this experiment a native crystal was soaked for 18 h in a solution containing 10% MPD, 0.1 m Na-Hepes, pH 7.20, with 10 μm p-chloromercuribenzoate. The crystals were cryoprotected and frozen as described previously. Data were collected over 160o with oscillations of 1o. A total of 345,018 reflections were measured at our home source using an Rigaku Raxis IV2+ image plate detector (Table II). CuKα radiation was generated by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode source operating at 50 kV and 90 mA. The automated heavy atom search routines implemented in the program SOLVE were used to find the four mercury and 27 initial selenium positions (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The program SHARP was used both to refine these sites and to find a total of 61 selenium sites by iterative difference Fourier analysis. SHARP was also used to calculate an initial set of phases and an initial electron density map (30La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Once the BE structure was traced, it was subjected to multiple rounds of structure refinement using CNS. Refinement was followed by the addition of water molecules and resolution extension to 2.3 Å. The final refinement parameters are listed in Table IV and show very good stereochemistry for a structure at this resolution. The four molecules in the BE asymmetric unit consist of 19,323 non-hydrogen atoms and 1,142 water molecules. Each molecule extends from residue 117 to residue 728 with the first four residues disordered. There are two disordered regions, between residues 361–373 and 414–429 in all four molecules. Another disordered region between residues 211 and 215 is observed only in molecules b and c. The overall elliptical structure of BE has dimensions of 87.7 × 42.6 × 42.0 Å. The structure of BE is organized into three domains: the COOH terminal, NH2-terminal, and (α/β) barrel (Fig.2). The COOH-terminal domain consists of 116 residues organized in seven β-strands. The NH2-terminal domain contains a β-sandwich fold, which was previously predicted by sequence analysis (1Chen, Y. T., and Burchell, A. (1995) in The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, W. S., and Valle, D., eds) Vol. 1, pp. 935–965.Google Scholar, 2DiMauro, S., and Tsujino, S.

Acta Neuropathol. 1993; 85: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This NH2-terminal domain is composed of 128 residues arranged in seven β-strands. The central (α/β) barrel domain, common in members of the α-amylase family, extends from residue 241 to residue 612 comprising a total of 372 residues (Fig.3). This domain contains the residues involved in catalysis and presents a substrate binding cleft with dimensions of 30.5 × 17.7 × 17.7 Å, large enough to accommodate branched glucose chains.Figure 3A sequence alignment of branching enzymes from various organisms. Shaded residues indicate those that are identical to the E. coli sequence. Elements of secondary structure as elucidated in the x-ray structure appear above the alignment with cylinders representing helices andarrows representing β-strands. Elements of secondary structure are numbered by domain, with n-β1indicating the first β-strand in the NH2 terminus for example. Elements of secondary structure in the catalytic domain are numbered based on the strands that make up the β-barrel. Residues that are conserved throughout the amylase family are shown withblack spheres, and residues that are found to be close to acarbose in the BE/acarbose model but are not conserved in the family are shown by gray spheres. All of these residues are absolutely conserved among bacterial BE enzymes. Sequence alignment was performed using DNASTAR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequence similarity among the primary structure of members of the α-amylase family is very low, preserved only among the four regions that contain the conserved residues (Fig. 1). X-ray structures of members of the family, however, showed the existence of a conserved barrel domain (6Buisson G. Duee E. Haser R. Payan F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 8Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Katsuya Y. Mezaki Y. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BE was the only member of the α-amylase family for which the three-dimensional structure was still unknown. Indeed BE has a central (α/β) barrel that contains the catalytic residues (Fig. 2). This domain is similar to the (α/β) barrels of other members of the family. Also, the COOH-terminal domain of BE is structurally similar to the COOH termini of isoamylase and α-amylase, while the NH2-terminal β-sandwich domain of BE is similar to the NH2-terminal domain in isoamylase (5Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Harada W. Kakudo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar,9Katsuya Y. Mezaki Y. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Among the members of the α-amylase family, BE and isoamylase are the more structurally similar. Isoamylase and BE are the only members in the family that bind sugars in the α-1,6 position. A complete (α/β) barrel should contain eight α-helices and eight β-strands. The (α/β) barrel domain in BE is missing H5, the α-helix between β-sheet number five (β5) and six (β6). This variation of the (α/β) barrel domain is also observed in isoamylase but not in other members of the family (9Katsuya Y. Mezaki Y. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This barrel also has extra helices inserted; H1a, H3a, H6a, H7a, H7b, and H8a (Fig. 3). The H1a helix, located between H1 and H2, is a one turn helix. The H6a helix positioned between H6 and β7 is a three turn helix. There are two loops connecting the domains in E. coli BE. The loop that connects the NH2-terminal domain to the (α/β) barrel is 18 residues long (223–240), and the loop joining the end of the (α/β) barrel to the COOH-terminal domain is 13 residues long (613–625). The elements of secondary structure are summarized in the amino acid sequence diagram of Fig. 3. There are marked differences between the loops connecting elements of secondary structure among members of the α-amylase family of enzymes, especially those that surround the active site. These loops might be responsible for the distinct catalytic properties between the enzymes. Comparison of the loop structures between members of the family revealed that BE has shorter loops, presenting a more open cavity for the binding of a bulkier sugar as is the case of a branched sugar. Overall BE has a more accessible cavity for sugar binding compared with CGT, isoamylase, and α-amylase. For example, the loop between β5/β6 is extended in all the other members of the family. This extension of the loop will block the incoming sugar chain acceptor. Although isoamylase also has an extended loop here, it is moved away from the cavity in contrast to its position in CGT and α-amylase. There is another extended loop between β2/α2 observed in all members of the family. There is also an extra domain of approximately 60 residues, named domain B, inserted in the barrel between β3 and α3. This domain is present in α-amylase, CGT, and isoamylase, but not in BE. Although in the BE structure there are 13 disordered residues in the loop between β3 and α3, this loop is only 40 residues long, not long enough to account for the complete B domain. Sequence analysis precludes any of the other branching enzymes from containing a B domain (Fig. 3). Based on primary structure analysis and the x-ray crystallographic structures of members of the amylolytic family of enzymes, seven conserved residues were defined: Asp335, His340, Arg403, Asp405, Glu458, His525, and Asp526(E. coli numbering; Figs. 1 and 2). It was established that these conserved residues are involved in catalysis and substrate binding. Upon analysis of the BE active site and after comparison with other members of the family, we noticed that although Asp335 is conserved it does not make any contacts with the substrates in any of the bound structures. On the other hand Tyr300 is not only conserved, but the equivalent residue also interacts with substrates and inhibitors in many of the enzyme complex structures (10Uitdehaag J.C. van Alebeek G.J. van Der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows the conserved residues and their relative orientation. Asp335 appears to play a structural role by hydrogen bonding and thereby orienting both Arg403and Tyr300. The structures of BE, isoamylase, α-amylase, and CGT were overlaid, and the conserved residues were compared (Fig. 4) (9Katsuya Y. Mezaki Y. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Qian M. Nahoum V. Bonicel J. Bischoff H. Henrissat B. Payan F.

Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The position and orientation of residues Arg403, His525, and Asp526 (E. colinumbering) are conserved in all structures. Inspection of residues Glu458, Asp405, and His340 show a considerable motion of their side chain in BE. His340 is hydrogen-bonded to Asp405 only in BE. The change in position of these residues may be important for the type of reaction that BE catalyzes. We must await further studies of substrate bound BE to understand this difference in orientation. Mutagenesis experiments performed on E. coli BE demonstrated that Glu459, which is either an Glu or Asp depending on the organism, is necessary for BE activity (15Binderup K. Preiss J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9033-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inspection of the orientation of Glu459 reveals that it is oriented away from the catalytic cavity interacting with the carboxylate of Thr461. This interaction holds the loop connecting β5 to β6 in position. This is important for properly orienting Glu458, which has an important role in BE catalysis. Mutations in BE responsible for GSD IV are Val273, Tyr306, Tyr377, Gly555, and Lys546 (E. coli numbering and TableV). These residues are conserved in E. coli with the exception of Arg524 in human BE, which is a glycine in E. coli BE. None of these residues are located within the catalytic cavity but are instead spread throughout the structure.

Libessart N. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, another acarbose-like inhibitor, BAY e4609, is a reasonably potent inhibitor of BE (37Binderup K. Libessart N. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). BAY e4609 differs from acarbose only in that it has between 7 and 20 glucose units extending from each side of the hydroxymethylconduritol/chinovose unit. In fact, it is the longer chain derivatives that are the better inhibitors, indicating that BE requires longer oligosaccharides for competitive binding with substrate (37Binderup K. Libessart N. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, since BAY e4609 does inhibit BE, it is likely that local binding around the active site will strongly resemble that seen in the CGT and α-amylase-acarbose complex structures. Therefore an acarbose molecule was modeled into the BE active site by overlaying the conserved catalytic residues of various substrate bound members of the α-amylase family onto BE. Interestingly, when the acarbose oligosaccharide from Aspergillus oryzae α-amylase and Bacillus circulans CGT (10Uitdehaag J.C. van Alebeek G.J. van Der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were modeled onto BE, collisions were observed between BE and the transferred side of the oligosaccharide (that is, the part of the oligosaccharide that remains covalently bound). However, the acarbose inhibitor from mammalian α-amylase (Protein Data Bank ID 1HXO) has a significant rotation and repositioning of the second sugar relative to the A. oryzae α-amylase and B. circulans CGT structures. This repositioning is manifested by a 52° change in the torsion angle defined by C3-C4-O1-C1, where C3 and C4 are from the previous sugar unit. This motion is caused by the conformation of the loop between residues 58–62 (porcine pancreatic isoamylase numbering), especially the position of Trp58, which sterically interferes with the oligosaccharide trajectory seen in the A. oryzae α-amylase and B. circulans CGT structures and makes Van der Waals interactions with the glucose unit at position two. The equivalent loop in BE (298–302) is in a similar conformation and results in Trp298 of BE sterically colliding with the acarbose units of A. oryzae α-amylase and B. circulans CGT (Fig. 5). On the other hand, no collisions are observed when the acarbose inhibitor of mammallian α-amylase is overlaid on the structure of BE (Fig. 5). A similar steric clash is relieved by this rotation when the two conformations of oligosaccharides are modeled into the isoamylase structure. It would seem that there are two distinct binding modes for oligosaccharides depending upon the conformation of this loop and the residue at this position (Trp298). The result is that the trajectory of the oligosaccharide is significantly different as it exits the active site, implicating a different surface of the molecule to be involved in binding the rest of the oligosaccharide chain. The roughly parallel orientation of the sugar rings is consistent with the production of a cyclic oligosaccharide in the case of CGT. The further mechanistic significance of these two conformations, however, is unclear in the absence of other data. The leaving group side of the oligosaccharide has the same conformation in all substrate- or inhibitor-bound α-amylases and CGT structures, and no collisions are seen in this part of the oligosaccharide when modeled into either the BE or isoamylase structures. The residues in BE that are predicted to be close to the oligosaccharide according to our modeling studies are Trp298, Tyr300, Gln301, His340, Arg403, Asp405, Glu458, Ser460, His525, Asp526, and His530. All of these residues are absolutely conserved among bacterial BE sequences, although there is some deviation in eukaryotes (Fig. 3). This may indicate some differences in sugar binding between bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes. An analysis of the surface charge distribution of BE was performed by the calculation of the electrostatic potential surface (EPS) (Fig.6). The overall surface of BE is quite electronegative, and the cavity formed in the (α/β) barrel domain is the most electronegative feature of the surface. This cavity contains four negatively charged residues: Asp335, Asp405, Glu458, and Asp526 known to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The EPSs of α-amylase, CGT, and isoamylase were also calculated, and it was observed that all members of the α-amylase family present an overall negatively charged surface. The highly electronegative character of the (α/β) barrel domain in all four members of the family indicates that this negatively charged catalytic cavity is important for sugar protein interactions. In a rather elegant set of crystallographic and biochemical experiments, a covalent intermediate was trapped in the active site of the CGT enzyme, and the structure of this covalent intermediate was determined (35Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This work, and work involving α-amylase (38Tao B.Y. Reilly P.J. Robyt J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), confirmed that Asp405(E. coli BE numbering throughout) was indeed the nucleophile in the reaction and strongly implicated Glu458 to be responsible for protonations and deprotonations necessary on the leaving group and attacking oxygen. Indeed the carboxylate oxygen of Glu458 is quite close to the carboxylate oxygen of Asp526 (2.6 Å) in CGT, indicating that Glu458may even exist in a protonated form in this enzyme. Although these residues are reasonably close in other enzymes of the family (3.7–4.1 Å), the distance seen in BE is quite long (5.6 Å). This is caused by a very different conformation of Glu458 in BE relative to the other enzymes (Fig. 4). While we expect that the mechanism of BE will be similar to that proposed for CGT in that Asp405will be the nucleophile in the formation of the covalent intermediate, there may be significant differences, especially in the treatment of the leaving group sugar and of the incoming nucleophilic sugar. This is not surprising given that while the cleavage occurs 1,4, the incoming nucleophile must be the 6-oxygen of the glucose moiety, which is distinct from CGT where both the leaving and entering oxygens are on the 4 position. In the case of isoamylase and α-amylase a water molecule acts as the proton donor hydroxylating the C1 of the sugar. This brings up the question of what makes CGT and BE perform a transglycosylation reaction and not just a hydrolysis with a water molecule acting as the proton donor. A possible explanation for this could be that in isoamylase and α-amylase, a water molecule is sequestered and clamped in position. A comparison of the water molecules among members of the family does not provide conclusive information, as a water molecule in this region that would only be particular to the hydrolases was not observed. Another possible explanation would involve sequestration of the active site from water in the enzymes that are not hydrolyases. No such sequestering is evident in the structures, however, as both active sites appear quite accessible to solvent, especially BE. Another possible explanation would involve stabilization of the covalent intermediate relative to that of the hydrolytic enzymes, with a conformational change caused by the second substrate binding being required for the second step of the reaction to occur. Alternatively, substrate binding in BE could be cooperative, with binding significantly enhanced by binding of both substrates before attack and formation of the covalent intermediate. The substrate would then effectively block access to the active site by water. This mechanism is clearly not possible for CGT, as both substrates must occupy similar positions in the active site, since 1,4 cleavage is followed by 1,4 attack. Further structural and biochemical studies will be required to answer these questions. We thank Rongguang Zhang, Andrzej Joachimiak, and Stephan L.

Indirect evidence suggests that phospholipids may be the primary substrate of ABCA1 and that cholesterol is transported through spontaneous diffusion-mediated process after sufficient phospholipid has complexed with lipid-poor ApoA-I to create a good cholesterol sink (8Wang N.

Therefore, the complex of ApoA-I and phospholipid is a much better acceptor of free cholesterol than ApoA-I itself (8Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation may have an important role in cholesterol efflux with ABCA1 being a potential substrate for kinases. In this report, we provide evidence that ABCA1 is indeed phosphorylated by PKA or a PKA-like kinase in vivo, and we identify two serines phosphorylated by PKA in vitro that may potentially regulate ABCA1 function. Phosphorylation of Ser-2054 within the nucleotide binding domain 2 was found to be particularly important for ApoA-I-dependent phospholipid efflux activity mediated by ABCA1. Our data suggest that, like other ABC transporters, phosphorylation by PKA is important for modulation of ABCA1 function. Human embryonic kidney cells 293T, Flip-In 293 cells (Invitrogen), HeLa cells, and RAW mouse macrophages were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Full-length human ABCA1 cDNA was isolated by reverse transcriptase PCR of mRNA obtained from cultured human skin fibroblast cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). PCR-based mutagenesis was performed on the ABCA1 gene to create the S1042A and S2054A mutants as described previously (30Wellington C.L. Singaraja R. Ellerby L. Savill J. Roy S. Leavitt B.

The mutagenesis primers used were as follows: 1042F, 5′-CAGAGAAAGCTAGCTGTGGCCTTG; 1042R, 5′-CAAGGCCACAGCTAGCTTTCTCTG; 2054F, 5′-ACAAACGCAAGCTCGCTACAGCCATGGCT; 2054R, 5′-AGCCATGGCTGTAGCGAGCTTGCGTTTGT. The S1042A and S2054A mutations in ABCA1 were completely sequence-confirmed. The S1042A mutation was isolated by XhoI/XbaI restriction digestion and moved into the S2054A clone, thereby generating a S1042A/S2054A double mutant that was also sequence-confirmed. All three of these mutants were then cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) and verified by complete sequencing of the insert. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused in-frame to the C terminus of ABCA1 to generate GFP-ABCA1. The EGFP-ABCA1 construct was generated in the plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) by overlapping PCR extension. Briefly, EGFP from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was amplified with the following PCR primers: F, 5′-GAAAGCTATGTAATGGTGAGCAAG; R, 5′-GCTCTAGATTACTTGTACAGCTC whereas ABCA1 was amplified with the following primers: F, 5′-CACCACAGGCATGGATCCCAAAG; and R, 5′-CTTGCTCACCATTACATAGCTTTC under standard PCR conditions. The products were pooled, and PCR was performed with the two outermost primers. This ABCA1/GFP hybrid was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 ABCA1 vector.

Mouse ABCA1 construct AG is a chimera consisting of a C-terminal fusion of EGFP and the 2261-amino acid full-length mouse ABCA1 transporter and has been described previously (32Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The MM mutant contains a lysine → methionine substitution in the first and second NBD of mouse ABCA1 and has been shown to be functionally inactive (32Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H.

Human embryonic kidney cells, 293 Flip-in cells, or HeLa cells were transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. 293 Flip-In cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). An ABCA1 monoclonal stable cell line was generated by co-transfecting pcDNA5/FRT-ABCA1 and pOG44 (Invitrogen) using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in growth medium without zeocin according to manufacturer recommendations. Twenty-four h after transfection, hygromycin B (Invitrogen) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 50 μg per ml, and the media were changed every 3–4 days until hygromycin-resistant colonies were clearly evident. Individual colonies were picked and evaluated for ABCA1 expression by Western blot analysis. At least two independent monoclonal lines were used for all experiments, and a control hygromycin-resistant cell line was generated by co-transfecting the pOG44 with the empty pcDNA5/FRT vector. Polyclonal cell lines were also prepared by pooling at least 500 individual colonies from 293 Flip-in cells co-transfected with pOG44 and pcDNA5/FRT-ABCA1, pcDNA5/FRT-ABCA1 S1042A, pcDNA5/ FRT-ABCA1 S2054A, or pcDNA5/FTR-ABCA1 S1042A/S2054A cDNAs and selected for hygromycin resistance as described above. GST-ABCA1 fusion proteins were induced in E. coli BL-21 DE3 (Stratagene) and purified as follows. 100 ml of LB containing 100 μg per ml ampicillin was inoculated with 3 ml of overnight seed culture and grown at 37 °C until theA 600 was between 0.6 to 0.8. Fusion protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and washed in STE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). GST-ABCA1 fusion proteins were purified from the cell pellets by solubilization with 1.5% sarkosyl detergent followed by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (34Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to ABCA1 were raised against a peptide directed against amino acid (aa) residues 2236 to 2259 of human ABCA1 and subsequently purified using an anti-peptide column as described previously (31Wellington C.L. Walker E.K. Suarez A. Kwok A. Bissada N. Singaraja R. Yang Y.Z. Zhang L.H. James E. Wilson J.E. Francone O. McManus B.M. Hayden M.R. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody to ABCA1 (AC10) that recognizes an epitope between aa 1873 and 2261 was also prepared as described (31Wellington C.L. Walker E.K. Suarez A. Kwok A. Bissada N. Singaraja R.

Cell pellets were lysed for 15 min in either RIPA buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) or 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and quantitated by a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Membranes were probed with either polyclonal or monoclonal (AC10) antibody to ABCA1 or with a monoclonal antibody to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon) as a control for equal loading. Immunoreactivity was detected by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). RAW macrophages were equilibrated in phosphate-free or methionine-free DMEM in 1% delipidated bovine serum albumin for 2 h before the addition of [32P]orthophosphate (0.7 mCi per ml) or [35S]methionine (0.5 mCi per ml), respectively, in the presence of 4 μg per ml 22-R-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 to 16 h. Cells were lysed by the addition of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). After 30 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates were incubated with a rabbit anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody for 2 to 4 h at 4 °C. Following the addition of 50 μl of 50% (w/v) suspension of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) the tubes were rocked for an additional 40 min. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, SDS-sample buffer was added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels, dried, and autoradiographed. For detection of PKA phosphorylation of ABCA1 by an antibody specific for PKA-phosphorylated serines, immunoprecipitation using an anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody was carried out as described above on unlabeled 293 Flip-in monoclonal cell lines constitutively expressing ABCA1. In some experiments, 0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) was added to the cells for 16 h at 37 °C prior to harvesting. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a phospho-PKA substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) to detect phosphorylation by PKA. Pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed on polyclonal 293 Flip-in cells constitutively expressing wild-type ABCA1, S1042A, or S2054A. Cells were starved in methionine-deficient media containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h and pulsed in the same medium containing 0.5 mCi per ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci per mmol; AmershamBiosciences) for 5 min at 37 °C. The chase was performed at 2-h time intervals up to 12 h using complete DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm cold methionine and cysteine. Cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer, and ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein G-Sepharose as described above. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis. The radioactivity associated with ABCA1 was quantitated by densitometry using a Molecular Imager FX system (Bio-Rad). About 1 μg of purified GST-ABCA1 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated with 5 units of protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Sigma), 10 μCi of [γ−32P]ATP, and 300 μm cold ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography of the dried gel. Stoichiometric analysis was performed by excising GST-ABCA1 bands from the gel and counting the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. For immunocomplex kinase assays, ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated as described above and immobilized on protein G-Sepharose. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and kinase reactions were performed as described above. Recombinant ApoA-I (Calbiochem) was coupled to the Cy5 fluorochrome with the FluorolinkTM Cy5 monofunctional dye 5-pack (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (32Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O.

HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-ABCA1 wild-type, S1042A, S2054A, or S1042A/S2054A as described above. Sixty h post-transfection, cells were bound to Cy5-ApoA-I, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed as described previously (32Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, ApoA-I was conjugated to the fluorochrome with the FluorolinkTM Cy5 monofunctional dye 5-pack (PA25001 Amersham Biosciences). Cy5-ApoA-I was diluted to 100 μg/ml in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl), and aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Binding was performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml of Cy5-ApoA-I for 1 h at 4 °C on 5 × 105 HeLa cells detached by mild trypsinization (0.005% in phosphate-buffered saline). At the end of incubation, cells were washed rapidly prior to fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde. Flow cytometric recordings were performed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by Flowjow software (Tree Star Inc., San Carlos, CA). Transiently transfected cells with the individual ABCA1 cDNAs were gated manually for ABCA1 expression as reflected by EGFP relative fluorescence intensity. Binding data were calculated from the mean of Cy5-ApoA-I relative fluorescence intensity on the selected cell populations. The induced binding was calculated as the point to point difference between the EGFP-positive and -negative cells and was expressed as a percent of the binding induced by the wild-type ABCA1 construct. Statistical analysis was carried out using a paired Student's t test. Efflux of phospholipid was performed as described previously (8Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

For each individual experiment, polyclonal cells expressing the pcDNA5/FRT wild-type ABCA1, S1042A, S2054A, or S1042A/S2054A mutants were plated in triplicate at a density of 80,000 per well in 24 well dishes and labeled with 10 μCi per ml [3H]choline (Amersham Biosciences) in 2 ml of DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Twenty-four h after labeling, cells were first washed with equilibration medium (DMEM containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) and then equilibrated in the same medium for 1 h. The media were then replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM in the presence or absence of 10 μg per ml ApoA-I and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, which was established to be within the linear range of the assay. Media was collected by spinning cells down at 14,000 × g for 5 min followed by transfer of 0.4 ml into a glass test tube. Cell pellets were lysed in 250 μl of 0.2% SDS by rocking for 10 min at room temperature and transferred to a second glass test tube. Remaining cellular debris was collected by washing the wells with 0.25 ml of water and pooling this with the 0.2% SDS lysates. Lipids were extracted by a 30-s vortex with a 1.5-ml chloroform:methanol mixture (1:2, v/v) followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, 0.5 ml of water and 0.5 ml of chloroform was added, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm at room temperature. The top phase was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of methanol by vortexing. Samples were then mixed with scintillation fluid and quantitated by liquid scintillation. Percent efflux was calculated by determining the ratio of counts released into the medium over the total counts. All phospholipid efflux data from independent experiments were normalized by densitometric analysis of ABCA1 protein by Western blot analysis. One-way ANOVA with a Neuman-Keuls post-test (Graphpad Prism) was used to detect significant differences among samples. For fractionation of phospholipids by TLC, cells were labeled with 10 μCi per ml [3H]choline and treated with ApoA-I and processed as described above. The chloroform/methanol extracts were dried under vacuum and suspended in 35 μl of chloroform. Samples were then loaded onto Whatman LK5D silica plates and developed in a TLC chamber containing a chloroform:methanol:water mixture (65:25:4) (v/v). Labeled choline-containing phospholipids, identified by their co-migration with pure standards, were visualized by autoradiography and then quantitated by scanning densitometry.

However, the histamine receptor on the postsynaptic, target neuron involved in photoreceptor synaptic transmission has not been identified definitively, either in vivo or in vitro. From whole-cell recordings of dissociated large laminar monopolar neurons, L1/L2, to which the major class of fly photoreceptors (R1–6) synapse, Hardie (2Hardie R.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the responses of L1/L2 are mediated through chloride channels that are most likely gated directly by histamine. However, until recently, all histamine receptors identified were G protein-coupled receptors (3Gantz I. Schaffer M. DelValle J. Logsdon C. Campbell V. Uhler M. Yamada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that two of the genes identified in the Drosophila Genome Project data base encode chloride channel subunits that are sensitive to histamine when expressed in oocytes. However, evidence that they are, indeed, the receptors involved in synaptic transmission from photoreceptors is still not available. Moreover, in vivo functions of the newly identified chloride channels remain unelucidated. In this work, we approached the identification of the presumptive histamine receptor for photoreceptor synaptic transmission genetically using the fruit fly Drosophila. The fly electroretinogram (ERG),1 the extracellularly recorded, light-evoked mass response of the eye, consists of a sustained, corneal negative, receptor component and transient components at the onset and offset of light stimulus (see Fig.3 A). A body of evidence has suggested from early on that the on and off transients of the ERG originate from the large laminar monopolar neurons, L1 and L2 (summarized in Refs. 10Buchner E. J. Neurogenet. 1991; 7: 153-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 11Pak W.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2340-2357PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus hypothesized that the on/off transient-defective mutants are deficient in synaptic transmission (12Pak W.L. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 3. Plenum, New York1975: 703-733Google Scholar). Indeed, every mutant known to be defective in synaptic transmission isolated to date has been shown to lack or to have reduced on/off transients (e.g. Refs.13Burg M.G. Sarthy P.V. Koliantz G.

Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2340-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pak W.L. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 3. Plenum, New York1975: 703-733Google Scholar, 18Pak W.L. Breakfield X.

(2002) in Receptors and Channels (Chidiak, P., ed) in press.Google Scholar) were those with defective on/off transients but a normal receptor component. We hypothesized that, among these transient-defective mutants isolated might be those harboring mutations in the gene(s) encoding subunits of the histamine receptor in the L1/L2 neurons. Accordingly, we assayed representative members of this class of mutants for defects in the responses of L1/L2 to bath application of histamine for the purpose of isolating the corresponding gene. We show that mutants of a single complementation group, named ort (for “ora transientless”) (20O'Tousa J.E. Leonard D.S. Pak W.L. J. Neurogenet. 1989; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), have defective responses of L1/L2 and that the complementation group corresponds to the gene,CG7411, identified in the DrosophilaGenome Project data base. The gene encodes a chloride channel subunit, which is expressed in the lamina and has been shown to form histamine-sensitive chloride channels in the Xenopus oocyte expression system (8Zheng Y. Hirschberg B. Yuan J. Wang A.P. Hunt D.C. Ludmerer S.W. Schmatz D.M. Cully D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2000-2005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Gisselmann G.

There are seven known alleles of ortin our collection: ort P306,ort P364, ort US2515,ort US6096, ort US1471,ort US1606, and ora JK84. The first two of these were isolated in the Pak laboratory, and the remainder were isolated in the J. Merriam laboratory at UCLA, both by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. Flies homozygous forort US1471 and ort US1606have low viability, reproduce poorly, and are kept on a balancer.ora JK84 is a double mutant with lesions in bothort and the opsin gene, ninaE (20O'Tousa J.E.

These three alleles were not used in the present work. ora JK84,ort US1471, ort US1606, andort US6096 are referred to asort 1, ort 2,ort 3, and ort 5, respectively, by Lindsley and Zimm (21Lindsley D.L. Zimm G. Drosophila Information Service. 1990; 68: 100-101Google Scholar). The others are not listed. Three of the 13 mutants used in whole cell recordings of L1/L2 (JK1285, JK1669, and JK1469) (see legend to Fig. 2) were also isolated in the Merriam laboratory at UCLA. The remaining 10 were isolated in the Pak laboratory. Oregon R was used as the wild-type control strain throughout. The ERGs were recorded as described in Larrivee et al. (22Larrivee D.C. Conrad S.K. Stephenson R.S. Pak W.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 521-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using glass microelectrodes filled with Hoyle's saline. The light stimuli originated from a tungsten halogen lamp (Bausch & Lomb) and were delivered to the preparation with a fiber optics light guide. The light was attenuated with neutral density filters as needed and filtered with a sharp cut orange filter (Corning CS 2–73 or Schott OG 590) for orange stimuli. The unattenuated intensity at the level of the fly was approximately 47 milliwatts/cm2. Dissociated laminar neurons were prepared as previously described (23Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) from 1-day-old flies. Briefly, retinas with attached laminas were dissected from about five fly heads in calcium-free Ringer and incubated for 30 min in the same solution with 3 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma type I). After washing in Ringer with added fetal calf serum (10%), the retinas and laminas were triturated using fire-polished pipettes, before plating in a Perspex recording chamber on the stage of a Zeiss IM inverted microscope. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made from cell bodies of the appropriate size (∼4–7 μm for L1/L2) using electrodes of resistance ∼10 megaohms. Series resistance values were generally below 25 megaohms and were routinely compensated to 80%. Data were collected and analyzed using an Axopatch one-dimensional amplifier and pCLAMP 5 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). After forming the whole-cell configuration, L1/L2 cell bodies were gently raised from the coverslip and brought in front of the perfusion device. This device consisted of a perspex block with 10 0.5-mm-square cross-section channels separated by 0.2-mm walls, firmly mounted in the chamber. Each channel was gravity-fed by a separate perfusion line containing either a wash (Ringer) or a test (histamine) solution. Each pair of channels with different histamine concentrations was separated by one containing Ringer. Rapid (less than 20-ms) solution changes were made by translating the stage with the attached perfusion device across the L1/L2 cell, held motionless with respect to the perfusion device. By moving the stage twice in opposite directions, this maneuver allowed each of six different histamine concentrations to be applied, each histamine application alternating with a Ringer wash. Standard Ringer consisted of 138 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm TES, pH adjusted to 7.15. Intracelluar solution contained 120 mm KCl, 2 mm KOH, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm TES. Histamine was obtained as an HCl salt (Sigma). Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from fly heads was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA using oligo(dT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Several sets of gene-specific primers were designed based on sequences obtained from the Drosophila data base (Flybase; www.flybase.org/) and used to amplify hclA cDNA. The 5′- and 3′-ends of thehclA transcript were obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a RACE kit (Invitrogen). For mutant sequence analysis, the genomic region encompassing thehclA-coding region in ort mutant alleles was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Selected clones were either sequenced manually or sent to the Iowa State University Sequencing Facility to be sequenced. The fidelity of sequences was checked by performing three sets of sequencing reactions for each region sequenced. To verify that the hclA gene is within the mapped limits of the ort gene, wild-type flies were crossed with the three deficiency stocks used in deficiency mapping of ort, Df(3R)ora12,Df(3R)oraB16, and Df(3R)Dl-X43. Genomic DNA samples were isolated from their F1 progeny heterozygous for each deficiency and digested with EcoRI. Equal amounts of digestion products (∼4 μg) were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The Southern blot was probed with 32P-labeled hclAgenomic DNA or a 6.7-kb genomic DNA fragment from an entirely different gene, as positive control. Ligand-gated chloride channel subunit sequences were aligned using the ClustalW (accurate) program (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Givson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) and optimized manually. For phylogeny analysis, parsimonious trees were constructed by the Protpars program using PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) version 3.53c, distributed by the author, J. Felsenstein (University of Washington, Seattle). The order of input sequences was jumbled 10 times. The consensus tree was generated by the Consense program using the majority rule method to determine the most parsimonious tree. Flies were raised at 25 °C under 12-h light/12-h dark illumination cycles. Flies of 0–1 day posteclosion were collected, and heads were separated from bodies. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from wild-type heads, wild-type bodies, and heads of the eya (for “eyes absent”) mutant and four ort allelic mutants, ort P306, ort P364,ort US2515, and ort US6096, by using a PolyATtract 1000 mRNA Isolation Kit (Promega). Theeya mutants were included to identify transcripts that are expressed predominantly in the eye, since they lack the compound eyes and most of the lamina (25Sved J. Drosophila Information Service. 1986; 63: 169Google Scholar, 26Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.5 μg of total mRNA were loaded in each lane, and the samples were separated by electrophoresis, blotted onto Hybond N membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and UV-cross-linked to the membrane. The RNA blot was probed with32P-labeled hclA cDNA. As a loading control, the same blots were reprobed with ribosomal rp49 cDNA (27O'Connell P.O. Rosbash M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5495-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). All probes were radiolabeled with random primers. Hybridization and stringency washes were performed at 68 °C using standard protocols. To generate transgenic flies carrying hclA cDNA in anort background, 2.2-kb hclA cDNA was cloned into the NotI site of the CaSpeR-hs transformation vector. This vector contains the promoter of the heat shock gene,hsp70, to allow heat-induced, ubiquitous expression of inserted cDNA. The vector harboring the cloned cDNA was coinjected with helper plasmid into early embryos (28Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar) ofort P306, which also carried the mutationwhite (w). Transformant lines were isolated with the help of an eye color marker gene (mini-w +) contained in the transformation vector. Over a dozen independent transformant lines were obtained. All experimental flies were kept at 19 °C except for periods of heat shock treatment. Heat shock treatment was carried out by exposing the pupae to 35 °C for 1 h/day for 5 days or until eclosion. Sibling transformants that were not exposed to heat shock served as controls. ERG recordings were performed within 24 h after eclosion. Coronal head sections (10 μm thick) were cut with a cryostat from wild-type flies, marked with white (w), embedded in Tissue Tech medium, and equilibrated at −17 °C. The tissue sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, delipidized with chloroform, and treated with proteinase K. RNA probes were synthesized using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The first 147-bp stretch of the hclA coding sequence was used to synthesize probes, because this region showed the least homology with coding sequences of genes encoding other known Drosophilaligand-gated channel subunits. The 147-bp stretch was subcloned into the pSPT18 vector, the DNA template was linearized with restriction enzymes downstream of the cloned insert, and the sense and antisense RNA probes were synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin-UTP byin vitro transcription with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively. After the completion of transcription, the template DNA in the synthesis mixture was removed by incubation with DNase I. The sizes of the labeled RNA probes were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the labeled RNA probes were quantified by dot blot analysis. The sense and antisense RNA probes were diluted to the same concentration in hybridization buffer (4× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 2 mm EDTA, 60% formamide, 250 μg/ml tRNA in DEPC-treated water). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 16 h. Following stringency washes, the hybridized RNA probes on tissue sections were visualized by a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Slides containing tissue sections hybridized with sense and antisense RNA probes were processed in parallel. To determine whether any of the mutants with no or underdeveloped on/off transients of the ERG in our collection might be defective in the histamine receptor in L1/L2 neurons, 15 mutants of this class, each from a different complementation group (i.e. each representing a different gene), were analyzed by whole cell recordings. These mutants were chosen for analysis because of their robust and clear cut ERG phenotypes, consisting of consistent absence or underdevelopment of on/off transients and relatively normal receptor components. The histamine-activated chloride conductance can be readily detected in wild-type fruit flies by whole-cell patch clamp recordings from the cell bodies of freshly dissociated laminar neurons, L1/L2 (2Hardie R.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To rapidly characterize the conductance, its dose response function was measured using a 10-channel, rapid perfusion system, which allowed sequential application of six different histamine concentrations ([Ha]) separated by bath washes (see “Experimental Procedures”) (23Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The data were fitted to the Hill equation, I/Imax=([Ha]/EC50)n/1+([Ha]/EC50)nEquation 1 to determine the mean effective concentration (EC50) and Hill coefficient (n). In wild-type (Oregon R) laminar neurons, the channels were rapidly and reversibly activated by histamine with an EC50 of ∼20 μm and with a cooperativity (n) of ∼2.5 (23Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Figs.1, A and D, and2). In most of the mutants, the histamine-activated conductance appeared indistinguishable from wild type (Figs. 1, B and D, and 2). However, a clear difference was detected in one, ort P306 (20O'Tousa J.E. Leonard D.S. Pak W.L. J. Neurogenet. 1989; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the laminar neurons still showed robust histamine-activated currents, much higher concentrations were required, with the EC50 being shifted to ∼10-fold higher concentrations (190 ± 77 μm, n = 9) without any obvious effect on the cooperativity (Figs. 1, C andD, and 2). The dramatic shift in EC50 was strongly suggestive of a direct effect on the channel protein itself. Furthermore, the shift seemed sufficiently large to result in the failure of effective synaptic transmission and, hence, the loss of ERG transients. It thus seemed likely that the mutation was in a gene encoding at least one subunit of the histamine-gated chloride channel in L1/L2. The following four ort alleles were examined in this report: ort P306,ort P364, ort US2515, andort US6096. Mutants homozygous for these alleles or bearing heteroallelic combinations lack the on/off transients of the ERG. Fig. 3 Acompares the ERG of a wild-type fly with that obtained fromort P306. The on/off transients of the ERG (arrows), present in wild type (Fig. 3 A,top trace), are missing inort P306 (Fig. 3 A, bottom trace), whereas the receptor component of the ERG is normal (Fig. 3 A, bent arrow). The cytogenetic location of the ort gene was determined by deficiency mapping. The deficiency, Df(3R)ora12, which deletes 92A6 through 92D2, uncovered the ort phenotype, whereas two other deficiencies, Df(3R)oraB16, which deletes 92A4–11 through 92A12-B1, and Df(3R)Dl-X43, which deletes 91F11 through 92A11–13, failed to uncover the ort phenotype. Thus, theort locus was placed between 92A11 and 92B1 on the right arm of the third chromosome. Previous attempts to isolate the ort gene by chromosomal walking of this region were not successful (29Semenov E.P. Pak W.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, with the completion of the Drosophila Genome Project, it became possible to search the Drosophila genome for genes that are predicted to encode proteins bearing sequence homology to known proteins. If ort, indeed, encodes subunit(s) of a ligand-gated chloride channel, it might have been identified in theDrosophila Genome Project data base as one of the genes predicted to encode ligand-gated chloride channel subunits. TheDrosophila genome is predicted to contain 12 genes encoding proteins homologous to members of the GABAA/glycine receptor family (i.e. the ligand-gated chloride channel family). Two of them localize to the ort region,gluclα, previously identified (30Cully D.F. Paress P.S. Liu K.K. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20187-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), andCG7411 (designation in the DrosophilaGenome Annotation data base, herein designated as hclA), raising the possibility that hclA might be theort gene. In addition, a BLAST search of theDrosophila data base identified a second gene,CG14723 (designation in the DrosophilaGenome Annotation data base, herein designated as hclB), mapping to 86F9 and showing the highest homology to hclA(∼65% identity over the N-terminal 320 residues). Both these transcription units have been reported to encode proteins displaying histamine-sensitive chloride conductances when expressed inXenopus oocytes (8Zheng Y. Hirschberg B. Yuan J. Wang A.P. Hunt D.C. Ludmerer S.W. Schmatz D.M. Cully D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2000-2005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Gisselmann G. Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For hclA to be a candidate gene for ort, it must fall within the mapped limits of ort (92A11–92B1). From deficiency mapping, theort gene is known to be within the deficiencyDf(3R)ora12 but outside the deficienciesDf(3R)oraB16 and Df(3R)Dl-X43 (see above). Accordingly, genomic Southern blots of wild type and flies heterozygous for these deficiencies (Df(3R)ora12/+,Df(3R)oraB16/+, and Df(3R)Dl-X43/+) were probed with a radiolabeled 1.5-kb hclA genomic fragment. If thehclA gene indeed resides within the mapped limits of theort locus, one would expect that the quantity ofhclA genomic DNA in Df(3R)ora12/+ is less than that in wild type, whereas that in Df(3R)oraB16/+ orDf(3R)Dl-X43/+ is the same as in wild type, since only theDf(3R)ora12-bearing third chromosome right arm would be missing the hclA gene. In agreement with this expectation, the Southern blot analysis detected a heavily labeled band in blots of wild-type, Df(3R)oraB16/+, and Df(3R)Dl-X43/+ but a lightly labeled band in that of Df(3R)ora12/+ (Fig.3 B). To isolate cDNA clones for these two presumptive chloride channel genes, several gene-specific primers were designed based on sequences in theDrosophila data base. Two cDNA clones, one for each gene, containing the complete open reading frames were isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR followed by 5′- and 3′-RACE. ThehclA cDNA (accession number AY049774) was 2163 bp long and contained 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of 348 and 557 bp, respectively. Because all clones generated by 5′-RACE contained the same start site and the clone generated by 3′ RACE ended in a small stretch of poly(A)+ tail, the hclA cDNA clone was presumed to be complete. The hclB cDNA clone (accession number AY049775) was 1550 bp long. It was missing a part of the 5′-untranslated region but contained a complete open reading frame. To establish definitively that the cloned hclA cDNA does correspond to the gene identified by ort mutants,hclA cDNA, driven by the heat-inducible promoter of the heat shock gene hsp70, was introduced into theort P306 mutant by P element-mediated germ line transformation. Transformants were reared at 19 °C and were exposed to 35 °C for 1 h per day at the pupal stage until eclosion to induce the promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). There were no clearly identifiable on/off transients in any of the transformants that were not heat-shocked (Fig.4 B; TableI). Thus, if hclA, indeed, corresponded to ort, there was no significant basal activity of the heat shock promoter at 19 °C. In heat-shocked transformants, however, robust on and off transients of sizable amplitudes were present consistently in every fly tested, although their amplitudes were markedly smaller than those of wild type (Fig. 4, A andC; Table I). Similar results were obtained from another transformant line tested. There are many reasons why the rescue of the transient amplitudes is not complete. For example, ubiquitous overexpression by heat shock promoter may not be compatible with normal expression of this gene, or complete rescue may require regulatory sequence(s) not present in the cDNA construct used for rescue. Furthermore, the level and timing of expression are not likely to be optimal without the native regulatory elements for transcription, and expression at inappropriate times could alter the subunit composition of heteromultimeric channels. On the other hand, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain consistent rescue if hclA andort were not one and the same. Thus, the fact that consistent and sizable rescue was obtained at all provided strong evidence that the cloned hclA cDNA corresponds to theort gene.Table IAnalysis of ERG on/off transients of the transformants with and without heat shockPeak receptor component amplitudeOn transient amplitudeOff transient amplitudeNormalized on transient amplitudeNormalized off transient amplitudemVWild type (n = 6)20.1 ± 2.14.2 ± 0.88.9 ± 0.64.2 ± 0.88.9 ± 0.6Transformant no heat shock (n = 11)17.8 ± 1.70.2 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.40.2 ± 0.40.6 ± 0.5Transformant heat shock (n = 9)17.4 ± 2.62.5 ± 0.73.0 ± 1.22.9 ± 0.83.5 ± 1.4Transformant flies had colored eyes because of themini-white + gene used as marker, whereas wild type flies used were white-eyed. The difference in the average peak receptor component amplitude is almost certainly due to the difference in eye color between wild type and transformant flies, since screening pigments giving rise to eye colors reduce the intensity of light stimulus. Indeed, white-eyed ort mutants gave similar receptor component amplitude as white-eyed wild type (Fig.3 A). The on/off transient amplitudes of the transformants shown in columns 5 and 6 were normalized with respect to the wild-type receptor component amplitudes to account for the general reduction in amplitudes in transformants. There were no clearly identifiable on/off transients in transformants that were not heat-shocked. Numerical values for these transients were obtained by measuring any small deflections of correct polarity occurring at appropriate times. Most of these “signals” were buried in noise, which had a peak to peak amplitude of 0.41 ± 0.09 mV (n = 30). The stimulus was 2-s white light attenuated with a neutral density f"

In the current study we examined the role that the DNA methylation machinery might be playing in regulating differential uPA gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. uPA mRNA is expressed in the highly invasive, hormone-insensitive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 but not in hormone-responsive cell line MCF-7. Using methylation-sensitive PCR, we show that 90% of CpG dinucleotides in the uPA promoter are methylated in MCF-7 cells, whereas fully demethylated CpGs were detected in MDA-MB-231 cells. uPA promoter activity, which is directly regulated by the Ets-1 transcription factor, is inhibited by methylation as determined by uPA promoter-luciferase reporter assays. We then tested whether the state of expression and methylation of the uPA promoter correlates with the global level of DNA methyltransferase and demethylase activities in these cell lines. We show that maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity is significantly higher in MCF-7 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas demethylase activity is higher in MDA-MB-231 cells. We suggest that the combination of increased DNA methyltransferase activity with reduced demethylase activity contributes to the methylation and silencing of uPA expression in MCF-7 cells. The converse is true in MDA-MB-231 cells, which represents a late stage highly invasive breast cancer. The histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, induces the expression of the uPA gene in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. This supports the hypothesis that DNA methylation is the dominant mechanism involved in the silencing of uPA gene expression. Taken together, these results provide insight into the mechanism regulating the transcription of the uPA gene in the complex multistep process of breast cancer progression.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)1and its cell surface glycophosphotidyl inositol-linked receptor (uPAR) play important roles in several malignancies (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N.

Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uPAR localizes the proteolytic effects of uPA within the tumor cell environment. Additionally, uPA enhances neovascularization of tumors thus further contributing to the process of tumor progression (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N.

Fourth, we have demonstrated previously that a peptide derived from the non-receptor binding domain of uPA (Å6) decreases breast cancer invasion, growth, and metastases because of its pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic effects (6Guo Y.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the expression of uPA, a well defined marker of highly invasive tumor cells and activated at the late stages of breast cancer, can be regulated via the changes in the methylation status of its promoter region. As a follow-up to our previous studies where we demonstrated that the uPA gene is transcriptionally suppressed by DNA methylation (21Xing R.H. Rabbani S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 443-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have now focused on the examination of the role of DNA demethylation and DNA methylating enzymes such as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and demethylase (DMase) in regulating uPA expression during breast cancer progression.DISCUSSIONuPA is now believed to play an important role in several cancers where increased uPA production is associated with late stages of cancer (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms responsible for regulation of uPA expression during tumor progression. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation is involved in the differential regulation of uPA during tumor progression. After fully characterizing several human breast cancer cell lines representing various stages of breast cancer, we focused on 2 cell lines, MCF-7, a hormone-sensitive and low invasive cell line that represents early stage human breast cancer, and MDA-MB-231 cells, which are hormone-insensitive and represent late stage breast cancer. Animals inoculated with MDA-MB-231 develop large tumors that can metastasize to several sites in vivo (6Guo Y. Higazi A.A. Arakelian A. Sachais B.S. Cines D. Goldfarb R.H. Jones T.R. Kwaan H. Mazar A.P. Rabbani S.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, levels of uPA expression correlate with tumor cell invasive capacity and provide a link between uPA expression and tumor stage (5Schmalfeldt B. Prechtel D. Harting K. Spathe K. Rutke S. Konik E. Fridman R. Berger U. Schmitt M. Kuhn W. Lengyel E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2396-2404PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rha S.Y. Yang W.I. Gong S.J. Kim J.J. Yoo N.C. Roh J.K. Min J.S. Lee K.S. Kim B.S. Chung H.C. Cancer Lett. 2000; 150: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using this model we examined whether the methylation status of the uPA gene plays a role in regulating the differential expression of this gene through the multistep process of tumor progression. Our data show that the methylation status of the uPA promoter correlates with its state of expression as demonstrated by methylation-sensitive endonuclease Southern blot analysis and sodium bisulfate mapping. DNA methylation plays a causal role in controlling the uPA expression, because the DNMT inhibitor 5-azaCdR induces the expression of uPA in MCF-7 cells and increases their invasive capacity. Further support for the causal role of DNA methylation in regulating uPA gene expression is drawn from experiments that show that in vitro methylation inhibits uPA promoter activity and its transactivation by the transcription factor Ets-1. Ets-1 is required for the expression of uPA in a number of tissues (31Nakada M. Yamashita J. Okada Y. Sato H. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Watabe T. Yoshida K. Shindoh M. Kaya M. Fujikawa K. Sato H. Seiki M. Ishii S. Fujinaga K. Int. J.

Pract. 2000; 196: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and interacts with sequences that are close to CpG dinucleotides as shown in Fig. 2. Methylation might inhibit uPA promoter activity by either inhibiting the interaction of Ets-1 with methylated CpGs in its recognition sequence or by recruiting methylated DNA-binding proteins that results in an inactive chromatin structure (12Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 39Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell.

These results demonstrate that the uPA promoter region involved in these effects contains an Ets-1 binding site; however, further experiments are required to determine the exact role of the Ets-1 site.Aberrations in the DNA methylation machinery resulting in global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation are well documented in cancer. It has been suggested that induction of both DNMT and DMase activities might play a role in the complex changes in DNA methylation observed in cancer cells (15Szyf M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D599-D609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, most of the attention in the field has been directed to the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells and its potential role in tumorigenesis (41Yang X. Yan L. Davidson N.E. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A large number of studies have demonstrated that inhibition of DNMT reverses tumor growth, and in addition, antisense DNMT1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials (42Lubbert M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 249: 135-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 43MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Our data, however, suggests that the involvement of methylation in tumorigenesis is more complex and that hypomethylation of certain genes might play a critical role in tumor progression. Therefore, activities that are responsible for demethylating genes required for tumor invasion might be important anti-cancer targets.Our data are consistent with a model in which DNMT and DMase activities are expressed differentially and play distinct roles at different stages of tumor progression (Fig. 8). Early stage cancer cells such as MCF-7 show higher maintenance DNMT activity that may be required for maintaining the transformed state and involved in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. However, in the later stages of tumor progression, increased DMase activity is vital to induce the expression of genes that are silenced by DNA methylation but are critical for tumor invasion such as uPA. We show that in later stage MDA-MB-231 cells, maintenance DNMT activity is reduced whereas DMase activity is increased. It has been shown previously that ectopic expression of the ras oncogene can lead to increased DMase activity, and an active DMase was purified recently from human lung carcinoma cells (29Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S.K. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6107-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 45Szyf M. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12690-12696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear which of the DMases is specifically induced in MCF-7 cells, and further experiments are required to characterize this DMase. Nevertheless our results demonstrate that DNA methylation activities do undergo distinct changes during tumor progression and might play different roles at specific stages. The breakdown of the extracellular matrix involves a variety of growth factors and proteases and is an important step in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mueller B.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)1and its cell surface glycophosphotidyl inositol-linked receptor (uPAR) play important roles in several malignancies (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). uPA produced by tumor cells and the surrounding stroma is intimately involved in tumor cell invasion, migration, and proliferation (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uPAR localizes the proteolytic effects of uPA within the tumor cell environment. Additionally, uPA enhances neovascularization of tumors thus further contributing to the process of tumor progression (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous data demonstrate the causal role of uPA in tumor growth and metastasis (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, expression of uPA or uPAR was shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis (3Frandsen T.L. Holst-Hansen C. Nielsen B.S. Christensen I.J. Nyengaard J.R. Carmeliet P. Brunner N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xing R.H. Rabbani S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, increased uPA gene expression in various malignancies including breast cancer is closely related with disease stage (1Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 393-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schmalfeldt B. Prechtel D. Harting K. Spathe K. Rutke S. Konik E. Fridman R. Berger U. Schmitt M. Kuhn W. Lengyel E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2396-2404PubMed Google Scholar). Third, inoculation of human breast cancer cells in mice lacking the uPA gene results in tumors of significantly smaller volume than tumors implanted in wild type mice (3Frandsen T.L. Holst-Hansen C. Nielsen B.S. Christensen I.J. Nyengaard J.R. Carmeliet P. Brunner N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, we have demonstrated previously that a peptide derived from the non-receptor binding domain of uPA (Å6) decreases breast cancer invasion, growth, and metastases because of its pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic effects (6Guo Y. Higazi A.A. Arakelian A. Sachais B.S. Cines D. Goldfarb R.H. Jones T.R. Kwaan H. Mazar A.P. Rabbani S.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifth, the active site inhibitor of uPA (B-428), alone or in combination with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen, blocks the growth and metastasis of prostate and breast cancers (7Xing R.H. Mazar A. Henkin J. Rabbani S.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3585-3593PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rabbani S.A. Harakidas P. Davidson D.J. Henkin J. Mazar A.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Sixth, antibodies directed against uPA or uPAR are able to decrease tumor growth (9Ignar D.M. Andrews J.L. Witherspoon S.M.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). DNA methylation marks inactive genes and can suppress gene expression directly by interfering with the binding of transcription factors or indirectly by attracting methylated DNA binding factors that recruit histone deacetylases and precipitate an inactive chromatin structure (12Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 13Momparler R.L. Bovenzi V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are commonly observed in cancer (13Momparler R.L. Bovenzi V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Neoplastic cells have the ability to simultaneously harbor widespread hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation that contribute to tumor progression (13Momparler R.L. Bovenzi V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 14Gama-Sosa M.A. Slagel V.A. Trewyn R.W. Oxenhandler R. Kuo K.C. Gehrke C.W. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Whereas hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes has attracted much attention recently (13Momparler R.L. Bovenzi V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Szyf M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D599-D609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Van Zee K.J. Calvano J.E. Bisogna M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2723-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying hypomethylation of tumor progression factors such asras,myc,hox11, andxmrk that are up-regulated during cancer development are poorly described. This suggests that hypomethylation may also play an important role in regulating gene expression during tumorigenesis similar to hypermethylation (17Watt P.M. Kumar R. Kees U.R.

Our data, however, suggests that the involvement of methylation in tumorigenesis is more complex and that hypomethylation of certain genes might play a critical role in tumor progression. Therefore, activities that are responsible for demethylating genes required for tumor invasion might be important anti-cancer targets. Our data are consistent with a model in which DNMT and DMase activities are expressed differentially and play distinct roles at different stages of tumor progression (Fig. 8). Early stage cancer cells such as MCF-7 show higher maintenance DNMT activity that may be required for maintaining the transformed state and involved in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. However, in the later stages of tumor progression, increased DMase activity is vital to induce the expression of genes that are silenced by DNA methylation but are critical for tumor invasion such as uPA. We show that in later stage MDA-MB-231 cells, maintenance DNMT activity is reduced whereas DMase activity is increased. It has been shown previously that ectopic expression of the ras oncogene can lead to increased DMase activity, and an active DMase was purified recently from human lung carcinoma cells (29Ramchandani S.

It is not yet clear which of the DMases is specifically induced in MCF-7 cells, and further experiments are required to characterize this DMase. Nevertheless our results demonstrate that DNA methylation activities do undergo distinct changes during tumor progression and might play different roles at specific stages.

We also showed that the increased mRNA levels are mainly due to increased mRNA stability mediated by sequences within the 4.5-kb 3′-UTR of the 7.9-kb cat-1 mRNA (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L.

It is shown here that an 11-residue AU-rich element in the distal 217 bases of the 3′-UTR is required for increased mRNA stability during amino acid starvation. Moreover, this element functions in both the cat-1 mRNA and in a chimeric mRNA. To begin to address the mechanism of mRNA stabilization during amino acid starvation, the interaction of the cat-1 mRNA with HuR protein was examined. HuR is a ubiquitously-expressed member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) family of RNA-binding proteins (reviewed in Refs. 13Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 14Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This protein is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. It shuttles between these two compartments, and it may play a role in mRNA export from the nucleus (15Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). HuR has been shown to bind to AU-rich elements in many mRNAs and to play a role in the stabilization of these mRNAs (13Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Finally, HuR functions are regulated. Several cellular stresses, including UV irradiation, heat shock, and actinomycin D shift HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (17Peng S.S. Chen C.Y., Xu, N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 18Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell.

A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in mRNA stability caused by these stresses may be mediated by HuR. We show that HuR binds to the AU-rich element in the 3′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA. Moreover, starvation causes HuR accumulation in the cytoplasm. Finally, the ability of cytoplasmic HuR to bind to the cat-1 AU-rich element shows a transient increase during amino acid starvation and these changes match the time course of cat-1 mRNA accumulationin vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that HuR may play a role in stabilizing the cat-1 mRNA during amino acid deprivation. C6 rat glioma cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium. Amino acid-fed cells were cultured in dialyzed fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM/F12 (Fed), whereas cells were amino acid depleted by culturing in dialyzed fetal bovine serum-supplemented Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (Starved). Cells were transfected with the tetcat-1 or pCAT plasmids along with an expression vector containing the neogene, and stable lines were selected in 0.1% G418. The ptetcat-1 vector contains the cat-1 cDNA (+1 to 6453, Fig. 1 A) under the transcriptional control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W.

The first 80 bases of the tetcat-1 mRNA are from the tet promoter. The ptetcat-1/Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 expression vectors (Fig. 1) were generated by deleting sequences from the 3′-UTR of wild type ptetcat-1 (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ptetcat-1/Δ1 was generated by deleting the StuI/NdeI fragment (2277–3470). ptetcat-1/Δ2 was generated by deleting theNdeI/EcoRV fragment (3470–4786). ptetcat-1/Δ3 was generated by deleting theHindIII fragment (4310–5894). ptetcat-1/Δ4 and ptetcat-1/Δ5 were generated in two steps using PCR-based methods. First, a BstEII restriction site was introduced at position 6445 between the polyadenylation signal, AATAAA (position 6432) and the polyadenylation site (position 6453). mRNA from this vector accumulated during amino acid deprivation similarly to thetetcat-1 mRNA (Fig. 1 D, con). To generate ptetcat-1/Δ4 -ptetcat-1/Δ6, the 759-bpBstEII fragment (5695–6453) was replaced with truncatedBstEII fragments containing residues 5695–6078 (ptetcat-1/Δ4) and 5695–6236 (ptetcat-1/Δ5). ptetcat-1/Δ4-AUmut was generated by mutating residues 6268–6279 of the cat-1 cDNA sequence, (TATTTTATTTTA) to GATGGATGGTA in ptetcat-1/Δ4. ptetcat-1/Δ6 was generated by replacing the BstEII fragment (5695–6453), which contains the 3′-end of the cat-1 gene, with the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence. pCAT was the pCAT®3 control vector from Promega. pCAT/UTR was constructed by inserting theBstEII fragment from ptetcat-1 into theXbaI/HpaI sites of pCAT by blunt-end ligation. This fragment contains residues 5965–6453 from the cat-13′-UTR and the SV40 late polyadenylation region. RNAs were detected by Northern blotting using the following 32P-labeled DNA probes: tet is a 157-bp KpnI fragment from ptetcat-1 that contains the first 70 bp of the tetcat-1 RNA (10Aulak K.S.

This probe hybridizes to the tetcat-1 RNAs but not the endogenous cat-1 mRNA. 5′-cat-1 is a 0.1-kb fragment from the first exon of the cat-1 gene (6Fernandez J.M. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A.E. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J.O. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 29Google Scholar) that hybridizes to endogenous cat-1 mRNA but not the tetcat-1 RNAs. cat-1 was the entire cat-1 cDNA. This probe detects both endogenous cat-1 and tetcat-1 RNAs. Asparagine synthase (AS) was detected using a 900-bp fragment of the AS cDNA (20Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 18 S ribosomal RNA was detected with a 5.8-kb fragment containing the 18 S mouse ribosomal DNA (21Katz R.A. Erlanger B.F. Guntaka R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 739: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RNAs from pCAT and pCAT/UTR were detected with a probe from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase DNA. Western blot analysis of HuR, AUF1, and actin proteins were carried out using the appropriate antibodies. The HuR antibody, a generous gift of H. M. Fourneaux, has been described previously (22Rodriguez-Pascual F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Forstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26040-26049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The AUF1 antibody was generated as follows: a cDNA expressing the 37-kDa isoform of AUF1 (provided by Dr. Gary Brewer, UMDNJ), was subcloned into a T7-dependent bacterial expression system. p37AUF1 protein was produced in Escherichia coli and used to raise a rabbit polyclonal antibody. The antibody was affinity purified. The anti-actin antibody (H-196) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were generated as follows: Cells (108) were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted and suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were kept on ice for 10 min, during which time they were sheared 5 times through a 25-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved as cytoplasmic lysate. The pellet was suspended in nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.225 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sheared by passing through a 27-gauge needle and kept on ice for 15 min. Nuclear extracts were obtained by collecting the supernatant after a 14,000 rpm spin for 10 min at 4°. Extracts were kept at −80 °C until use. 32P-labeled RNA probes (specific activity 1.5 × 107 cpm/μg) were generated byin vitro transcription of PCR-generated DNA templates containing the T7 promoter (Ambion), followed by gel purification. The wild-type RNA had the sequence of residues 6232–6308 of the cat-1 cDNA. The AUmut RNA had GAUGGAUGGUA substituted for UAUUUUAUUUUA beginning at residue 6268 of the rat cat-1 cDNA. RNA binding reactions were performed by incubating cell lysates (0.6 mg of protein/ml) in the presence of 5 mg/ml heparin for 15 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of [32P]RNA (105 cpm/15-μl reaction) for an additional 20 min. Antibodies were then added for 1 h on ice. Complexes were resolved on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. To analyze proteins bound to the RNA, samples were irradiated for 30 min on ice in a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene), followed by incubation with RNase T1 (0.2 units) and RNase A (20 μg) at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis on 7.5% gels. Cells were plated on Lab-Tec chamber slides 36 h before the experiment. Cells were fed with fresh medium for 12 h and then incubated in amino acid-containing or amino acid-depleted medium for the indicated times. After treatment, cells were fixed in freshly-prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were then quenched in 25 mmglycine in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% fish gelatin, and 0.02% saponin. Samples were incubated with antibody to HuR (20 μg/ml) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times for 15 min in blocking buffer and then incubated with Oregon Green-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:300) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h in blocking buffer. Slides were finally washed three times for 15 min in blocking buffer and twice for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline. Slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined with either a BioRad confocal microscope or a Nikon microscope. At least four separate preparations were examined for each condition. Nonspecific staining, assessed by incubating the cells in the absence of primary antibody, was negligible. mRNAs of ∼7.9 and ∼3.4 kb are synthesized from the cat-1 gene. These mRNAs result from polyadenylation at two sites within the 3′-UTR (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-off studies have shown that the transcription rate of the cat-1gene does not change during amino acid limitation (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the stability of the 7.9 kb but not the 3.4 kb cat-1 mRNA increases in amino acid-depleted cells (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that sequences which regulate mRNA stability during amino acid starvation are contained within the 3.5 kb at the 3′-end of the 7.9 kb cat-1 mRNA that is not present in the 3.4 kb mRNA (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In order to identify the regulatory cis-mRNA sequences, a series of cDNAs with truncations in the 3′-UTR of the 7.9 kb mRNA were generated (Fig.1 A). These cDNAs were linked to a tetracycline-inducible promoter in an expression vector, transfected into C6 cells, and mRNA levels were measured in control and amino acid-depleted cells (Fig. 1,B–F). It was previously shown that transcription of the wild-type tetcat-1 cDNA in this vector system is not affected by nutrient deprivation and can be induced by doxycycline (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, doxycycline was not used in these studies; the low expression under these conditions provided an ideal system for studying the accumulation of mRNA during amino acid deprivation. The effects of amino acid deprivation on the expression oftetcat-1 and endogenous cat-1 mRNAs were examined on Northern blots, using probes (tet and 5′-cat-1) that are specific for tetcat-1 and cat-1 mRNAs, respectively. Amino acid deprivation for 4 h caused increases in both the chimeric tetcat-1mRNA (Fig. 1 B, con-wt) and the endogenous 7.9 kb cat-1 mRNA, consistent with our previous results. Similar increases in mRNA levels were seen for all the constructs that contained the 3′-terminal 217 bases. Deletions of different parts of bases 2277–6236 (tetcat-1/Δ1 − tetcat-1/Δ5 in Fig. 1,B–E) did not affect induction of the chimeric mRNAs by amino acid starvation. For all these constructs, increases of 5- to 10-fold were seen, a level similar to wild type. In thetetcat-1/Δ2 transfectant shown in Fig. 1 B, the amount of cat-1/7.9 mRNA did not increase during amino acid deprivation, possibly due to titration of factors by the transfected mRNA. Consequently, samples from a second transfectant were analyzed by probing with the cat-1 probe, which hybridizes to both endogenous and tetcat-1 RNAs. In this case, amino acid deprivation stimulated the accumulation of both RNAs (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, tetcat-1/Δ6, which does not contain the 3′-terminal 758 bases (residues 5695–6453) was not induced by amino acid starvation (Fig. 1 F). Two tetcat-1 mRNAs are seen. The cat-1 polyadenylation site is missing in this construct, so these two RNAs arise from polyadenylation at vector sequences. Neither of these RNAs increased during starvation. In contrast, when the same blot is probed with the cat-1 probe, which detects both endogenous and tetcat-1 RNAs, the endogenous mRNA is seen to increase. Because some of the region that is deleted in tetcat-1/Δ6 (5695–6235) is present in the tetcat-1/Δ4 and Δ5 constructs, which show the starvation-induced mRNA accumulation, we conclude that the sequences required for induction are in residues 6236–6453. These regulatory sequences are present in all of the constructs except tetcat-1/Δ6. In all cell lines, accumulation of the endogenous cat-1 and asparagine synthase (AS) mRNAs was induced by amino acid starvation, confirming the adaptive response of the cells (11Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AU-rich elements in the 3′-UTR are known to regulate mRNA stability (13Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Several of these elements are found in the 759-base region that is deleted from tetcat-1/Δ6, the mRNA whose level is not increased by amino acid deprivation. There are two single AUUUA elements (position 5831 and 5858) and one overlapping AUUUUAUUUUA element (position 6268). The single AREs are probably not important for regulating stability because one is deleted in tetcat-1/Δ4 and other is deleted in tetcat-1/Δ5. Despite these deletions, both of these mRNAs accumulate to levels similar to the control during amino acid deprivation (Fig. 1 E). However, deletion of the entire distal 759 bases that contains the overlapping AU motif at position 6268 resulted in complete loss of regulation of the tetcat-1/Δ6 RNA (Fig. 1 F), suggesting that this sequence is important in regulation of mRNA stability. The importance of this sequence was tested directly by mutating the overlapping AU motif in the tetcat-1/Δ4 RNA (Fig.1 A). The mutated mRNA (tetcat-1/Δ4-AUmut) only showed a 50% increase during amino acid starvation (Fig.1 G), demonstrating that this 11-residue element is essential for induction of cat-1 mRNA levels. This AU-rich element is the shortest sequence known to be required for the regulation of mRNA stability (13Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this is the first demonstration of an AU-rich sequence that regulates mRNA stability in response to amino acid starvation. The distal 217 base region of the cat-1 mRNA 3′-UTR that contains the critical 11-residue sequence will therefore be called the nutrient-sensor AU-rich element (NS-ARE). To prove that the NS-ARE mediates the increased mRNA stability during amino acid starvation, we showed that this element functions when it is present at the 3′-end of a chimeric mRNA. To accomplish this, mRNAs from two constructs that encode chloramphenicol acetyltransferase were studied. pCAT encodes an RNA containing the SV40 late polyadenylation signal (Fig.2 A). pCAT/UTR contains nucleotides 5696–6453 from the 3′-end of the cat-1 cDNA inserted in front of the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The RNA transcript from this construct, which contains two polyadenylation signals, has the potential to give rise to two mRNAs (Fig. 2 A). The amount of RNA from pCAT did not increase when transfected cells were starved for amino acids, even though there was a large increase in the amount of endogenous 7.9 kb cat-1 mRNA (Fig. 2 B). In cells transfected with pCAT/UTR, two RNAs were expressed (Fig.2 C). During amino acid deprivation, there was a 3-fold increase in the amount of the smaller mRNA, which results from polyadenylation at the cat-1 polyadenylation site. This demonstrates that the NS-ARE is capable of enhancing mRNA stability in a heterologous mRNA. The amount of the larger mRNA, which results from polyadenylation at the SV40 site, also increased during deprivation, but only by 1.5-fold. This suggests that the NS-ARE stabilizes mRNAs most effectively during amino acid deprivation when it is close to the 3′-end of the molecule. In this experiment, the level of endogenous cat-1 mRNA increased by 6-fold during starvation. Because this increase is greater than those seen for the CAT/UTR RNAs, it is possible that the 757 bp from the cat-1 mRNA that are present in CAT/UTR do not contain all the sequences required for mRNA stabilization. The importance of the cat-1 NS-ARE was further supported by the sequence analysis of the mouse 3′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA. A mouse EST clone (GenBankTM accession number, AV271225) was compared with the distal 3′-UTR of the rat cat-1 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the AUUUUAUUUUA element and the flanking sequences are fully conserved between the mouse and the rat cDNAs. This was further confirmed by sequencing of a mouse genomic DNA clone that was isolated in our laboratory (not shown). 2The sequence ATTTATTTTA (GenBankTMaccession number U704476, position +6268) should read ATTTTATTTTA. HuR, is an RNA-binding protein that has been suggested to bind AREs, leading to mRNA stabilization (13Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 14Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The most conserved ARE sequence among all HuR-binding mRNAs is the 11 nucleotide element, AUUUUAUUUUA (14Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), that is required for the starvation-induced stabilization of the cat-1 mRNA. HuR contains sequences that allow it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (15Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). HuR may bind target mRNAs in the nucleus and follow them to the cytoplasm, thus protecting them from degradation (19Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased cytoplasmic HuR levels may cause increased stability of ARE-containing mRNAs by binding in the cytoplasm (17Peng S.S. Chen C.Y., Xu, N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 18Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell.

A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we carried out experiments to determine whether HuR could be involved in the stabilization of the cat-1 mRNA during amino acid deprivation by the NS-ARE. First, we used cell fractionation and immunocytochemistry to test whether amino acid deprivation increases cytoplasmic levels of HuR. Analysis of HuR levels by Western blotting showed that amino acid starvation caused a 60% decrease of total HuR levels by 12 h (Fig.3 A). At the same time the levels of AUF1 (also known as HnRNP D), an ARE-binding protein, which is associated with increased mRNA decay (23Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), did not change (Fig.3 A). The specificity of the anti-AUF1 antibody was verified by performing a Western blot in the presence of the antigenic peptide p37AUF1 (Fig. 3 A). We next tested the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of HuR, by performing Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. In both fed and starved cells, the majority of the HuR was nuclear (Fig. 3 B). However, there was a large increase in the amount of cytoplasmic HuR after 4 h of amino acid deprivation. This change was not seen for AUF1. Analysis of HuR levels during a time course of amino acid deprivation showed that cytoplasmic HuR levels increased transiently. Levels at 3 and 6 h of starvation were 5-fold higher than in fed cells and returned to control levels by 9 h (Fig. 3 C). As expected, β-actin was only present in cytoplasmic extracts, confirming the purity of the cell fractions (Fig. 3 C). The findings that amino acid starvation alters HuR level and distribution are supported by immunocytochemistry (Fig.4). In control cells HuR was largely in the nucleus. However, after 4 h of amino acid starvation, nuclear HuR levels decreased and cytoplasmic HuR levels increased (Fig.4 A). This increase was more evident in amino acid-depleted than in heat-shocked cells, a treatment that has been previously shown to increase cytoplasmic HuR levels (19Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In fact, the effects of starvation are as large as those of actinomycin D, which also increases cytoplasmic HuR levels (Fig. 4 B and Ref. 19Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We next determined the distribution of HuR during a time course of amino acid starvation. Decreased nuclear HuR staining was visible by 1 h and the decrease continued for 9 h (Fig. 4 B). It was next demonstrated that the redistribution of HuR caused by amino acid depletion is reversed by amino acid refeeding. This was accomplished by depriving cells of amino acids for 6 h and then incubating in complete medium for an additional 3 h. Refeeding of starved cells resulted in increased HuR levels in the nucleus (Fig. 4 B,S6h/F3h), with a staining pattern similar to control cells. These data su"

Wild-type CD14 enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter activity in cells expressing TLR4/MD-2, and deletion of amino acid regions 35–44, 144–153, 235–243, and 270–275 impaired the TLR4-mediated activation. Unlike human CD14, mouse CD14 truncated at amino acid 151 lost the activity.

Deletion and alanine substitution experiments revealed that amino acids 151–153 and 273–275 were required for the TLR4-mediated activation. Both deletion mutants lacking amino acids 35–44 and 235–243 and alanine substitution mutants in regions 151–153 and 273–275 were expressed on the cell surface and retained the ability to associate with TLR4.

Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Since CD14 lacks transmembrane and intracellular domains, it is postulated that CD14 presents LPS to its signaling molecule, TLR4 (20Jiang Q. Akashi S. Miyake K. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3541-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

Thus, CD14 plays a critical role in discriminating bacterial products and dividing their signals into TLR4 or TLR2 depending on the nature of the product. We previously reported that lipid A preparations from various Salmonella strains and synthetic Salmonella-type lipid A (compound 516) possess very little stimulatory activity in human macrophages despite being potently active in murine macrophages (26Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lipid A preparations from Escherichia coli and synthetic E. coli-type lipid A (compound 506) were equally active in both human and murine macrophages (26Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, Salmonella lipid A shows animal species-specific actions. The mechanism of the animal species-specific actions of Salmonella lipid A is still unknown, but it may be attributable to species differences in the CD14 molecules in recognizing these lipid A molecules.

However, since no structural studies of mouse CD14, especially the regions of the mouse CD14 molecule required for TLR4/MD-2- or TLR2-mediated activation of NF-κB, had ever been performed, in the present study we investigated these regions by transiently transfecting 293 cells as a first step in clarifying the species-specific actions ofSalmonella lipid A.DISCUSSIONWe created three types of deletion mutants to investigate the structural requirement of mouse CD14 molecules for TLR4- and TLR2-mediated activations of NF-κB. The first type of deletion mutant (d35–44) lacked the region (amino acids 35–44) that corresponds to the region of human CD14 reported to be important for LPS recognition and signal transduction. The second type of deletion mutant (d144–153, d235–243, and d270–275) lacked regions conserved among species, and the third type of deletion mutant (d244–247 and d312–320) lacked regions that vary among species. We avoided the deletion of possible glycosylation sites of CD14 because they might release the CD14 molecule from the cell membrane by disrupting its GPI anchoring. Deletion of variable regions (d244–247 and d312–320) did not significantly affect either TLR2- or TLR4-mediated activation (Fig. 1,A and B). Deletion of conserved regions (d144–153, d235–243, and d270–275) always caused loss of either TLR2- or TLR4-mediated activation, indicating an important role of these conserved regions in mouse CD14 function. Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 35–44 caused loss of both LPS-induced TLR4-mediated activation and PEX-induced TLR2-mediated activation (Fig. 1,A and B). We used a phenol extract of E. coli O111:B4 LPS (PEX) to stimulate the TLR2-dependent pathway, because the LPS preparation repurified by the method described by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) did not stimulate this pathway (data not shown) as shown by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). We were also unable to use peptidoglycan and bacterial lipopeptides, which are known to be TLR2 ligands, because peptidoglycan yielded ambiguous results in our experimental system (data not shown), and the TLR2-mediated activity of a synthetic lipopeptide derived from E. coli murein lipoprotein, tripalmitoyl-Cys-Ser-Ser-Asn-Ala, was not dependent on CD14 (data not shown). The biochemical nature of the substance(s) contained in PEX is currently unknown. Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and Dziarski et al. (40Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported that bacterial lipoproteins or endotoxin proteins may be responsible for the activation of TLR2-dependent pathway. However, PEX-induced activation of NF-κB was clearly different in terms of CD14 dependence from that induced by bacterial lipoproteins. It is therefore likely that a substance(s) other than bacterial lipopeptides is responsible for the effect of PEX. Our finding that the d35–44 mutant had lost activity in response to PEX suggests involvement of an LPS-like substance(s) in the PEX-induced activation. An effort to identify the substance(s) contained in PEX is currently in progress in our laboratory.To identify the molecular mechanism responsible for the loss of TLR4-mediated activity by the CD14 mutants, we tested them for membrane surface expression, and the results showed that they were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 5). Since close interaction between CD14 and TLR4 has been suggested to participate in LPS signaling (20Jiang Q. Akashi S. Miyake K. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3541-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we investigated the association between CD14 mutants and TLR4, and, as shown in Fig. 6, the results showed that TLR4 was co-precipitated with all mutants (d35–44, 151–153A, d235–243, and 273–275A). Therefore, these regions of mouse CD14 are unlikely to play a significant role in the interaction with TLR4. Our result also suggested that deletion or substitution of these regions does not cause any destructive change in the structure of CD14. In the present study, an association between CD14 and TLR4 was detected by the co-immunoprecipitation technique regardless of MD-2 expression, although our data do not necessarily mean a direct interaction between CD14 and TLR4. Co-precipitation of MD-2 with CD14 was also detected when MD-2 was co-expressed with CD14 and TLR4, but no co-precipitation of MD-2 was detected when CD14 and MD-2 were expressed without TLR4. It is therefore likely that MD-2 was co-precipitated with CD14 through the interaction between MD-2 and TLR4.The amino acid regions of CD14 between 144–153 and 270–275 were investigated in detail in this study, because these regions were found to be selectively involved in TLR4-mediated activity (Fig. 1,A and B). We were able to narrow these required regions down to 151–153 and 273–275, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B), and since point mutants in which each of the amino acids in these regions was changed to alanine retained TLR4-mediated activity (Fig. 2, A and B), the secondary structure created by these regions is likely to play an important role in the TLR4-mediated activity. By contrast, the amino acid regions between 35–44 and 235–243 were required for both TLR4- and TLR2-mediated activity (Fig. 1, A and B). As stated above, deletion of these regions seems to cause no destructive change in CD14 structure because CD14 mutants (d35–44 and d235–243) in which these regions were deleted retained their ability to associate with TLR4. These regions may play a fundamental role in CD14 function.In this study, photoactivable LPS (SBED-LPS) was used to assess LPS binding to CD14 or mutant CD14 and the capability of these mutants to transfer LPS to TLR4/MD2 (Fig. 7). The labeling to TLR4/MD-2 was completely CD14-dependent, because no labeling was observed when CD14 was not expressed. These results agreed with those described by da Silva et al. (39da Silva C. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In this experimental condition, we found that labeling intensities to CD14 mutants, TLR4 and MD-2, were roughly paralleled by the ability of CD14 mutants to increase TLR4-mediated activation (see Fig. 3). It is, therefore, likely that the impairment of LPS binding and its transfer to TLR4/MD-2 is involved in the impaired TLR4-mediated activity.Viriyakosol et al. (28Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using chimeric CD14 in which amino acids 1–151 of human CD14 were fused to the C-terminal region of decay-accelerating factor, demonstrated that the C-terminal portion of human CD14 beyond amino acid 152 is not required for its role as a membrane receptor for the LPS response. In our study, the amino acid region 273–275 of mouse CD14 was required for TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2 B). In addition, mouse CD14 truncated at amino acid 151 attached to the GPI anchor sequence of decay-accelerating factor (mCD14-DAF) lost the ability to increase LPS-induced reporter activity in 293 cells expressing mouse TLR4 and MD-2. Therefore, our results demonstrate that human and mouse CD14 are clearly different in terms of the requirement of their C-terminal portions in TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB. We previously reported that Salmonella lipid A exerts very little stimulatory activity on human macrophages despite exerting strong activity on murine macrophages (26Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although similar species-specific actions have been observed with lipid IVA (compound 406) and CD14 has been reported (41Delude R.L. Savedra R.J. Zhao H. Thieringer R. Yamamoto S. Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9288-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) not to be involved in its species-specific actions, the structure of lipid IVA is not found as a component of any LPS of bacterial origins, and emphasis should be put on the fact that Salmonella lipid A is a naturally occurring lipid A. Thus, it will be interesting to investigate the involvement of the C-terminal part of mouse CD14 in species-specific actions ofSalmonella lipid A. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is a constituent of the outer membrane of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and plays a major role in septic shock in humans (1Schletter J. Heine H.

Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Exposure of macrophages to nanogram quantities of LPS results in rapid activation of a number of transcription factors, including NF-κB, which leads to the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines (3Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The cell surface molecules that bind to LPS have been extensively studied, and CD14 has been found to be the major receptor (4Juan T.S. Kelley M.J. Johnson D.A. Busse L.A. Hailman E. Wright S.D.

Recently, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been identified as another molecule that transmits LPS signaling into intracellular components (7Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K.

TLR4 is a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila Toll protein, and it was initially recognized as a molecule that increases constitutive NF-κB activity but not LPS-inducible NF-κB activity (9Muzio M.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) showed that an endotoxic substance(s) other than LPS is responsible for TLR2-mediated signaling. CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein expressed on leukocytes and is the major receptor responsible for the effects of LPS on macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils (for a review, see Ref.2Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Since CD14 lacks transmembrane and intracellular domains, it is postulated that CD14 presents LPS to its signaling molecule, TLR4 (20Jiang Q. Akashi S. Miyake K. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3541-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). CD14 has also been reported to be a membrane receptor for various bacterial products, such as peptidoglycan and lipoarabinomannan (for a review, see Ref. 21Ulmer A.J. Dziarski R., El- Samalouti V.

Thus, CD14 plays a critical role in discriminating bacterial products and dividing their signals into TLR4 or TLR2 depending on the nature of the product. We previously reported that lipid A preparations from various Salmonella strains and synthetic Salmonella-type lipid A (compound 516) possess very little stimulatory activity in human macrophages despite being potently active in murine macrophages (26Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lipid A preparations from Escherichia coli and synthetic E. coli-type lipid A (compound 506) were equally active in both human and murine macrophages (26Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, Salmonella lipid A shows animal species-specific actions. The mechanism of the animal species-specific actions of Salmonella lipid A is still unknown, but it may be attributable to species differences in the CD14 molecules in recognizing these lipid A molecules.

However, since no structural studies of mouse CD14, especially the regions of the mouse CD14 molecule required for TLR4/MD-2- or TLR2-mediated activation of NF-κB, had ever been performed, in the present study we investigated these regions by transiently transfecting 293 cells as a first step in clarifying the species-specific actions ofSalmonella lipid A. DISCUSSIONWe created three types of deletion mutants to investigate the structural requirement of mouse CD14 molecules for TLR4- and TLR2-mediated activations of NF-κB. The first type of deletion mutant (d35–44) lacked the region (amino acids 35–44) that corresponds to the region of human CD14 reported to be important for LPS recognition and signal transduction. The second type of deletion mutant (d144–153, d235–243, and d270–275) lacked regions conserved among species, and the third type of deletion mutant (d244–247 and d312–320) lacked regions that vary among species. We avoided the deletion of possible glycosylation sites of CD14 because they might release the CD14 molecule from the cell membrane by disrupting its GPI anchoring. Deletion of variable regions (d244–247 and d312–320) did not significantly affect either TLR2- or TLR4-mediated activation (Fig. 1,A and B). Deletion of conserved regions (d144–153, d235–243, and d270–275) always caused loss of either TLR2- or TLR4-mediated activation, indicating an important role of these conserved regions in mouse CD14 function. Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 35–44 caused loss of both LPS-induced TLR4-mediated activation and PEX-induced TLR2-mediated activation (Fig. 1,A and B). We used a phenol extract of E. coli O111:B4 LPS (PEX) to stimulate the TLR2-dependent pathway, because the LPS preparation repurified by the method described by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) did not stimulate this pathway (data not shown) as shown by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). We were also unable to use peptidoglycan and bacterial lipopeptides, which are known to be TLR2 ligands, because peptidoglycan yielded ambiguous results in our experimental system (data not shown), and the TLR2-mediated activity of a synthetic lipopeptide derived from E. coli murein lipoprotein, tripalmitoyl-Cys-Ser-Ser-Asn-Ala, was not dependent on CD14 (data not shown). The biochemical nature of the substance(s) contained in PEX is currently unknown. Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and Dziarski et al. (40Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported that bacterial lipoproteins or endotoxin proteins may be responsible for the activation of TLR2-dependent pathway. However, PEX-induced activation of NF-κB was clearly different in terms of CD14 dependence from that induced by bacterial lipoproteins. It is therefore likely that a substance(s) other than bacterial lipopeptides is responsible for the effect of PEX. Our finding that the d35–44 mutant had lost activity in response to PEX suggests involvement of an LPS-like substance(s) in the PEX-induced activation. An effort to identify the substance(s) contained in PEX is currently in progress in our laboratory.To identify the molecular mechanism responsible for the loss of TLR4-mediated activity by the CD14 mutants, we tested them for membrane surface expression, and the results showed that they were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 5). Since close interaction between CD14 and TLR4 has been suggested to participate in LPS signaling (20Jiang Q. Akashi S. Miyake K. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3541-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we investigated the association between CD14 mutants and TLR4, and, as shown in Fig. 6, the results showed that TLR4 was co-precipitated with all mutants (d35–44, 151–153A, d235–243, and 273–275A). Therefore, these regions of mouse CD14 are unlikely to play a significant role in the interaction with TLR4. Our result also suggested that deletion or substitution of these regions does not cause any destructive change in the structure of CD14. In the present study, an association between CD14 and TLR4 was detected by the co-immunoprecipitation technique regardless of MD-2 expression, although our data do not necessarily mean a direct interaction between CD14 and TLR4. Co-precipitation of MD-2 with CD14 was also detected when MD-2 was co-expressed with CD14 and TLR4, but no co-precipitation of MD-2 was detected when CD14 and MD-2 were expressed without TLR4. It is therefore likely that MD-2 was co-precipitated with CD14 through the interaction between MD-2 and TLR4.The amino acid regions of CD14 between 144–153 and 270–275 were investigated in detail in this study, because these regions were found to be selectively involved in TLR4-mediated activity (Fig. 1,A and B). We were able to narrow these required regions down to 151–153 and 273–275, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B), and since point mutants in which each of the amino acids in these regions was changed to alanine retained TLR4-mediated activity (Fig. 2, A and B), the secondary structure created by these regions is likely to play an important role in the TLR4-mediated activity. By contrast, the amino acid regions between 35–44 and 235–243 were required for both TLR4- and TLR2-mediated activity (Fig. 1, A and B). As stated above, deletion of these regions seems to cause no destructive change in CD14 structure because CD14 mutants (d35–44 and d235–243) in which these regions were deleted retained their ability to associate with TLR4. These regions may play a fundamental role in CD14 function.In this study, photoactivable LPS (SBED-LPS) was used to assess LPS binding to CD14 or mutant CD14 and the capability of these mutants to transfer LPS to TLR4/MD2 (Fig. 7). The labeling to TLR4/MD-2 was completely CD14-dependent, because no labeling was observed when CD14 was not expressed. These results agreed with those described by da Silva et al. (39da Silva C.

In this experimental condition, we found that labeling intensities to CD14 mutants, TLR4 and MD-2, were roughly paralleled by the ability of CD14 mutants to increase TLR4-mediated activation (see Fig. 3). It is, therefore, likely that the impairment of LPS binding and its transfer to TLR4/MD-2 is involved in the impaired TLR4-mediated activity.Viriyakosol et al. (28Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect.

However, PEX-induced activation of NF-κB was clearly different in terms of CD14 dependence from that induced by bacterial lipoproteins. It is therefore likely that a substance(s) other than bacterial lipopeptides is responsible for the effect of PEX.

In the present study, an association between CD14 and TLR4 was detected by the co-immunoprecipitation technique regardless of MD-2 expression, although our data do not necessarily mean a direct interaction between CD14 and TLR4. Co-precipitation of MD-2 with CD14 was also detected when MD-2 was co-expressed with CD14 and TLR4, but no co-precipitation of MD-2 was detected when CD14 and MD-2 were expressed without TLR4. It is therefore likely that MD-2 was co-precipitated with CD14 through the interaction between MD-2 and TLR4. The amino acid regions of CD14 between 144–153 and 270–275 were investigated in detail in this study, because these regions were found to be selectively involved in TLR4-mediated activity (Fig. 1,A and B). We were able to narrow these required regions down to 151–153 and 273–275, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B), and since point mutants in which each of the amino acids in these regions was changed to alanine retained TLR4-mediated activity (Fig. 2, A and B), the secondary structure created by these regions is likely to play an important role in the TLR4-mediated activity. By contrast, the amino acid regions between 35–44 and 235–243 were required for both TLR4- and TLR2-mediated activity (Fig. 1, A and B). As stated above, deletion of these regions seems to cause no destructive change in CD14 structure because CD14 mutants (d35–44 and d235–243) in which these regions were deleted retained their ability to associate with TLR4. These regions may play a fundamental role in CD14 function. In this study, photoactivable LPS (SBED-LPS) was used to assess LPS binding to CD14 or mutant CD14 and the capability of these mutants to transfer LPS to TLR4/MD2 (Fig. 7). The labeling to TLR4/MD-2 was completely CD14-dependent, because no labeling was observed when CD14 was not expressed. These results agreed with those described by da Silva et al. (39da Silva C. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In this experimental condition, we found that labeling intensities to CD14 mutants, TLR4 and MD-2, were roughly paralleled by the ability of CD14 mutants to increase TLR4-mediated activation (see Fig. 3). It is, therefore, likely that the impairment of LPS binding and its transfer to TLR4/MD-2 is involved in the impaired TLR4-mediated activity. Viriyakosol et al. (28Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using chimeric CD14 in which amino acids 1–151 of human CD14 were fused to the C-terminal region of decay-accelerating factor, demonstrated that the C-terminal portion of human CD14 beyond amino acid 152 is not required for its role as a membrane receptor for the LPS response. In our study, the amino acid region 273–275 of mouse CD14 was required for TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2 B). In addition, mouse CD14 truncated at amino acid 151 attached to the GPI anchor sequence of decay-accelerating factor (mCD14-DAF) lost the ability to increase LPS-induced reporter activity in 293 cells expressing mouse TLR4 and MD-2. Therefore, our results demonstrate that human and mouse CD14 are clearly different in terms of the requirement of their C-terminal portions in TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB. We previously reported that Salmonella lipid A exerts very little stimulatory activity on human macrophages despite exerting strong activity on murine macrophages (26Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although similar species-specific actions have been observed with lipid IVA (compound 406) and CD14 has been reported (41Delude R.L. Savedra R.J. Zhao H. Thieringer R. Yamamoto S. Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9288-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) not to be involved in its species-specific actions, the structure of lipid IVA is not found as a component of any LPS of bacterial origins, and emphasis should be put on the fact that Salmonella lipid A is a naturally occurring lipid A. Thus, it will be interesting to investigate the involvement of the C-terminal part of mouse CD14 in species-specific actions ofSalmonella lipid A.

Current phase II clinical trials in Europe and the United States indicate that ET-743 represents a highly promising antitumor agent. However, the mechanism by which ET-743 exerts its anticancer activity remains to be elucidated. ET-743 has been reported to bind to the minor groove of DNA (8Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Bailly C. Waring M. Mazumder A. Kohn K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13303-13309Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Moore B.M. Seaman F.C. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1999; 42: 2493-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). DNA-bound ET-743 appeared to modify the interaction between DNA and several transcription factors (11Bonfanti M. La Valle E.

Also, at high concentrations ET-743 and the related synthetic drug phthalascidin, have been reported to target topoisomerase I (13Takebayashi Y. Pourquier P. Yoshida A. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc.

However, the relevance of these actions for the antitumor activity of ET-743 can be questioned as they are evidenced at drug concentrations much higher than those required for achieving its antitumor effect. On the other hand, ET-743-treated cells have been reported to accumulate in S and G2/M phases (15Takebayashi Y. Goldwasser F. Urasaki Y. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 185-191PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li W.W. Takahashi N. Jhanwar S. Cordon-Cardo C. Elisseyeff Y. Jimeno J. Faircloth G. Bertino J.R. Clin.

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of ET-743, we investigated the putative role of apoptosis in ET-743 action as an explanation for its cytotoxic effect. In this work we have found evidence for the induction of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-, mitochondria-, and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in human cancer cells by ET-743 in a dose- and time-dependent way. Also, at very low concentrations, ET-743 is able to inhibit cell proliferation, accumulating cells in S or G2/M, before promoting apoptosis after prolonged incubations. Our findings indicate that Bcl-2 overexpression is able to block the apoptotic effects of ET-743, preserving its actions on cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest induced by ET-743 was transcription-dependent, but ET-743-induced apoptosis was independent of transcription and of Fas/CD95. ET-743 had a rather weak effect on gene expression, but changes in the expression of a small number of genes seemed to account for the ET-743-promoted cell cycle arrest. Thus, ET-743 exerts two major concentration-dependent effects, namely cytostatic and proapoptotic, when used at concentrations (nm) required for the in vivo ET-743 anticancer action; therefore, these actions can account for the antitumor properties of the marine compound. Our data indicate that ET-743-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis result from the activation of two different signal transduction pathways. ET-743 was obtained from PharmaMar (Madrid, Spain) and prepared as a 1 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in ethanol and kept at −20 °C. Before use, the drug was diluted freshly in double-distilled sterile water to the desired concentrations. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640, fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human caspase-3 was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody C2.10 against human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-1 against Bcl-2, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 were from Calbiochem(Cambridge, MA). The caspase inhibitor z-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone (z-d-dbmk) and the recombinant human Fas ligand (FasL) were from Alexis (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, andN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). All other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma. The following human leukemic cell lines were used: the acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line; the T lymphoid Jurkat cell line, derived from an acute T-cell leukemia patient; the Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cell line, derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis patient; the Fas-resistant T-lymphoid RAPO leukemic cell line (a kind gift of Dr. P. H. Krammer, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany); and the erythroleukemia HEL cell line. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 24 μg/ml gentamicin. The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the human epithelioid cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cell line were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum and antibiotics as above. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. HEL cells were transfected by electroporation with the SFFV-Neo expression vector containing the human bcl-2 open reading frame driven by the long terminal repeat of the splenic focus-forming virus (pSFFV-bcl-2) as described previously (19Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar) and selected by growth in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. As a control, transfection was performed with empty SFFV-Neo plasmid. ET-743 was added to the cell cultures at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the respective figures. Agents used to examine their action on ET-743-dependent apoptosis were added 20–30 min before ET-743 treatment. Cell growth was measured by cell counting and by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (20Mollinedo F. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To assess apoptosis, fragmented DNA was isolated, analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide as described previously (20Mollinedo F. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Mollinedo F. Santos-Beneit A.M. Gajate C. Clynes M. Animal cell culture techniques. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1998: 264-297Crossref Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis was also monitored as the appearance of the sub-G1 peak in cell cycle analysis (22Gajate C. Barasoain I. Andreu J.M. Mollinedo F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2651-2659PubMed Google Scholar) using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer (San Jose, CA). Quantitation of apoptotic cells was calculated as the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 region (hypodiploidy) in cell cycle analysis. The possible implication of Fas/FasL interaction in ET-743-induced apoptosis was evaluated by using the blocking anti-Fas SM1/23 IgG2b monoclonal antibody (Bender, Vienna, Austria) as described previously (23Gajate C. Fonteriz R.I. Cabaner C. Alvarez-Noves G. Alvarez-Rodriguez Y. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Experiments performed with mock irrelevant isotype immunoglobulins had no effect. About 107 cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (24Gajate C. Santos-Beneit A.M. Macho A. Lazaro M. Hernandez-De Rojas A. Modolell M. Munoz E. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Proteins (20 μg) were separated through sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, blocked with 5% powder defatted milk, and incubated overnight with the corresponding antibodies. Signals were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Aylesbury, UK). Protein kinase assays were carried out using a fusion protein between GST and c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) as a substrate for JNK, as described previously (22Gajate C. Barasoain I. Andreu J.M. Mollinedo F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2651-2659PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Cells (3–5 × 106) were resuspended in 200 μl of extract buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were incubated for 30 min in continuous rotation at 4 °C and then microfuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were discarded, and the supernatants, representing cell extracts, were diluted with 600 μl of dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Mixtures were incubated for 10 min on ice and then microfuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell extracts were mixed with 20 μl of a suspension in dilution buffer of glutathione-agarose beads to which GST-c-Jun was freshly bound. Mixtures were rotated overnight at 4 °C in an Eppendorf tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. After four 1-ml washes in dilution buffer containing 50 mm NaCl to remove kinases that have a weaker affinity to bind c-Jun-(1–223) than JNK, the pelleted beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μm ATP) and incubated with 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 1 h at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by washing with dilution buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and microfugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Then the beads were boiled with 10 μl of 5 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer to elute the phosphorylated proteins, which were subsequently resolved in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. These conditions have been shown to enable specific binding of JNK to the c-Jun NH2-terminal domain (25Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Release of cytochromec from mitochondria to cytosol was analyzed by Western blot as previously described (26Pique M. Barragan M. Dalmau M. Bellosillo B. Pons G. Gil J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (4 × 106) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and gently lysed (by pipetting up and down 5 times) for 30 s in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% digitonin, 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzimidine, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min to obtain the supernatants (cytosolic extracts free of mitochondria) and the pellets (fraction that contains mitochondria). Supernatants (40 μg of protein) and pellets (40 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blot using anti-cytochrome c antibody (7H8.2C12, from PharMingen) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II antibody (12C4-F12, from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and ECL. Total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA integrity was assessed with an AGILENT 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using a RNA Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 15 μg of total RNA by means of the SuperScriptTM double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with oligo(dT)24 primer containing T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In vitrotranscription was carried out by means of the Bioarray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) with biotinylated cytidine triphosphate and uridine triphosphate. The biotin-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) was purified with an RNeasy column and fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm magnesium acetate). Integrity of cDNA, cRNA, and fragmented cRNA was assessed by electrophoresis of the samples on 1% agarose gels. Microarray RNA analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Human Genome U95Av2 GeneChip (Affymetrix), which represents 12,625 human genes. Scanned output files were visually inspected for hybridization artifacts and then analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Arrays were scaled to an average intensity of 100 and analyzed independently. Genes were considered up-regulated or down-regulated if the expression was changed at least two-fold from the control. Only reliable and consistent mean values from four independent experiments with an appropriate standard deviation were considered. Data with low signal intensity, high background, and high variability among experiments were eliminated. Unless otherwise indicated, the results given are the mean (± S.D.) of the number of experiments indicated. Human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells were incubated with ET-743 for different periods of time at concentrations ranging from 0.1–100 ng/ml (0.131–131 nm, ET-743 mol. wt. is 761) and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figs. 1and 2). No significant effect on cell cycle was observed at doses of 0.1 ng/ml ET-743. Incubation with 1 ng/ml ET-743 resulted in accumulation of cells in G2/M (Figs. 1 and 2) and blockade of cell proliferation (>98% inhibition after 24 h treatment) (data not shown). About 50% of the cells were arrested at G2/M with 4n content of DNA after 24-hour incubation (Figs. 1 and 2). This G2/M arrest eventually led to cell death as protracted incubations with 1 ng/ml ET-743 induced a weak apoptotic response (about 11% apoptosis after >72 h of treatment). Treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 or 100 ng/ml ET-743 resulted in the rapid appearance of cells with a DNA content less than G1, characteristic of apoptotic cells (Figs. 1 and 2), with no previous changes in cell cycle (Fig. 1, and data not shown).Figure 2Dose response of the ET-743-induced effect on cell cycle in HL-60 cells. Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ET-743 for 24 h, and the proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was quantitated by flow cytometry. Cells in the sub-G1 region represent apoptotic cells. Untreated control cells were run in parallel. Data are shown as means of four independent experiments ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Similar results were obtained when human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were incubated with ET-743 (Fig. 3). Incubation with 1 ng/ml ET-743 resulted first in an increase of cells in S phase and then in accumulation of cells in G2/M (Fig.3), with a blockade of cell proliferation (100% inhibition after 24 h treatment) (data not shown). No apoptotic response was elicited by 1 ng/ml ET-743 after 48 h treatment (Fig. 3). The effect on cell cycle was not reversed after drug washout, and cells eventually underwent apoptosis (about 12%, after >72 h of ET-743 washout). Incubation of HeLa cells with 10 (Fig. 3) or 100 (data not shown) ng/ml ET-743 resulted in a time-dependent accumulation of apoptotic cells with no previous changes in cell cycle. To demonstrate that ET-743 was able to induce an apoptotic response, we analyzed DNA degradation in ET-743-treated HL-60 and HeLa cells. Fig. 4 shows that ET-743, at concentrations of 10 or 100 ng/ml, induced the typical internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in multiples of 180–200 bp, a hallmark for apoptosis, in both tumor cell types. Involvement of the Fas/CD95 receptor/ligand system has been proposed to mediate apoptosis induced by several anticancer drugs (27Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The implication of Fas/FasL interaction in ET-743-induced apoptosis in the human acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells was evaluated by using the blocking anti-Fas SM1/23 monoclonal antibody, which abrogates Fas/FasL-mediated killing. Preincubation with SM1/23 anti-Fas antibody totally prevented apoptosis induced by the agonistic cytotoxic CH 11 anti-Fas monoclonal antibody in Jurkat cells, but had no protective effect on ET-743-induced apoptosis (Fig.5), suggesting that Fas/FasL interactions are not required for ET-743-induced apoptosis. We also found that ET-743 induced apoptosis in the Fas-resistant T-lymphoid RAPO leukemic cells (42.1 ± 4.3% and 76.8 ± 6.3% apoptosis after 24 h treatment with 10 and 100 ng/ml ET-743, respectively,n = 3). RAPO cells express Fas (about 60% cells positive for Fas), but incubation with 50 ng/ml CH 11 antibody or 50 ng/ml recombinant human FasL for 24 h did not induce apoptosis (less than 2.5% apoptosis, n = 3), indicating that Fas was non-functional in these cells. Furthermore, ET-743 induced apoptosis in the Fas-negative K562 leukemic cells (23Gajate C. Fonteriz R.I. Cabaner C. Alvarez-Noves G. Alvarez-Rodriguez Y. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), namely 19.2% and 25.3% apoptosis after 24 h treatment with 10 and 100 ng/ml ET-743, respectively. These results indicate that ET-743-induced apoptosis does not involve Fas/CD95. Because JNK activation has been suggested to be involved in the induction of apoptosis by different insults (28Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 29Gajate C. Santos-Beneit A. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we examined whether ET-743 was able to activate JNK in HeLa and HL-60 cells through phosphorylation of its substrate c-Jun. To determine JNK activation, we used a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1–223 of c-Jun (GST-c-Jun) as a substrate for JNK. ET-743 (10 and 100 ng/ml) induced a persistent JNK activation, measured as phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun, before the onset of apoptosis (Fig.6). When ET-743 was used at 1 ng/ml, no JNK activation was detected before cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an inhibitor of the JNK signaling pathway (30Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), inhibited both ET-743-induced JNK activation and apoptosis (Fig.7, A and B). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with the novel JNK inhibitor SP600125 (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one) (31Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C.

A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar) inhibited both ET-743-induced JNK activation and apoptosis (Fig. 7, C andD). These results suggest that the JNK signaling pathway is involved in ET-743-induced apoptosis.Figure 7Effect of curcumin and SP600125 on ET-743-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. HeLa cells were incubated in the absence or in the presence of curcumin (20 μm), ET-743 (100 ng/ml) or curcumin + ET-743 for 8 h and analyzed for JNK activation (A) or for 24 h and analyzed for apoptosis through fluorescence flow cytometry (B). HL-60 cells were incubated in the absence or in the presence of SP600125 (20 μm), ET-743 (10 ng/ml), or SP600125 + ET-743 for 8 h and analyzed for JNK activation (C), or for 24 h and analyzed for apoptosis through fluorescence flow cytometry (D). The position of phosphorylated GST-c-Jun-1–223 (GST-c-Jun) is indicated.

The caspase-3 cleavage product p19 observed in Fig. 8 A represents the p17 subunit plus the short caspase-3 prodomain, which is then slowly converted into the active p17 subunit (32Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Incubation with the aspartate-based caspase inhibitor z-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone (z-d-dbmk) completely blocked PARP degradation (data not shown) and apoptosis in ET-743-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 8 B) and HeLa cells (data not shown). We also found that MCF-7 cells, which are deficient in caspase-3 because of a 47-bp deletion within exon 3 of the caspase-3 gene (33Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), did not undergo apoptosis upon ET-743 treatment (4.1 ± 1.4% apoptosis in untreated MCF-7 cellsversus 4.2 ± 1.7% apoptosis in MCF-7 cells treated with either 10 or 100 ng/ml ET-743 for 24 h, n = 3). These data support the involvement of caspase-3 in ET-743-induced apoptosis. Bcl-2 regulates apoptosis, acting as suppressor (34Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed whether ET-743-induced apoptosis was under Bcl-2 control in human erythroleukemia HEL cells. These cells were stably transfected with pSFFV-bcl-2 (HEL-Bcl-2), containing the humanbcl-2 open reading frame, or with control pSFFV-Neo plasmid (HEL-Neo). Western blot analysis indicated that HEL-Neo cells expressed no Bcl-2, whereas a high expression of this protein was observed in HEL-Bcl-2 cells, as previously reported (19Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gajate C. Barasoain I. Andreu J.M. Mollinedo F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2651-2659PubMed Google Scholar). HEL-Neo cells were accumulated in S phase before undergoing apoptosis when treated with 10 ng/ml ET-743 and underwent apoptosis without any previous effect on cell cycle at 100 ng/ml ET-743 (Fig.9 A). Overexpression of Bcl-2 by gene transfer prevented ET-743-induced apoptosis, even after 72 h of treatment. But cells did not proliferate (100% inhibition in cell growth) and accumulated in S or G0/G1when treated with 10 or 100 ng/ml ET-743, respectively (Fig.9 B). Quantitative data showed that 65.0 ± 5.6% and 66.2 ± 5.0% (n = 3) of HEL-Bcl-2 cells treated for 72 h with 10 and 100 ng/ml ET-743 accumulated at S and G0/G1 phase, respectively, whereas 43.1 ± 3.7% and 38.1 ± 3.1% (n = 3) of untreated HEL-Bcl-2 cells were in G0/G1 and S phase, respectively. Because ET-743-triggered apoptosis was tightly controlled by Bcl-2, we asked whether ET-743 could trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release, as Bcl-2 has been reported to interfere with cytochrome c release from mitochondria (34Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 10, cytosolic cytochrome c levels markedly and rapidly increased after treatment of HL-60 cells with proapoptotic concentrations of ET-743 (100 ng/ml). Similar results were obtained also when cells were treated with 10 ng/ml ET-743 (data not shown). However, no cytochromec release was detected when HL-60 cells were incubated with 1 ng/ml ET-743 for up to 12 h of treatment (data not shown), conditions that did not promote apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in HEL cells prevented both apoptosis (Fig. 9) and mitochondrial cytochrom"

Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1963; 59: 369-382Google Scholar), numerous clinical, epidemiological, and genetic (cross-sectional and prospective) studies have revealed that high plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with human cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and restenosis (2Maher V.M.

JAMA. 1993; 270: 2195-2199Google Scholar, 6Gurewich V. Mittleman M. JAMA. 1994; 271: 1025-1026Google Scholar). The involvement of Lp(a) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis was suggested initially by the presence of Lp(a) in human atherosclerotic lesions (7Rath M. Niendorf A. Reblin T. Dietel M. Krebber H.J. Beisiegel U. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 579-592Google Scholar, 8Jurgens G. Chen Q. Esterbauer H. Mair S. Ledinski G. Dinges H.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1689-1699Google Scholar), and accumulating evidence indicates that Lp(a) deposition in atherosclerotic plaques is associated with the severity of unstable coronary syndrome (9Dangas G. Mehran R. Harpel P.C. Sharma S.K. Marcovina S.M. Dube G. Ambrose J.A. Fallon J.T. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 32: 2035-2042Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which Lp(a) increases the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease are largely unknown.The major difficulties in defining the functional roles of Lp(a)in vivo are attributed to the lack of appropriate experimental animals; Lp(a) is naturally present exclusively in Old World monkeys and humans, although one nonprimate species, the hedgehog, has independently evolved an Lp(a)-like protein (10Laplaud P.M. Beaubatie L. Rall Jr., S.C. Luc G. Saboureau M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1157-1170Google Scholar). Four reports using Tg mice showed that apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)) may increase aortic fatty streak formation when the apo(a) Tg mice are fed a high fat diet (11Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E.

Clin.

Newland D.L. Mooser V. Murata J. Marcovina S. Young S.G. Hammer R.E. Sanan D.A. Hobbs H.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1911-1916Google Scholar, 16Sanan D.A. Newland D.L. Tao R.

Gong E. Rubin E.M. Hughes S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1247-1251Google Scholar) generated Tg rabbits expressing human apo(a) and showed that human apo(a) is efficiently assembled into Lp(a) in rabbit plasma; this is contrast to human apo(a) Tg mice, in which human apo(a) is not associated with murine LDL (19Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Google Scholar). Recently we reported that Lp(a) substantially increases the development of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in Tg rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich diet (20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar, 21Ichikawa T. Unoki H. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Marcovina S.M. Shikama H. Watanabe T. Fan J. Am J Pathol. 2002; 160: 227-236Google Scholar). Although these studies in Tg rabbits or in Tg mice revealed that apo(a), regardless of association with apoB (as in Tg rabbits) or the lack of such association (as in Tg mice), may be proatherogenic in the case of cholesterol-rich diet; they did not provide an answer to the question of whether Lp(a) increases the risk of advanced atherosclerotic lesion progression. This is a difficult issue to address in these models because the lesions formed in cholesterol-fed animals are basically fatty streak and defined as early-stage lesions, in contrast to the lesions in human atherosclerosis, which are more advanced and often associated with rupture and calcification (22Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Dinsmore R.E. Fuster V. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1512-1531Google Scholar). It is these advanced atherosclerotic lesions that increase the risk of ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease and produce many clinical manifestations. Another confounding factor is that the major atherogenic lipoproteins present in cholesterol-fed animals are hepatically and intestinally derived remnant lipoproteins (so-called β-VLDLs) rather than LDLs as in humans (23Kroon P.A. Thompson G.M. Chao Y.S. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 56: 323-329Google Scholar).To further study Lp(a) atherogenicity, we cross-bred human apo(a) Tg rabbits with WHHL rabbits, an animal model for human familial hypercholesterolemia, to produce apo(a) Tg WHHL rabbits. WHHL rabbits have defective LDL receptor function (24Yamamoto T. Bishop R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Science. 1986; 232: 1230-1237Google Scholar). The apo(a) Tg WHHL model provides an ideal opportunity for gaining insight into the atherogenicity of Lp(a) because these rabbits have high plasma levels of LDL cholesterol on a chow diet and develop spontaneous atherosclerosis resembling that of humans (25Watanabe Y. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 36: 261-268Google Scholar). Moreover, Tg WHHL rabbits have 4-fold higher levels of Lp(a) in plasma than wild-type apo(a) Tg rabbits due to an LDL receptor defect (26Fan J. Challah M. Shimoyamada H. Shiomi M. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1004-1012Google Scholar). Finally, accumulating evidence from clinical studies shows that familial hypercholesterolemia patients have higher levels of Lp(a) than normal populations, and the risk of elevated Lp(a) concentration is increased significantly in the presence of high levels of LDL cholesterol (27Armstrong V.W. Cremer P. Eberle E. Manke A. Schulze F. Wieland H. Kreuzer H. Seidel D. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 62: 249-257Google Scholar,28Seed M. Hoppichler F. Reaveley D. McCarthy S. Thompson G.R. Boerwinkle E. Utermann G. New Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1494-1499Google Scholar). Some researchers have suggested that elevated Lp(a) may be a risk factor for coronary heart disease only in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol levels (29Cantin B. Gagnon F. Moorjani S. Despres J.P. Lamarche B. Lupien P.J. Dagenais G.R. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31: 519-525Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible to use the apo(a) Tg WHHL model to uncover links between elevated plasma levels of both Lp(a) and LDLs and the increased risk for atherosclerosis. In this study, we characterized the atherosclerotic lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits and found that Tg WHHL rabbits developed more extensive advanced lesions than did non-Tg WHHL rabbits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that Lp(a) may enhance the development of complicated atherosclerotic lesions with calcification.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrated for the first time that Lp(a) enhances advanced lesion development in Tg WHHL rabbits. Tg WHHL rabbits have high levels of plasma LDL cholesterol, as do non-Tg WHHL rabbits, but they also have relatively high levels of human Lp(a). In this regard, one could state that the two models (apo(a) Tg and non-Tg WHHL) enabled us to compare the atherogenicities of one risk factorversus two risk factors, namely high LDL cholesterol alone and both high LDL cholesterol and Lp(a) levels. Tg WHHL rabbits showed increased atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch and thoracic/abdominal aortas, respectively, in comparison to non-Tg WHHL rabbits, and their lesions consisted of advanced lesions, including atheroma, fibroatheroma, and calcification. The finding of more extensive advanced atherosclerotic lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits not only supports the notion that Lp(a) is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis but also strengthens the prevailing view that the risk of hypercholesterolemia for atherosclerosis is increased significantly in the setting of elevated Lp(a). It is surprising that Lp(a) does not lead to a significant increase in the extent of sudanophilic lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits, which is different from what we found in cholesterol-fed apo(a) Tg rabbits (20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). We believe that this discrepancy between cholesterol-fed and WHHL Tg rabbits may be due to differences in their atherogenic particles (large β-VLDLversus small LDL) (33Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Kim S.K. Ambroziak P. Chu A. Wilson M.D. Hellerstein M.K. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1501-1510Google Scholar), or it is possible that the very high plasma levels of LDL in WHHL rabbits may overwhelm the effect of Lp(a) on the early stage lesion formation. In humans, Lp(a) levels over 30 mg/dl are considered to be atherogenic (34Utermann G. Scrive C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1887-1912Google Scholar). Even though the plasma Lp(a) levels (15 mg/dl) in Tg WHHL rabbits are lower than this arbitrary threshold, this level is still significantly proatherogenic in rabbits, which normally do not have endogenous Lp(a). The lipoprotein profiles of Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbits were essentially identical, and the amounts of cholesterol and apoB in LDLs do not appear to explain the occurrence of increased advanced atherosclerosis in Tg WHHL rabbits. Therefore, it is likely that the presence of plasma Lp(a) was the major factor underlying the significant enhancement of the lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits. The presence of lipid core and a layer of fibrous cap in these advanced lesions in Tg WHHL mimics the features in human atherosclerosis (22Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Dinsmore R.E. Fuster V. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1512-1531Google Scholar). An important finding of the current study was the demonstration of striking vascular calcification in Tg WHHL rabbits, which was barely noted in non-Tg WHHL rabbits. We have excluded the possibility that calcification in Tg WHHL rabbits may be caused by increased plasma phosphate or calcium and/or increased alkaline phosphatase activity (data not shown). It is noteworthy that vascular calcification has not been observed in either human apo(a) Tg mice (11Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Google Scholar) or cholesterol-fed Tg rabbits (20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). In normal rabbits fed a diet containing fairly high cholesterol (2%), only calcifiable matrix vesicles, rather than calcified lesions, were reported in aortas (35Hsu H.H. Camacho N.P. Sun F. Tawfik O. Aono H. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 153: 337-348Google Scholar), whereas wild-type WHHL rabbits were found to develop vascular calcification when fed a diet containing high cholesterol, vitamin D, and calcium (36Demer L.L. Circulation. 1991; 83: 2083-2093Google Scholar) or upon reaching average age of over 15 months. 2M. Shiomi, unpublished observations. Vascular calcification is a common feature of human atherosclerotic lesions and contributes to a multitude of clinical problems such as coronary heart disease and aortic ruptures (37Doherty T.M. Detrano R.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 224-230Google Scholar). In this aspect, the lesions of Tg WHHL rabbits share many features of the calcification seen in human advanced atherosclerosis, and thus they may serve as an ideal model for studying vascular calcification associated with atherosclerosis. The presence of calcification and the intimate association between Lp(a) and calcification in the lesions of Tg WHHL rabbits led us to propose a hypothesis that Lp(a) is a potential mediator of the process of vascular calcification. On a preliminary basis (three representative specimens from the 12 patients), we also found that Lp(a) deposition is closely localized in the calcified areas of atherosclerotic lesions. It is important to note that Yamada recently reported that oxidized Lp(a) is frequently deposited in calcification-associated atherosclerotic lesions by analyzing carotid arterial specimens from eight patients. 3S. Yamada (2002) The Seventh Lp(a) Conference, July 2002, Kobe, Japan. The etiology of vascular calcification has been now recognized as an active process rather than an end-stage, passive, or degenerative process of aging (38Parhami F. Tintut Y. Patel J.K. Mody N. Hemmat A. Demer L.L. Z. Kardiol. 2001; 90: 27-30Google Scholar, 39Tintut Y. Demer L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 555-560Google Scholar).A critical question is whether Lp(a) can really induce calcification in vascular cells such as SMCs. To address this issue, we have taken several steps to examine the effect of Lp(a) on calcification of cultured SMCs in vitro. First, treatment of SMCs with Lp(a) at physiological concentrations resulted in an enhanced calcium accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Secondly, Lp(a) significantly up-regulated MGP mRNA expression, whereas it down-regulated OPN expression of SMCs at 4 days. This pattern of osteogenic protein expression (increased MGP and decreased OPN) is compatible with the notion that calcification of SMCs is associated with high levels of MGP and low levels of OPN in human vascular SMCs (40Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 379-388Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lp(a) may enhance calcification by inducing the differentiation of SMCs to osteoblasts since Osf2 was up-regulated and alkaline phosphatase activity was concomitantly increased in SMCs treated with Lp(a). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Lp(a) may participate in the process of vascular calcification. In Tg WHHL rabbits, about 20% of Lp(a) was covalently linked with apoB, and remaining Lp(a) was noncovalently associated, which is consistent with the previous studies (18Rouy D. Duverger N. Lin S.D.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). This may suggest that although rabbit apoB lacks a compatible Cys-4326, which is required for covalent binding with apo(a) in human, there may be another cysteine residue in rabbit apoB for such covalent linkage. It is currently unknown whether apo(a) needs to be associated with apoB either in covalent or noncovalent linkage to exert its functions such as inducing calcification. In a separate study, we have found that Lp(a) isolated from Tg rabbits showed a similar effect on SMC calcium uptake to human Lp(a). 4H. Unoki, unpublished observations.Further studies are needed to address free apo(a) versusLp(a), covalently associated Lp(a) versus noncovalently associated Lp(a), and native Lp(a) versus oxidized Lp(a) regarding the effect on calcification.While the mechanism(s) of the increased formation of advanced atherosclerotic lesions caused by Lp(a) in Tg WHHL rabbits remains unclear, the presence of necrotic or lipid cores in the lesions indicates that cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis, occurs, which raises an intriguing question as to whether Lp(a) may directly or indirectly induce such cell death or whether cell death is also involved or required in the subsequent calcification process. Previous studies showed that Lp(a) increases the production of superoxide in monocytes (41Hansen P.R. Kharazmi A. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 24: 497-499Google Scholar) and induces apoptosis in human endothelial cells and rabbit aorta (42Galle J. Schneider R. Heinloth A. Wanner C. Galle P.R. Conzelmann E. Dimmeler S. Heermeier K. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1450-1461Google Scholar). If this mechanism is really operating in vivo, it may certainly help explain the findings observed in Tg WHHL rabbits. Consistent with this possibility, some studies using cultured SMCs showed that apoptosis precedes SMC calcification,4 and apoptotic bodies are capable of initiating vascular calcification (43Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N. Hegyi L. Bennett M.R. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1055-1062Google Scholar).In conclusion, our current study provides further evidence that Lp(a) is not only a risk factor for the initiation of atherosclerosis but is also an inducer of the acceleration of the progression of lesion development. Furthermore, we have shown that Lp(a) is a potential regulator in the vascular calcification associated with atherosclerosis. Whereas the molecular mechanism(s) of Lp(a) atherogenicity and calcification are not fully understood, the occurrence of advanced atherosclerosis in Tg WHHL rabbits will undoubtedly prove useful for the study of human atherosclerosis and its complications such as plaque rupture and aneurysm. In future studies, it will be interesting to determine whether Tg WHHL rabbits have increased incidence of myocardial infarction. We believe that the Tg WHHL model with high levels of Lp(a) and advanced atherosclerosis may be an extremely useful model for studying the benefits of some drugs in the treatment of atherosclerosis in patients with high levels of Lp(a).

Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1963; 59: 369-382Google Scholar), numerous clinical, epidemiological, and genetic (cross-sectional and prospective) studies have revealed that high plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with human cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and restenosis (2Maher V.M. Brown B.G. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 1995; 6: 229-235Google Scholar, 3Djurovic S. Berg K. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 281-292Google Scholar, 4Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1998; 82: 57U-66UGoogle Scholar), although several studies have failed to demonstrate such an association (5Ridker P.M. Hennekens C.H. Stampfer M.J. JAMA. 1993; 270: 2195-2199Google Scholar, 6Gurewich V. Mittleman M. JAMA. 1994; 271: 1025-1026Google Scholar). The involvement of Lp(a) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis was suggested initially by the presence of Lp(a) in human atherosclerotic lesions (7Rath M. Niendorf A. Reblin T. Dietel M. Krebber H.J. Beisiegel U. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 579-592Google Scholar, 8Jurgens G. Chen Q. Esterbauer H. Mair S. Ledinski G. Dinges H.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1689-1699Google Scholar), and accumulating evidence indicates that Lp(a) deposition in atherosclerotic plaques is associated with the severity of unstable coronary syndrome (9Dangas G. Mehran R. Harpel P.C. Sharma S.K. Marcovina S.M. Dube G. Ambrose J.A. Fallon J.T. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 32: 2035-2042Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which Lp(a) increases the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease are largely unknown. The major difficulties in defining the functional roles of Lp(a)in vivo are attributed to the lack of appropriate experimental animals; Lp(a) is naturally present exclusively in Old World monkeys and humans, although one nonprimate species, the hedgehog, has independently evolved an Lp(a)-like protein (10Laplaud P.M. Beaubatie L. Rall Jr., S.C. Luc G. Saboureau M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1157-1170Google Scholar). Four reports using Tg mice showed that apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)) may increase aortic fatty streak formation when the apo(a) Tg mice are fed a high fat diet (11Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Google Scholar, 12Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2263-2267Google Scholar, 13Lawn R.M. Pearle A.D.

Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 558-564Google Scholar); however, two other studies failed to detect an atherogenic effect of apo(a) in Tg mice expressing either apo(a) alone or human apo(a) and apoB (15Mancini F.P. Newland D.L. Mooser V. Murata J. Marcovina S. Young S.G. Hammer R.E. Sanan D.A. Hobbs H.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1911-1916Google Scholar, 16Sanan D.A. Newland D.L. Tao R.

Kakuta H. Shikama H. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 639-644Google Scholar) along with others (18Rouy D. Duverger N. Lin S.D. Emmanuel F. Houdebine L.M. Denefle P. Viglietta C. Gong E. Rubin E.M. Hughes S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1247-1251Google Scholar) generated Tg rabbits expressing human apo(a) and showed that human apo(a) is efficiently assembled into Lp(a) in rabbit plasma; this is contrast to human apo(a) Tg mice, in which human apo(a) is not associated with murine LDL (19Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Google Scholar). Recently we reported that Lp(a) substantially increases the development of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in Tg rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich diet (20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar, 21Ichikawa T. Unoki H. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Marcovina S.M. Shikama H. Watanabe T. Fan J. Am J Pathol. 2002; 160: 227-236Google Scholar). Although these studies in Tg rabbits or in Tg mice revealed that apo(a), regardless of association with apoB (as in Tg rabbits) or the lack of such association (as in Tg mice), may be proatherogenic in the case of cholesterol-rich diet; they did not provide an answer to the question of whether Lp(a) increases the risk of advanced atherosclerotic lesion progression. This is a difficult issue to address in these models because the lesions formed in cholesterol-fed animals are basically fatty streak and defined as early-stage lesions, in contrast to the lesions in human atherosclerosis, which are more advanced and often associated with rupture and calcification (22Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Dinsmore R.E. Fuster V. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1512-1531Google Scholar). It is these advanced atherosclerotic lesions that increase the risk of ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease and produce many clinical manifestations. Another confounding factor is that the major atherogenic lipoproteins present in cholesterol-fed animals are hepatically and intestinally derived remnant lipoproteins (so-called β-VLDLs) rather than LDLs as in humans (23Kroon P.A. Thompson G.M. Chao Y.S. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 56: 323-329Google Scholar). To further study Lp(a) atherogenicity, we cross-bred human apo(a) Tg rabbits with WHHL rabbits, an animal model for human familial hypercholesterolemia, to produce apo(a) Tg WHHL rabbits. WHHL rabbits have defective LDL receptor function (24Yamamoto T. Bishop R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Science. 1986; 232: 1230-1237Google Scholar). The apo(a) Tg WHHL model provides an ideal opportunity for gaining insight into the atherogenicity of Lp(a) because these rabbits have high plasma levels of LDL cholesterol on a chow diet and develop spontaneous atherosclerosis resembling that of humans (25Watanabe Y. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 36: 261-268Google Scholar). Moreover, Tg WHHL rabbits have 4-fold higher levels of Lp(a) in plasma than wild-type apo(a) Tg rabbits due to an LDL receptor defect (26Fan J. Challah M. Shimoyamada H. Shiomi M. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1004-1012Google Scholar). Finally, accumulating evidence from clinical studies shows that familial hypercholesterolemia patients have higher levels of Lp(a) than normal populations, and the risk of elevated Lp(a) concentration is increased significantly in the presence of high levels of LDL cholesterol (27Armstrong V.W. Cremer P. Eberle E. Manke A. Schulze F. Wieland H. Kreuzer H. Seidel D. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 62: 249-257Google Scholar,28Seed M. Hoppichler F. Reaveley D. McCarthy S. Thompson G.R. Boerwinkle E. Utermann G. New Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1494-1499Google Scholar). Some researchers have suggested that elevated Lp(a) may be a risk factor for coronary heart disease only in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol levels (29Cantin B. Gagnon F. Moorjani S. Despres J.P. Lamarche B. Lupien P.J. Dagenais G.R. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31: 519-525Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible to use the apo(a) Tg WHHL model to uncover links between elevated plasma levels of both Lp(a) and LDLs and the increased risk for atherosclerosis. In this study, we characterized the atherosclerotic lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits and found that Tg WHHL rabbits developed more extensive advanced lesions than did non-Tg WHHL rabbits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that Lp(a) may enhance the development of complicated atherosclerotic lesions with calcification. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrated for the first time that Lp(a) enhances advanced lesion development in Tg WHHL rabbits. Tg WHHL rabbits have high levels of plasma LDL cholesterol, as do non-Tg WHHL rabbits, but they also have relatively high levels of human Lp(a). In this regard, one could state that the two models (apo(a) Tg and non-Tg WHHL) enabled us to compare the atherogenicities of one risk factorversus two risk factors, namely high LDL cholesterol alone and both high LDL cholesterol and Lp(a) levels. Tg WHHL rabbits showed increased atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch and thoracic/abdominal aortas, respectively, in comparison to non-Tg WHHL rabbits, and their lesions consisted of advanced lesions, including atheroma, fibroatheroma, and calcification. The finding of more extensive advanced atherosclerotic lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits not only supports the notion that Lp(a) is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis but also strengthens the prevailing view that the risk of hypercholesterolemia for atherosclerosis is increased significantly in the setting of elevated Lp(a). It is surprising that Lp(a) does not lead to a significant increase in the extent of sudanophilic lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits, which is different from what we found in cholesterol-fed apo(a) Tg rabbits (20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). We believe that this discrepancy between cholesterol-fed and WHHL Tg rabbits may be due to differences in their atherogenic particles (large β-VLDLversus small LDL) (33Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Kim S.K. Ambroziak P. Chu A. Wilson M.D. Hellerstein M.K. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1501-1510Google Scholar), or it is possible that the very high plasma levels of LDL in WHHL rabbits may overwhelm the effect of Lp(a) on the early stage lesion formation. In humans, Lp(a) levels over 30 mg/dl are considered to be atherogenic (34Utermann G. Scrive C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1887-1912Google Scholar). Even though the plasma Lp(a) levels (15 mg/dl) in Tg WHHL rabbits are lower than this arbitrary threshold, this level is still significantly proatherogenic in rabbits, which normally do not have endogenous Lp(a). The lipoprotein profiles of Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbits were essentially identical, and the amounts of cholesterol and apoB in LDLs do not appear to explain the occurrence of increased advanced atherosclerosis in Tg WHHL rabbits. Therefore, it is likely that the presence of plasma Lp(a) was the major factor underlying the significant enhancement of the lesions in Tg WHHL rabbits. The presence of lipid core and a layer of fibrous cap in these advanced lesions in Tg WHHL mimics the features in human atherosclerosis (22Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Dinsmore R.E. Fuster V. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1512-1531Google Scholar). An important finding of the current study was the demonstration of striking vascular calcification in Tg WHHL rabbits, which was barely noted in non-Tg WHHL rabbits. We have excluded the possibility that calcification in Tg WHHL rabbits may be caused by increased plasma phosphate or calcium and/or increased alkaline phosphatase activity (data not shown). It is noteworthy that vascular calcification has not been observed in either human apo(a) Tg mice (11Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Google Scholar) or cholesterol-fed Tg rabbits (20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). In normal rabbits fed a diet containing fairly high cholesterol (2%), only calcifiable matrix vesicles, rather than calcified lesions, were reported in aortas (35Hsu H.H. Camacho N.P. Sun F. Tawfik O. Aono H. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 153: 337-348Google Scholar), whereas wild-type WHHL rabbits were found to develop vascular calcification when fed a diet containing high cholesterol, vitamin D, and calcium (36Demer L.L. Circulation. 1991; 83: 2083-2093Google Scholar) or upon reaching average age of over 15 months. 2M. Shiomi, unpublished observations. Vascular calcification is a common feature of human atherosclerotic lesions and contributes to a multitude of clinical problems such as coronary heart disease and aortic ruptures (37Doherty T.M. Detrano R.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 224-230Google Scholar). In this aspect, the lesions of Tg WHHL rabbits share many features of the calcification seen in human advanced atherosclerosis, and thus they may serve as an ideal model for studying vascular calcification associated with atherosclerosis. The presence of calcification and the intimate association between Lp(a) and calcification in the lesions of Tg WHHL rabbits led us to propose a hypothesis that Lp(a) is a potential mediator of the process of vascular calcification. On a preliminary basis (three representative specimens from the 12 patients), we also found that Lp(a) deposition is closely localized in the calcified areas of atherosclerotic lesions. It is important to note that Yamada recently reported that oxidized Lp(a) is frequently deposited in calcification-associated atherosclerotic lesions by analyzing carotid arterial specimens from eight patients. 3S. Yamada (2002) The Seventh Lp(a) Conference, July 2002, Kobe, Japan. The etiology of vascular calcification has been now recognized as an active process rather than an end-stage, passive, or degenerative process of aging (38Parhami F. Tintut Y. Patel J.K. Mody N. Hemmat A. Demer L.L. Z. Kardiol. 2001; 90: 27-30Google Scholar, 39Tintut Y. Demer L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 555-560Google Scholar).A critical question is whether Lp(a) can really induce calcification in vascular cells such as SMCs. To address this issue, we have taken several steps to examine the effect of Lp(a) on calcification of cultured SMCs in vitro. First, treatment of SMCs with Lp(a) at physiological concentrations resulted in an enhanced calcium accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Secondly, Lp(a) significantly up-regulated MGP mRNA expression, whereas it down-regulated OPN expression of SMCs at 4 days. This pattern of osteogenic protein expression (increased MGP and decreased OPN) is compatible with the notion that calcification of SMCs is associated with high levels of MGP and low levels of OPN in human vascular SMCs (40Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 379-388Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lp(a) may enhance calcification by inducing the differentiation of SMCs to osteoblasts since Osf2 was up-regulated and alkaline phosphatase activity was concomitantly increased in SMCs treated with Lp(a). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Lp(a) may participate in the process of vascular calcification. In Tg WHHL rabbits, about 20% of Lp(a) was covalently linked with apoB, and remaining Lp(a) was noncovalently associated, which is consistent with the previous studies (18Rouy D. Duverger N. Lin S.D. Emmanuel F. Houdebine L.M. Denefle P. Viglietta C. Gong E. Rubin E.M. Hughes S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1247-1251Google Scholar, 20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). This may suggest that although rabbit apoB lacks a compatible Cys-4326, which is required for covalent binding with apo(a) in human, there may be another cysteine residue in rabbit apoB for such covalent linkage. It is currently unknown whether apo(a) needs to be associated with apoB either in covalent or noncovalent linkage to exert its functions such as inducing calcification.

The etiology of vascular calcification has been now recognized as an active process rather than an end-stage, passive, or degenerative process of aging (38Parhami F. Tintut Y. Patel J.K. Mody N. Hemmat A. Demer L.L. Z. Kardiol. 2001; 90: 27-30Google Scholar, 39Tintut Y. Demer L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 555-560Google Scholar). A critical question is whether Lp(a) can really induce calcification in vascular cells such as SMCs. To address this issue, we have taken several steps to examine the effect of Lp(a) on calcification of cultured SMCs in vitro. First, treatment of SMCs with Lp(a) at physiological concentrations resulted in an enhanced calcium accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Secondly, Lp(a) significantly up-regulated MGP mRNA expression, whereas it down-regulated OPN expression of SMCs at 4 days. This pattern of osteogenic protein expression (increased MGP and decreased OPN) is compatible with the notion that calcification of SMCs is associated with high levels of MGP and low levels of OPN in human vascular SMCs (40Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 379-388Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lp(a) may enhance calcification by inducing the differentiation of SMCs to osteoblasts since Osf2 was up-regulated and alkaline phosphatase activity was concomitantly increased in SMCs treated with Lp(a). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Lp(a) may participate in the process of vascular calcification. In Tg WHHL rabbits, about 20% of Lp(a) was covalently linked with apoB, and remaining Lp(a) was noncovalently associated, which is consistent with the previous studies (18Rouy D. Duverger N. Lin S.D. Emmanuel F. Houdebine L.M. Denefle P. Viglietta C. Gong E. Rubin E.M. Hughes S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1247-1251Google Scholar, 20Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Google Scholar). This may suggest that although rabbit apoB lacks a compatible Cys-4326, which is required for covalent binding with apo(a) in human, there may be another cysteine residue in rabbit apoB for such covalent linkage. It is currently unknown whether apo(a) needs to be associated with apoB either in covalent or noncovalent linkage to exert its functions such as inducing calcification. In a separate study, we have found that Lp(a) isolated from Tg rabbits showed a similar effect on SMC calcium uptake to human Lp(a). 4H. Unoki, unpublished observations.Further studies are needed to address free apo(a) versusLp(a), covalently associated Lp(a) versus noncovalently associated Lp(a), and native Lp(a) versus oxidized Lp(a) regarding the effect on calcification. While the mechanism(s) of the increased formation of advanced atherosclerotic lesions caused by Lp(a) in Tg WHHL rabbits remains unclear, the presence of necrotic or lipid cores in the lesions indicates that cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis, occurs, which raises an intriguing question as to whether Lp(a) may directly or indirectly induce such cell death or whether cell death is also involved or required in the subsequent calcification process. Previous studies showed that Lp(a) increases the production of superoxide in monocytes (41Hansen P.R. Kharazmi A. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 24: 497-499Google Scholar) and induces apoptosis in human endothelial cells and rabbit aorta (42Galle J. Schneider R. Heinloth A. Wanner C. Galle P.R. Conzelmann E. Dimmeler S. Heermeier K. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1450-1461Google Scholar). If this mechanism is really operating in vivo, it may certainly help explain the findings observed in Tg WHHL rabbits. Consistent with this possibility, some studies using cultured SMCs showed that apoptosis precedes SMC calcification,4 and apoptotic bodies are capable of initiating vascular calcification (43Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N. Hegyi L. Bennett M.R. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1055-1062Google Scholar). In conclusion, our current study provides further evidence that Lp(a) is not only a risk factor for the initiation of atherosclerosis but is also an inducer of the acceleration of the progression of lesion development. Furthermore, we have shown that Lp(a) is a potential regulator in the vascular calcification associated with atherosclerosis. Whereas the molecular mechanism(s) of Lp(a) atherogenicity and calcification are not fully understood, the occurrence of advanced atherosclerosis in Tg WHHL rabbits will undoubtedly prove useful for the study of human atherosclerosis and its complications such as plaque rupture and aneurysm. In future studies, it will be interesting to determine whether Tg WHHL rabbits have increased incidence of myocardial infarction. We believe that the Tg WHHL model with high levels of Lp(a) and advanced atherosclerosis may be an extremely useful model for studying the benefits of some drugs in the treatment of atherosclerosis in patients with high levels of Lp(a)."
https://openalex.org/W2044874798,"We previously identified a specific activation-dependent interaction between the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, Gz, and a regulator of Rap1 signaling, Rap1GAP (Meng, J., Glick, J. L., Polakis, P., and Casey, P. J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36663–36669). We now demonstrate that activated forms of Gαz are able to recruit Rap1GAP from a cytosolic location to the membrane. Using PC12 cells as a model for neuronal differentiation, the influence of Gz activation on Rap1-mediated cell differentiation was examined. Introduction of constitutively-activated Gαz into PC12 cells markedly attenuated the differentiation process of these cells induced by a cAMP analogue. Treatment of PC12 cells expressing wild type Gαz with a specific agonist to the α2A-adrenergic receptor also attenuated cAMP-induced PC12 cell differentiation, demonstrating that receptor-mediated activation of Gz was also effective in this regard. Furthermore, activation of Gz decreased the ability of the cAMP analogue to trigger both Rap1 and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Differentiation of PC12 cells induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) is also thought to be a Rap1-mediated process, and Gz activation was found to attenuate this process as well. Rap1 activation, ERK phosphorylation, and PC12 cell differentation induced by NGF treatment were all significantly attenuated by either transfection of constitutively activated Gαz or receptor-mediated Gz activation. Based on these findings, a model is proposed in which activation of Gzresults in recruitment of Rap1GAP to the membrane where it can effectively down-regulate Rap1 signaling. The implications of these findings in regard to a possible role for Gz in neuronal development are discussed. We previously identified a specific activation-dependent interaction between the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, Gz, and a regulator of Rap1 signaling, Rap1GAP (Meng, J., Glick, J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). GTP binding to the G protein α subunit, which is initiated by appropriately liganded G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as well as other GTP exchange factors (GEFs), and dissociation of the tightly associated βγ complex from α-GTP produce the active forms of the G proteins that transmit signals to downstream targets, termed effectors. G protein α subunits possess intrinsic GTPase activity, and GTP hydrolysis returns the system to its resting state where the α subunit and βγ complex re-associate (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). This GTP hydrolysis step can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as the members of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) family of proteins (3Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Structural homology of the α subunits, and also functional differences, divides G proteins into Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 subgroups (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 5Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One particularly interesting member of the Gi subfamily is Gz(6Fong H.K. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3066-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Matsuoka M. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5384-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Gi family, Gαz has the ability to inhibit some subtypes of adenylyl cyclases (8Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and is subject to both myristoylation and palmitoylation (9Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Mutation of either myristoylation site Gly2 or palmitoylation site Cys3 results in incorrect localization of Gαz and loss of the ability to transduce signals to downstream effectors in the cell (11Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tissue distribution of Gαz is quite restricted, being found primarily in brain, adrenal medulla, and platelets, while expression is virtually undetectable in other tissues (5Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hinton D.R. Blanks J.C. Fong H.K. Casey P.J. Hildebrandt E. Simons M.I. J Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lacking a cysteine residue that is conserved in other members of the Gi family near the C terminus, Gαz does not serve as a substrate for pertussis toxin (PTX)-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (5Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fong H.K. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3066-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαz is quite low compared with most other G protein α subunits, suggesting that RGSs such as RGSZ1 (one of the products of the RGS20 gene, Ref.13Barker S.A. Wang J. Sierra D.A. Ross E.M. Genomics. 2001; 78: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) play important roles in the regulation of its signaling (14Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Monomeric G proteins consist of only one polypeptide and also cycle between two conformations induced by binding and hydrolysis of GTP (15Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). While Ras is probably the best known and best studied member in the family, the closely related Rap1 has attracted considerable attention recently (16Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). First identified as a molecule capable of reverting the oncogenic phenotype of Ras-transformed fibroblasts (17Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), Rap1 has been implicated as a key player in several cellular processes. In rat thyroid-like cells, thyrotropin activates Rap1 through a cAMP-mediated and PKA-independent mechanism and results in Akt phosphorylation (18Vanvooren V. Allgeier A. Nguyen M. Massart C. Parma J. Dumont J.E. Van Sande J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 144: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Tsygankova O.M. Saavedra A. Rebhun J.F. Quilliam L.A. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, Rap1 can be activated by elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and contributes to prolonged activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) (20York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Influx of Ca2+ in platelets also activates Rap1 and consequently promotes platelet aggregation (21Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells, Rap1 is required for cAMP-mediated inhibition of cell growth (22Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A key negative regulator in Rap1 signaling pathway is Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (Rap1GAP) that is expressed most abundantly in brain and some tumor cell lines (23Halenbeck R. Crosier W.J. Clark R. McCormick F. Koths K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21922-21928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rap1GAP is a 663-residue protein, and the region from residue 75 to 416 comprises its “core” domain that has full GAP activity toward Rap1 (24Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of Rap1GAP facilitates the process of converting Rap1 from the GTP-bound active state to GDP-bound inactive state, resulting in a down-regulation of Rap1 signaling. In a previous study, we identified an interaction between the activated form of Gαz and Rap1GAP, the aforementioned specific activator of Rap1 signaling. Characterization of the interaction revealed that the three proteins, i.e. Gαz, Rap1GAP, and Rap1, could form a ternary complex, suggesting a role for Gαz in Rap1-mediated signaling processes (26Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However Rap1 single-turnover GTPase assays indicated that binding of Gαz did not affect Rap1GAP's ability to stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Rap1. In the present study, cell-based approaches are described to show that activated Gαz can recruit Rap1GAP from a cytosolic location to the membrane. In PC12 cells, Gαz-mediated recruitment of Rap1GAP was accompanied by a down-regulation of a Rap1-mediated signaling process, i.e.cell differentiation induced by either cAMP analogue or nerve growth factor (NGF). These studies shed light on the mechanism of how Rap1 signaling can be regulated by activation of Gz and provide insight into the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in PC12 cell differentiation. HEK293 cells and Sf9 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. PC12 cells were generously provided by Pate Skeen (Duke University). His-tagged Rap1 was a gift from William Tschantz (Duke University). RalGDS-RBD plasmid was provided by Johannes L. Bos (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Gαz wild type was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously. Adrenal chromaffin cell membrane fractions were prepared as described (12Hinton D.R. Blanks J.C. Fong H.K. Casey P.J. Hildebrandt E. Simons M.I. J Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-Rap1GAP polyclonal antibody (25Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and anti-Gαz polyclonal antibody (5Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously described. The anti-Rap1 polyclonal antibody, anti-ERK polyclonal antibody, and anti-phospho-ERK monoclonal antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Radioactive compounds ([γ-32P]GTP and [γ-35S[GTPγS) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Plasmids containing the cDNA of rat Gαz (both wild type and the Q205L mutant) containing the Glu-Glu epitope at residues 3–8 were the gift of Henry Bourne (University of California, San Francisco) and have been described (27Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing full-length Rap1GAP (designated pCAN-Rap1GAP) and fragments thereof were previously described (25Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing full-length Rap1GAP with an appended N-terminal His-tag (pRSET-Rap1GAP) was constructed by subcloning a KpnI- andEcoRI-digested fragment from pCAN-Rap1GAP that contained the Rap1 GAP coding sequence into the pRSET-C vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid containing full-length Rap1GAP with an appended N-terminal EGFP (N-GFP-Rap1GAP) was constructed by subcloning a KpnI- andEcoRI-digested fragment from pCAN-Rap1GAP that contained the Rap1-GAP coding sequence into the EGFP-N2 vector (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum at 37 °C. Transfection was performed using SuperfectTM reagent (Qiagen) in 6-well Falcon plates. Standard protocols provided by the manufacturer were used. Briefly, cells were transfected at 70–80% confluency with 5.0 μg (the default level) or 15.0 μg of plasmid encoding Gαz forms and/or 2.0 μg of the plasmid encoding N-GFP-Rap1GAP unless otherwise noted. The procedure was essentially the same as previously described (26Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rap1 was first incubated with [γ-32P]GTP at room temperature for 10 min and then isolated by gel filtration using a 1-ml spin column of G-25 Sephadex. GTP hydrolysis was carried out in the presence or absence of Rap1GAP protein or cell lysate. In experiments assessing the abilities of Gαz forms to inhibit Rap1GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, the Rap1GAP protein was incubated with the Gαz-GTP complex at 0 °C for 5 min before addition to the reaction. GTPase activity was measured by phosphate release as previously described (28Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were transfected with designated plasmids and allowed to recover 24 h before serum deprivation. Following 24 h of serum deprivation, cells were treated with either 10 μm 8-CPT, CalBiochemfor an additional 24 h or 100 ng/ml NGF (CalBiochem) for 18 h and examined by microscopy. Where indicated, 10 μmUK14304 (Research Biochemicals Inc.) was applied 1 min before 8-CPT or NGF treatment. Differentiation of PC12 cells was accessed by measurement of neurite outgrowth; five random photographs were taken of more than 100 cells in each well, and only cells with neurite extensions longer than one cell body diameter were considered as differentiated cells. PC12 cells were serum-starved for 24 h before 8-CPT or NGF treatment as above. In experiments using UK14304, the compound at a concentration of 10 μmwas added 1 min prior to 8-CPT or NGF. Cells were harvested and disrupted, and extracts were centrifuged at 3,000 × gfor 5 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. Supernatant samples were normalized to contain equal amounts of protein and subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels followed by immunoblot with specified antibodies. Briefly, PC12 cells were treated as described for the differentiation assays and lysed as described above. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. RalGDS-RBD (10 μg) coupled to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) was added to the supernatant and the mixture incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle agitation. Beads were washed twice with 50 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Lubrol. Sample buffer was added and heated at 65 °C for 10 min to uncouple the proteins from the beads. Supernatant samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with the Rap1-specific antibody. The procedure used to ADP-ribosylate G proteins in PC12 cells was essentially the same as previously described. Briefly, cells were treated with or without PTX (100 ng/ml) for 2 h and membrane fractions prepared and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl. The membrane suspension was then incubated with [32P]NAD and PTX (15 ng/ml) at 30 °C for 30 min to ribosylate any remaining PTX substrates and membranes subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. PC12 cells were treated as described above in “PC12 cell differentiation assays,” washed with phosphate-buffered saline and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, N.Y.) under phase-contrast mode and 20-fold magnification. HEK293 cells were treated as described above, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and viewed using a Zeiss LSM 410 invert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscope Systems, Oberkochen, Germany) under green fluorescence detection mode and 63-fold magnification. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblot, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) and processed by standard immunoblot procedures; bound antibodies were visualized by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega). Intensity of the staining was analyzed by Scion Image for Windows (Scion Corporation). In our previous study, Rap1GAP, a regulator of Rap1 signaling, was found to specifically interact with activated Gαz. While binding to Rap1GAP blocked access of RGS proteins to the activated Gαz, it did not affect the ability of Rap1GAP to act on Rap1 (26Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These findings suggested to us another regulatory mechanism that Gαz activation might employ, that of triggering recruitment of Rap1GAP to a specific cellular location to enhance its ability to act on, and thus down-regulate, Rap1 signaling. To address the question of the cellular localization of Rap1GAP, a GFP-Rap1GAP fusion protein was constructed and expressed in HEK293 cells. The GFP-Rap1GAP fusion protein retained functional activity, as cell extracts prepared after transfection exhibited 20-fold greater GAP activity toward Rap1 than extracts from mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Consistent with a previous report on the localization of Rap1GAP (23Halenbeck R. Crosier W.J. Clark R. McCormick F. Koths K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21922-21928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GFP-Rap1GAP was localized predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 1 A). Similar to most other heterotrimeric G proteins, Gαz is localized primarily at the plasma membrane (11Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When constitutively activated Gαz (Gαz QL) was co-transfected with GFP-Rap1GAP, GFP-Rap1GAP translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, this translocation was not triggered by expression of either wild type Gαz (Fig. 1 C) or the QL variant of Gαz lacking the N-terminal myristoylation site required for correct plasma membrane association (non-myristoylated QL Gαz) (Fig. 1 D). We also tested the ability of Gαi2, another member in Gi subfamily, and Gα12, a member of a distinct subfamily, for their abilities to recruit GFP-Rap1GAP to the plasma membrane of these cells. However, neither of these constitutively active forms of α subunits influenced the cellular localization of GFP-Rap1GAP (Fig. 1,E and F), even though expression and membrane association of the two proteins were confirmed (results not shown). In our previous study, deletion of N-terminal 74 amino acids of Rap1GAP was found to eliminate its ability to interact with Gαz, even though its ability to act on Rap1 was completely preserved (26Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As an additional test of the requirement for Gαz binding in the translocation of Rap1GAP, a construct encoding a GFP protein fused to this N-terminal deletion from of Rap1GAP (GFP-ΔN-Rap1GAP) was created. Expression of GFP-ΔN-Rap1GAP in HEK293 cells showed cytosolic localization of this protein similar to that seen with the full-length form (Fig. 1 G). However, co-transfection of Gαz QL did not alter the cellular localization of GFP-ΔN-Rap1GAP (Fig. 1 H). Taken together, all these localization studies demonstrate that activated Gαz can specifically recruit Rap1GAP to the plasma membrane, and that the N-terminal 74 residues of Rap1GAP are required for this consequence of Gαz activation. Having obtained evidence for a functional consequence of the Gαz-Rap1GAP interaction, i.e. a relocalization of Rap1GAP to the membrane where it could potentially act on Rap1 in that cellular location, we were keen to identify a Rap1-mediated biological process on which to test the influence of Gzactivation. Due to the emerging evidence of the importance of the Rap1/B-Raf/ERK signaling pathway in PC12 cell differentiation (20York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 29Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), we chose this cell system for the studies of the functional consequences of Gαz-mediated Rap1GAP relocation to the membrane fraction. Cellular localization of Rap1 and Rap1GAP was examined in PC12 cells expressing the G protein α subunit. Endogenous Rap1 was detected only in the membrane fraction (Fig.2), but not in the cytosol fraction (data not shown). In untransfected PC12 cells, cells expressing wild type Gαz, or cells expressing constitutively active Gαi2, endogenous Rap1GAP was only detected in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 2). While the expression level of Rap1 and Rap1GAP was unchanged in transfected PC12 cells, expression of Gαz QL resulted in a redistribution of endogenous Rap1GAP to the membrane fraction (Fig. 2). This observation confirmed that active form of Gαz was able to recruit endogenous Rap1GAP to the cellular localization of Rap1, and this recruitment is specific to Gz. Consistent with a previous finding (29Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), treatment of PC12 cells with a cAMP analogue, 8-CPT, promoted cell differentiation (Fig.3). Expression of Gαz QL in PC12 cells greatly decreased the 8-CPT-induced differentiation of the cells, while no significant effect on differentiation was observed when wild type Gαz was expressed (Fig. 3, C andD). Furthermore, when the non-myristoylated Gαz QL variant was used in the experiment, there was no significant decrease in the ratio of differentiated PC12 cells (Fig.3 E), indicating that correct localization of Gαz was required for the effect on the differentiation process. These experiments were performed several times and the results, summarized in Fig. 3 F, clearly indicate a specific effect of activated Gαz on PC12 cell differentiation. We also performed an additional set of experiments in which constitutively active forms of Gαi2 or Gα12 were introduced into the PC12 cells; neither of these α subunits affected 8-CPT-induced differentiation of PC12 cells even though they were clearly expressed in the PC12 cells (data not shown). The results of all these studies support the conclusion that the Gαz-Rap1GAP interaction is specific and that correct localization of activated Gαz is required to influence differentiation of PC12 cells induced by the cAMP analogue. Differentiation of PC12 cells through the cAMP-Epac-Rap1 axis leads to activation of B-Raf, phosphorylation of ERKs, and accompanying downstream events (29Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). If the effect of activated Gαz on the differentiation of PC12 cells was mediated through a Gαz-Rap1GAP interaction, we reasoned that activation of Rap1 and phosphorylation of ERKs should be reduced when activated Gαz was present in the cells. Activation of Rap1 in PC12 cells was assessed through the use of pull-down experiments using GST-RalGDS, which specifically binds and stabilizes the GTP-form of Rap1 (30Inoue K. Maurer T. Yamada H. Herrmann C. Horn G. Kalbitzer H.R. Akasaka K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When treated with 8-CPT, activation of endogenous Rap1 was observed within 1 min, and the effect persisted for at least 30 min (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). When PC12 cells were transfected with the constitutively active form of Gαz, Rap1 activation stimulated by 8-CPT treatment was almost completely blocked, while expression of neither wild type Gαz nor the non-myristoylated Gαz QL variant had any significant effect on 8-CPT-induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 4, upper panel). Recent studies on aggregation of platelets obtained from Gαz-null mice showed decreased susceptibility to epinephrine, which has been interpreted as indication that α2A-adrenergic receptors preferentially couple to Gz in platelets (31Rao A.K. Willis J. Kowalska M.A. Wachtfogel Y.T. Colman R.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 494-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yang J., Wu, J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Using a specific agonist for α2A-adrenergic receptors, UK14304, we examined the effects of activating the α2A-adrenergic receptor system on Rap1 activation in PC12 cells. Treatment with UK14304 alone did not affect Rap1 activation in PC12 cells, nor did it affect PC12 cell differentiation induced by 8-CPT (data not shown). However, if PC12 cells were transfected with wild type Gαz and then treated with UK14304 prior to the addition of 8-CPT, Rap1 activation by the cAMP analogue was markedly attenuated (Fig. 4, upper panel). This observation supports the hypothesis that α2A-adrenergic receptors couple to Gz in PC12 cells, and activation of these receptors leads to the activation of Gαz, which results in a down-regulation of Rap1 signaling. To ensure that the above results were not due to overexpression of Gαz, we compared the expression levels of Gαz in transfected PC12 cells with adrenal chromaffin cells, the cell type in which the pheochromocytoma tumors from which PC12 cells are derived (36Lee V. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Either during tumor development or establishment of the PC12 line, the cells seem to have down-regulated Gαz expression as Gαz was virtually undetectable in untransfected PC12 cells (data not shown). Transfection of the PC12 cells the amounts of plasmid used in these studies resulted in increased expression of Gαz in the membrane fraction of the cells, and the expression levels obtained were in the range of that observed in the parental adrenal chromaffin cells (Fig. 4,lower panel), indicating that the level of Gαzin the transfected PC12 cells was similar to its physiological level in the adrenal medulla. We next examined whether 8-CPT-induced phosphorylation of ERKs was attenuated by activation of Gzin PC12 cells, which would be the predicted consequence of reducing Rap1 activation. While the total amounts of ERK p42 and p44 did not change upon treatment with 8-CPT, phosphorylation of ERKs detected with a phosphospecific antibody was markedly increased (Fig.5). This ERK activation was completely blocked by expression of Gαz QL, but not by wild type Gαz or the non-myristoylated Gαz QL variant (Fig. 5). In addition, treatment of cells expressing wild type Gαz with the α2A-adren"

Still the mechanisms controlling human adipose tissue angiotensin II concentrations are not yet known. We investigated whether angiotensin II is degraded by human primary cultured preadipocytes and adipocytes and which enzymes are responsible for its metabolism. Distinct but transient angiotensin II production was limited by degradation due to consecutive proteolytic cleavage by endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activities. The endopeptidase could be identified as neprilysin expressed on the surface of both preadipocytes and adipocytes. Degradation of angiotensin II was preceded by a lag phase that was considerably longer in preadipocytes. This time span could not be explained by an induction of neprilysin nor by an increase in its surface localization. Following the lag phase, adipocytes showed a higher degradation activity than preadipocytes as mirrored by increased neprilysin levels and activity measured in their membrane fractions. Our findings demonstrate that human preadipocytes and adipocytes differentially express functional neprilysin and aminopeptidase activity involved in the regulation of angiotensin II concentrations in human adipose tissue.

Research over last decades has uncovered that the evolutionary origin of the RAS is the central nervous system, where Ang peptides control electrolyte and water balance in species as diverse as leeches and mammals (1Kobayashi H. Takei Y. Zoophysiology. 1996; 35: 1-5Google Scholar). During the evolution of vertebrates the RAS was adapted to function in the circulation and other tissues as well, although with modifications. Adipose tissue is one of those tissues to possess a local RAS. Angiotensinogen, the sole precursor for all Ang peptides, is synthesized and secreted by adipocytes from all species tested so far. Its production is up-regulated during the differentiation of preadipocytes and can therefore be considered a late marker of adipose conversion (2Engeli S. Negrel R. Sharma A.M. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 1270-1277Google Scholar). Experiments with transgenic mice engineered to express angiotensinogen only in adipose tissue show that adipose tissue-angiotensinogen is released from adipose tissue into the bloodstream and plays a role in the circulating RAS as well (3Massiéra F. Bloch-Faure M. Ceiler D. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Gasc J.-M. Quignard-Boulangé A. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Seydoux J. Meneton P. Teboul M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2727-2729Google Scholar). Next to angiotensinogen adipose tissue possesses proteases able to cleave angiotensinogen to Ang I or Ang II, namely renin (EC 3.4.23.15) (4Karlsson C. Lindell K. Ottosson M. Sjostrom L. Carlsson B.

Ottosson M. Sjostrom L. Carlsson B. Carlsson L.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3925-3929Google Scholar). Interconversion of Ang I, which is physiologically inactive, to Ang II and alternative fragments can be achieved by aminopeptidases (AP), carboxypeptidases, and endopeptidases. AP that have been demonstrated to act on Ang peptides and to be present in adipose tissue are membrane alanine AP (EC3.4.11.2) (9Gronthos S. Franklin D.M. Leddy H.A. Robey P.G. Storms R.W. Gimble J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 54-63Google Scholar), adipocyte-derived leucine AP (EC 3.4.11.?) (10Hattori A. Kitatani K. Matsumoto H. Miyazawa S. Rogi T. Tsuruoka N. Mizutani S. Natori Y. Tsujimoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 755-762Google Scholar), and cystinyl-AP (EC 3.4.11.3) (11Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606Google Scholar). Next to kallikrein and cathepsin G, which can act on Ang I in addition to angiotensinogen, dipeptidyl-dipeptidase A (EC 3.4.15.1), better known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and chymase (3.4.21.39) both cleave Ang I to Ang II (12Sanker S. Chandrasekharan U.M. Wilk D. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2963-2968Google Scholar) and can be found in adipose tissue (5Schling P. Mallow H. Trindl A. Löffler G. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: 336-341Google Scholar, 13Engeli S. Gorzelniak K. Kreutz R. Runkel N. Distler A. Sharma A.M. J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 555-560Google Scholar). Ang II seems to be a hyperplastic and hypertrophic factor for murine adipose tissue (14Ailhaud G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 127-133Google Scholar) but inhibits adipose conversion of human preadipocytes (15Schling P. Löffler G. Horm. Metab. Res. 2001; 33: 189-195Google Scholar). Once created, signals also have to be switched off for effective signal transduction. Peptidergic hormones can be degraded by extracellular peptidases or internalized by ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis to be hydrolyzed intracellularly. No information is yet available on the control of Ang II levels in adipose tissue. Still this issue is of vital importance to Ang II signal transduction in human adipose tissue, where it is thought to take part in the development and maintenance of diseases clustered in the metabolic syndrome (16Schling P. Löffler G. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 99-104Google Scholar). In the present study we therefore investigated the production and degradation of Ang II by human preadipocytes and in vitrodifferentiated adipocytes. Human adipose tissue was chosen because of severe species differences to rodent models concerning the adipose tissue RAS. Renin, for example, cannot be detected in mouse adipocytes (8Saye J.A. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. Peach M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1570-C1576Google Scholar), but when human renin is expressed ectopically in mice, high expression levels of the transgene are found in white adipose tissue (17Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M. Wu C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Google Scholar). ACE, on the other hand, is only present in the stromal vascular fraction of rat adipose tissue (18Crandall D.L. Herzlinger H.E. Saunders B.D. Kral J.G. Drug Dev. Res. 1994; 32: 117-125Google Scholar), although it is expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes in humans (5Schling P. Mallow H. Trindl A. Löffler G. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: 336-341Google Scholar, 19Jonsson J.R. Game P.A. Head R.J. Frewin D.B. Blood Press. 1994; 3: 72-75Google Scholar). Therefore, only results obtained with human adipose tissue cells can be expected to be valid for the in vivo situation in man. By using primary isolated preadipocytes, secondarily differentiating them in vitro, we were able to disclose individual sequences of events avoiding the overall complexity of adipose tissue. The present study characterizes for the first time the enzymes responsible for Ang II degradation by human adipose tissue cells and defines their importance in regulating the extracellular Ang II concentration. Human preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained during abdominal or breast plastic reductive surgery from healthy women aged 17–59 years as described (5Schling P. Mallow H. Trindl A. Löffler G. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: 336-341Google Scholar, 15Schling P. Löffler G. Horm. Metab. Res. 2001; 33: 189-195Google Scholar). The basal serum-free defined medium (SD6 medium) used in all cell culture experiments consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's Nutrient Mixture F-12 (3:1, without phenol red) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 30 mmNaHCO3, 1 μm biotin, 17 μm pantothenate, 2 μg/ml transferrin, and 1 μm insulin. For all experiments isolated, preadipose cells were placed into culture dishes in SD6 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) to allow for overnight attachment. Three culture regimens were used to obtain preadipocytes, differentiating cells, and adipocytes. Preadipocytes were propagated to confluence in SD6 + 10% FCS. On the day of confluence the medium was changed to SD6 alone and the incubation continued for another 14 days. To obtain differentiating cells, the serum-containing medium was removed 1 day after cell preparation, and propagation was achieved in SD6medium supplemented with 1 nm human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 50 nmcortisol. On the day of confluence the medium was changed to SD6 supplemented with 100 nm cortisol and 500 μmisobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and cells were harvested 2 days later. For the development of adipocytes, primary preadipocytes were grown to confluence in SD6 medium supplemented 1 nm bFGF and 50 nm cortisol. Differentiation was induced with SD6 supplemented with 100 nm cortisol and 500 μm IBMX for 3 days, and adipose conversion proceeded for another 11 days in SD6 medium alone. The primary human fibroblast cell line N1, originally derived from adult skin of a healthy donor, was kindly provided by Dr. Gero Brockhoff and propagated to confluence in SD6 + 10% FCS, at which point cells were harvested. During the entire culture period, media changes were conducted three times weekly and cells incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Lipid accumulation was monitored daily by phase contrast microscopy. For the enzymatic and Ang II degradation measurements, preadipocytes and adipocytes were lysed by sonification (homogenate) followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 140,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was collected (soluble cell fraction), and the pellet, corresponding to a crude membrane fraction, was resuspended in either enzyme assay buffer or SD6 medium (membranes). For Western blots N1 fibroblast homogenates were fractionated by sequential centrifugation at 4 °C as follows: 15 min at 1,000 ×g, 15 min at 16,000 × g, and 1 h at 140,000 × g. The supernatant of the last centrifugation step was referred to as “soluble cell fraction.” As sonification was the means of initial cell breakage, both the plasma membrane and organelles will have been ruptured into fragments of variable size and might therefore be contained in the 16,000 ×g pellet as well as the 140,000 × g pellet. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). 14 days after having reached confluence, on the day of the experiment, preadipocytes and adipocytes were harvested and cell fractions subsequently diluted to 200 μg/ml. All enzyme assays were performed at room temperature. The glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) assay was performed essentially as described (21Pairault J. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5138-5142Google Scholar). AP activity was determined with five different amino acid-para-nitroanilides (pNA) as artificial substrates. 200 μl of reaction mixture in assay buffer (0.01 m NaCl, 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4) contained the indicated concentrations of substrate (0.1–8 mm) and 25 μl of diluted cell fractions. An increase in absorbance at 405 nm was followed for 60 min and ΔE/min determined from the linear part of the curve. Neprilysin activity was determined as described (22Indig F.E. Ben-Meir D. Spungin A. Blumberg S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 237-240Google Scholar), but with Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA as substrate (23Mari B. Checler F. Ponzio G. Peyron J.-F. Manie S. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3875-3885Google Scholar). To cleave the resulting Phe-pNA 5 μl of 0.5 mg/ml membrane alanine AP (Sigma) was included in the test, which had been shown earlier to be well above the expected activity of neprilysin. Because the AP itself slowly liberates pNA from Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA, a control reaction was always included in the measurement and subtracted from the other samples. Per 10-cm2 cell culture dish, 2 ml of SD6 medium with or without 0.5 nm Ang II were added either 14 (preadipocytes/adipocytes) or 2 days (differentiating cells) post-confluence, and 125- (degradation measurements) or 400-μl aliquots (Ang II secretion measurements) were taken at the time points indicated under “Results.” The aliquots were mixed with 4 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and centrifuged at 4 °C, 2000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was lyophilized. The lyophilisate was dissolved in EIA buffer, and Ang II concentrations were determined with the commercially available Ang II EIA kit (Bachem, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Medium controls were always included and subtracted from each sample. Medium aliquots were prepared as described for Ang II measurements by EIA, with the exception of Ang II concentration, which was 0.5 mm instead of 0.5 nm. Lyophilisates were dissolved in 125 μl of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) solution A (30 mm formic acid, 4 mmtriethylammonium formate) immediately before injection. For reverse phase HPLC separation of Ang II and its fragments, a C18 column and a linear gradient of acetonitrile at 0.5 ml/min were used. The detector was set to read the absorbance at 232 nm. The injection of the sample at 100% solution A was followed by a linear gradient, increasing solution B (100% acetonitrile) from 0 to 20% over 15 min. This ration was maintained for 10 min, in which the last peak, Ang II, eluted. The column was washed by increasing solution B to 100% within 15 min and maintaining this concentration for 10 min. No prominent peaks were ever detected during the regeneration of the column. Preadipocytes, adipocytes, N1 fibroblasts, and rat kidney were lysed by sonification. Cell fractions from N1 fibroblasts were obtained as described. These preliminary results with N1 cells showed no necessity for membrane preparations (Fig. 5A). The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), and equal loading was verified by Coomassie staining of a second gel run in parallel (not shown). 20 μg of N1 lysates, 1 μg of rat kidney lysates, and 2 μg of adipocyte and preadipocyte lysates were routinely used for SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, followed by incubation in blocking solution (PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at room temperature, overnight incubation at 4 °C in blocking solution containing either mouse monoclonal antibody NCL-CD10-270 (Novacastra, UK), diluted 1:200, or rabbit polyclonal antibody sc-9149 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:100. Washed membranes were incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h (Sigma). Membranes were washed again before treatment with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and exposure to x-ray film. 14 days after reaching confluence on collagen I-coated coverslips, cells were incubated for 0, 3, or 6 h in SD6 medium containing 0.5 nm Ang II, washed with physiological NaCl solution, and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. All further incubation steps were performed at room temperature in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS if not specified otherwise. Formaldehyde was washed off with PBS, and cells were incubated with 0.005% (w/v) saponin in PBS for 30 min for permeabilization or with PBS alone if permeabilization of the plasma membrane was not desired. Unspecific binding was blocked for 30 min, followed by incubation of the coverslips with the primary antibody (NCL-CD10-270, 1:5; Novacastra, UK) for 2 h, a 5-min wash repeated twice, incubation with the secondary antibody (IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, 1:5; Sigma), and washing three times for 10 min. Cells were mounted with the slow fade light anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes) and photographed. Calculations of arithmetic means, S.E., and Student's t tests were performed with the SPSS software from SPSS, Inc. (Chicago). The level of significance was set to 5%. “n” depicts individual repeats of the respective experiment, each with cells isolated from different tissue preparations. Graphic representation of data was achieved with the software program Sigma Plot from SPSS, Inc. (Chicago). Densitometric scanning of Western blots was performed with the Bio 1D densitometric system from Vilbert Lourmat (Marne la Valleé, France). Human preadipocytes were kept in a fibroblast-like cell morphology by propagation in SD6 medium containing 10% FCS. The same cells, cultured in basal serum-free defined medium and induced with IBMX and cortisol for 3 days after reaching confluence, differentiated into adipocytes as monitored by intracellular lipid accumulation (not shown) and increased specific GPDH activity. Specific GPDH activity was highest in the soluble fraction of cell lysates and was significantly elevated in adipocytes (TableI), as expected for a cytosolic adipogenic differentiation marker.Table IGPDH activity of different cell fractionsCell fractionPreadipocytesAdipocytesDifference (p)Specific activity% maximum activitySpecific activity% maximum activitymilliunits/mgmilliunits/mgHomogenate61.3 ± 38.853.91622.6 ± 457.456.00.125Membranes17.7 ± 9.715.6452.2 ± 184.415.60.149Soluble fraction113.7 ± 83.21002899.5 ± 793.41000.007 Open table in a new tab Ang II concentrations were determined in basal serum-free defined cell culture medium conditioned by preadipocytes, adipocytes, and cells stimulated for 2 days with cortisol and IBMX. Concerning the first 9 h of observation, an accumulation of Ang II was found that was followed by a gradual decline in the concentration of the hormone. This finding holds true for all cell types tested (Fig. 1A). Whereas maximal Ang II levels were comparable in preadipocytes and adipocytes, they were significantly lower in cells treated with IBMX and cortisol for 2 days post-confluence. This is in contrast to results obtained previously with 3T3-L1 cells (25Mallow H. Löffler G. Int. J. Obes. 1997; 21 Suppl. 2: 92Google Scholar). In an additional experiment confluent preadipocytes and adipocytes were incubated in SD6 medium containing no additives, cortisol, IBMX, or both for 2 days. Two hours after addition of fresh media, no alteration in Ang II levels was found (data not shown). Preadipocytes as well as adipocytes metabolized Ang II when exogenously added to the cell culture medium (Fig. 1B). 0.5 nmAng II was diminished to basal levels within 5 h on differentiating cells and within 10 h upon addition to adipocytes, while it took 24–36 h with preadipocytes. There are three possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, confluent differentiating cells and adipocytes possess a higher specific metabolizing activity toward Ang II. Second, differentiating cells and adipocytes have a higher overall protein content than preadipocytes at confluence. Third, differentiating cells and adipocytes start the degradation prior to preadipocytes. Two of these possibilities were shown to apply, although the specific Ang II degrading activity was only slightly elevated in differentiating cells/adipocytes (23.05 ± 6.3 nanounits/g in differentiating cells and 21.1 ± 3.5 nanounits/g in adipocytesversus 15.2 ± 2.8 nanounits/g in preadipocytes; not significant (p = 0.341/0.676)) 2The measurement of Ang II degrading activity was done right after termination of the lag phase, when the degradation rate was maximal. The units are used as follows: nanounits/g, 10−15 mol of Ang II degraded per min per g of cellular protein; nm/h, 10−9m Ang II degraded within 1 h. ; the whole cell protein content was elevated in differentiating cells and significantly higher in adipocytes (0.18 ± 0.04 mg/dish in differentiating cells and 0.21 ± 0.02 mg/dish in adipocytesversus 0.13 ± 0.02 mg/dish in preadipocytes;p = 0.291/0.005). This consequently led to an increased absolute metabolization rate in differentiating cells and adipocytes (0.23 ± 0.02 nm/h in differentiating cells and 0.24 ± 0.04 nm/h in adipocytesversus 0.08 ± 0.006 nm/h in preadipocytes; p = 0.007/0.003).2Next, the lag phase (Fig. 1B, inset) preceding the onset of Ang II degradation was much longer for preadipocytes than for differentiating cells and adipocytes (<1 h for differentiating cells and 3.35 ± 0.39 h for adipocytes versus 8.20 ± 1.07 h for preadipocytes; p < 0.001). Therefore, Ang II disappearance from the culture medium began earlier and proceeded at a higher rate with differentiating cells and adipocytes (Fig. 1B). Ang II disappearance from the cell culture medium can either be caused by ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis or by extracellular degradation catalyzed by secreted or membrane-based ectopeptidases. To distinguish between these two possibilities Ang II was added in combination with diverse protease inhibitors and AT1- and AT2-receptor blockers. Although the receptor blockers losartan (AT1-specific) and PD 123319 (AT2-specific) alone or in combination had no effect on the disappearance rate of Ang II, protease inhibitors stabilized Ang II levels in preadipocyte and adipocyte supernatants to a variable degree (Fig. 2, Aand B). The two metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and thiorphan were especially effective, even at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 2, C and D). Nevertheless, a receptor-independent uptake of Ang II as well as intracellular effects of the protease inhibitors used here cannot be ruled out completely. To address the question if proteolysis occurs in the extracellular space or at the cell surface, the Ang II-degrading capability of different cell fractions, conditioned medium alone, and intact cells was compared (Fig. 2, E and F). As expected, neither SD6 medium alone nor the soluble cell fraction showed considerable degradation of the added Ang II. Instead, intact cells and cell homogenates are both active toward Ang II and degrade 40–60% of the added peptide within 2 h. Unexpectedly, 2 h after mixing the crude membrane fraction with SD6medium containing 0.5 nm Ang II, 0.55–0.7 nm Ang II was measured. Still this value dropped to 0.1–0.2 nm Ang II when membranes were incubated for 12 h instead (data not shown). The absorbance of Ang II and its fragments can be detected at 232 nm following separation by HPLC. To obtain fragment concentrations well above the detection limit, a supraphysiological Ang II concentration of 0.5 mmhad to be used. With these experimental settings, four additional peaks could be detected next to the expected Ang II signal and the three medium peaks (Fig. 3). Peaks 4, 5, and 8 were identified by mass spectrometry and Edman protein sequencing as Ang(1–4)/Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr, Ang(6–8)/His-Pro-Phe, and Ang II, respectively. Peaks 2 and 6 had identical retention times as Ang(3–4)/Val-Tyr and Ang(5–8)/Ile-His-Pro-Phe, respectively. Ile eluted with peak 1. Although not tested, Ang(1–2)/Asp-Arg is expected to have eluted with peak 1 also due to its hydrophilic nature. When interpreting the time course of appearance and disappearance of the Ang II fragments (Fig. 4, A andB), it was found for both preadipocytes and adipocytes, that Ang(1–4) and Ang(5–8) appeared first, followed by Ang(3–4) and Ang(6–8). Ang II was thus first cleaved centrally to yield two tetrapeptides, which were secondarily degraded themselves. Ang(1–4) was cleaved to Ang(3–4) and either Asp and Arg or the dipeptide Ang(1–2)/Asp-Arg. Ang(5–8) was cleaved to Ile and Ang(6–8). The turnover rates of Ang(5–8) in preadipocytes and adipocytes and of Ang(6–8) in preadipocytes approximately equaled their rates of synthesis, as hardly any accumulation of these peptides was found. Formation and degradation of the other fragments was about three times slower in preadipocytes than in adipocytes. In preadipocytes Ang(1–4) and Ang(5–8) were maximal 36 h after Ang II had been added to the medium, followed by the Ang(3–4) peak another 12 h later (Fig. 4A). In adipocytes Ang(1–4) and Ang(5–8) were maximal ∼7 h after Ang II addition to the medium, followed by the Ang(3–4) and Ang(6–8) peak 5 h later (Fig. 4B). Four metalloendopeptidases are known to cleave Ang II into the fragments Ang(1–4) and Ang(5–8) observed here; neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11), thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), and meprin A (EC 3.4.24.18) (26Mentlein R. Roos T. Peptides. 1996; 17: 709-720Google Scholar). Whereas thimet oligopeptidase and neurolysin are intracellular enzymes (27Fontenele-Neto J.D. Massarelli E.E. Garrido P.A.G. Beaudet A. Ferro E.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 438: 399-410Google Scholar), meprin A is insensitive to phosphoramidon (28Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Google Scholar) and thiorphan (29Spencer-Dene B. Thorogood P. Nair S. Kenny A.J. Harris M. Henderson B. Development. 1994; 120: 3213-3226Google Scholar). We therefore examined if neprilysin is expressed in human preadipocytes and in in vitro differentiated adipocytes. We detected high levels, comparable with those of rat kidney and about 10 times higher than those found in fibroblasts, of neprilysin in whole cell lysates by Western blot (Fig. 5, C andD). On the contrary, the NCL-CD10-270 antibody showed no immunoreactivity toward the soluble cell fraction of fibroblasts (Fig. 5A), preadipocytes, and adipocytes (data not shown). A second antibody against neprilysin (sc-9149, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) also did detect a protein in the expected molecular weight range, although with far less specificity, as two additional bands were observed in the soluble cell fraction (Fig. 5B). The band believed to be immunoreactive neprilysin is seen in the cell homogenate (lane 1), the 16,000 × g fraction (lane 3), and the 140,000 × g fraction (lane 5). For further studies only the NCL-CD10-270 antibody was used. Adipocytes expressed twice as much neprilysin per whole cell protein than preadipocytes. Neither in adipocytes nor in preadipocytes did neprilysin levels alter upon exposure to 0.5 nm Ang II. By immunohistochemistry neprilysin was found in punctate intensities on the cell surface of preadipocytes and adipocytes (Fig. 6, A–C), similar to the pattern previously described for human neutrophils (30Erdös E.G. Skidgel R.A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 145-151Google Scholar). The pattern was not influenced by permeabilization of the cell membrane with saponin, indicating that no additional intracellular neprilysin stores exist that could serve as reservoirs for rapid alterations in neprilysin membrane levels. Neither was any difference seen in cells pretreated with 0.5 nm Ang II (data not shown). Neprilysin activity was highest in the membrane fraction of preadipocytes as compared with whole cell lysates and the soluble cell fraction (Table II) and inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of phosphoramidon and thiorphan (TableIII). Neprilysin activity in preadipocyte membranes was only 70% that found in adipocyte membranes (Table II), which correlates well with the Western blot data.Table IINeprilysin and aminopeptidase activity of different cell fractionsCell fractionNeprilysinAminopeptidaseSpecific activity% maximum activitySpecific activity% maximum activitymilliunits/mgmilliunits/mgPreadipocyte15.1 ± 3.939.561.7 ± 6.432.6Ho"

The absence of disulfide isomers demonstrates that specific folding information resides within the isolated chains (8Tang J.G. Tsou C.L. Biochem.

In this article we investigate whether the N-terminal α-helix of the A chain is necessary for the success of chain combination. Inspection of crystal structures suggests that this helix is an integral component of the insulin fold (3Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.M.

Introduction of multiple glycine substitutions into the A1–A5 segment (highlighted in red in Fig.1 B) yields analogs that are inactive and less stable than native insulin. Such substitutions shave side-chain contacts and attenuate helical propensities (19Luo Y. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5283-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Glycine substitutions are studied in the context of a variant B chain designed to prevent formation of insulin dimers and hexamers. The engineered monomer (designated DKP-insulin) exhibits enhanced stability and activity (20Weiss M.A. Frank B.H. Khait I. Pekar A. Heiney R. Shoelson S.E. Neuringer L.J.

To correlate synthetic yields with structure, circular dichroism (CD)2 and two-dimensional 1H NMR studies of a representative analog lacking invariant side chains IleA2 and ValA3(A chain sequence GGGEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN; substitutions underlined and cysteines in bold) are presented. We demonstrate that chain combination is robust to multiple glycine substitutions in the N-terminal segment of the A chain and thus that this segment does not participate in the transition state of the pairing reaction. The solution structure of [GlyA2,GlyA3]DKP-insulin exhibits local unfolding of the A1–A5 segment in an otherwise native-like structure. Although the supersecondary structure of the B chain is not significantly perturbed by the variant A chain, conformational broadening of amide resonances is reduced relative to DKP-insulin. These observations suggest that packing of the native A1–A8 α-helix influences the time scale of fluctuations in the B chain. Non-cooperative detachment of the A1–A5 segment is in accord with the modular partial folds of populated disulfide intermediates in the oxidative folding pathway of proinsulin (1Hua Q.X., Hu, S.Q.

Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Concentrations of A and B chains were 1.2 and 0.4 mm, respectively; a molar excess of A chain favors A-B pairing (relative to B chain aggregation) and compensates for formation of cyclic A chains. S-Sulfonate modification enhances peptide solubility and renders peptides refractory to disulfide chemistry. Specific A-B pairing is initiated by addition of dithiothreitol in quantity stoichiometric to the concentration of S-sulfonate groups. Relative yields are given in Table II. In a mock chain-combination reaction lacking the A chain, 10% of the B chain mass remained as HPLC-recoverable monomers after 24 h, whereas 60% was sedimented by microcentrifugation; in a mock reaction lacking B chain, the oxidized A chains remained soluble and recoverable by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC).Table IReceptor binding activitiesAnalogActivity%Human insulin100DKP-insulinaDKP-insulin contains three substitutions in the B chain to prevent self-assembly; the classical dimer interface is destabilized by substitutions ProB28 → Lys and LysB29→ Pro, whereas the hexamer interface is destabilized by HisB10 → Asp (21, 56).

Re-chromatography of this material on RP-HPLC under the same conditions in each case gave a single sharp peak. Amino acid analyses and mass spectrometry in each case gave expected values. The purity of the insulin analogs was in each case greater than 98% as evaluated by analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Electrospray mass spectra revealed no anomalous molecular masses as contaminants. Native disulfide pairing of GlyA3-insulin was determined by x-ray crystallography in an R6 zinc hexamer. 3G. D. Smith, S. Nakagawa, H. S. Tager, and M. A. Weiss, manuscript in preparation. Native disulfide pairing of G3-DKP-insulin was verified by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy as follows. A native-like nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) on the protein surface is observed between the β proton of CysA7 and the α proton of CysB7; a native-like NOE in the core is observed between the β proton of CysA6 and the side chain of LeuB6; the positions of CysA11, CysA19, and CysB20 are well defined in the core by a native-like network of inter-residue NOEs involving LeuA16, LeuB11, and PheB24. Imposition of non-native pairing schemes in molecular models would violate one or more of these NOEs. Correct pairing of the remaining analogs was assumed. 4Insulin chain combination in each case was observed to generate a unique product and not a mixture of isomers, which typically exhibit very different HPLC mobilities (10Hua Q.X.

To our knowledge, in no instance have mutations in insulin caused mispairing in synthesis. Gross substitution of the entire insulin B chain by the B domain of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) yields native and non-native isomers in equilibrium (57Guo Z.Y. Shen L. Feng Y.M.

Foushee D.B. Van Wyk J.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1974; 39: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), stored at −80 °C in small aliquots, and thawed prior to use. Membrane fragments (0.025 mg of protein/tube) were incubated with 125I-labeled insulin (∼30,000 cpm) in presence of selected concentrations of unlabeled peptide for 18 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.25 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl and 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at pH 8. Subsequent to incubation, each mixture was diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer and centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed by aspiration, and the membrane pellet counted for radioactivity. Data were corrected for nonspecific binding (amount of radioactivity remaining membrane-associated in the presence of 1 μm human insulin). Each determination was performed with three or four replicates (see Table I); values are reported as mean and standard deviation. Far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectra of each analog were obtained using an Aviv spectropolarimeter equipped with thermister temperature control and automated titration unit for guanidine denaturation studies. CD samples for wavelength spectra contained 25–50 μm insulin analog in (a) 50 mm KCl and 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) or (b) 100 mm KCl and 10 mm glycine (pH 10.5); samples were diluted to 5 μm for equilibrium denaturation studies. Data were obtained at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Guanidine denaturation data were fitted by non-linear least squares (36Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, CD data were fitted to Equation 1. θ(x)=θA+θBe(−ΔGH2Oo−mx)/RT1+e−(ΔGH2Oo−mx)/RTEquation 1 x is the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride, and θA and θB are base-line values in the native and unfolded states.

Fitting CD data and base lines simultaneously circumvents artifacts associated with linear plots of ΔG as a function of denaturant according to ΔGo(x) = ΔG H2Oo + mBx (for review, see Ref. 36Sosnick T.R.

Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). In the absence of appropriate signals, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with one of several inhibitory IκB species (1May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Its release from IκB and translocation to the nucleus results from activation of IκB kinase (IKK) (3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). NFκB transcriptionally regulates an array of genetic responses, many of which determine the balance between cell survival and death. Its activity is particularly important for cells to resist apoptosis triggered by surface death receptors (4Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). As an illustration, mice lacking p65 die at embryonic day 12 as a result of massive liver apoptosis triggered by TNF-α (5Doi T.S. Marino M.W. Takahashi T. Yoshida T. Sakakura T. Old L.J. Obata Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, the nature of actions of NFκB on the balance between life and death is complex because NFκB also mediates cell death. For example, wild-type p53 induces activation of NFκB in response to genotoxic stress, and inhibition of NFκB activity under these circumstances abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis (6Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). NB is a malignant tumor that develops in children, arising from neoplastic cells of neural crest origin (7Saxen L. Saxen E. Cancer. 1960; 13: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the cure rate of children with high risk NB remains at <20%, providing a compelling reason to better understand the molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to treat this disease (8Frappaz D. Michon J. Coze C. Berger C. Plouvier E. Lasset C. Bernard J.L. Stephan J.L. Bouffet E. Buclon M. Combaret V. Fourquet A. Philip T. Zucker J.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 468-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schmidt M.L. Lukens J.N. Seeger R.C. Brodeur G.M. Shimada H. Gerbing R.B. Stram D.O. Perez C. Haase G.M. Matthay K.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The study of this disease is further complicated by the fact that NB tumors are composed of a mixture of histologically distinct malignant cell types identified as neuroblastic and stromal cells (10Roald H.S.A.B. Brodeur G.M. Sawada T. Tsuchida Y. Voute P.A. Neuroblastoma. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 341-354Google Scholar). In culture, tumor cell explants reflect this heterogeneity in that cells demonstrate one of the three phenotypes: neuronal (N)-, stromal (S)-, or intermediate (I)-type. N-type cells contain enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, grow as poorly adherent aggregates of small round cells with neuritic processes, and express cell surface receptors characteristic of embryonic neuronal precursors. S-type cells grow flattened and adherent to substrate and are devoid of the synthetic machinery for neurotransmitter synthesis (11Biedler J.L. Helson L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2652PubMed Google Scholar). I-type cells share certain characteristics with S- and N-type cells and can be induced to further differentiate along either lineage (12Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with S-type cells, N-type cells are more tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice and express higher levels of the tumor marker MYCN and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (13Piacentini M. Piredda L. Starace D.T. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Mattei M. Oliverio S. Farrace M.G. Melino G. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In human NB, disease prognosis worsens as the proportion of neuroblastic cells in a tumor increases. These characteristics have made N-type cells the primary focus of studies of NB chemotherapy responsiveness. In previous work, we reported that N-type cells respond to doxorubicin, an agent used to treat this disease, by inducing NFκB activation and that NFκB is necessary for the cytotoxic effects of this drug (14Bian X. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Shao F. Schumacher K.R. Feng Z. Porter A.G. Castle V.P. Opipari Jr., A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48921-48929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the heterogeneity of NB tumors presents the possibility that malignant behavior (including development, persistence, and treatment response) is influenced by the non-neuroblastic components that correspond to S- and I-type cells in culture. Despite their low tumorigenicity in xenograft models, S-type cells in particular have characteristics that suggest an important role in determining disease outcome. Most importantly, recent data show that S- and N-type cells are derived from neoplastic clones that are genetically identical (15Mora J. Cheung N.K. Juan G. Illei P. Cheung I. Akram M. Chi S. Ladanyi M. Cordon-Cardo C. Gerald W.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6892-6898PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, stromal tumor cells appear more able to persist after treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Following cytotoxic therapy, residual tumor deposits are primarily composed of mature atypical ganglion cells and stromal components and lack neuroblastic elements that predominate in specimens prior to treatment (16Ogita S. Tokiwa K. Majima S. Takahashi T. Oncology. 1988; 45: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Chemotherapy-induced differentiation does not correlate with more favorable outcomes, further suggesting that stromal cells have malignant capability. These observations may be partly explained by the increased expression of membrane-bound complement inhibitors such as CD59 on S-type cells (17Chen S. Caragine T. Cheung N.K. Tomlinson S. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1085-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By resisting complement-mediated cell lysis, S-type cells evade an arm of immune surveillance as well as a mechanism that eliminates tumor cells following cytotoxic therapy (18Bolivar R. Kohl S. Pickering L.K. Walters D.L. Cancer. 1980; 46: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because S-type cells are capable of trans-differentiating into N-type cells in vitro (19Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Chang T.D. Ross R.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 271: 265-276PubMed Google Scholar), a model of NB tumorigenesis has been proposed in which S-type cells provide a reserve pool of tumor cells that survive even when N-type cells are successfully targeted (15Mora J. Cheung N.K. Juan G. Illei P. Cheung I. Akram M. Chi S. Ladanyi M. Cordon-Cardo C. Gerald W.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6892-6898PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and MYCN are highly expressed in N-type cells and appear to primarily account for their survival advantage and tumorigenic phenotype (20Jasty R. van Golen C. Lin H.J. Solomon G. Heidelberger K. Polverini P. Opipari A. Feldman E. Castle V.P. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). S-type cells express at most low levels of Bcl-2 and are rarely MYCN-amplified. Consequently, their survival must depend on other molecular mechanisms that could be important targets for therapy. This report describes experiments performed to test the hypothesis that NFκB supports S-type cell survival. Results show that NFκB is constitutively active in two S-type NB cell lines and that this activity is necessary for their survival. Pharmacological or molecular inhibition of NFκB induced apoptosis that was associated with the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane gradient and caspase-9 activation. NFκB species comprised of p50/p50 homodimers and p65/p50 heterodimers were present in the nuclei of S-type cells but not in N-type cells. Consistent with these results, constitutive NFκB-dependent gene transcription was detected in S-type cells. These findings add to the understanding of the mechanistic importance of NFκB in NB and define a significant difference between S- and N-type cells with respect to NFκB. Future therapeutic strategies should consider the complex behavior of NFκB as an arbiter of NB cell survival.

Cells were seeded in tissue culture plates to achieve 50% confluence. 24 h later, cells were transfected using a mixture of DNA and LipofectAMINE Plus in Opti-MEM I. 8 h following transfection, cells were supplemented with serum at a final concentration of 10%. Cells were then treated as indicated. NB cells were plated in triplicates at 104 cells/well in 96-well culture plates in minimal essential medium. For consecutive days following treatment, cells were incubated with MTT dye (5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h and lysed in buffer containing 20% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v)N,N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.5). Absorbance at 600 nm (A 600) was determined for each well using an automated microplate reader (Biotek Instruments, Winnoski, VT). After subtraction of the background absorbance, the absorbance of treated cells was divided by that of the untreated cells to obtain the percent viability. The Student's t test was used to test the significance of the difference in cell viability for these assays. Cells were co-transfected with 1.75 μg of control vector pCMV4 or pCMV4-SR-IκBα-FLAG along with 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pEF-1-Bos/β-galactosidase). 24 h following transfection, cells were stained with X-gal and visualized by light microscopy. Following treatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCL, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Aliquots of cell lysates containing 30 μg of total protein were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with anti-IκBα or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). S-type NB cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid pBVIx-Luc as described. To assure identical transfection efficiency in control and treated cells, cells were replated 12 h after transfection into 12-well plates, and after attachment they were treated as indicated. After cells were harvested, luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using the luciferase reagent kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). An aliquot of the same samples was subjected to protein concentration determination (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity was then normalized to protein concentration. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Schafer H. Diebel J. Arlt A. Trauzold A. Schmidt W.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and incubated in EMSA reaction buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml poly(dI·dC), 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm DTT with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide encompassing the consensus NFκB binding site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). In the antibody supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.2 μg of anti-p65 or anti-p50 polyclonal antibody for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. After incubation, samples were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells were plated in duplicate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and treated as indicated. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with JC-1 (1 μm) and harvested by trypsinization. ΔψM was determined for 10,000 cells by flow cytometry, and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). NB cells were seeded on 2-chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) at 104 cells/well. After attachment, cells were transiently transfected with pCMV4-SR-IκBα and pEGFP at a ratio of 5:1 as described above. 24 h following transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-pheylindole (2 μg/ml). Epifluorescence was detected using a Nikon eclipse E600 (Nikon, Melville, NY). To explore the role of NFκB in S-type cell survival, two S-type cells lines were treated with small molecules known to inhibit NFκB activation. PDTC is an antioxidant and chelator of heavy metals that blocks NFκB activity by suppressing the release of IκBα from NFκB (23Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). TPCK inhibits NFκB by blocking IκBα degradation (24Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Both compounds dose-dependently kill SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig.1 A). When visualized by interference contrast microscopy after treatment with PDTC or TPCK, cells demonstrated an apoptotic appearance including plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and detachment from the culture flask (Fig. 1 B). These findings were in sharp contrast with our previous results that showed that PDTC blocks cell death of N-type cells, suggesting that NFκB activity and function might differ dramatically according to NB cell phenotype (14Bian X. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Shao F. Schumacher K.R. Feng Z. Porter A.G. Castle V.P. Opipari Jr., A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48921-48929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mechanism and time course of cell death was further characterized with respect to mitochondria dysfunction and caspase activation. JC-1, a fluorescent potentiometric indicator, selectively accumulates in mitochondria and was used to monitor the mitochondrial transmembrane gradient (ΔψM) by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.2 A, the treatment of SH-EP1 cells with PDTC or TPCK causes ΔψM collapse beginning within 4 h of treatment. Caspase-9 activation, which depends on apoptosome formation that is in turn triggered by cytochromec release from mitochondria (25Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar), was also detected in treated cells. Both drugs the induced processing of pro-caspase-9 to the active 35-kDa form between 8 and 12 h after treatment (Fig.2 B). Thus, its activation is slightly delayed relative to ΔψM collapse. Of note, caspase-9 is processed into two forms in the cells treated with TPCK, corresponding to molecular masses of 35 and 37 kDa. In PDTC-treated cells, only the 35-kDa form is detected. This difference may be related to serine protease inhibition by TPCK that can result in altered caspase processing (26Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Together, these data are consistent with an apoptotic response induced by PDTC and TPCK that involves mitochondria-associated signals beginning within 4 h following treatment. Identical changes in ΔψM and in caspase processing were detected in SK-N-AS cells after these treatments (data not shown). Because IκBα levels inversely correlate with NFκB activity, its levels were measured in SH-EP1 cells during treatment to directly correlate the death response with the inhibition of NFκB. As expected, increased IκBα levels in SH-EP1 cells were detected by 8 h of treatment with PDTC and 4 h of treatment with TPCK (Fig. 3 A). Similar increases were also observed in SK-N-AS cells after treatment with these agents (data not shown). To confirm the increase in IκBα reflects diminished NFκB activity, NFκB-dependent gene expression was measured using a NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter construct. SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS cells were transiently transfected with pBVIx-Luc, which contains six tandemly placed NFκB consensus binding sites within the promoter region upstream of sequence encoding firefly luciferase. Using this construct, constitutive NFκB-dependent luciferase activity was detectable in both S-type cell lines in the absence of any treatment (Fig. 3 B). When cells were treated with PDTC or TPCK, luciferase activity decreased in a time-dependent fashion beginning within 4 h of treatment. With PDTC, decreased transcriptional activity occurred prior to the detectable increase in IκBα. This difference may be attributed to the relative insensitivity of immunoblotting to detect early small increases in the protein. On the basis of measurements using the NFκB-dependent luciferase assay, NFκB transcriptional activity decreases within the time frame during which ΔψM is disrupted and prior to pro-caspase-9 processing or morphological evidence of cell death. These results are consistent with the possibility that changes in NFκB activity underlie the apoptotic response to PDTC and TPCK and suggest that constitutive NFκB activity is necessary for SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS cell survival. The reporter gene assays above, which showed basal activity of the NFκB promoter construct in untreated cells, provided initial direct evidence that NFκB is indeed activated in untreated S-type cells. To more firmly establish that this is indeed the case, we directly measured NFκB sequence-specific DNA binding. Nuclear extracts prepared from untreated S-type cells (SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS) were incubated with a32P end-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. As seen in Fig.4 A, extracts of both S-type lines shifted the labeled NFκB oligonucleotide during electrophoresis, resulting in three distinct complexes. Additional experiments were performed to determine which shifted complexes correspond to NFκB-specific binding. First, nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with TNF-α, a potent inducer of NFκB activity (27Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Upon comparison with the EMSA results from untreated cells, the intensity of two bands were increased by TNF-α treatment, consistent with their identity as NFκB·DNA complexes (Fig.4 A, asterisk). Second, confirmation was obtained by antibody supershift experiments in which antibodies specific for either p50 or p65 were added to the mixture of nuclear extract and labeled oligonucleotide. As seen in Fig. 4 B, each of the two putative NFκB·DNA complexes was supershifted by the p50-specific antibody, whereas the larger complex (upper band) was also supershifted by anti-p65. Hence, constitutively active NFκB is detected in S-type cells and consists of both p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers. N-type cells were expected to have little or no basal NFκB DNA binding activity, because prior experiments showed theabsence of constitutive NFκB reporter gene activation in N-type cells (14Bian X. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Shao F. Schumacher K.R. Feng Z. Porter A.G. Castle V.P. Opipari Jr., A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48921-48929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We tested this possibility and directly compared S-type and N-type cells with respect to constitutive NFκB DNA binding activity. As expected, when the EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts prepared from untreated N-type cells (SH-SY5Y and IMR32), neither of the two complexes specific for NFκB·DNA binding was detected (Fig. 4 C). We confirmed that the cytotoxic action of PDTC in S-type cells is related to a reduction of NFκB·DNA binding. Treating SH-EP1 cells with PDTC resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in DNA binding activity (Fig.4 D). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated instead with TPCK (data not shown). These results confirm the constitutive NFκB activity in S-type cells and show that the inhibition of NFκB is associated with the response of S-type cells to small molecule inhibitors of NFκB signaling that induce apoptosis. Experiments were next performed to test whether the specific inhibition of NFκB is sufficient to induce S-type cell death. The super-repressor mutant form of IκBα (SR-IκBα) binds NFκB but can not be phosphorylated on the basis of alanine substitution for serines 32 and 36 (28). SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS cells were co-transfected with pCMV4-SR-IκBα-FLAG along with the NFκB-responsive luciferase reporter (pBVIx-Luc) and the expression plasmid pCDNA3-p35 (21Inohara N. Koseki T., Hu, Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). pCDNA3-p35 encodes a dominant negative inhibitor of caspase-9 and was included in these experiments to block the expected cytotoxic effect of inhibiting NFκB so that changes in transcriptional activity could be detected. SR-IκBα expression was first confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig.5 A). Additionally, cells transfected in this manner showed no evidence of increased cell death compared with cells transfected with SR-IκBα vector-only plasmid (data not shown). In a dose-dependent manner, SR-IκBα expression decreased NFκB-dependent luciferase activity in both cell lines, confirming the activity of the super-repressor against NFκB transcriptional activation in these cells (Fig.5 A). To determine whether the inhibition of NFκB caused cell death, SH-EP1 cells were transiently co-transfected to express SR-IκBα and GFP (as a transfection marker) without the expression plasmid pCDNA3-p35. Control-transfected cells demonstrated normal morphology including intact nuclei (Fig. 5 B, upper panels). In contrast, 24 h following transfection, cells expressing SR-IκBα demonstrated apoptotic morphology: rounding up, detachment, and nuclear condensation (Fig. 5 B, lower panels). This cytotoxic effect was further quantified by enumerating cell survival following transfection on the basis of expression of a co-transfected marker gene, β-galactosidase. SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS cells were transfected with efficiencies of 5.5 and 8.0%, respectively, using the β-galactosidase expression vector. β-Galactosidase-positive cells per high power field were counted 24 h after six independent co-transfections with pEF-1-Bos/β-galactosidase and either pCMV4 control or pCMV4-SR-IκBα-FLAG. For SH-EP1 cells, β-galactosidase positivity decreased from 50 ± 1.9 cells/high power field with control to 17 ± 1.1 following pCMV4-SR-IκBα-FLAG transfection, revealing a 60% reduction in survival (p < 0.01). For SK-N-AS cells, 84 ± 10 β-galactosidase-positive cells/high power field were counted for control compared with 45 ± 5.2 with pCMV4-SR-IκBα-FLAG, a 40% reduction in survival (p< 0.01). Together, these results confirm that specific molecular inhibition of NFκB changes NFκB-dependent gene expression and concomitantly reduces the survival of S-type cells in culture. In the absence of appropriate stimuli, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by physical association with IκB, which prevents exposure of nuclear localization signals. As an immediate response to stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharides, and phorbol esters, IκB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by proteasomes (29Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of NFκB and transcriptional activation of NFκB-responsive genes follow (30Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In turn, NFκB induces the synthesis of IκBα, which results in negative feedback, limiting the magnitude and duration of the response (31Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Despite tight coupling of NFκB to specific signals as outlined above, constitutive NFκB activation can occur. Constitutive NFκB activation appears to have an important role in tumorigenesis. For example, persistent nuclear NFκB localization and NFκB-dependent transcription is detected in breast (32Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), ovarian (33Bours V. Dejardin E. Goujon-Letawe F. Merville M.P. Castronovo V. Biochem.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1372-1377PubMed Google Scholar) tumors. In breast and prostate tumor cells, constitutive NFκB activity is associated with reduced levels of IκBα that appears related to increased degradation of IκB proteins in these cells (38Kim D.W. Sovak M.A. Zanieski G. Nonet G. Romieu-Mourez R. Lau A.W. Hafer L.J. Yaswen P. Stampfer M. Rogers A.E. Russo J. Sonenshein G.E.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 141-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive NFκB activity is also associated with the tumorigenic properties of viruses. The viral homologue of c-rel (v-rel) is transduced in the reticuloendotheliosis virus and is responsible for the acute-transforming properties of this virus in mammalian cells (40Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6925-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of cellular gene-encoded NFκB mediates transformation by human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I. The human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I-encoded Tax protein activates NFκB by stably activating IKK, providing an ongoing signal for IκBα degradation (41Chu Z.L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). IκBα degradation is primarily regulated through the phosphorylation of N-terminal serine residues 32 and 36 by the IKK complex. Phosphorylation at these residues leads to dissociation from NFκB and targets the protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Alternatively, the phosphorylation of C-terminal serine residues by casein kinase 2, phosphorylation at tyrosine 42 under conditions of anoxia, and treatment with UV radiation can result in NFκB activation independent of IKK (42Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Our results are most consistent with the two N-terminal serine residues determining constitutive NFκB activity in S-type cells. This conclusion is based on the inhibitory activity of the mutant SR IκBα that derives its dominant-negative action solely on the basis of alanine substitutions at serine 32 and 36. However, to completely exclude a contribution of the C-terminal region or tyrosine 42, additional mutants involving these residues would need to be studied. Because the IKK complex is the only kinase recognized to directly phosphorylate serine 32 and 36 on IκBα (3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), constitutive IKK activity is suspected to underlie constitutive NFκB activation in this model. The regulation of IKK is complex, and input converges from multiple signaling cascades including those coupled to TrkA (the high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor) and tumor necrosis receptor-1. Additionally, other signals that activate Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and MEKK1 also increase IKK activity. Because S-type cells neither express nerve growth factor receptors nor demonstrate nerve growth factor responsiveness (43Reddy U.R. Venkatakrishnan G. Roy A.K. Chen J. Hardy M. Mavilio F. Rovera G. Pleasure D. Ross A.H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 44Janet T. Ludecke G. Otten U. Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the activity of TrkA or the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor is unlikely to sustain NFκB activation. The autocrine activity of TNF-α seems a more probable possibility. S-type cells are responsive to this cytokine (see Fig. 2), and cells derived from the neural crest (including sympathetic neurons) are known to synthesize both TNF-α and TNFR1 (45Barker V. Middleton G. Davey F. Davies A.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NFκB supports neoplastic growth by preventing cell death. In this study, we found that inhibition of constitutive NFκB activity engages an apoptotic response that specifically involves the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane gradient and caspase-9 activation, both responses associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition. The anti-apoptotic function of NFκB in these cells could be mediated by transcriptional up-regulation of any one of the array of NFκB-responsive genes including TRAF1, TRAF2, c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, A20, and Bcl-xL (46Bui N.T. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the involvement of the mitochondria and caspase-dependent processes in the death response, it is possible that c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 (inhibitors of caspase activation), and Bcl-xL (stabilizer of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore) are potentially important. Indeed, S-type cells have previously been shown to constitutively express Bcl-xL (49Dole M.G. Jasty R. Cooper M.J. Thompson C.B. Nunez G. Castle V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments using an activation-specific antibody against p65, we have uncovered evidence of NFκB activation in a NB tumor specimen (data not shown). From hereon, it will be important to firmly establish whether NFκB is indeed activated specifically within the stromal components of NB tumor specimens and whether differences in activation are associated with stage and histopathologic grade. Efforts to directly measure transcription factor activation are best combined with experiments to quantify the expression of NFκB target genes to more strongly support conclusions regarding NFκB activation. Along these lines, a recent study has elegantly used gene expression profiling to show that diffuse large B cell lymphoma consists of two molecularly distinct diseases that are distinguished on the basis of their constitutive expression of NFκB-induced genes (50Davis R.E. Brown K.D. Siebenlist U. Staudt L.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1861-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Similar experimental strategies are planned to address the question of in vivo NFκB activation in NB. In conclusion, NFκB is constitutively active in S-type NB cells. Moreover, because it is necessary for S-type cell survival in culture, it has the potential to contribute to cellular transformation, tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy. Given its opposing, pro-apoptotic activity in N-type NB cells, therapeutic strategies designed to inhibit NFκB must be approached cautiously.

We found that TRAIL receptor could induce cytochrome c (Cyt c) release from mitochondria in cells that failed to respond to CD95. Therefore, we examined whether these two closely related death receptors use different intermediates to convey the apoptotic signal to mitochondria. Dominant negative FADD, FLIPL, or a Bid mutant lacking cleavage sites for caspase-8/10 completely inhibited Cyt crelease in response to either receptor. Depletion of Bid from TRAIL- or CD95-activated cytosols blocked their capacity to mediate Cytc release from mitochondria in vitro, whereas Bax depletion reduced it. We conclude that FADD, caspase-8/10, and caspase-cleaved Bid are required for TRAIL receptor and CD95 signaling to mitochondria, whereas Bax is a common accessory. In vitro, caspase-8 treatment of cytosol from CD95-resistant cells permitted generation of truncated Bid and its association with mitochondria. However, this cytosol impaired the ability of truncated Bid to liberate Cyt c from exogenous mitochondria. We conclude that the TRAIL receptor can bypass or neutralize the activity of cytosolic factor that blocks truncated Bid function.

Presently six human DR are known, including TNF receptor-1, CD95 (APO-1/Fas), and two receptors for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, also known as TRAIL (3Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J.

Various soluble recombinant ligand forms retain biological activity and have been explored for clinical use. Toxicity of TNFα and CD95 ligand (CD95L) precludes their use for systemic therapy. TRAIL, however, is very promising. In vitro, it killed the majority of malignantly transformed cell lines tested but not normal cells. Both in mouse and monkey preclinical models, TRAIL was not toxic to normal tissues (5Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A., Le, T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Google Scholar, 6Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C. Chang L.

DR are interesting candidates for anti-cancer therapy, because they can bypass certain forms of apoptosis resistance that frequently occur in tumor cells. DR-induced apoptosis is not affected by loss of functional alleles of the p53 transcription factor, which is the most common mutation in human cancer (7El-Deiry W.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1066-1075Google Scholar). Also, in a number of tumor cell lines, CD95 and TRAIL receptors could bypass the inhibitory action of Bcl-2 proto-oncogene products (8Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C., Li, F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar, 9Walczak H. Bouchon A. Stahl H. Krammer P.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3051-3057Google Scholar, 10Knight M.J. Riffkin C.D. Muscat A.M. Ashley D.M. Hawkins C.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5789-5798Google Scholar). Moreover, DR are promising candidates for combination therapy with radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs, in the case of tumors with wild-type p53; TRAIL receptor-2, also called DR5, is a bona fide p53 target gene (11Sheikh M.S. Burns T.F. Huang Y., Wu, G.S. Amundson S. Brooks K.S. Fornace A.J. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1593-1598Google Scholar, 12Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1735-1743Google Scholar). Accordingly, TRAIL proved synergistic with radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs in cell death induction (13Chinnaiyan A.M. Prasad U. Shankar S. Hamstra D.A. Shanaiah M. Chenevert T.L. Ross B.D. Rehemtulla A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1754-1759Google Scholar, 14Lacour S. Hamman A. Wotawa A. Corcos L. Solary E. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1645-1651Google Scholar). The majority of apoptotic stimuli act via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. In this pathway, proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members induce permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane, permitting release of cytochrome c (Cyt c). Binding of cytosolic Cytc and dATP to the scaffold protein Apaf-1 allows recruitment and activation of the inducer caspase-9, followed by effector caspase activation and execution of the apoptotic program. In addition, release of Smac/Diablo alleviates blockade of effector caspases by the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (15Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). Inhibitory Bcl-2 family members prevent mitochondrial permeability (15Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar, 16Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Google Scholar) and consistently inhibit apoptosis induced by DNA damaging (anti-cancer) regimens (17Strasser A. Harris A.W. Jacks T. Cory S. Cell. 1994; 79: 329-339Google Scholar). DR also signal to mitochondria and induce Cyt c release. However, in various cell types, DR can bypass a blockade at the mitochondria imposed by inhibitory Bcl-2 family members. This is explained by their capacity to recruit and activate caspase-8 or -10, which can directly cleave effector caspases (8Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C., Li, F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). The CD95 signaling pathway has been explored by biochemical and genetic approaches. Upon ligand binding, CD95 recruits the FADD adaptor through homotypic death domain interactions. FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 through homotypic death effector domain interactions. Within the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) thus formed at the receptor tail, caspase-8 zymogens are activated by proteolytic self-processing and released into the cytosol, where they can activate effector caspases (18Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Google Scholar). The second death effector domain-containing caspase, caspase-10, has also been demonstrated in the endogenous CD95 DISC (19Kischkel F. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Google Scholar). Recently, FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-10 were all demonstrated in native TRAIL receptor complexes (19Kischkel F. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Google Scholar, 20Sprick M.R. Weigand M.A. Rauch C.T. Juo P. Blenis J. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 599-609Google Scholar, 21Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Google Scholar, 22Bodmer J.-L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Google Scholar). That FADD is required for apoptosis induction by both TRAIL receptors followed from the use of FADD-deficient cells (23Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Google Scholar). Involvement of caspase-8 or -10 was first suggested by the finding that TRAIL receptor-induced apoptosis is blocked by FLICE-inhibitory proteins (FLIPs), which have a death effector domain and compete with caspase-8/10 for FADD binding (24Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattman C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Google Scholar). Moreover, in caspase-8-deficient cells, either caspase-8 or -10 could restore TRAIL receptor and CD95 signaling (19Kischkel F. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Google Scholar). These data indicate that both CD95 and TRAIL receptors induce apoptosis via FADD and either caspase-8 or -10. Caspase-8 cleaves and activates effector caspases but also processes the BH3 domain-only Bcl-2 family member Bid to generate a proapoptotic carboxyl-terminal fragment termed truncated Bid (tBid) (25Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 26Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar). tBid translocates to mitochondria, inserts in the outer membrane, and, in cooperation with Bax or Bak, brings about Cyt c release, by a yet incompletely resolved mechanism (27Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar, 28Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). It has been established that CD95 conveys the apoptotic signal to mitochondria via Bid (26Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar). TRAIL receptors also signal to mitochondria, as evidenced by Cytc release and mitochondrial depolarization (9Walczak H. Bouchon A. Stahl H. Krammer P.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3051-3057Google Scholar, 29Thomas W.D. Zhang X.D. Franco A.V. Nguyen T. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5612-5620Google Scholar, 30Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Google Scholar). However, the exact sequence of events in the TRAIL receptor pathway has not been established. Bid processing has been observed, but it is not clear whether it is instrumental in TRAIL-induced Cyt crelease (30Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Google Scholar, 31MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-11254Google Scholar, 32Yamada H. Tada-Oikawa S. Uchida A. Kawanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 130-133Google Scholar). TRAIL receptor signaling pathways are far from elucidated. TRAIL receptors have been reported to recruit the TRADD adaptor, either downstream or independent of FADD, as well as the RIP kinase (33Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Google Scholar, 34Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.-L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Google Scholar). Both TRAIL receptors activate NF-κB (33Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Google Scholar, 34Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.-L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Google Scholar) and c-Jun kinase. According to certain authors, this proceeds through two distinct cascades emerging from the TRAF2 adaptor protein (35Hu W.-H. Johnson H. Shu H.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30603-30610Google Scholar), whereas others link RIP to the NF-κB response (36Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Google Scholar). DAP3, a GTP-binding adaptor protein, associates with the TRAIL receptor death domains in the yeast two-hybrid system. DAP3 was suggested to link FADD to the receptor tails (37Myazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Google Scholar). However, all of these findings are based on use of transient overexpression systems and may not reflect the endogenous situation. For instance, endogenous TRAIL receptor complexes in BJAB cells did not contain TRADD or RIP, in contrast to TNF receptor-1 complexes (21Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Google Scholar). Our studies were prompted by the observation that variant Jurkat T cells, which failed to display Cyt c release in response to CD95 stimulation, did so in response to TRAIL. We delineate here the pathway employed by TRAIL receptor-2 to convey the death signal to mitochondria. The pathway requires FADD, caspase-8/10, and caspase-cleaved Bid, whereas Bax facilitates the process. We find that in this respect, the TRAIL receptor is indiscernible from CD95 in its mechanism of action. However, TRAIL receptor signaling to the mitochondria is not affected by a cytosolic factor, which impedes the CD95 pathway downstream from tBid. Mouse anti-human CD95 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7C11 was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France), and soluble human recombinant TRAIL and enhancer were from Alexis (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). Recombinant human caspase-8 and anti-Cyt c mAb 7H8.2C12 were obtained from PharMingen. Anti-actin mAb C4 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 was originally from Ortho Pharmaceuticals (Raritan, NJ). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Bid serum was raised in our laboratory against a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and full-length Bid. It detects full-length Bid and tBid, as established in transfection experiments and in vitro (38Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W.G. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22781-22788Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Bax serum SC-493 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-Bax mAb B8429 was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig and swine anti-rabbit Ig were obtained from DAKO A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Protein A- and G-Sepharose beads and the ECL kit for standard immunoblotting procedures were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate for chemiluminescence was from Pierce. The J16 clone was derived from the human T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat by limiting dilution and selected for CD95 sensitivity (39Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Google Scholar, 40Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Google Scholar). CD95-resistant JA variant clones were derived by limiting dilution from the parental Jurkat line after 5 weeks of selection for cells resistant to anti-CD95 mAb (39Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, supplemented with 8% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Before stimulation, cells were transferred to serum-free Yssel's medium (41Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. van Blitterswijk W.J. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Google Scholar) and seeded at 1 × 106/ml, 200 μl/well, in round bottom 96-well plates for apoptosis assays and at 5–10 × 106/ml in 24-well culture plates for Cyt crelease assays. Cells were stimulated with medium, anti-CD95 mAb, recombinant TRAIL plus a 10-fold excess of enhancer, or coated anti-CD3 mAb at the indicated concentrations and incubated for various time periods at 37 °C, 5% CO2. pET15b/Bid vector containing human full-length Bid cDNA was a gift from Dr. X. Wang (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dallas, TX). pET15b/tBid (nucleotides 181–588) was made by introducing suitable restriction sites by PCR into this Bid cDNA. Point mutations in the caspase-8 and Granzyme-B cleavage sites of Bid (pET15b/BidD59E/D75E) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described (26Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar). Human FADD and mouse cellular FLIPL(cFLIPL) cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. J. Tschopp (Institute of Biochemistry, Epalinges, Switzerland). A cDNA encoding dominant negative FADD (dnFADD), lacking amino acids 2–77, was generated by PCR. All sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. dnFADD, cFLIPL, and BidD59E/D75E cDNAs were cloned into the retroviral vector LZRS-MS-IRES-eGFP, and human Bcl-2 cDNA was cloned into LZRS-MS-IRES-Zeo/pBR, both derivatives of LZRS-pBMN-lacZ (42Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Google Scholar), which was provided by Dr. G. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA). To produce retrovirus, LZRS-dnFADD-IRES-eGFP, LZRS-cFLIPL-IRES-eGFP, LZRS-BidD59E/D75E-IRES-eGFP, LZRS-Bcl-2-IRES-Zeo/pBR, or empty vectors were transfected into the 293T human embryonic kidney cell-derived packaging line Phoenix Ampho (42Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Google Scholar), using Fugene-6 transfection reagent, according to instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech).Virus-containing supernatants were harvested after 2–5 days and stored at −80 °C until further use. J16 cells were seeded on dishes coated with RetroNectin (Takara) and transduced with 1 ml of virus-containing supernatant/0.5 × 106cells. Supernatants were removed after overnight incubation, and cells were cultured in fresh medium. Transduced cells were selected for enhanced green fluorescent protein expression using a MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) or selected from 48 h after transduction for growth in the presence of 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). To measure nuclear fragmentation (subdiploid DNA content), cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (43Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar) as described earlier (39Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Google Scholar, 40Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide-stained DNA was determined on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and data were analyzed using CellQuest software. Full-length Bid and tBid were expressed from the pET15b vector in Escherichia coli. Recombinant proteins, containing an amino-terminal tag of six histidines encoded by the pET15b vector, were recovered from bacteria lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% sucrose, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm sodium metabisulfite, with protease inhibitors. Proteins were purified by Q-Sepharose column chromatography, followed by Talon metal affinity resin, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Clontech). Recombinant protein was eluted from this column with 100 mmimidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium metabisulfite and stored at −80 °C. His-tagged full-length Bid and tBid were also made byin vitro transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine. They were produced from the appropriate pET15b vectors with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation for genes cloned downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). After incubation with the appropriate stimuli (100 ng/ml anti-CD95 mAb or 200 ng/ml TRAIL plus enhancer), cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. They were suspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min (44Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Protein content in cytosols was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. For analysis of Cyt c release, 10 μg of cytosolic protein was loaded per lane. For immunodepletion, cytosols were incubated with anti-Bid or a combination of both anti-Bax antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose beads five times for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, which were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% dry milk. Blots were probed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, with anti-Cyt c mAb (1:1000), anti-actin mAb (1:10,000), SC-493 anti-Bax serum (1:250), or anti-Bid serum (1:1000) and as secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig or swine anti-rabbit Ig (1:7500), as appropriate. Immunostained proteins were visualized by ECL. Mouse liver cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in mitochondrion incubation buffer (MIB): 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (45Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Google Scholar). Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in MIB and layered on a gradient, consisting of layers of 10, 18, 30, and 70% Percoll in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 225 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Purified mitochondria were collected at the 30%/70% interface after centrifugation in an SW-41 rotor at 13,500 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The harvested fraction was diluted in MIB, at least 5-fold, and centrifuged at 6,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After two more washes in MIB, mitochondria were suspended to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in Wang buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 100 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 1 mm Na2EGTA, 1 mm dithithreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (30Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria (25 μg/sample) were incubated in the presence or absence of defined protein amounts of cytosol or recombinant proteins in a final volume of 30 μl of Wang buffer B at 30 °C for 1 h or for the time periods indicated and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets, corresponding to 12.5 μg of protein, and the corresponding volume of supernatant fractions were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated by 13% SDS-PAGE gels. Cyt c immunoblotting was performed as described above. Where appropriate, ECL signals were quantified using a Fluorchem 8000 chemoluminescence imager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Jurkat T leukemic cells are a useful model system for apoptosis, since they are sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including CD95 triggering and DNA damage (39Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Google Scholar, 40Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Google Scholar). They are also sensitive to TRAIL, which acts via TRAIL receptor-2 (DR5) in these cells (20Sprick M.R. Weigand M.A. Rauch C.T. Juo P. Blenis J. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 599-609Google Scholar). We have previously characterized CD95-resistant clones selected from the Jurkat cell line. These variant cells displayed cross-resistance to DNA-damaging anti-cancer regimens (i.e.treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide or γ-radiation). We found that resistance was due to a blockade in Cyt crelease (39Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Google Scholar). Here, we show that the variant Jurkat cells are sensitive to TRAIL. In J16 wild-type cells, anti-CD95 mAb 7C11 (Fig.1 A), natural CD95L as induced by stimulation of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex (46Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Google Scholar) (Fig.1B), and recombinant TRAIL (Fig. 1 C) effectively induced apoptosis, as read out by nuclear fragmentation. A representative JA variant clone was resistant to both anti-CD95 mAb and natural CD95L (Fig. 1, A and B). In response to TRAIL, however, JA cells underwent apoptosis at wild-type levels (Fig. 1 C). Both CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis were severely impeded by retrovirus-mediated overexpression of Bcl-2 in J16 cells (Fig.1 D). This indicates that, in these cells, apoptotic execution downstream from either receptor is strongly facilitated by a mitochondrial contribution. Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrion-free cytosols prepared from control and stimulated cells showed that CD95 stimulation could give rise to Cyt c release in wild-type J16 cells but failed to do so in JA cells (Fig. 1 E). TRAIL, however, could induce Cyt c release in variant JA cells as effectively as in wild-type J16 cells. In conclusion, the TRAIL receptor, but not CD95, can activate mitochondria in JA cells, which subsequently allows for apoptotic execution. The finding that TRAIL receptor, but not CD95, could induce Cyt c release in JA cells suggests that these receptors use different signaling components to convey the death signal to mitochondria. To examine this, we first assessed whether FADD and capase-8/-10, which are recruited to both receptor types, were required to induce Cyt c release. J16 cells were retrovirally transduced with vectors encoding either a dominant negative FADD mutant or cFLIPL and tested for Cytc release and apoptosis. In both dnFADD- and cFLIPL-overexpressing cells, CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis were completely blocked (Fig.2, A and B), indicating the effectiveness of these proteins in preventing caspase-8/10 activation. Inhibition of caspase-8, -3, and -7 processing was demonstrated by immunoblotting (data not shown). Fig.2 C shows that Cyt c release was also completely blocked in dnFADD- and cFLIPL-overexpressing cells, whereas it proceeded effectively in J16 cells transduced with empty vector. We conclude that the TRAIL receptor, like CD95, uses FADD and caspase-8/10 to signal to mitochondria. Next, we explored whether Bid is involved in the TRAIL receptor pathway upstream from mitochondria. J16 and JA cells were retrovirally transduced with a Bid cDNA containing point mutations that delete the caspase-8 (D59E) and granzyme B (D75E) cleavage sites (26Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar). Overexpression of this noncleavable Bid mutant inhibited both CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in J16 wild-type cells. The effect of this Bid mutant on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was comparable in J16 and JA cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunoblotting of mitochondrion-free cytosols, derived from CD95- and TRAIL-stimulated J16 cells, showed that the BidD59E/D75E mutant impeded Cyt c release in both cases (Fig. 3 C). In conclusion, like CD95, the TRAIL receptor requires FADD, caspase-8/10, and caspase-cleaved Bid to convey the apoptotic signal to mitochondria. We used an in vitro assay to examine whether lack of Cyt c release in CD95-resistant JA cells was due to an impediment in the cytosol or intrinsic to mitochondria. Cytosols derived from wild-type J16 cells or variant JA cells were activated in vitro with recombinant caspase-8 and incubated with mouse liver mitochondria. Subsequently, mitochondria were assayed for the presence of Cyt c. In case mitochondria were incubated with activated cytosol from wild-type J16 cells, Cytc w"

A portion of the ROS disk membrane was found to be resistant to Triton X-100 extraction at 4 °C. This detergent-resistant fraction was isolated as a low buoyant density band on sucrose density gradients and exhibited an increase in light scattering detected at 600 nm. Biochemical analysis of the Triton X-100-resistant fraction showed it to be enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin relative to phospholipid and in phospholipid relative to protein compared with the soluble fraction. The Triton X-100-resistant membranes described herein did not arise simply from partial solubilization of the ROS disk membranes because detergent-treated low buoyant density fractions isolated from homogenates with octyl glucopyranoside had cholesterol and sphingomyelin content indistinguishable from that of solubilized ROS disk homogenates. Analysis of proteins associated with the Triton X-100-resistant fraction showed it to be enriched in the rim-specific protein ROM-1 and caveolin; surprisingly, the fusion protein peripherin/rds (where rds is retinal degeneration slow), also localized to the disk rim, was entirely absent from the membrane raft domain. The lipid profiles of the Triton X-100-resistant membranes were virtually identical in preparations homogenized in either the light or dark. Slightly more ROM-1 was recovered from samples prepared in the light (23%) than from samples prepared in the dark (13%), but peripherin/rds could not be detected in either preparation. When the Triton X-100-resistant membranes were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextran to deplete membrane cholesterol, the resultant membranes contained slightly lower levels of ROM-1, specifically in the dimeric form. Cholesterol depletion also resulted in the collapse of the large caveolin complex to monomeric caveolae. The results presented herein characterize a pool of ROM-1, a photoreceptor tetraspanin protein, that may play a regulatory role in peripherin/rds-dependent fusion.

These unique post-mitotic cells are made up of a rod inner segment and a rod outer segment (ROS)1 region. The ROS contains a stack of closed membranous sacs, referred to as disks, that contain the photoreceptor rhodopsin and that provide the requisite lipid environment for the initial events of phototransduction. There is a continual turnover of disk membranes and the proteins contained therein. Through coordinated processes of disk renewal at the base of the outer segment and disk shedding at the apical tip, the outer segment region is maintained at a constant length, and the physiologic function of light transduction is maintained (1Young R.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1976; 15: 700-715PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the distribution of the major proteins within disks remains constant during the basal-to-apical transit of disks, a process that requires 10 days in the vertebrate rod cell, the lipid composition of the disks changes during this time. Specifically, the cholesterol content of the disks decreases by >50% as they age (2Boesze-Battaglia K. Hennesey T. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Boesze-Battaglia K. Fliesler S.J. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18867-18870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the content of saturated fatty acid in the phospholipids increases (4Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This same cholesterol heterogeneity is not observed in disk membranes isolated from an animal model of retinal degeneration, the Royal College of Surgeons rats (5Boesze-Battaglia K. Organisciak D. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to the loss of cholesterol from disks as they are apically transported, a tremendous sorting of lipid components occurs at the base of the ROS as new disks are formed from the surrounding ROS plasma membrane. The plasma membrane is found to be high in cholesterol (6Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and squalene (7Flielser S.J. Boesze-Battaglia K. Paw Z. Keller R.K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and relatively enriched (compared with disks) in saturated fatty acids (4Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Conversely, the mature disks are enriched in unsaturated fatty acids species, specifically docosahexanoic acid, 22:6 (6Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The sorting at the base of the ROS is not limited to lipid components, but includes the selective association of the cGMP channel, the GLUT-1 transporter, and the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Refs.8Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar and references therein) with the plasma membrane, while rhodopsin, guanylate cyclase, the ABCR protein, and two photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin proteins (peripherin/rds (where rds is retinal degeneration slow) and ROM-1) sort to the disk membrane (8Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar). The unique protein complex consisting of peripherin/rds and its non-glycosylated homolog, ROM-1 (9Bascom R.A. Manara S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), is localized exclusively to the bulbous ends of the disks, termed the rim region (12Arikawa K. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Williams D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic evidence and mutagenesis studies have shown that peripherin/rds forms disulfide-linked dimers that assemble into homotetramers (13Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The tetramers associate into larger polymers of intermediate size, and polymerization appears to be inhibited by ROM-1 (13Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The peripherin/rds dimers complex noncovalently with ROM-1 homodimers to form heterotetrameric complexes, the precise function of which is unknown. Peripherin/rds participates in the maintenance of normal ROS disk membrane structure and in disk morphogenesis and shedding (Ref. 15Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F.X. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 216: 183-226Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholarand references therein) and acts as a photoreceptor-specific fusion protein (16Boesze-Battaglia K. Kong F. Lamba O.P. Stefano F.P Williams D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 22: 6835-6846Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both peripherin/rds and ROM-1 belong to a growing family of proteins consisting of four transmembrane domains known collectively as tetraspanins (18Claas C. Stipp C. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In various other cell types, tetraspanin proteins serve as molecular adapters in the assembly of protein complexes in membrane microdomains known as rafts (19Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 20Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar). The association between tetraspanin proteins and protein complexes falls into three categories, loosely associated such that, in a Triton X-100-soluble fraction, the complex is retained, or in a Triton X-100-soluble fraction, the complex is not retained. Furthermore, the most tightly associated complexes are Triton X-100-resistant species that are isolated as membrane rafts (18Claas C. Stipp C. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To understand the nature of the noncovalent association between peripherin/rds and ROM-1, we investigated the distribution of these two proteins in ROS disk membrane-specific membrane rafts. The lateral organization of lipids within ROS membranes has been a subject of intense investigation over the past 2 decades (for reviews, see Refs. 21Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 22Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). More recently, the concept of lateral organization of lipids has been refined to include their role as functional domains within membranes with the recognition of separate liquid-ordered phases embedded in the liquid-disordered matrices in the bilayer (19Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar). These more ordered liquid phases, known as rafts, are described as unique assemblies of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and saturated lipids (23Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 24Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). They can be readily isolated in most cells as Triton X-100-resistant species at low temperature. A correlation between lipid organization in the context of a membrane raft, phototransduction, and lipid and protein sorting is in the early stages of characterization. Recent model membrane studies suggest that cholesterol is necessary for the recruitment of polyunsaturated fatty acids by rhodopsin into membrane microdomains (25Polozova A. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2632-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar studies also demonstrated the requirement for specific lipids in the activation process of rhodopsin (26Litman B.J. Niu S.L. Polozova A. Mitchell D.C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 16: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell D.C. Niu S.L. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in transducin binding (29Albert A.D. Young J.E. Paw Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and in phosphodiesterase activation (30Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20727-20730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rafts are involved in a variety of transport, signaling, and differentiation processes. Membrane rafts are characterized by a number of well defined criteria, the most essential of which are their high cholesterol-to-phospholipid content, high sphingomyelin content, low buoyant density, light scattering properties, and unique protein composition (19Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 20Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar, 31Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref Scopus (5152) Google Scholar). Although other investigators have isolated what appear to be low buoyant density Triton X-100-resistant membrane fractions from ROS with unique protein compositions, their analyses did not include all of the criteria to distinguish these as rafts (32Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshima W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The results presented herein provide the first biochemical lipid analysis of ROS-specific membrane rafts and document the selective association of ROM-1 and caveolin with this raft species. To our surprise, membrane rafts isolated from purified ROS disk membranes appear to selectively contain ROM-1, and not peripherin/rds. Methyl-β-cyclodextran and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. Octyl glucopyranoside (OG) and anti-α-transducin antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas were purchased from J. Lawson, Inc. (Lincoln, NE). Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Monoclonal antibodies 2B6 (against peripherin/rds), 1D5 (against ROM-1), and 4D2 (against opsin) were generous gifts from Dr. Robert S. Molday (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Anti-GARP-1 and anti-GARP-2 antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. U. B. Kaupp (Institut für Biologische Informationsverarbeitung, Julich, Germany). Anti-caveolin-1 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. ROS disk membranes were isolated free from ROS plasma membrane vesicles using ricin-agarose and differential sucrose gradient centrifugation essentially as described in detail previously (6Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact ROS membranes were isolated from the 1.11–1.13 g/ml sucrose interface and treated with neuraminidase and ricin-agarose. The ricin-agarose-bound ROS were lysed overnight in ice-cold water. Because we did not treat with trypsin, the peripherin/rds-GARP interaction should not have been disrupted by these conditions (34Poetsch A. Molday L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The disks were separated from plasma membrane bound to ricin-agarose on sucrose density gradients. The ROS plasma membrane composes only 6–8% of the total membrane in the ROS (Ref. 6Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and references therein). Under the isolation conditions as described (6Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) ∼7% of the total membrane is ricin-associated plasma membrane, suggesting minimal (<1%) plasma membrane association with the disks. The isolated ROS disk membranes were pelleted at 17,500 rpm for 25 min and resuspended in MOPS buffer (10 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin) and used immediately. Triton X-100-resistant membrane rafts were prepared from isolated disk membranes essentially as described by Seno et al. (32Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshima W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Disk membranes were suspended in MOPS buffer to a final protein concentration of 8–10 mg/ml. Triton X-100 (2%, w/v) was added to this suspension to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the suspensions were homogenized with three passes of a glass pestle through a glass Tenboeck tissue grinder. Homogenates were prepared in the light or dark. The homogenate was mixed with 1.23 ml of 2.4 msucrose to yield a final sucrose concentration of 0.9 m and transferred to an SW 41 centrifuge tube. The sample was overlaid with sucrose solutions in MOPS buffer at decreasing sucrose concentrations of 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5 m and centrifuged at 46,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C. The fractions were collected and analyzed for cholesterol, phosphate, and protein. In control experiments, an equal volume of disk membranes with identical phosphate and protein content were treated with 2% OG as described previously (35Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Verkade P. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Innis-Whitehouse W. Eastburn K.K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the isolated ROS disk membranes were depleted of cholesterol by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextran for 30 min at 37 °C (36Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Philips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following methyl-β-cyclodextran treatment, the disk membranes were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in MOPS buffer prior to solubilization with Triton X-100. For one study, the isolated low buoyant density rafts were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextran as described above. After cyclodextran treatment, the rafts were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended for cholesterol, phosphate, and protein assays and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described (37Springer H.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeck A.M. Margulis D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 8.3.1-8.3.11Google Scholar). The isolated fractions from the sucrose density gradients were recovered, and 10 μl of the primary antibody (bovine anti-peripherin/rds monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B6 or anti-ROM-1 mAb 1D5) was added to each of the samples and incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation with 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the complexes were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. After heating at 85 °C for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis (17Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or silver-stained (38Merrill C.R. Goldman D. Van Keuran M.L. Electrophoresis. 1982; 3: 17-23Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular masses of the immunoreactive species were calculated using R Fmeasurements of molecular mass markers. Cholesterol was determined as described (39Allain C.C. Poon L.S. Chan C.S.G. Richmond W. Fu P.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7340) Google Scholar). Phosphate was measured as described (40Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified (41Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 13: 2545-2554Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from the low buoyant density fractions as described (42Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to extraction of lipids from the solubilized membrane fractions, they were dialyzed for 48 h against two changes of 10 mm HEPES and 0.5 m NaCl to decrease the detergent concentration. In both cases, 90 ± 1.2% of the total phospholipid was extracted, indicating that the presence of any residual Triton X-100 in the solubilized fractions did not interfere with the lipid extraction. The chloroform extracts were evaporated under N2 and resuspended in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1). The lipids were resolved by sequential one-dimensional TLC on Silica Gel H chromatograms developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2). The plates were developed in the same solvent system three times in sequence as described (43Skipski V.P. Peterson R.F. Barclay M. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The spots were identified by comparison with the migration of known standards (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol) following specific staining using Dragendorff, ninhydrin, and sulfuric acid charring. The spots were scraped, and total phosphate was determined as described above. To identify and characterize ROS disk membrane-specific detergent-resistant membranes, purified disk membranes were homogenized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C in either the dark (designated TD) or light (designated TL) and fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Samples prepared in the dark (TD) had two bands: a low density diffuse white-yellow band at a sucrose density of 20.1 ± 2.2% (designated F1D) and a nearly transparent red-orange band at 26.5 ± 1.4%, similar to the Triton X-100-soluble band described by Senoet al. (32Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshima W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The low buoyant density bands resolved in the sample prepared in the light (TL) appeared to be more diffuse; and on occasion, two bands were detected. The low density band called F1L corresponded to an average percent sucrose of 18.6 ± 1.18%; a Triton X-100-soluble band was detected at 26 ± 2.2% sucrose. To distinguish between Triton X-100-resistant membranes and simply partial solubilization of the ROS disk membranes, disk membranes were homogenized in the nonionic detergent OG (35Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Verkade P. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Innis-Whitehouse W. Eastburn K.K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374PubMed Google Scholar) in either the dark or light (designated OGD and OGL, respectively). In the OGD samples, a very low buoyant density diffuse white-yellow band was present at 19.7 ± 0.76% sucrose. OGL samples showed a similar banding pattern with a fraction isolated at 16.5 ± 3.8%. With both the OGD and OGL samples, diffuse OG-soluble bands were detected at sucrose densities of 27.0 ± 0.76 and 24.5 ± 3.8%, respectively. When the disk membranes were treated with a higher concentration of OG, above the critical micelle concentration of the detergent, these low density bands were not observed, suggesting that the majority of the disk membrane proteins were solubilized completely. The low density fractions isolated from the TD and TL samples (called F1D and F1L, respectively) exhibited peak light scattering at 600 nm (data not shown), and these samples had higher absorbance at 600 nm than the OGD and OGL samples and the solubilized fractions. The increased light scattering was mirrored by a substantial increase in the phospholipid-to-protein content of F1D and F1L. The absorbance at 600 nm was lower in the OGD and OGL samples because the membranes were partially solubilized, thereby scattering less light. The results from the lipid analysis of the various fractions are shown in Table I. The low density Triton X-100-resistant fractions F1D and F1Lcontained from 16 to 19% of the total isolated phospholipid. The cholesterol/phospholipid (mole/mol) ratio in the F1D and F1L samples was more than twice that in the OG-treated samples and in the solubilized fractions. Similarly, the sphingomyelin content of the F1D and F1L samples was greater than that of the OGD and OGL fractions. Sphingomyelin represents <2% of the total phospholipid in ROS membranes (44Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and was no higher in the OGD and OGL samples. In contrast, the F1D and F1L fractions had a 2-fold higher sphingomyelin/phospholipid ratio.Table ILipid profile of detergent-treated membranesSamplesSucrose (w/v)Chol/PL (mol/mol)SPH/PL (mol/mol)Total phosphate%%LightTriton F1L18.6 ± 1.810.24 ± 0.090.11 ± 0.0416.7 ± 2.4Triton-soluble26.0 ± 2.200.105 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.00583 ± 6.8OG F1L16.5 ± 3.800.13 ± 0.020.0079 ± 0.00230 ± 4.6OG-soluble24.5 ± 3.800.101 ± 0.030.029 ± 0.00170 ± 6.2DarkTriton F1D20.3 ± 2.200.24 ± 0.070.10 ± 0.0219 ± 3.4Triton-soluble26.5 ± 1.400.08 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.00689 ± 2.6OG F1D19.7 ± 0.760.12 ± 0.030.009 ± 0.00326 ± 3.8OG-soluble27.0 ± 1.000.09 ± 0.010.031 ± 0.00474 ± 5.9Samples were treated with Triton X-100 or OG in the dark or light as indicated.

The biophysical characteristics of the F1D and F1L fractions from the Triton X-100-treated samples correspond to those described previously for detergent-insoluble membrane raft-like microdomains or detergent-resistant membranes (18Claas C.

The designation of the F1D and F1Lfractions as membrane raft-like microdomains was further substantiated by the observed high cholesterol/phospholipid ratios and the high sphingomyelin/phosphate ratio in these fractions. In contrast, the low density fractions isolated from the OG-treated disks showed cholesterol/phospholipid ratios analogous to that in the soluble fraction and a sphingomyelin/phospholipid ratio consistent with incomplete solubilization of disks. Recently, using two different techniques, Seno et al. (32Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshima W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol.

These investigators failed to provide lipid analysis showing higher cholesterol/phospholipid or sphingomyelin/phospholipid ratios in their low density fractions indicating a raft-like species, thus making it difficult to directly compare the protein components of the ROS membrane rafts. Our results are the first to identify and characterize both the lipid profile and the tetraspanin protein profile of disk membrane rafts. Immunoblot analysis showed that"

In vascular smooth muscle cells, this results in the activation of the type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase and vasorelaxation. In contrast, pressor hormones like arginine-vasopressin, angiotensin II, and endothelin bind serpentine receptors that interact with Gq and activate phospholipase Cβ. The products of this enzyme, diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, activate the conventional and novel forms of protein kinase C (PKC) and elevate intracellular calcium concentrations, respectively. The latter response results in vasoconstriction, which opposes the actions of natriuretic peptides. Previous reports have shown that pressor hormones inhibit natriuretic peptide receptors NPR-A or NPR-B in a variety of different cell types. Although the mechanism for this inhibition remains unknown, it has been universally accepted that PKC is an obligatory component of this pathway primarily because pharmacologic activators of PKC mimic the inhibitory effects of these hormones. Here, we show that in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells, neither chronic PKC down-regulation nor specific PKC inhibitors block the AVP-dependent desensitization of NPR-B even though both processes block PKC-dependent desensitization. In contrast, the cell-permeable calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester), abrogates the AVP-dependent desensitization of NPR-B, and ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, mimics the AVP effect. These data show that the inositol trisphosphate/calcium arm of the phospholipase C pathway mediates the desensitization of a natriuretic peptide receptor in A10 cells. In addition, we report that CNP attenuates AVP-dependent elevations in intracellular calcium concentrations. Together, these data reveal a dominant role for intracellular calcium in the reciprocal regulation of these two important vasoactive signaling systems.

ANP and BNP are stored primarily in the cardiac atria and ventricles, respectively, and are released into the circulation upon an increase in cardiac wall stretch that usually results from increased blood pressure. CNP is found in reasonably high quantities in cytokine-treated vascular endothelial cells (3Suga S. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin.

Instead, it is regulated at the level of transcription by various signaling molecules, such as transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor-α (3Suga S. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Τhe physiological responses elicited by natriuretic peptides are similar but not identical. In general, ANP and BNP counterbalance the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (1Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar, 2Wilkins M.R. Redondo J. Brown L.A. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Acutely, they decrease blood pressure by increasing renal sodium and water excretion, stimulating vascular vasorelaxation, and inhibiting aldosterone and renin secretion. Similarly, CNP has been implicated in a “vascular natriuretic peptide system,” but in this scenario it signals in an autocrine/paracrine manner (3Suga S. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). CNP binding to NPR-B relaxes phenylephrine-contracted rat aortic rings and, unlike ANP, is equally effective at relaxing veins and arteries (13Wei C.M. Aarhus L.L. Miller V.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H71-H73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CNP inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (14Furuya M. Yoshida M. Hayashi Y. Ohnuma N. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and has been shown by many groups to inhibit balloon angioplasty-induced coronary artery restenosis (15Brown J. Chen Q. Hong G.

Metab. 2001; 12: 235-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In mice, transgenic overexpression of BNP results in skeletal overgrowth (8Suda M. Ogawa Y. Tanaka K. Tamura N. Yasoda A. Takigawa T. Uehira M. Nishimoto H. Itoh H. Saito Y. Shiota K. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consistent with these findings, mice lacking NPR-C display increased natriuretic peptide half-lives and skeletal overgrowth (20Matsukawa N. Grzesik W.J. Takahashi N. Pandey K.N. Pang S. Yamauchi M.

Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) exhibit dwarfism. The signaling receptors for natriuretic peptides are cell surface guanylyl cyclases, which catalyze the synthesis of the intracellular messenger cGMP (22Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Schulz S. Waldman S.A. Vitam.

Natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) is activated by both ANP and BNP, whereas the B-type natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-B) is activated by CNP. Both NPR-A and -B are constitutively phosphorylated when expressed in tissue culture cells (25Joubert S. Labrecque J. De Lean A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11096-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and receptor phosphorylation is absolutely essential for hormonal activation (29Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of NPR-A and NPR-B in response to hormone binding has been shown to correlate with the declining activity of these receptors in whole cells (25Joubert S. Labrecque J. De Lean A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11096-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that receptor dephosphorylation mediates the homologous desensitization of these receptors. Consistent with this idea, a mutant version of NPR-A that cannot be dephosphorylated is resistant to ANP-dependent desensitization in whole cells and in membrane preparations (31Bryan P.M. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16041-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The pressor hormones arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and endothelin, which stimulate phospholipase C-β, oppose the actions of natriuretic peptides (33Richards A.M. Heart. 1996; 76: 36-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, from a teleological point of view, it is reasonable that all three pressor peptides decrease natriuretic peptide-dependent cGMP elevations in cultured cell lines (34Nambi P. Whitman M.

Three primary observations have implicated PKC in this inhibitory response. First, all hormones that inhibit natriuretic peptide signaling activate PKC via phospholipase C. Second, direct pharmacologic activation of PKC with phorbol esters mimics the desensitizing effect of the hormones on natriuretic peptide receptors (36Jaiswal R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Yeung V.T., Ho, S.K. Tsang D.S. Nicholls M.G. Cockram C.S. J. Neurosci.

Third, in a few instances relatively specific inhibitors of PKC, like H7, block all or part of the hormone-dependent desensitization (35Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Maeda S. Togawa M. Koya D. Horide N. Kajiwara N. Shigeta Y. Kidney Int. 1991; 40: 188-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Jaiswal R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hence, for more than 15 years it has been generally assumed that PKC is obligatory component in the heterologous desensitization of natriuretic peptide signaling. In this report, we provide evidence for a calcium-dependent desensitization pathway that appears to be distinct from the previously characterized PKC-dependent desensitization pathway. Rat ANP, rat CNP, arginine-vasopressin, GF-109203X, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, BAPTA-AM, ionomycin, and the alumina resin used for cGMP purification were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]GTP (NEG-006H) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The horseradish perioxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody was purchased from AmershamBiosciences. A10 rat aortic smooth muscle cells (CRL-1476) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Inc.) in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 15-cm plates of ∼95% confluent cells were washed and incubated for at least 4 h with serum-replete DMEM. To prepare crude membranes, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 0.5 ml of phosphatase inhibitor buffer (25 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μm microcystin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), sonicated for 1–2 s with a Misonix Sonicator XL2020, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 2 °C. Pellets were resuspended in phosphatase inhibitor buffer at a protein concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Cells plated in 12-well dishes were grown to 90% confluency and incubated at least 4 h in serum-free media. The dishes were then placed on a slide warmer maintained at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES to stabilize the pH at room atmosphere, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, and various hormones or drugs. After a 30-min incubation, the medium was aspirated and replaced with the same medium containing CNP. The cells were then stimulated for 3 min and stopped by aspirating the medium and adding 1 ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol. The ethanol extract was transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g to remove any particulate matter. The supernatant was transferred to borosilicate 12 × 75-mm tubes, and the ethanol was evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac apparatus. The amount of cGMP contained in each sample was estimated by radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Guanylyl cyclase assays were performed in the presence of 25 mm HEPES, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 m1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase (as a nucleotide regenerating system), 1 μm microcystin, 0.1–0.2 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 0.1 or 1 mm GTP. Activator mixtures consisted of 1 mm ATP, 1 μmCNP, and 5 mm MgCl2 or 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm MnCl2. Between 25 and 50 μg of crude membranes were assayed for 3 min at 37 °C by the addition of a mixture containing the above reagents to a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of a mixture containing the substrate and terminated with 500 μl of 110 mm zinc acetate. To purify the cGMP, 0.5 ml of sodium carbonate was added to the mixture, and the sample was vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C. The supernatant was added to chromatography columns (Bio-Rad model 731-1550) containing ∼0.5 g of dry neutral alumina resin (Sigma, A9003) acidified with 5 ml of 1n perchloric acid. The columns were then washed with 10 ml of 1 n perchloric acid followed by 10 ml of water. The purified [α-32P]GTP was then eluted with 5 ml of freshly prepared 200 mm ammonium formate and quantitated using the Cerenkov method in a Beckman 3801 scintillation counter. NPR-B present in crude membranes was fractionated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon P) membrane using a BioRad Trans-Blot semidry transfer cell. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in TBST (20 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.05% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, pH 7.5) containing 3% bovine serum albumin followed by two 5-min washes with TBST. The primary antiserum was diluted 1:2,500 in TBST and incubated with the membrane for 2 h followed by four washes for 5 min with TBST. The specific antisera were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the last 17 or 10 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of NPR-A (antiserum 6326) or NPR-B (antiserum 6328), respectively, which were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. These antisera are specific for each receptor and do not cross-react (see Fig. 1, bottom panel). The membrane was then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST for 45 min. After four washes for 5 min with TBST, the NPR-B antibody complex was visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). A10 cells were plated on 15-mm glass coverslips and grown until they formed a monolayer. The cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 5 μm fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (a ratiometric fluorescent Ca2+ indicator). The coverslip was then washed with HBSS and placed on a 150-μl open slide chamber (RC-25F, Warner Instruments) mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. The chamber was perfused at ∼2.5 ml/min at room temperature with HBSS. In experiments using ionomycin or CNP, the reagents were added directly to the chamber without constant perfusion. fura-2-loaded cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm with a digitally controlled filter wheel (DG-4, Sutter Instrument Co.). The fluorescence emissions at 510 nm were collected with a cooled CCD 12-bit digital camera (Princeton Scientific Instruments). The digital camera output was then analyzed by a digital computer (Universal Imaging). Fluorescent signals were determined from regions of interest and the images corrected for system background, shading errors, and the very low autofluorescence of the unloaded cells. In each experiment, fura-2-loaded cells were exposed to 1 μm 4-bromo-A23187 and 10 mm EGTA to obtain maximum and minimum F340/F380 ratios, respectively. Calcium concentrations were calculated using an in vitro calibration method as previously described (48Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The data were graphed and IC50 values estimated with GraphPad Prism for the MacIntosh. In Fig. 2, the dose-response curve was fit using the equation: Y = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(1 + 10(logEC50−X)). The “Top” is the best-fit highest value, which the program determined to be 4.990. The “Bottom” is the best-fit lowest value, given by 0.5670. With these two values, the logEC50 was estimated at −10.5. One of the primary goals of this study was to examine the heterologous regulation of a natriuretic peptide receptor in a physiological setting. Therefore, we chose rat vascular smooth A10 cells because vascular smooth muscle is a known target for natriuretic peptides (13Wei C.M. Aarhus L.L. Miller V.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. Am. J.

However, because of discrepancies in the literature regarding whether A10 cells express NPR-A (34Nambi P. Whitman M. Gessner G. Aiyar N. Crooke S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8492-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Nambi P. Whitman M. Aiyar N. Stassen F. Crooke S.T. Biochem.

Graihle R. De Lean A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 52Fethiere J. Graihle R. Larose L. Babinski K. Ong H. De Lean A. Mol. Cell.

Life Sci. 1996; 58: 2345-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we first determined the expression profile of natriuretic peptide receptors in these cells. Initially, we examined the sensitivity of whole A10 cells to CNP or ANP by measuring cGMP elevations in response to increasing concentrations of each peptide. Cells treated with CNP responded with dose-dependent increases in intracellular cGMP (Fig. 1,top panel,squares). Statistically significant elevations in cGMP concentrations were first detected at 1 nm CNP, and the maximum dose (1 μm), resulted in a 230-fold increase in cGMP concentrations above basal levels. In contrast, 100 nm concentrations of ANP were required to detect an increase in cGMP levels, and 1 μm ANP only stimulated cGMP concentrations 34-fold above basal levels (Fig. 1,top panel,circles). The ANP-dependent dose response in the A10 cells is similar to that observed in cell lines only expressing NPR-B (54Koller K.J. Lowe D.G. Bennett G.L. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1991; 252: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 55Suga S. Nakao K. Hosoda K. Mukoyama M. Ogawa Y. Shirakami G. Arai H. Saito Y. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it most likely results from ANP cross-activation of NPR-B. In complete agreement with these data, Western blots on membranes prepared from A10 cells or 293 cells stably expressing NPR-A (293-NPR-A) or NPR-B (293-NPR-B) indicated that A10 cells express NPR-B but no detectable NPR-A (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Together, these data indicate that NPR-B is the primary and probably the only natriuretic peptide receptor expressed in A10 cells. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has previously been shown to decrease ANP-dependent cGMP elevations in A10 cells (34Nambi P. Whitman M. Gessner G. Aiyar N. Crooke S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8492-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 50Bellemann P. Neuser D. J. Recept. Res. 1988; 8: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, based on the observation that micromolar concentrations of ANP were not able to saturate the cGMP response in these cells (34Nambi P. Whitman M. Gessner G. Aiyar N. Crooke S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8492-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 50Bellemann P. Neuser D. J. Recept. Res. 1988; 8: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) combined with the expression data shown in Fig. 1, it is likely that previous investigators were actually studying the regulation of NPR-B and not NPR-A as they suggested. This was a reasonable oversight because CNP and NPR-B had not yet been identified at the time their studies were conducted. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that AVP reduced CNP-dependent cGMP elevations in these cells. Incubation of A10 cells with 1 μm AVP for 30 min reduced cGMP concentrations at every CNP dose tested (Fig.2 A). Cells stimulated with the highest concentration of CNP tested (5 μm) produced 12.5 pmol cGMP/well, whereas the same CNP concentration resulted in only 3.0 pmol cGMP/well after treatment with AVP, which equals 24% of the control values. AVP exposure had no effect on basal cGMP concentrations, which suggests that the reduced cGMP concentrations are not mediated through increased cGMP degradation. The ability of AVP to decrease cGMP elevations was also dose-dependent (Fig.2 B). Diminished CNP-dependent cGMP elevations were first apparent at picomolar concentrations of AVP, and the maximum desensitization was reached around 10 nm AVP. The IC50 for the response was estimated to be 0.03 nm AVP. To distinguish between the possibilities that the reduced cGMP concentrations could have resulted from increased phosphodiesterase activity or from decreased guanylyl cyclase activity, we performed guanylyl cyclase assays. Crude membranes prepared from A10 cells treated in the presence (circles) or absence (squares) of 100 nm AVP for 30 min were assayed for CNP-dependent (1 μm CNP, 5"
https://openalex.org/W1966143652,"In the present study we have explored the role of calmodulin (CaM) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the communication process activated after the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the activation of calcium influx via endogenous TRP1 channels from Chinese hamster ovary cells. Experiments using combined rapid confocal calcium and electrophysiology measurements uncovered a consistent delay of around 900 ms between the first detectable calcium released from the ER and the activation of the calcium current. This delay was evident with two different methods used to release calcium from the ER: either the blockade of the microsomal calcium ATPase with thapsigargin or activation of bradykinin receptors linked to the IP3cascade. Direct application of IP3 or a peptide from the NH2-terminal region of the IP3R activated store operated calcium, reducing the delay period. Introduction of CaM into the cell via the patch pipette increased the delay period from 900 ± 100 ms to 10 ± 2.1 s (n = 18). Furthermore, the use of selective CaM antagonists W7 and trifluoperazine maleate resulted in a substantial reduction of the delay period to 200 ± 100 ms with 5 μmtrifluoperazine maleate (n = 16) and 150 ± 50 ms with 500 nm W7 (n = 22). CaM reduced also the current density activated by thapsigargin or brandykinin to about 60% from control. The CaM antagonists did not affect significantly the current density. The results presented here are consistent with an antagonistic effect of IP3R and CaM for the activation of store operated calcium after depletion of the ER. The functional competition between the activating effect of IP3R and the inhibiting effect of CaM may modulate the delay period between the release of calcium from the ER and the activation of calcium influx observed in different cells, as well as the amount of current activated after depletion of the ER. In the present study we have explored the role of calmodulin (CaM) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the communication process activated after the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the activation of calcium influx via endogenous TRP1 channels from Chinese hamster ovary cells.

Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Depletion of the ER appears to be a prerequisite for the activation of calcium influx, because several experimental maneuvers that induce depletion of the ER, such as the introduction of IP3 into the cell or blockade of the microsomal calcium ATPase with thapsigargin (TG) and other selective blockers, are equally effective activators of calcium influx (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). The activation of calcium influx after store depletion has been termed store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and appears to be a well preserved mechanism from insects to humans (2Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The finding that the transient receptor potential protein (TRP) from the Drosophilaphotoreceptor encodes a calcium-permeable channel activated after depletion of intracellular calcium stores, provided the first evidence for the identification of the molecular entity responsible for SOCE (3Vaca L. Sinkins W.G., Hu, Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intense search in mammalian tissues led to the isolation of several mammalian TRP homologues, some of which are activated after depletion of the ER (4Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The diverse TRP superfamily of channels has been divided in three subfamilies (TRPC, TRPV, and TRPM) based on structural motifs (5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Members from the TRP superfamily are found in a wide range of organisms, from yeast to humans (6Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). One of the most prominent features in this superfamily is the wealth of regulatory mechanisms responsible for channel activation, including changes in osmolarity (TRPV4), ligands such as vanilloid (TRPV1), cold and menthol (TRPM8), store depletion and diacylglycerol (TRPC subfamily) (for review see Ref.6Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Although the search for new TRPC homologues in a wide variety of organisms has proven very fruitful, the identification of the mechanism communicating the depleted state of the ER to the plasmalemmal channel remains elusive. Several models have been proposed to explain the communication between the ER and store operated channels (SOC), which can be divided into two main classes: one involving a physical coupling between the ER and the plasmalemmal channel and another suggesting the presence of a diffusible messenger responsible for communicating the depleted state of the ER to the plasma membrane (7Putney Jr., J.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recent evidence favoring the physical coupling model shows direct and functional interactions between the IP3 receptor (IP3R) and human TRP3 channel (8Birnbaumer L. Boulay G. Brown D. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Mikoshiba K. Zhu X. Qin N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 127-161PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a common binding site for calmodulin (CaM) and IP3R has been identified at the carboxyl termini of TRP channels (9Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have previously shown that the carboxyl-terminal domain of theDrosophila TRP channel confers the thapsigargin sensitivity to TRPL, a channel that is not originally activated after depletion of the ER (10Sinkins W.G. Vaca L., Hu, Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2955-2960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have shown also that CaM inhibits SOCE in vascular endothelium (11Vaca L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The modulation of channel activity by CaM appears to be a common feature found in several TRP members. In the Drosophilaphotoreceptor, CaM mediates termination of the light response in vivo via modulation of TRP and TRPL channels (12Scott K. Sun Y. Beckingham K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 375-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CaT1, a TRP member recently identified, is modulated by a competitive interaction between CaM and protein kinase C (13Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A CaM binding site has been identified in human TRP1 and TRP3 and mouse TRP4–TRP7 (9Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized the role of CaM and IP3R in the communication between the ER and endogenous TRP1 channels from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using rapid confocal microscopy and electrophysiology. The results presented here show: 1) a consistent delay of several hundreds of milliseconds between the first detectable release of calcium from the ER and the activation of TRP1 channels; 2) CaM antagonists significantly reduced the delay period; 3) introduction of CaM into the cell via the patch pipette significantly increased the delay period; 4) single channel measurements revealed a competitive interaction between CaM and IP3 in the modulation of TRP1 single channel activity; 5) a peptide from the IP3R restored channel activity in excised inside-out patches; and 6) introduction of dsRNA from a segment of the TRP1 sequence resulted in very potent and specific reduction of TRP1 protein and SOCE. All of these results show that a competitive interaction between CaM and IP3R is sufficient to explain the activation of TRP1 channels and SOCE, after depletion of the ER in CHO cells. Our results show also that CaM has a dominant effect on TRP1 channel activity, which may play a role in preventing calcium influx under resting conditions. All salts used were analytical grade purchased from Sigma. The PBS solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, HEPES, and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The NMDG-Cl solution contained (mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The solution NA contained (mm): 140 Na-aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, with NaOH. In all whole cell experiments, the pipette (NA) solution contained in addition 2 mm ATP and 1 mm GTP from Sigma. Where indicated, the calcium in PBS and NA solutions was adjusted to either 1 or 100 nm with EGTA as previously described (14Martinez-Francois J.R. Morales-Tlalpan V. Vaca L. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bovine brain calmodulin, the S-100 calcium-binding protein from bovine brain, and the calmodulin antagonists W7 and trifluoperazine dimaleate (TFP) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). CHO cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in culture using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% antibiotics, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% bovine fetal serum (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were grown on plastic Petri dishes and maintained with 5% CO2 in a humidity controlled incubator (NUAIRE, Plymouth, MN). Degenerated oligonucleotide primers from TRP-conserved regions were 5′-TGGGGCC(ATC)(TC)TGCAGAT(AC)TC(AT)CTGGGA-3′ and 5′-TG(CT)AG(AC)(TG)CGTTT(CA)AAGGT(GA)AG-3′ synthesized by Life Technologies (Karlsruhe, Germany). The first primer was designed according to Okada et al. (15Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar); the second primer was designed based on the highly TRP conserved amino acid sequence EWKFAR. mRNA from CHO cultures was isolated following standard procedures and cDNA was synthesize in vitro. A PCR was performed for 19 cycles and the products were analyzed in a polyacrylamide gel. Over five independent PCR reactions from different cultures produced similar results, a single product of 450 bp. The PCR product was cloned in the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After sequencing the fragment, the nucleotide sequence was introduced in the FASTA program (National Center for Biotechnology Information) to identify homologues. The search indicated that the cloned sequence was over 93.7% identical to rat TRP1 (accession number AF061266). The partial clone from CHO-TRP1 has been submitted to GenBankTM (accession numberAF448492). The full-length cDNA encoding the human bradykinin type 2 receptor (Bk2R) was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) using standard ligation techniques. 50% confluent CHO cells were transfected with 5 μm of the construct mixed with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies). Transfected CHO cells were maintained in G418 (Life Technologies) for 1 month, and antibiotic-resistant clones were isolated. The G418-resistant cells were maintained in culture and used in the studies described. The entire 450-bp TRP1 DNA fragment isolated by PCR was cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and linearized with BamHI to produce single stranded RNA using the MEGAscript kit (AMBION, Austin, TX) with the T3 polymerase. In a separate experiment the vector with insert was linearized with EcoRV to produce the complementary RNA strand with the T7 polymerase. Equal amounts of both single stranded RNA products were mixed and heated at 60 °C and cooled down slowly for 30 min until room temperature was reached. The product obtained was compared by nondenaturating electrophoresis with both single stranded RNA products to confirm the formation of the double stranded RNA (dsRNA). 5 μg of dsRNA were mixed with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies) and the mixture was placed on 60-mm Petri dishes containing 50% confluent CHO cells. 48 and 72 h later the same cells were transfected again with 5 μg of dsRNA each time. Calcium measurements were performed 24–48 h after the third transfection. Control cells were exposed to LipofectAMINE alone using the same protocol. For Bk2R RNAi experiments a fragment from nucleotides 420 to 762 was isolated by PCR and cloned in pBluescript. The dsRNA was prepared as described above for TRP1. CHO cells were transfected three times with the dsRNA using a similar procedure to the one described above. Total membrane extracts from control cells and RNAi-treated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper as previously reported (16Reyes-Cruz G. Vazquez-Prado J. Muller-Esterl W. Vaca L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 658-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To ensure equal amounts of protein loading, the amount of total protein was assessed using the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and albumin as control. 10 μg of protein was loaded for every experimental condition. Antibody anti-TRPC1 (ALAMONE Labs. number ACC-010) was diluted 1:1000 in buffer A containing (in mm): 50 Tris, 150 NaCl, pH 7.4, and 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the nitrocellulose sheets were washed 5 times for 15 min each time with buffer A and incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-labeled mouse anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:5000 (Sigma). After a second washing period, bound antibody was visualized with the Supersignal Ultra chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The human type 2 bradykinin receptor was detected with antibody AS 346-2 (a generous gift from Dr. Müller-Esterl, Johannes Gutenberg University at Mainz) as previously described (16Reyes-Cruz G. Vazquez-Prado J. Muller-Esterl W. Vaca L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 658-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The free calcium reported in the different solutions was adjusted by the addition of EGTA purchased from Sigma. To determine the amount of EGTA needed to obtain the free calcium for each experimental condition, we used the program “Bound and Determined” (BAD 4.35) as previously described (14Martinez-Francois J.R. Morales-Tlalpan V. Vaca L. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Free calcium concentrations reported in the text were corroborated using FURA-2 tetrapotassium salt (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) and an Aminco-Bowman Series II spectrophotometer. The peptide IP3R-P1 (EYLSIEYSEEEVWLTWTD) was purchased from ResGen (Carlsbad, CA). This peptide has been previously reported to bind several TRP channels and compete with CaM for a common binding site (9Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The scrambled peptide IP3R-P2 (TWLSTDEVELYIEWEYSE) was used as control. This peptide contains the same amino acids as IP3R-P1 but in random order. Peptides were introduced into the cell via the patch pipette or perfused on isolated patches (single channel experiments) via a Picospritzer II (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ). Free calcium in CHO cells was monitored as previously described (16Reyes-Cruz G. Vazquez-Prado J. Muller-Esterl W. Vaca L. J. Cell.

Briefly, cells were incubated in physiological solution containing (mm): 120 NaCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 Mg2SO4, 4.75 KCl, 10 glucose, 20 HEPES, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 5 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes). Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature (22 °C), cells were washed twice with physiological solution and treated for 2 min with 0.25% trypsin. Cells were later dispersed with a plastic pipette and subjected to centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence was measured using an Aminco-Bowman Series II spectrophotometer. Excitation wavelength alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence intensity was monitored at an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Calibration of the fura-2 associated with the cells was accomplished using Triton lysis in the presence of a saturating concentration of calcium followed by addition of EGTA (pH 8.5). Free calcium was calculated as previously described (16Reyes-Cruz G. Vazquez-Prado J. Muller-Esterl W. Vaca L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 658-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CHO cells were loaded with 5 μmFluo-4-AM using the loading procedure described above for FURA-2-AM. Cells were placed on glass coverslips and allowed to attach to the glass surface. Combined patch clamp and confocal microscopy measurements were performed using an EPC9 amplifier (Heka Instruments, Bonn, Germany) and a real-time confocal system (Noran Instruments, Oxon, England). The EPC9 amplifier was synchronized with the confocal acquisition unit via a TTL pulse. The microscope objective used was Nikon 60X Plan-Apo 1.40 oil immersed. The confocal acquisition window was set to 300 × 300 pixels to improve acquisition speed. At this resolution the system acquired one image every 10 ms. Five images were averaged and the result was saved, producing one averaged image every 50 ms. All images were stored on the hard disk of an Indigo2 (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA) for off-line analysis. CHO cells showed diameters in the range of 15–20 μm, the focal point was moved to approximately the middle of the cell, using a focal resolution of 10 μm. Conventional whole cell experiments and perforated patch mode were performed on Fluo-4-AM-loaded CHO cells. The voltage protocol consisted of a ramp from −100 to +100 mV delivered continuously every 50 ms for the duration of the experiment. Patch pipette resistance ranged from 6 to 10 MΩ when filled with the NA solution. Cell capacitance was 10–12 pF. To compare among different cells, the amount of current from each cell was corrected by the cell capacitance and reported throughout the text as pA/pF. TG and Bk were applied to the cell via a Picospritzer II (General Valve). Drug applications were synchronized with electrophysiology and confocal acquisition via a TTL pulse delivered by a DG535 Digital Delay/Pulse Generator (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA). Whole cell data was recorded and stored on a PC computer hard disk for off-line analysis using Igor Pro 4 software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Fluorescence intensity was measured with procedures written in-house with Igor Pro. For cell-attached and inside-out experiments, the pipette contained the PBS solution with the calcium reported in each condition, as indicated in the figure legends. Data was stored on FM tape (VETTER PCM recorder) for off-line analysis. Single channel recordings were digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and filtered at 5 kHz during analysis using pClamp software (Axon Instruments). An in-house designed multibarreled microperfusion system was used to apply the different concentrations of CaM and IP3. Fluo-4-loaded single CHO cells stably transfected with the human Bk2R responded to Bk with elevation of intracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner, showing a maximum response to 75 nm Bk (data not shown). Over 90% of the cells studied showed this response. These results are consistent with the affinity of this receptor for Bk measured in different expression systems (16Reyes-Cruz G. Vazquez-Prado J. Muller-Esterl W. Vaca L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 658-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nontransfected CHO cells did not respond to Bk at the concentrations tested in this study (up to 1 μm). Combined whole cell patch clamp and rapid confocal intracellular calcium measurements with Fluo-4-loaded single CHO cells uncovered a consistent delay between the first detectable increment of intracellular calcium and the activation of calcium influx current. Approximately 85% of the cells studied (43 of 50) responded to a saturating Bk concentration (100 nm) with a rapid elevation in intracellular calcium observed within the first 50 ms after Bk application, followed 900 ± 100 ms later by an increment in inward current (Fig. 1). In these experiments the extracellular solution was PBS and the intracellular solution was the NA solution with 100 nm free calcium (“Materials and Methods”). Under these conditions the inward current activated by Bk showed a reversal potential of +45 ± 5 mV (n = 40), only a current carried primarily by calcium ions would show such a positive reversal potential given the solutions used. Replacing the bath solution for the NMDG-Cl solution with 2 mm calcium (“Materials and Methods”) did not result in a significant change of the reversal potential (+48 ± 4 mV,n = 17), further supporting the calcium selectivity of the Bk-activated inward current. The delay between the first detectable increment of intracellular calcium and the activation of calcium influx current was slightly longer in cells studied in the perforated patch mode using nystatin in the patch pipette (800 ± 50 ms, n = 35). The differences between the whole cell and the perforated patch mode were not statistically significant, probably because of the fact that whole cell experiments were completed within the first minute after disrupting the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, the dilution of intracellular components was not favorable. The initial fluorescence increment (IFI) obtained after Bk stimulation was localized to well defined spots in the cells (Fig. 1). Because no inward current was measured in this initial time periods, the IFI most likely reflects the release of calcium from intracellular storage compartments (ER). By the time the inward current was activated, the elevation in fluorescence intensity was observed throughout the cytosol, part of which most likely reflects the influx of calcium from the extracellular space. Fig.2 A illustrates representative experiments using combined rapid confocal microscopy and whole cell current measurements. Under control conditions, after Bk stimulation, a typical delay of 900 ± 100 ms between IFI and activation of inward current was observed. Introduction of two CaM selective antagonists, W7 and TFP, in the patch pipette significantly reduced the delay period between IFI and inward current activation, when compared with control experiments (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, the delay period observed was 200 ± 100 ms with 5 μm TFP (n = 16) and 150 ± 50 ms with 500 nmW7 (n = 22). This reduction represents ¼ of the control value. Increasing TFP to 20 μm or W7 to 5 μm did not result in further reductions of the delay period (data not shown) therefore, the remaining studies were carried out with these CaM antagonists concentrations. Introduction of CaM in the patch pipette resulted in a significant increment of the delay period between IFI and the activation of inward current. In experiments where 10 μm CaM was introduced in the patch pipette, the delay period increased to 10 ± 2.1 s, a value around 10 times greater than control (n = 18, Fig. 2 B). The CaM effects were observed with 100 nm free intracellular calcium (in the patch pipette) adjusted with EGTA (“Materials and Methods”). Buffering calcium in the patch pipette to 1 nm prevented the effects of CaM on the delay period between IFI and activation of inward current (data not shown). With 1 nm free intracellular calcium the delay period observed in the presence of 10 μm CaM was 950 ± 150 ms (n = 7), a value not significantly different from control (p > 0.1). These results suggest that the CaM-calcium complex modulates the delay period between the initial release of calcium from the ER and the activation of SOC. CaM blockade reduces significantly the delay period, and SOCE initiates faster. CaM and the CaM antagonists affected also the time to reach the maximum current. In control conditions, the whole cell current density reached its peak with a time constant of 15 ± 4.1 s, to a value of 6.12 ± 0.13 pA/pF at −100 mV (n = 25, Fig.2 C). With 10 μm CaM in the pipette, the maximum current density was reached with a time constant of 25 ± 5.2 s to a value of 3.65 ± 0.34 pA/pF (n = 18, Fig. 2 C). The CaM antagonists reduced the time to reach the maximum current density to 6.2 ± 1.8 s with TFP (n = 16, Fig. 2 C) and 6.8 ± 1.5 s with W7 (n = 22, Fig. 2 C). The maximum current density obtained with CaM was about 60% from control (Fig.2 B). Both CaM antagonists did not alter significantly the maximum current density compared with control (6.16 ± 0.43 and 6.12 ± 0.32 pA/pF for W7 and TFP, respectively, Fig.2 B). These results resemble the effects of CaM on the TG-induced calcium influx current from vascular endothelial cells (11Vaca L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects observed with CaM were the result of calcium buffering by this calcium-binding protein, we performed similar experiments to those indicated above but replaced CaM with 20 μm S-100 protein from bovine brain, a calcium-binding protein with some structural similarity to CaM. With 20 μm S-100 in the patch pipette, the delay period between IFI and activation of inward current was 850 ± 120 ms (n = 8), a value not significantly different from the value obtained in the absence of S-100 (910 ± 140 ms,n = 6). These results strongly suggest that the effects observed with CaM are not the result of buffering the calcium in the cell. Because any maneuver that alters the rate of release of calcium from the ER may affect also the time of activation of SOC (17Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we designed experiments to explore the effect of incubating cells with W7 and TFP on the rate of calcium release from the ER. To explore this we took two avenues: first we explored the increments in intracellular calcium in CHO cells incubated for 5 min with the CaM antagonist and compared the time course of calcium increments with control cells (not exposed to CaM antagonists). To ensure that the CaM antagonists were permeating adequately into the cells, we performed additional experiments in which the CaM antagonists were introduced in the cell via the patch pipette, as we have done in previous experiments. With both experimental procedures the extracellular (PBS) solution contained less than 1 nm free calcium, to minimize the effects of calcium influx. Under these experimental conditions, fluorescence increments would reflect primarily the release of calcium from the ER. Fig. 3 A illustrates representative experiments of the increment in single cell fluorescence after application of 100 nm Bk"

T. pallidum has remained exquisitely sensitive to penicillin, but the mode of action and lethal targets for β-lactams are still unknown. We previously identified the T. pallidum 47-kDa lipoprotein (Tp47) as a penicillin-binding protein (PBP). Tp47 contains three hypothetical consensus motifs (SVTK, TEN, and KTG) that typically form the active center of other PBPs. Yet, in this study, mutations of key amino acids within these motifs failed to abolish the penicillin binding activity of Tp47.

It comprises four distinct domains: two complex β-sheet-containing N-terminal domains and two C-terminal domains that adopt immunoglobulin-like folds. The three hypothetical PBP signature motifs do not come together to form a typical PBP active site. Furthermore, Tp47 is unusual in that it displays β-lactamase activity (k cat for penicillin = 271 ± 6 s−1), a feature that hindered attempts to identify the active site in Tp47 by co-crystallization and mass spectrometric techniques.

Consequently, despite decades of intensive efforts, many features of T. pallidumultrastructure, physiology, and membrane biology remain obscure (1Radolf J.D. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2066991166,"A highly selective, high affinity recombinant anti-testosterone Fab fragment has been generated by stepwise optimization of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) by random mutagenesis and phage display selection of a monoclonal antibody (3-C4F5). The best mutant (77 Fab) was obtained by evaluating the additivity effects of different independently selected CDR mutations. The 77 Fab contains 20 mutations and has about 40-fold increased affinity (K d = 3 × 10−10m) when compared with the wild-type (3-C4F5) Fab. To obtain structural insight into factors, which are needed to improve binding properties, we have determined the crystal structures of the mutant 77 Fab fragment with (2.15 Å) and without testosterone (2.10 Å) and compared these with previously determined wild-type structures. The overall testosterone binding of the 77 Fab is similar to that of the wild-type. The improved affinity and specificity of the 77 Fab fragment are due to more comprehensive packing of the testosterone with the protein, which is the result of small structural changes within the variable domains. Only one important binding site residue Glu-95 of the heavy chain CDR3 is mutated to alanine in the 77 Fab fragment. This mutation, originally selected from the phage library based on improved specificity, provides more free space for the testosterone D-ring. The light chain CDR1 of 77 Fab containing eight mutations has the most significant effect on the improved affinity, although it has no direct contact with the testosterone. The mutations of CDR-L1 cause a rearrangement in its conformation, leading to an overall fine reshaping of the binding site. A highly selective, high affinity recombinant anti-testosterone Fab fragment has been generated by stepwise optimization of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) by random mutagenesis and phage display selection of a monoclonal antibody (3-C4F5). The best mutant (77 Fab) was obtained by evaluating the additivity effects of different independently selected CDR mutations. The 77 Fab contains 20 mutations and has about 40-fold increased affinity (K d = 3 × 10−10m) when compared with the wild-type (3-C4F5) Fab. To obtain structural insight into factors, which are needed to improve binding properties, we have determined the crystal structures of the mutant 77 Fab fragment with (2.15 Å) and without testosterone (2.10 Å) and compared these with previously determined wild-type structures. The overall testosterone binding of the 77 Fab is similar to that of the wild-type. The improved affinity and specificity of the 77 Fab fragment are due to more comprehensive packing of the testosterone with the protein, which is the result of small structural changes within the variable domains. Only one important binding site residue Glu-95 of the heavy chain CDR3 is mutated to alanine in the 77 Fab fragment. This mutation, originally selected from the phage library based on improved specificity, provides more free space for the testosterone D-ring. The light chain CDR1 of 77 Fab containing eight mutations has the most significant effect on the improved affinity, although it has no direct contact with the testosterone. The mutations of CDR-L1 cause a rearrangement in its conformation, leading to an overall fine reshaping of the binding site. Steroid hormones have remained a great challenge for immunodiagnostics. They are small, rigid, hydrophobic molecules with only a few functional groups capable of specific interactions with antibodies. The number of different closely related steroids in human serum is high, their in vivo concentrations are low (down to a picomolar level), and their relative concentrations can vary greatly, even between normal healthy individuals. Furthermore, steroids are poorly immunogenic in mice and rats; two species from which monoclonal antibodies are usually generated, making it extremely difficult to produce high affinity and specificity anti-steroid monoclonal antibodies. In most diagnostic immunoassays of steroid hormones, rabbit polyclonal antibodies are used, despite the many drawbacks associated with the use of antisera. The supply of good polyclonal antibody reagents of uniform quality is a severe problem for the immunodiagnostic industry and requires continuous immunization of many laboratory animals.Antibody engineering provides excellent tools to tailor the properties of antibodies with respect to affinity, specificity, and performance for different applications. An in vitro process of antigen-driven selection, based on the display of antibody fragments on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage, has been shown to be a powerful method for the selection of specific or improved binders from a heterogeneous mixture of antibody fragments (1Winter G.

The mutant Fab fragment (A60/HCDR1/LCDR2), which has both a >10-fold improvement in the relative affinity and a significantly lower cross-reactivity to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), worked in a competitive one-step immunoassay within a wide testosterone concentration range of patient serum specimens (8Hemminki A.

However, low testosterone concentrations found in female samples (<2 nmol/liter) deviated from values obtained by the reference immunoassay or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, most probably due to too high a cross-reaction with DHEAS. Here we have further refined the binding site of the mutant Fab fragment (A60/HCDR1/LCDR2) by retargeting the CDR3 regions of the heavy and light chain to mutagenesis. The individually cloned CDR3 phage libraries were selected in relation to specificity and affinity.

The crystal structure of 77 Fab in complex with testosterone reveals that during the stepwise refinement, mutations on the CDR regions that are not in direct contact with the hapten can have an important influence on the improved binding. In the 77 Fab, the increased adaptability of the L1 loop and the binding site mutation E95A of the heavy chain CDR3 facilitate more compact packing of the testosterone to the protein.

https://openalex.org/W1979605107,"Genes encoding polyadenylated mRNAs depend on their poly(A) signals for termination of transcription. Typically, transcription downstream of the poly(A) signal gradually declines to zero, but often there is a transient increase in polymerase density immediately preceding the decline. Special elements called pause sites are traditionally invoked to account for this increase. Using run-on transcription from the nuclei of transfected cells, we show that both the pause and the gradual decline that follow a poly(A) site are generated entirely by the poly(A) signal itself in a series of model constructs. We found no other elements to be involved and argue that the elements called pause sites do not function through pausing. Both the poly(A)-dependent pause and the subsequent decline occurred earlier for a stronger poly(A) signal than for a weaker one. Because the gradual decline resembles the abortive elongation that occurs downstream of many promoters, one model has proposed that the poly(A) signal flips the polymerase from the elongation mode to the abortive mode like a binary switch. We compared abortive elongators with poly(A) terminators and found a 4-fold difference in processivity. We conclude that poly(A) terminating polymerases do not merely revert to their prior state of low processivity but rather convert to a new termination-prone condition.

On the one hand are polymerases, newly dispatched from the promoter, which have failed to acquire the modifications necessary to become adequately processive (1Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). These polymerases tend to dissociate from the DNA within a few hundred base pairs of the promoter and are sensitive to the presence of simple termination elements in the DNA (2Roberts S. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4622-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The presence of any such element near the promoter thus serves to terminate these polymerases of low processivity (2Roberts S. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some fraction of the polymerases leaving the promoter of any actively expressed gene do become appropriately modified and go on to transcribe the entire gene in a highly processive manner. For most genes, namely those whose RNAs are destined to become cleaved and polyadenylated, the poly(A) signal is a required element for the termination of this processive transcription (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 7Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Such termination is referred to as poly(A)-dependent termination. Both in vivo andin vitro, the poly(A) signal alone is sufficient for signaling the polymerase to stop processive transcription (8Yeung G. Choi L.M. Chao L.C. Park N.J. Liu D. Jamil A. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Both the establishment and disestablishment of processive transcription by RNA polymerase II appear to be intricate processes. Transcription complexes leaving the promoter are not initially of sufficient processivity to enter into productive transcription (1Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In part, this reflects underphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (5Kim Y.K. Bourgeois C.F. Isel C. Churcher M.J. Karn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4622-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, shortly after leaving the promoter (10Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), elongation complexes acquire the negative transcription elongation factors DRB1 sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF), which induce the polymerase to pause. Relief of pausing and the establishment of processivity is brought about by the action of P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b), which phosphorylates both DSIF and the C-terminal domain (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency with which processivity is established varies with the promoter and the physiological context (3Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Meulia T. Krumm A. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Spencer C.A. Kilvert M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1296-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The promoter-proximal termination of those polymerases on which high processivity has not been conferred has been called abortive elongation (15Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Productive elongation is brought to an end by poly(A)- dependent termination (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). At the heart of this mechanism is the problem of how the poly(A) signal communicates with the polymerase to direct it to terminate. For many years the favored model was that cleavage at the poly(A) site released a signal telling the polymerase to terminate (7Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Connelly S. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Yonaha M.

A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, now it is clear that poly(A) signaling can occur in the absence of poly(A) site processing both in vivo (19Osheim Y.N. Proudfoot N.J. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in vitro (9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signal to stop transcription is delivered at some point during the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation apparatus before processing itself takes place.Termination does not occur at the position of the poly(A) signal on the DNA but at a variable distance downstream. Often, polymerase density decreases gradually downstream of the poly(A) site, as assessed by run-on transcription (20Affolter M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. J. Biol.

In many instances this decrease in polymerase density is preceded by a region in which the polymerase density is higher than it is over the body of the gene (25Vandenbergh D.J. James-Pederson M.

This has generally been interpreted to indicate the presence of polymerase pausing in the region, but the basis for this pausing is not understood.Just as the mechanism of poly(A) signaling is not clear, neither is the mechanism of the release step that follows. It has been proposed that regardless of the mechanism of poly(A) signaling, its effect is to flip a binary switch that returns the polymerase to its prior state of low processivity (18Logan J. Falck-Pedersen E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This idea is consistent with the observation that termination downstream of a poly(A) site, like abortive elongation, often occurs gradually (20Affolter M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. J. Biol.

However, this idea has never been tested.Because poly(A)-dependent termination is, by its nature, a gradual process, a variety of auxiliary elements downstream of the poly(A) site often are also pressed into service to assist in termination (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). For example, some promoter elements are designed to repulse encroaching polymerases that have crossed an upstream poly(A) site but have not yet terminated and might otherwise lead to transcription interference (34Valerius O. Brendel C. Duvel K. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21440-21445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl.

The latter elements have been called pause sites because it was thought necessary first to pause the polymerase to give the poly(A) signal time to act (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 7Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3770-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Because of the complexities attending the wide variety of auxiliary elements involved, we have chosen to focus on the core poly(A) signal alone to gain a better understanding of the basal mechanism of poly(A)-dependent termination. Previously, we have shown that the core poly(A) signal by itself can direct efficient terminationin vivo, a form of poly(A)-dependent termination that we have referred to as being poly(A)-driven (8Yeung G. Choi L.M. Chao L.C. Park N.J. Liu D. Jamil A. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have also shown in vitro that this signaling from the poly(A) signal to the polymerase does not depend on cleavage at the poly(A) site (9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we test the idea that poly(A) signaling operates a binary switching mechanism that converts polymerases to the same low processivity characteristic of polymerases near the promoter. We find that polymerases in the process of terminating downstream of a poly(A) site are several times more processive than abortively elongating polymerases proximal to a promoter. This shows that the poly(A) signal does not simply trigger a reversion of the polymerase to a prior state but rather that it orchestrates a transition to a new set of activities. We identify one of these activities as pausing. The core poly(A) signal directs all polymerases to pause downstream of the poly(A) signal in a way that does not depend on the underlying DNA sequence. Thus, pausing downstream of the poly(A) signal reflects an intrinsic property of poly(A) signaling that does not depend on the presence of any special pause sites. Transcription termination by RNA polymerase II is predominantly of two sorts, both poorly understood. On the one hand are polymerases, newly dispatched from the promoter, which have failed to acquire the modifications necessary to become adequately processive (1Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). These polymerases tend to dissociate from the DNA within a few hundred base pairs of the promoter and are sensitive to the presence of simple termination elements in the DNA (2Roberts S. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4622-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The presence of any such element near the promoter thus serves to terminate these polymerases of low processivity (2Roberts S. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some fraction of the polymerases leaving the promoter of any actively expressed gene do become appropriately modified and go on to transcribe the entire gene in a highly processive manner. For most genes, namely those whose RNAs are destined to become cleaved and polyadenylated, the poly(A) signal is a required element for the termination of this processive transcription (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 7Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Such termination is referred to as poly(A)-dependent termination. Both in vivo andin vitro, the poly(A) signal alone is sufficient for signaling the polymerase to stop processive transcription (8Yeung G. Choi L.M. Chao L.C. Park N.J. Liu D. Jamil A. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both the establishment and disestablishment of processive transcription by RNA polymerase II appear to be intricate processes. Transcription complexes leaving the promoter are not initially of sufficient processivity to enter into productive transcription (1Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In part, this reflects underphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (5Kim Y.K. Bourgeois C.F. Isel C. Churcher M.J. Karn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4622-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, shortly after leaving the promoter (10Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), elongation complexes acquire the negative transcription elongation factors DRB1 sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF), which induce the polymerase to pause. Relief of pausing and the establishment of processivity is brought about by the action of P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b), which phosphorylates both DSIF and the C-terminal domain (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency with which processivity is established varies with the promoter and the physiological context (3Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Meulia T. Krumm A. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Spencer C.A. Kilvert M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1296-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The promoter-proximal termination of those polymerases on which high processivity has not been conferred has been called abortive elongation (15Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Productive elongation is brought to an end by poly(A)- dependent termination (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). At the heart of this mechanism is the problem of how the poly(A) signal communicates with the polymerase to direct it to terminate. For many years the favored model was that cleavage at the poly(A) site released a signal telling the polymerase to terminate (7Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Connelly S. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Yonaha M.

A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, now it is clear that poly(A) signaling can occur in the absence of poly(A) site processing both in vivo (19Osheim Y.N. Proudfoot N.J. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in vitro (9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signal to stop transcription is delivered at some point during the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation apparatus before processing itself takes place. Termination does not occur at the position of the poly(A) signal on the DNA but at a variable distance downstream. Often, polymerase density decreases gradually downstream of the poly(A) site, as assessed by run-on transcription (20Affolter M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11496-11502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Giardina C. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23806-23811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hagenbüchle O.

In many instances this decrease in polymerase density is preceded by a region in which the polymerase density is higher than it is over the body of the gene (25Vandenbergh D.J. James-Pederson M.

This has generally been interpreted to indicate the presence of polymerase pausing in the region, but the basis for this pausing is not understood. Just as the mechanism of poly(A) signaling is not clear, neither is the mechanism of the release step that follows. It has been proposed that regardless of the mechanism of poly(A) signaling, its effect is to flip a binary switch that returns the polymerase to its prior state of low processivity (18Logan J. Falck-Pedersen E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This idea is consistent with the observation that termination downstream of a poly(A) site, like abortive elongation, often occurs gradually (20Affolter M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11496-11502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Giardina C. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23806-23811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hagenbüchle O.

However, this idea has never been tested. Because poly(A)-dependent termination is, by its nature, a gradual process, a variety of auxiliary elements downstream of the poly(A) site often are also pressed into service to assist in termination (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). For example, some promoter elements are designed to repulse encroaching polymerases that have crossed an upstream poly(A) site but have not yet terminated and might otherwise lead to transcription interference (34Valerius O. Brendel C. Duvel K. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21440-21445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl.

Other elements assist in termination in conjunction with a transcript cleavage activity of unknown function (37Dye M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 669-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Still other elements assist in termination while exhibiting a polyadenylation enhancement function of unknown mechanism (6Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 27Peterson M.L. Bertolino S. Davis F. Mol. Cell.

We have also shown in vitro that this signaling from the poly(A) signal to the polymerase does not depend on cleavage at the poly(A) site (9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol.

We determined the pore size of several voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels of known molecular composition with large organic cations as probes. T-type channels supported by the CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 subunits; L-type channels encoded by the CaV1.2, β1, and α2δ1 subunits; and R-type channels encoded by the CaV2.3 and β3subunits were each studied using a Xenopus oocyte expression system. The weak permeabilities to organic cations were resolved by looking at inward tails generated upon repolarization after a large depolarizing pulse. Large inward NH 4+ currents and sizable methylammonium and dimethylammonium currents were observed in all of the channels tested, whereas trimethylammonium permeated only through L- and R-type channels, and tetramethylammonium currents were observed only in L-type channels. Thus, our experiments revealed an unexpected heterogeneity in pore size among different Ca2+channels, with L-type channels having the largest pore (effective diameter = 6.2 Å), T-type channels having the tiniest pore (effective diameter = 5.1 Å), and R-type channels having a pore size intermediate between these extremes. These findings ran counter to first-order expectations for these channels based simply on their degree of selectivity among inorganic cations or on the bulkiness of their acidic side chains at the locus of selectivity.

T-type Ca2+ channels are found in many cell types and are important for cellular functions as diverse as cell proliferation, cardiac pacemaker activity, and rhythmic firing of neural networks (1Tsien R.W.

Ca2+channels (L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-type), T-type channels activate at relatively negative membrane potentials and are often referred to as “low voltage-activated” (LVA). The distinctive permeation properties of T-type Ca2+ channels were critical for their original identification as distinct entities (3–16). In native preparations, T-type channels are equally permeable to Ca2+and Ba2+ ions, unlike all known HVA channels, for which unitary Ba2+ fluxes are larger than those supported by Ca2+ (17Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 83-114Google Scholar). Despite general agreement about these differences (1Tsien R.W. Clozel J.P. Nargeot J. Low Voltage-activated T-type Calcium Channels. Adis International Ltd., Tottenhall, United Kingdom1996Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the underlying basis of ion selectivity and permeation in T-type channels. New impetus for approaching such questions is provided by the molecular cloning of three different pore-forming CaV subunits with biophysical properties that clearly identify them as T-type channels (18Perez-Reyes E.

These subunits form a closely related family with only limited sequence homology to the subfamilies of HVA channels (∼28%). In the regions thought to be important for permeation, the CaV3 subunits and HVA channel are more similar (40%). The CaV3 subunits also have “P-loops,” each containing an amino acid with an acidic side chain thought to be important for permeation. However, instead of a set of four glutamates as in HVA channels (EEEE locus), the corresponding amino acids in the three T-type channel α1 subunits are glutamates in domains I and II and aspartates in domains III and IV, forming a putative EEDD locus (21Sather W.A.

Life Sci. 1999; 56: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Knowledge about the molecular differences between the pore-forming regions of T-type channels and HVA channels has redirected attention to differences in their permeation properties. Because current models of ion permeation through voltage-dependent Ca2+channels are based almost entirely on studies of L-type channels (24McCleskey E.W. J. Gen.

Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), characterizing permeation and selectivity in various T-type channels offers broader perspectives about mechanisms. A promising start was provided by Talavera et al. (27Talavera K. Staes M. Janssens A. Klugbauer N. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45628-45635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who showed that the aspartates at the EEDD locus of a T-type α1 subunit contribute to its distinctive selectivity properties (see also Ref.28Yang N.

Even in the absence of direct evidence about channel structure from x-ray crystallography, valuable information on minimal pore size can be gathered by studies on the permeation of large organic cations (17Hille B.

There was also a brief report that T-type channels in neoplastic B-lymphocytes are impermeable to tetramethylammonium (37Fukushima Y. Hagiwara S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 255-284Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). By contrast, no systematic study of the pore size of Ca2+ channels of known molecular composition has yet been reported.Here, we used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to determine the apparent pore size of calcium channels encoded by cloned CaV subunits. CaV1.2 (α1C), the subject of the vast majority of recent permeation experiments, was a logical starting point for comparison with the three T-type channel subunits, CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3. We also studied the pore size of channels encoded by the CaV2.3 subunit (α1E), which supports the R-type current (38Piedras-Renteria E.S. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), of interest because this channel resembles T-type channels in permeation and selectivity properties, although its amino acid sequence is much closer to L- than T-type α1subunits (39Bourinet E.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSTo estimate the minimal dimensions of the permeation pore, we pursued the classical approach of recording the Ca2+channel currents supported by a series of monovalent cations of increasing size (17Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 83-114Google Scholar, 35McCleskey E.W. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out in buffered Ca2+-free solutions to avoid the potent blocking effects of Ca2+ ions on monovalent cation currents (35McCleskey E.W. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 46Hess P. Lansman J.B. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). When currents were evoked by a series of increasingly large depolarizing steps, inward currents first grew in size as the channels activated, but became progressively smaller and eventually reversed when the depolarization became strong enough to drive a net positive charge out of the oocytes, presumably supported by K+ efflux. Fig.1 A compares currents carried by Li+ ions in oocytes expressing the T-type channel subunits, CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3, or the HVA channel subunits, CaV1.2 (L-type) and CaV2.3 (R-type). As expected, each of these channels became highly permeable to monovalent ions once divalent cations were removed from the bath, and large inward currents were recorded with Li+ as the external charge carrier (Fig. 1). Despite obvious differences in activation and inactivation kinetics from one channel to the next, Li+ current reversed at around +5 mV in both L- and R-type channels and in each of the T-type channel isoforms. This value is in good agreement with previous determinations of Li+ current reversal in oocytes expressing CaV1.2 (47Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and leads to an estimatedP Li/P K of 1.46 using the Hodgkin-Goldman-Katz formalism for bi-ionic permeation. In calculating this permeability ratio, we assumed that the intracellular potassium concentration in Xenopus oocytes is 120 mm (48Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and does not change significantly upon recording with KCl-filled pipettes because of the large volume of the oocytes. Pooled results from many oocytes displayed no significant difference in reversal potential (E rev) among the various channel types (Fig. 1 B and Table I).Table IComparison of the Erev values obtained using Li+ as the charge carrier and either a step or tail protocolTailsStepsCaV1.23.34 ± 0.425.62 ± 0.43CaV2.34.43 ± 1.035.37 ± 1.85CaV3.13.83 ± 0.696.36 ± 0.39CaV3.23.58 ± 0.785.32 ± 0.58CaV3.34.71 ± 0.857.11 ± 0.28 Open table in a new tab CaV3.2 and CaV1.2 Differ in Their Permeability to Organic CationsTo determine whether there is any difference in the pore size of LVA and HVA Ca2+ channels, we compared the relative permeabilities of L- and T-type channels to organic cations (results with R-type channels are deferred to the end of “Results”). Ammonium and its di-, tri-, and tetramethyl substituents were chosen for two main reasons (49Sun Y.M. Favre I. Schild L. Moczydlowski E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). First of all, given their pK a values, all of these compounds are >95% ionized at pH 7.4, allowing recordings at physiological pH without complications due to pH-induced changes in the channel itself. Second and more importantly, these compounds are expected to offer reliable reagents to determine channel pore size because the progressive addition of methyl groups produces a gradual increase in the size of these molecules without introducing gross modifications in their overall three-dimensional structure. For reference (49Sun Y.M. Favre I. Schild L. Moczydlowski E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the maximal diameters and the volumes of these ions, respectively, are as follows: NH 4+, 3.6 Å and 20.1 Å3; methylammonium (MA), 3.8 Å and 35.1 Å3; dimethylammonium (DMA), 4.6 Å and 49.7 Å3; trimethylammonium (TriMA), 6.0 Å and 64.2 Å3; and tetramethylammonium (TMA), 6.0 Å and 78.8 Å3. Interesting differences were found in CaV1.2- and CaV3.2-expressing oocytes when these ions were used as charge carriers for inward currents evoked by depolarizing steps (Fig. 2). NH 4+ and MA clearly permeated through both types of channels, but only CaV1.2-expressing oocytes displayed clear inward DMA currents. This provided an initial clue that channels supported by CaV3.2 and CaV1.2 differ in their permeability.Figure 2Whole cell currents carried by ammonium and its methyl-substituted derivatives in CaV1.2 and CaV3.2. Representative traces of the whole cell currents carried by NH 4+, MA, DMA, TriMA, and TMA as indicated in CaV3.2-expressing (upper row) and CaV1.2-expressing (lower row) oocytes are shown. The oocytes were held at −80 mV and step-depolarized to the voltages indicated in 10-mV increments (75-ms pulses, 0.6-Hz pulse frequency). In the case of CaV3.2, thevertical bar indicates 2 μA for NH 4+ and 1 μA for all of the other cations, whereas in the case of CaV1.2, the amplitude of the vertical bar is 1 μA in the NH 4+ trace and 0.5 μA in all of the other recordings. The time scale is set at 30 ms. Each set of traces was obtained in a different oocyte and is representative of the behavior of six different cells. To emphasize the monotonic decrease in current size accompanying the increase in cation size, traces obtained in oocytes with similar Li+ current are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We looked more closely at the currents with TriMA and TMA as external cations to develop a more quantitative picture of the cutoff sizes of T- and L-type channels. The failure of these ions to support significant inward currents during step depolarizations must be cautiously interpreted because of the possibility that T- and L-type channels are permeable to these cations, but not detectably so at voltage levels sufficiently depolarized to activate the various Ca2+ channels. As an indication that this was of concern for CaV1.2, both TriMA and TMA supported clear inward current tails after the depolarizing pulses upon repolarization to −80 mV, where the driving force was larger (Fig. 2,lower row). Accordingly, to improve the resolution of weak permeabilities, we carried out additional experiments to look systematically at inward current tails over a wide range of potentials. This approach is illustrated in Fig. 3, with tail currents recorded in the presence of 100 mmLi+. Ca2+ channels were strongly activated by application of a 5-ms depolarizing pulse to +70 mV, and then the inward driving force was sharply increased by sudden repolarizations to a range of voltage levels to generate inward tail currents through the open channels. The large tail currents that resulted were outward at repolarization levels at or positive to +10 mV, but increasingly negative at levels at or below 0 mV. The values of reversal potential determined with the tail protocol agreed withE rev values obtained with step depolarizations to within 2–3 mV (Table I). In no case were the differences significant, validating the tail current procedure.Figure 3Tail currents carried by Li+ in HVA and LVA channels. A, representative traces of tail currents recorded in oocytes expressing the L-type channel CaV1.2 or the T-type channels, CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3, using Li+ as a carrier ion and the voltage protocol depicted in the insets. In particular, tail currents were elicited by increasing the membrane potential from a holding potential of −80 mV to +70 mV for 5 ms to maximally open the voltage-dependent calcium channels and by stepping down the potential to values increasing from −30 to +30 mV in repetitive episodes (10-mV increments, 50-ms pulse duration, 0.6-Hz frequency). The horizontal bar is set at 15 ms, whereas thevertical bar indicates 0.5 μA. B, current-voltage plot derived from the data obtained in CaV1.2 (○), CaV3.1(▵), CaV3.2 (▿), and CaV3.3 (■) using this tail protocol.

Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of the data obtained in at least five different oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we proceeded to use the same tail current protocol to explore the permeation of organic cations through the various voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, focusing first on the CaV1.2 and CaV3.2 subunits. In oocytes expressing either of these subunits, very large inward NH 4+ currents and sizable MA and DMA currents were observed (Fig. 4 and TableII). The contrasts became more dramatic in considering even larger organic cations. In CaV3.2-expressing oocytes, no inward tails were detected with either external TriMA or TMA. In contrast, in CaV1.2-expressing oocytes, TriMA carried small but unmistakable inward currents that reversed around −30 mV, and TMA supported extremely small tails negative to −60 mV (Fig. 4).Figure 4Tail currents carried by NH 4+ and its methyl-substituted derivatives in CaV1.2 and CaV3.2.

Open table in a new tab Measurements of reversal potential provided a more quantitative assessment of the differences between channels. For NH 4+, no significant difference was observed in E rev between CaV1.2 and CaV3.2 (Table II), suggesting that pore size was not critical in allowing permeation of these small ions. In the case of MA and DMA, E rev was ∼20 mV more negative for CaV3.2 than for CaV1.2. This difference corresponds to a lower relative permeability of the T-type channels for the intermediate-sized ions.CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 Show Organic Cation Permeability Similar to That of CaV3.2All of the data reported in above point to the conclusion that the channel pore is smaller in CaV3.2 than in CaV1.2. To establish whether a smaller pore size is a general feature of T-type channels, we extended our studies to the two other members of the T-type channel family, CaV3.1 and CaV3.3, using the tail protocol to study their permeability to NH 4+ and its methyl-substituted derivatives (Fig. 5). Despite clear differences in the kinetic properties of tail currents carried by these two channels, their permeability to organic cations was remarkably similar. Very large tails were observed when ammonium was the charge carrier, and these currents reversed at approximately +20 mV, as in the case of CaV3.2 and CaV1.2. Clear tails were observed with MA and DMA, and, once again, the reversal potentials for these currents were remarkably similar to that observed in CaV3.2-expressing oocytes, ranging at around −20 mV for MA and −60 mV for DMA (Table II). No clear inward tails were observed with TriMA and TMA as charge carriers. Indeed, with either of these external cations, outward currents flowed through the channel at potentials as negative as −80 mV. All of these data support the conclusion that T-type channels constitute a homogeneous family with regard to pore size, significantly different from L-type channels.Figure 5Tail currents carried by NH 4+ and its methyl-substituted derivatives in CaV3.1 and CaV3.3. A, representative traces of tail currents carried by NH 4+, MA, DMA, TriMA, and TMA in oocytes expressing CaV3.1 (upper row) or CaV3.3 (lower row).

However, no information is available on the pore size of channels supported by CaV2.3. To explore this, we used the same approach that allowed us to establish a small pore size in T-type channels (Fig.6). In CaV2.3-expressing oocytes, large inward tail currents were observed when Li+or NH 4+ was present as the charge carrier. The tail currents were smaller with external MA and DMA and very small but clearly detectable with the larger cation TriMA. No inward tail currents whatsoever were observed with TMA as the external cation. The reversal potential for Li+ and NH 4+ was not significantly different in CaV2.3- and CaV1.2-expressing oocytes. By contrast, MA, DMA, and TriMA currents reversed at significantly more negative potentials in CaV2.3-expressing oocytes than in CaV1.2-expressing oocytes. Thus, there were quantitative differences in permeation properties between channels supported by CaV2.3 and the best studied exemplar of the HVA subfamily.Figure 6Tail currents carried by NH 4+ and its methyl-substituted derivatives in CaV2.3. A, tail currents carried in CaV2.3 subunit-expressing oocytes by Li+, NH 4+, and its methyl-substituted derivatives MA, DMA, TriMA, and TMA.

The implicit presumption here is that whichever cation is present in the extracellular bath, the composition of relevant charge carriers in the intracellular compartment is similar and constant, a very reasonable assumption because the volume of the oocytes is so large.

The traditional method of industrially producing mannitol involves the reduction of fructose using a metal catalyst and hydrogen gas, resulting in nearly equal amounts of d-sorbitol andd-mannitol, which must then be separated. In general, mannitol dehydrogenases (MDH)1 catalyze the NAD(P)+-dependent reversible oxidation ofd-mannitol or d-mannitol-1-phosphate to the corresponding ketose, d-fructose, or d-fructose 6-phosphate. These secondary alcohol dehydrogenases are specific for the C2(R) configuration of polyhydroxylated compounds and are of interest because of their potential applications in chiral synthesis. More recently, mannitol dehydrogenases have been identified in plants that catalyze the oxidation of d-mannitol tod-mannose, an aldose (6Stoop J.M. Pharr D.M. Arch. Biochem.

More recent work increased this number to 66. 2Klimacek, M., Kavanagh, K., Wilson, D., and Nidetzky, B., in press. 2Klimacek, M., Kavanagh, K., Wilson, D., and Nidetzky, B., in press. Sequence identity with other long-chain dehydrogenases is low, typically around 10%. Most members of the prokaryotic long-chain MDH family have been identified by primary sequence alone (11Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar), and a limited number of these proteins have had their specificity characterized and activity quantitated. The proteins that have been studied are monomeric long-chain dehydrogenases of a molecular mass of ∼54 kDa (10Schneider K.-H. Giffhorn F. Kaplan S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Novotny M.J. Reizer J. Esch F. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 986-990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This family so far includes mannitol 2-dehydrogenases, mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenases, d-mannonate dehydrogenases, sorbitol dehydrogenases,l-sorbose reductase, fructuronate reductase, altronate oxidoreductases, and d-arabinitol dehydrogenases. In addition to their significance as an alcohol dehydrogenase that employs a novel mechanism, interest in long-chain MDHs originates from several potential uses: (i) transgenic expression of bacterial MDHs in plants has been tested to improve salt tolerance and resistance to oxidative stress in agricultural crops (15Tarczynski M.C. Jensen R.G. Bohnert H.J. Science. 1993; 259: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), (ii) quantitative analysis of mannitol concentration in serum and urine via a simple and sensitive enzymatic assay has potential clinical use (16Diamandis E.P. Grass C.L. Uldall R. Mendelssohn D. Maini D. Clin. Biochem. 1992; 25: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and (iii) enzymatic production of d-mannitol from fructose would reduce downstream purification (17Slatner M. Nagl G. Haltrich D. Kulbe K.D. Nidetzky B. Biocat. Biotrans. 1998; 16: 351-363Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An inducible mannitol 2-dehydrogenase belonging to the long-chain MDH family was isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM50106 (pfMDH, EC 1.1.1.67) (18Brunker P. Altenbuchner J. Kulbe K.D. Mattes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the reversible oxidation ofd-mannitol to d-fructose,d-arabinitol to d-xylulose, andd-sorbitol to l-sorbose by transferring the C2 hydride to the pro-S position on the nicotinamide without the use of metal cations. It is specific for the C2(R) configuration of polyols with a minimum of five carbons, and no activity is measurable with mannitol 1-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, or 5,6-dideoxy-d-fructose. 3B. Nidetzky, unpublished results. 3B. Nidetzky, unpublished results.How specificity for polyol substrates is achieved is not well understood. Although able to use both NADH and NADPH as cofactor, the activity with NADH is greater. Other alcohol dehydrogenases use metal ions (medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductases and some long-chain dehydrogenases) or a conserved tyrosine (SDRs) for catalysis. Neither is present in long-chain MDHs, so presumably, these alcohol dehydrogenases use a novel catalytic mechanism. Biochemical data implicate an enzyme side-chain with a pKa of 9.34 (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to gain an understanding of how specificity is achieved for substrate and cofactor as well as elucidate the mechanism for catalysis in the structurally uncharacterized family of long-chain MDHs. Recombinant wild-type MDH fromP. fluorescens DSM 50106 was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as previously described (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The selenomethione-substituted protein was expressed in the presence of 60 mg/liter selenomethionine accompanied by amino acids inhibiting de novo synthesis of methionine (19Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Purification was carried out using a protocol similar to the previously described wild-type preparation (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A final gel filtration step was included to obtain highly purified protein. Gel filtration was carried out on an Äktaexplorer 100 system (Amersham Biosciences) using 140-ml Superdex 75 prep-grade material packed into a 1.6/70-cm column. Approximately 15 mg of protein in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, were applied to the column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated to ∼11 mg/ml. The purified protein migrated as a single band in SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing anionic PAGE. Semiquantitative densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels suggested that the purity of pfMDH was 99% or better. The selenium-substituted protein retains full wild-type activity. Wild-type pfMDH was concentrated to 14 mg/ml, and the buffer changed to 10 mm Tris, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments were duplicated at 277 and 293 K using both apoprotein and protein solution containing 5 mm NADH. Initial crystals of a binary complex with NADH took five months to appear at 293 K over a well containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mmammonium acetate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6. A single crystal was flash-cooled in a buffer containing 75% (v/v) well solution and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Diffraction intensities to 2.5 Å were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 9−1 and processed using the program Denzo (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38243) Google Scholar). This indicated that the spacegroup was I222 with unit cell dimensions of a = 102 Å, b = 103 Å,c = 107 Å. A Matthews' constant (V m) of 2.58 Å3/dalton implied one monomer/asymmetric unit. Because a suitable molecular replacement model could not be identified and the original protein had degraded, selenomethione-substituted protein was used to grow additional crystals. Crystallization experiments were conducted around the previously determined conditions by mixing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of well solution. Crystals of size 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm took three months to appear from a protein solution containing 14 mg/ml selenomethionine pfMDH, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm NADH, 50 μm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, over a well of 34% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 250 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0. These crystals were used for seeding, and square rods of size 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.5 mm were obtained within 2 days. Crystals were flash-cooled in a buffer containing 25% (v/v) glycerol, 75% (v/v) well solution. Lattice constants of a = 102.23 Å,b = 103.28 Å, and c = 106.57 Å were observed, similar to those found in the wild-type crystals. Several attempts to get mannitol bound in the active site were made. Ultimately, a protein solution of 14 mg/ml selenomethionine-substituted pfMDH, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mmd-mannitol, 5 mm NAD+, 50 μm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was used to grow seeded crystals over identical well conditions. Initially, these crystals were flash-cooled in a buffer containing 300 mmmannitol, 1 mm NAD+, 36% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 250 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.0. Electron density maps calculated using data collected from these crystals suggested incomplete incorporation of mannitol. Data used for refinement of the ternary complex were obtained using crystals soaked in this buffer for 12 h before flash cooling. The binary complex multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data set was collected at SSRL beamline 9-2. A three-wavelength MAD experiment was conducted with a high energy reference after performing a fluorescence scan to determine peak and inflection points (Table I). Diffraction intensities were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38243) Google Scholar). All eleven of the expected selenium sites were determined using the program Solve that resulted in a figure of merit of 0.468. After density modification executed by Resolve, the figure of merit was 0.638 and maps were calculated to 2.3-Å resolution (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The density for protein and cofactor was easily interpretable, and the model was built using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). A data set to 1.7-Å resolution was subsequently collected on a binary crystal at SSRL beamline 9-2. The crystals were isomorphous, and the model built from the MAD data was used as starting model.Table IData collectionData setSe peakSe remoteSe inflectionHolo-nativeTernaryWavelength (Å)0.97910.93220.97930.98010.9198Resolution (Å) (highest shell)30–2.3 (2.34–2.3)30–1.7 (1.76–1.7)30–1.8 (1.84–1.8)Reflections (observed/unique)127,020/25,768126,991/25,738127,004/25,745227,038/58,258367,595/105,300Completeness (%)100 (100)100 (99.9)100 (100)94.4 (70.8)99.5 (96.1)I/ς(I)15.7 (5.1)19.0 (5.8)18.7 (5.8)15.1 (2.3)18.4 (2.8)Rmerge0.092 (0.298)0.079 (0.288)0.077 (0.296)0.083 (0.228)0.064 (0.371)Values in parenthesis are for data in highest shell.

The program Denzo was used to determine a primitive orthorhombic lattice of dimensions of a = 107.0 Å,b = 104.5 Å, and c = 101.5 Å. Systematic extinctions indicated the that the spacegroup wasP21212. The calculation of the Matthews' constant (V m) of 2.6 Å3/dalton implied two protein molecules/asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement using the holo-MDH structure stripped of water molecules as a search model was implemented using the program EPMR (23Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). An initial solution was found for two molecules using data between 30 and 4 Å, which yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.603 and an initial R cryst = 0.41 in this resolution range. In both cases before refinement commenced, 5% of the data was flagged for calculation of R free. Alternating rounds of manual fitting and crystallographic refinement using the programs O and CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Ordered water molecules were picked in CNS and manually checked for appropriate hydrogen bonding. Despite the inclusion of 1 mm NAD+ in the mannitol soak, the density of the NAD+ indicated occupancy of <1. Because it is not possible to accurately refine occupancy and temperature factors at this resolution, values between 0.5 and 1.0 were tested and the occupancy for the NAD+ in the ternary model was set to 0.8, a value that gave both reasonable temperature factors and minimized features in difference maps.Table IIRefinementHolo pfMDHTernary complexSpacegroupI222P21212Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 102.2, b= 103.3, c = 106.6a = 107.0, b = 104.5, c = 101.5Resolution (Å)30–1.730–1.8Reflections (I > 0)58,319104,464Completeness (%)94.398.8Rcryst (%)17.117.6Rfree(%)19.720.2Rmsd bond lengths (Å)0.0170.016Rmsd bond angles (°)1.791.68Protein atoms38297658NADH atoms4488 (80% occupancy)Water molecules437630Mannitol atoms—24Temperature factors (Å2)Protein chain A18.5219.80Protein chain B—23.05NADH14.2328.89 (80% occupancy)Mannitol—13.48Waters31.6628.57Rmsd, root mean square deviations. Open table in a new tab Rmsd, root mean square deviations. The structure of the binary complex of pfMDH with NADH was initially determined to 2.3 Å resolution by MAD using selenomethione-substituted protein (TableI). A data set to 1.7 Å was subsequently collected and used for refinement (TableII). Crystals of a ternary complex of pfMDH with NADH and mannitol were obtained by including 10 mmd-mannitol in the protein solution and soaking the crystals for 12 h in a solution containing 300 mm mannitol. Diffraction intensities to 1.8 Å resolution were collected on a ternary crystal (Tables I and II). In both cases, the model for MDH includes residues 1–492. The final C-terminal residue was disordered and not fit. The holo model includes 1 pfMDH monomer, 1 NADH molecule, and 437 water molecules. The model of the ternary complex includes 2 pfMDH protein chains, 2 NAD+molecules with 80% occupancy, and 630 water molecules. Root mean square deviations between holo- and ternary models are <0.8 Å for α-carbons and 1.0 Å for all atoms. A Ramachandran plot as implemented by Procheck for the binary model indicates that 89.6% of the residues lie in the most favored regions, 9.9% in additional allowed regions and 0.2% in generously allowed regions. A Procheck Ramachandran plot for the ternary model indicates that 90.8% of the residues are in the most favored regions and 9.0% in additional allowed regions (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In both the binary and ternary models, residue Thr-132 was the single exception and was always located in a disallowed region. This residue is located in a loop involved in cofactor binding, and density clearly indicates it is in this conformation. Consistently low temperature factors of Thr-132 and clear 2F o − F c density provide clear evidence that it is very well ordered. The structure reveals that pfMDH folds into two main domains (Fig. 1). Overall dimensions are 65 × 45 × 60 Å with the active site located at the bottom of a cleft between the two domains that is 12 × 11 Å wide and 23 Å deep. The structure confirms the biochemical data in which there are no metal ions involved in catalysis (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (domain 1) includes 9 α-helices, 14 β-strands, and 3 310-helices (Fig. 2). The largest β-sheet is a six-stranded parallel dinucleotide binding motif commonly known as a Rossmann fold. A tetra-peptide linker of sequence Thr-Asp-Asp-Val connects domain 1 and the C-terminal domain (domain 2). Domain 2 contains 11 α-helices, 2 310-helices, and a small β-hairpin. The most important secondary structural elements involved in contacts between the two domains are loop regions on domain 1 and helices α10 and α15 in domain 2. In addition, helix α13 contributes a conserved arginine, Arg-361, which is engaged in interdomain salt bridges to Asp-230 on β11 and Glu-259 located on the loop at the C terminus of β12.Figure 2Schematic diagram of MDH secondary structure. β-Strands are colored blue and numbered β1–β16; strands within the canonical dinucleotide binding motif are also labeled sequentially as A–F. α-Helices arecolored green and numbered 1–20.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The active site is at the interface of the two domains with the majority of residues that bind NADH contributed by the N-terminal domain and residues that bind mannitol coming primarily from the C-terminal domain. Arg-373 is the only residue from the C-terminal domain that interacts directly with the bound NAD+. Important secondary structural elements that contribute residues to the active site are α1 and loop regions at the C termini of β3, β7, and β10 from domain 1 and α10 from domain 2. A conserved lysine located on α10, Lys-295, is poised to act as the general acid/base in the reaction. Residues 1–285 form the NAD+-binding domain, domain 1. Helix α1 is in the center of domain 1 and is surrounded by the six-strand parallel β-sheet of the dinucleotide binding motif, a three-strand β-sheet formed by the extension of the final strand in the Rossmann fold with two antiparallel strands, and a four-strand mixed β-sheet. Although the relative order of the strands in the parallel sheet are the same as a Rossmann fold (CBADEF), there are insertions within it that suggest that the additional elements are not merely appended (Fig. 2). The three-strand sheet is formed wholly from residues inserted between the last strand in the dinucleotide binding fold (strand F) and the C-terminal domain, whereas the four-strand sheet is formed from residues at the N terminus, an insertion between strands B and C and the C-terminal insertion. A small solvent-accessible β-hairpin is located at the C terminus of β7. Asn-191 and Asp-230 are the only residues from domain 1 that directly bind mannitol, whereas Glu-133 has a water-mediated interaction. Eleven α-helices and a small β-hairpin make up the C-terminal domain, which can be further divided into two subdomains. Residues 289–375 compose helices α10-α14, forming domain 2A, an antiparallel three-helix bundle with two short connecting helices. Domain 2B, residues 378–493, consists of α15-α20 and the β-hairpin. Helices α15, α16, and α19 form a three-helix bundle of different structural arrangement with α15 and α16 antiparallel and α16 and α19 parallel. Helix α15 has a pronounced 40° bend because of two proline residues, Pro-383 and Pro-388, in the middle of the helix. At least one proline is found in this region in all long-chain MDH sequences examined, suggesting that the bend in α15 is a common feature for the family. Helix α15 lies antiparallel to α10 and contributes several contacts to domain 1 including three water-mediated hydrogen bonds and one salt link between Lys-384 and Asp-140. Also located on α15 is Lys-381, which hydrogen bonds to the terminal hydroxyl of mannitol away from the point of oxidation. Residues 289–313 compose α10, the first helix in the C-terminal domain that lies near the cleft between domains 1 and 2 and provides several interdomain contacts. It also contributes three residues important in substrate binding, Asn-300, His-303, and the apparent catalytic acid/base Lys-295. Arg-361 located on α13 is involved in salt links across the domain interface to Glu-259 and Asp-230, and the loop following α13 provides hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts to residues Leu-88, Asp-90, and Met-258 in domain 1. Arg-373 on α14 donates hydrogen bonds to hydroxyls on carbons 3 and 4 of the substrate and is the only residue from the C-terminal domain within 4 Å of the NAD+. It is located parallel but slightly offset 3.15–3.89 Å abutting the amide on the nicotinamide, contributing weak stacking or van der Waals interactions. Although there is a lack of extensive interaction between the NAD+and domain 2, a closer inspection shows that the loops from domain 1 that recognize the NAD+ provide ∼40% of the interdomain contacts. Therefore, a conformational change upon binding NAD+ is possible and is predicted from the kinetic mechanism (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The NAD+is bound with the adenine anti and the nicotinamidesyn between the two domains. The sugar pucker of the adenosine ribose is C2′-endo, and the nicotinamide ribose is C3′-endo. There is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the nicotinamide N7 and pyrophosphate oxygen NO1. Using the method of Lee and Richards (26Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) with a probe of radius 1.4 Å, 80% of the accessible surface of NAD+ is buried in the complex with pfMDH (26Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar). Cofactor contacts are mainly from domain 1 and primarily from the canonical dinucleotide binding motif. As is commonly found in enzymes with a Rossmann fold, the pyrophosphate moiety is situated at the N terminus of α1. The glycine-rich turn in the sequence 31HIGVGGFHR39 precedes α1. HXGXGXXXR is the conserved fingerprint motif for the long chain MDH family with the exception of altronate dehydrogenases that have a glutamine at position 31. A hydrophobic Ile, Leu, or Phe follows this residue. The Nε of invariant Arg-39 orients the amide of Gly-36 to interact with the pyrophosphate by hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-35. Phe-37 stacks against the A side of the nicotinamide, making the B side accessible to substrate and promoting transfer of the 4-pro-S hydride. A Phe or Ile is present at this position for all members of the long-chain MDH family and probably stacks against the pyridine ring. Thr-233, located on the loop following β11, has main-chain hydrogen bonds to the cofactor amide oxygen and nitrogen (Fig. 3). The adenine packs against Ile-131 and is shielded from solvent by Arg-66. Isomerization of the loop containing residues 65–69 is required for cofactor binding and release and could explain why the release of NADH is the rate-limiting step in the direction of oxidation of mannitol (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Loops at the C termini of strands B, D, and E contribute residues that hydrogen bond with the ribose hydroxyls. Although significant activity with NADPH is still observed, pfMDH exhibits a strong preference for NADH over NADPH (13Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10489-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Asp-69, which hydrogen bonds to both adenosine ribose hydroxyls, almost certainly contributes toward specificity for NAD+ over NADP+ by discouraging phosphate binding. However, it is located on a mobile loop, allowing Asp-69 to have a different conformation with NADP+ bound. Arg-66 on the same loop could make favorable contacts with a phosphate moiety and partially compensate for the negative Asp-69 interaction. Other members of this f"

Three protein species (p240/TEP1, p193/VPARP, and p100/MVP) and a small RNA comprise the 13-MDa vault particle. The expression of the unique 100-kDa major vault protein is sufficient to form the basic vault structure. Previously, we have shown that stable association of the vault RNA with the vault particle is dependent on its interaction with the p240/TEP1 protein. To identify other proteins that interact with the vault RNA, we used a UV-cross-linking assay. We find that a portion of the vault RNA is complexed with the La autoantigen in a separate smaller ribonucleoprotein particle. La interacts with the vault RNA (both in vivo and in vitro) presumably through binding to 3′-uridylates. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the La autoantigen is the 50-kDa protein that we have previously reported as a protein that co-purifies with vaults.

This protein, termed the major vault protein (MVP), is the main structural component of the particle because its expression alone is sufficient to induce vault particle formation (7Stephen A.G. Raval-Fernandes S. Huynh T. Torres M. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23217-23220Google Scholar). Two other proteins and a small RNA comprise the rest of the vault particle. These protein subunits have masses of 193 (VPARP) and 240 kDa (TEP1) (8Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J.

VPARP is a functional poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and TEP1 is essential for the stable association of the vault RNA with the particle (10Kickhoefer V.A. Liu Y. Kong L.B. Snow B.E. Stewart P.L. Harrington L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 157-164Google Scholar). TEP1 is a protein subunit that is shared with the telomerase RNP complex; however, its role in telomerase function is unclear (11Liu Y. Snow B.E. Hande M.P. Baerlocher G. Kickhoefer V.A. Yeung D. Wakeham A. Itie A. Siderovski D.P. Lansdorp P.M. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8178-8184Google Scholar). A vault-interacting protein of ∼50 kDa has been reported to co-purify with vaults prepared from rat liver (12Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar).Besides the proteins, a unique small untranslated RNA of 141 bases termed vault RNA (vRNA) is associated with rat vaults (13Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Google Scholar). The rat vRNA component is estimated to account for approximately 5% of the particle mass or 16 copies/vault particle (12Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar). Difference mapping of the various vault reconstructions indicated that the vRNA is localized to the particle caps in proximity to TEP1 (6Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 890-900Google Scholar). The genes encoding human, rat, and mouse vRNAs have been cloned and sequenced (13Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J.

Mossink M.H. Schoester M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Sonneveld P. Wiemer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37715-37721Google Scholar). The vault RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and contain the canonical A and B box internal promoter elements along with several external promoter elements (16Vilalta A. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Johnson D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29752-29759Google Scholar). Some species like human and bullfrog contain multiple related vRNAs. The vertebrate vRNAs range in size from 86–141 bases in length, and despite their differences in length, they are predicted to fold into similar secondary structures. The vRNA is not a structural component of the vault particle, as its digestion with ribonucleases does not alter particle morphology (6Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 890-900Google Scholar, 17Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Google Scholar). Our current hypothesis is that vRNA is a functional component of the vault particle, possibly through the mediation of protein-RNA and/or RNA-RNA interactions.Ultimately, our goal is to understand the function of the vault particle and the role of its associated RNA. We have undertaken a biochemical analysis of the vRNA and its association with other proteins in cellular extracts. Early characterization of vault particles revealed that vaults pelleted with the microsomal fraction at 100,000 × g (P100) (2Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 161-170Google Scholar, 12Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar). Here we show that although most of the major vault protein is associated with the microsome fraction, a significant amount of TEP1, VPARP, and vRNA is associated with the high speed (100,000 × g) supernatant (S100) and nuclear fractions. We demonstrate that the vRNA can be UV-cross-linked with a 50-kDa protein in the S100 fraction to form a small RNP complex. We have identified this protein as the La/SS-B autoantigen (reviewed in Refs. 18Maraia R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: F13-F18Google Scholar, 19Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 41-57Google Scholar, 20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). Partial purification of the complex demonstrates that vRNA and the La/SS-B autoantigen co-fractionate by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Anti-La serum specifically immunoprecipitates a portion of the cellular vRNA, and gel shift analysis shows that La specifically binds to vRNA. Finally, we identify La as the “50-kDa” protein that has been reported to co-purify with vaults isolated from rat liver (12Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have undertaken an analysis of the vRNA in extracts from tissue culture cell lines with the aim of examining its cellular role. Early characterization of vault particles revealed that vaults pelleted with the microsomal fraction at 100,000 × g (12Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar). In this study, we refer to the microsomal fraction (100,000 ×g pellet) as the P100 fraction, and we refer to the supernatant as the S100 or non-vault cytoplasmic fraction. As a first step in this analysis, we show that although most of the major vault protein is associated with the P100 fraction, TEP1, VPARP, and the vRNA are associated as well with the S100 fraction and in varying amounts with the nuclear fraction. This finding suggested that these components may have additional roles outside of the vault particle and that the vRNA may associate with other proteins. We have used a UV-cross-linking/hybridization assay to identify proteins that interact with the vRNA. We have partially purified a 50-kDa protein that cross-links to the vRNA in the S100 fraction and identified it as the La protein. Anti-La antibodies are found in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogrens syndrome (24van Venrooij W.J. Slobbe R.L. Pruijn G.J. Clemens M.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 113-119Google Scholar). La is a ∼47-kDa phosphoprotein that associates with small untranslated RNAs during their processing and incorporation into larger RNPs (18Maraia R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: F13-F18Google Scholar, 19Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 41-57Google Scholar). The association of La with these small RNAs is thought to occur largely through La binding to polyuridine-rich sequences, usually found at the 3′ end of unprocessed RNA polymerase III-transcribed RNAs. There are many precursor RNAs that have been identified in La RNPs including 7 S RNA, tRNA, 5 S RNA, U6 RNA, Y RNAs, and the virally encoded RNAs, VA (I and II) and EBER (1 and 2) RNAs (reviewed in Ref. 20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). La association with these transcripts is thought to be transient, because most of the 3′-uridine-rich sequences are lost during maturation of the transcripts. La binding to the vRNA may be more stable because the vRNA transcript does not appear to undergo further processing after synthesis, and thus the 3′ end has an intact uridylate tail (13Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Google Scholar). Indeed La interaction with vRNA in vitro can be competed with poly(U) but not poly(A), suggesting that binding to vRNA is through the 3′-UUU-OH tract. Two results indicate a stable association of the La protein with vRNA to form a small RNP complex: one is that the anti-La serum co-immunoprecipitates vRNA and another is that La co-purifies with the vRNA in the S100 fraction through DEAE-Sepharose chromatography and glycerol gradient purification at 200 mmNaCl. TEP1 is also found in the non-vault-cytoplasmic fraction, and at least a portion of it probably interacts with vRNA to form the RNP II complex identified here. Previously, we have shown that TEP1 interacts with vRNA and telomerase RNA in a yeast three-hybrid assay. Unlike with La, the sequences/secondary structures of the vRNA required for its binding to TEP1 have not yet been determined. Interestingly, in addition to an RNA binding domain, TEP1 also contains a Walker A motif, which in La has been shown to interact with the 5′-ppp of pre-tRNAs (27Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Engelke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Google Scholar). Because the vRNA is not capped and has a 5′-pppG, this motif may be another binding site for interaction with La and/or TEP1.The co-purification of La with vaults suggests that La may be involved in the assembly of vRNA into vault particles. Potentially, a La·vRNA complex may be targeted to vaults whereupon the vRNA is then transferred to vault-associated TEP1. Another possibility is that a La·vRNA complex may interact with non-vault-associated TEP1 and that this larger complex would then be targeted to vaults. This latter model seems less probable because preliminary analysis indicates that La remains associated with vaults purified from the livers ofTep1-deficient mice (data not shown). Thus, the interaction of La with vaults may not be dependent on TEP1. Previously, we have shown that in the absence of Tep1, the vRNA does not stably associate with vaults and that the stability of vRNA is greatly reduced in Tep1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (10Kickhoefer V.A. Liu Y. Kong L.B. Snow B.E. Stewart P.L. Harrington L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 157-164Google Scholar). Although a La·vRNA complex may be targeted to vaults in both wild type andTep1-deficient mice, vaults lacking TEP1 may be unable to then bind to the vRNA, even if it is brought within close proximity.The precise subcellular localization of La is controversial. Most immunolocalization studies place La in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref.20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). However, La has also been identified in both the cytoplasm and in the nucleolus (20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). In contrast, vaults have a predominately cytoplasmic distribution both biochemically and by immunofluorescence. Our cell fractionation method used in this study would result in significant contamination of the S100 fraction with nuclear components; thus, the presence of the vRNA and La in this fraction cannot be used as evidence of a cytoplasmic distribution. It is possible that a portion of the vRNA is “stored” in the nucleus or perinuclear region or that all of the vRNA in this fraction could represent newly synthesized RNA. Recently, we have found that a portion of each of the individual vault components localizes to the nucleolus. 2A. Siva, N. Emre, M. Torres, P. Webster, L. Rome, and V. Kickhoefer, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it is not yet clear where a La·vRNA complex might assemble into vaults. The present findings indicate that only a fraction of the cellular vRNA is found in vaults and that another fraction exists in at least two smaller RNP complexes: one containing La and the other presumably containing TEP1. These data suggest that there may be a dynamic relationship between the vRNA and vault particle and that La could mediate this interaction by acting as a chaperone.

Although the exact function of vaults is not yet known, in humans, the elevated vault levels have been used to predict whether tumors will acquire multidrug resistance (reviewed in Ref. 4Scheffer G.L.

Early characterization of vault particles revealed that vaults pelleted with the microsomal fraction at 100,000 × g (12Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar). In this study, we refer to the microsomal fraction (100,000 ×g pellet) as the P100 fraction, and we refer to the supernatant as the S100 or non-vault cytoplasmic fraction. As a first step in this analysis, we show that although most of the major vault protein is associated with the P100 fraction, TEP1, VPARP, and the vRNA are associated as well with the S100 fraction and in varying amounts with the nuclear fraction. This finding suggested that these components may have additional roles outside of the vault particle and that the vRNA may associate with other proteins. We have used a UV-cross-linking/hybridization assay to identify proteins that interact with the vRNA. We have partially purified a 50-kDa protein that cross-links to the vRNA in the S100 fraction and identified it as the La protein. Anti-La antibodies are found in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogrens syndrome (24van Venrooij W.J. Slobbe R.L. Pruijn G.J. Clemens M.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 113-119Google Scholar). La is a ∼47-kDa phosphoprotein that associates with small untranslated RNAs during their processing and incorporation into larger RNPs (18Maraia R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: F13-F18Google Scholar, 19Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 41-57Google Scholar). The association of La with these small RNAs is thought to occur largely through La binding to polyuridine-rich sequences, usually found at the 3′ end of unprocessed RNA polymerase III-transcribed RNAs. There are many precursor RNAs that have been identified in La RNPs including 7 S RNA, tRNA, 5 S RNA, U6 RNA, Y RNAs, and the virally encoded RNAs, VA (I and II) and EBER (1 and 2) RNAs (reviewed in Ref. 20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). La association with these transcripts is thought to be transient, because most of the 3′-uridine-rich sequences are lost during maturation of the transcripts. La binding to the vRNA may be more stable because the vRNA transcript does not appear to undergo further processing after synthesis, and thus the 3′ end has an intact uridylate tail (13Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Google Scholar). Indeed La interaction with vRNA in vitro can be competed with poly(U) but not poly(A), suggesting that binding to vRNA is through the 3′-UUU-OH tract. Two results indicate a stable association of the La protein with vRNA to form a small RNP complex: one is that the anti-La serum co-immunoprecipitates vRNA and another is that La co-purifies with the vRNA in the S100 fraction through DEAE-Sepharose chromatography and glycerol gradient purification at 200 mmNaCl. TEP1 is also found in the non-vault-cytoplasmic fraction, and at least a portion of it probably interacts with vRNA to form the RNP II complex identified here. Previously, we have shown that TEP1 interacts with vRNA and telomerase RNA in a yeast three-hybrid assay. Unlike with La, the sequences/secondary structures of the vRNA required for its binding to TEP1 have not yet been determined. Interestingly, in addition to an RNA binding domain, TEP1 also contains a Walker A motif, which in La has been shown to interact with the 5′-ppp of pre-tRNAs (27Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Engelke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Google Scholar). Because the vRNA is not capped and has a 5′-pppG, this motif may be another binding site for interaction with La and/or TEP1. The co-purification of La with vaults suggests that La may be involved in the assembly of vRNA into vault particles. Potentially, a La·vRNA complex may be targeted to vaults whereupon the vRNA is then transferred to vault-associated TEP1. Another possibility is that a La·vRNA complex may interact with non-vault-associated TEP1 and that this larger complex would then be targeted to vaults. This latter model seems less probable because preliminary analysis indicates that La remains associated with vaults purified from the livers ofTep1-deficient mice (data not shown). Thus, the interaction of La with vaults may not be dependent on TEP1. Previously, we have shown that in the absence of Tep1, the vRNA does not stably associate with vaults and that the stability of vRNA is greatly reduced in Tep1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (10Kickhoefer V.A. Liu Y. Kong L.B. Snow B.E. Stewart P.L. Harrington L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 157-164Google Scholar). Although a La·vRNA complex may be targeted to vaults in both wild type andTep1-deficient mice, vaults lacking TEP1 may be unable to then bind to the vRNA, even if it is brought within close proximity. The precise subcellular localization of La is controversial. Most immunolocalization studies place La in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref.20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). However, La has also been identified in both the cytoplasm and in the nucleolus (20Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Google Scholar). In contrast, vaults have a predominately cytoplasmic distribution both biochemically and by immunofluorescence. Our cell fractionation method used in this study would result in significant contamination of the S100 fraction with nuclear components; thus, the presence of the vRNA and La in this fraction cannot be used as evidence of a cytoplasmic distribution. It is possible that a portion of the vRNA is “stored” in the nucleus or perinuclear region or that all of the vRNA in this fraction could represent newly synthesized RNA. Recently, we have found that a portion of each of the individual vault components localizes to the nucleolus. 2A. Siva, N. Emre, M. Torres, P. Webster, L. Rome, and V. Kickhoefer, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it is not yet clear where a La·vRNA complex might assemble into vaults. The present findings indicate that only a fraction of the cellular vRNA is found in vaults and that another fraction exists in at least two smaller RNP complexes: one containing La and the other presumably containing TEP1. These data suggest that there may be a dynamic relationship between the vRNA and vault particle and that La could mediate this interaction by acting as a chaperone.

The degree to which a given process or enzyme contributes to expansion mutations in humans is not entirely clear but likely depends on the repeat type involved. Most studies to date have concentrated on the role that hairpin folding may play in slippage-expansion with DNA polymerase during DNA replication where single-stranded regions are involved.The present study focuses on repeat expansions in double-stranded DNA repair contexts, at strand breaks in the form of simple nicks, and 1-base gaps. Human DNA polymerase β (pol β),1 having no proofreading (3′-exonuclease activity), is a logical choice for study in such contexts, since it has a well established role in DNA repair, notably base excision repair (BER) (11Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R., Gu, H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Cells express pol β independently of the cell cycle (12Mitchell J. Karawya E. Kinsella T. Wilson S. Mutat. Res. 1985; 146: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar) but show tissue specific differences in pol β expression, with particularly high levels of expression occurring in testis (13Intano G.W. McMahan A. Walter R.B. McCarrey J.R. Walter C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During BER, following glycosylase and AP endonuclease activity, human pol β carries out DNA repair synthesis by filling single nucleotide gaps (short patch BER) or by strand displacement to create flaps of several nucleotides (long patch BER) (14Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). As observedin vitro under physiological salt conditions, pol β itself has weak strand displacement DNA synthesis activity (15Wang T.S.-F. Korn D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1782-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Randahl H. Elliott G.C. Linn S. J. Biol.

We have developed a 2-strand system to analyze repeat expansion in a DNA repair context at simple breaks (nicks or 1-base gaps) within double-stranded repeat tracts. Much like a recent study of dinucleotide repeat slippage and expansion by T4 DNA polymerase (22Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31528-31535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we wanted to examine polymerase-catalyzed repeat expansions by slippage at breaks within a repeat tract surrounded by non-repeating sequence.Here we present our results using human pol β to catalyze slippage-expansion at nicks and 1-base gaps within a DNA duplex of CAG/CTG repeats. For comparison we also present data obtained with a prokaryotic repair polymerase without proofreading, an exo− derivative of E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow Fragment (KFexo−), which has a much stronger strand displacement activity than pol β.RESULTSThe double-stranded DNA molecules constructed to explore triplet repeat slippage and expansion with pol β have stable terminal hairpin structures flanking a less stable CAG/CTG triplet repeat duplex containing a strand break (nick or 1-base gap) on each side (Fig.1, A and B). The hairpin structures effectively mimic a long stretch of surrounding, non-repetitive duplex DNA. If the polymerase bound to the strand break has enough strand displacement activity to extend the primer 3′-end into the non-repeating regions of terminal hairpins, the repetitive character of the primer will be destroyed and repeat expansion by slippage will be halted.Our placement of strand breaks internally to the repeat/non-repeat boundary, at a distance of two CAG repeats on one strand and two CTG repeats on the other strand (Fig. 1, A and B), provides a weak (2-triplet) barrier against such termination of slippage by strand displacement into non-repeat sequence. As long as strand displacement is not strong enough to pass this barrier of two triplet repeats, the polymerase may expand triplet repeats by allowing the 3′-end to slip in the “positive” direction as indicated for +1 slippage, i.e. slippage by one triplet to create a 3-base gap (Fig. 1, A and B). However, if strand displacement is strong enough to pass this barrier, the polymerase can only extend the 3′-primer end by continued strand displacement synthesis that opens the hairpin structure and uses the Ha or Hb sequence as template to create a blunt-end product of defined length (e.g. 42 bases added to the CTG-Nick or CAG-Nick strand, corresponding to 30 bases added on template Ha or Hb and 12 on 2 CAG + 2 CTG triplets). Since the 5′-end of one strand is32P-labeled while the other is not, only extension products of the labeled strand are observed as bands by denaturing gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging.Triplet Repeat Expansions Observed With DNA Pol β in Nick ConstructAt 1 and 10 μm dNTP concentration, pol β extends the 3′-end of the radiolabeled CTG-Nick strand to generate a band pattern with a periodicity of exactly three nucleotides,i.e. bases added in 3-base (triplet) steps (Fig.2 A, CTG Nick). The pattern builds in a progressive time-dependent manner, indicating CTG repeat expansion via slippage in steps of one triplet. With increasing reaction time at 10 μm dNTP, each band shows a characteristic rise in intensity to some maximum level, followed by a corresponding fall in intensity, as the molecules slip and are further extended by polymerase into bands of increasing number of bases added. Thus at 10 μm dNTP, bands ranging from 3 bases added (1 triplet) to 102 bases added (34 triplets) are formed as a result of triplet-repeat slippage and polymerase-catalyzed extension over a 32-min period (Fig. 2 A).After increasing dNTP concentration 10-fold, from 10 to 100 μm, we observe a dramatic change in the pol β extension pattern (Fig. 2 A, CTG Nick). The major reaction product is now a termination band at 42 bases added, which rises to a near maximum intensity within 1 min and fails to decrease in intensity with remaining reaction time. The accumulation of band intensity at this point (42 bases added) indicates that the major product is no longer extendable by pol β. Since this product corresponds to the predicted size dictated by the sequence of hairpin ends, we identify it as the blunt-ended product obtained by strand displacement through the 2-triplet barrier (into the non-repeat sequence) starting from the original unslipped state of CTG Nick.Above this band, we also observe less intense ultimately static product bands with additional triplet repeats, corresponding to 42 + 3n bases added, where n = 1, 2, 3, etc. (Fig. 2 A,CTG Nick, 100 μm). As before, the failure of these bands to decrease in intensity suggests that they also contain products that are blunt-ended and no longer extendable by pol β. These bands indicate to us that at this elevated dNTP concentration a substantial fraction of strands still undergo pol β catalyzed slippage-expansion a number of times before the downstream barrier of two triplet repeats is breached by strand displacement synthesis into non-repeat sequence. Determining how a given band below 42 bases added forms within the first 2 min of reaction (strand displacement or slippage expansion) is somewhat confounded by the fact that extension products from strand displacement into non-repeat sequence overlap in size with extension products formed by slippage expansion occurring prior to strand displacement into non-repeat sequence. However, once strand displacement into non-repeat sequence occurs, no further expansion by triplet-repeat slippage is possible. Therefore, molecules that have n triplets added by slippage end up in bands at 42 + 3n bases added, after reaching the blunt-ended state by the addition of 42 bases via strand displacement through the barrier.As seen in Fig. 2 A (CAG Nick), pol β extends the CAG-Nick strand in a similar fashion to the CTG-Nick strand, by catalyzing slippage-expansion at 1–10 μm dNTP concentrations and slippage-expansion largely terminated by strong strand displacement at 100 μm dNTP concentration. However, the slippage-expansion rate of the CAG-Nick strand, by the addition CAG triplets with pol β, is not quite as high as the rate of the CTG-Nick strand by the addition of CTG triplets. Some differences in polymerase pausing on the two opposing strands are also evident.Pol β Catalyzes Slippage-Expansion at Physiological Concentrations of dNTPAt 1–10 μm dNTP concentrations, in our Nick construct (Fig. 2 A), pol β catalyzes expansion by slippage with little or no strand displacement into non-repeat template. These concentrations roughly bracket published estimates of physiological dNTP concentrations in human, except for dTTP whose in vivo estimates are somewhat higher than 10 μm (29Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar); human dNTP concentrations being on average as follows (in μm): n = A (2.4), G (2.7), C (4.5), T (17Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.-J. Kedar P. Yang X.-P. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32411-32414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Pol β catalyzes terminal strand displacement into non-repeat sequence in our Nick construct only at much higher dNTP concentrations,e.g. 100 μm, well outside of the physiological range. Thus, pol β shows a much lower dNTP requirement for slippage-expansion than for terminal strand displacement, when acting on CTG Nick and CAG Nick (Fig. 2 A).Pause Patterns of DNA Pol β Suggest Low Processivity in Slippage-ExpansionAt 10 μm dNTP, during slippage expansion at both CTG Nick and CAG Nick (Fig. 2 A), pol β produces repetitive “pause” bands indicating low processivity,i.e. a tendency to fall off DNA after each insertion. The greatest pausing (most intense pause bands) appears after T insertion during addition of CTG repeats to the CTG-Nick strand (Fig.2 A, left), and after C and A insertions during addition of CAG repeats to the CAG-Nick strand (Fig. 2 A,right). The observation of such pausing suggests slippage-expansion is not simply occurring by slippage and gap filling but also may involve non-processive strand displacement in the repeat region.A simple slippage event in a triplet repeat sequence might be expected to create a 3-base gap as indicated for +1 slippage (Fig.1 A). Pol β has been shown to fill small gaps in non-repeating DNA in a highly processive manner in the presence of a 5′-phosphate group (30Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If there were simply a processive filling of 3-base gaps created by slippage in our system, we would expect a single-band pause pattern occurring at insertion of G after adding 3 nucleotides with G being the last one as dictated by the sequence of the gap, for both CTG-Nick and CAG-Nick strands. The observation of pausing after other insertion events in such gap filling has led us to consider how slippage and gap-filling may be associated with non-processive strand displacement in the repeat region.Extension Reactions of Gap Construct with Pol βThe Gap construct (Fig. 1 B) differs from the Nick construct (Fig.1 A) only by the removal of 3′-terminal G from each of the two strands. The CTG-Nick and CAG-Nick strands with G removed from their 3′-ends are referred to as CTG-Gap and CAG-Gap strands, respectively. In the resultant CTG/CAG duplex formed between the two strands, we expect 1-base gaps as illustrated (Fig. 1 B,unslipped structure).Pol β extends the CTG-Gap strand (Fig. 2 B) in much the same way it extends the CTG-Nick strand (Fig. 2 A). As expected, we see a shift in the gel patterns by 1 base (consistent with the fill-in of the 1-base gap) (Fig. 2 B). Otherwise, we observe pol β catalyzing almost the same slippage-expansion process at lower dNTP concentrations (1 and 10 μm) and only a slightly different terminal strand displacement reaction at higher dNTP concentration (Fig. 2 B).At 100 μm dNTP, in addition to pol β extending the unslipped structure via terminal strand displacement to form the 43 bases-added product (corresponding to the 42 bases-added product formed in the Nick construct), we see a strand displacement product at 40 bases added as well (Fig. 2 B). The intense band at 40 bases added is consistent with extension of a 3′-primer end that has been slipped in the “negative” direction to create a 5′-flap of 2 bases, as illustrated for −1 slippage (Fig. 1 B, top). We note that the 40 bases-added band appears even more intense than the 43 bases-added band, indicating that the negatively slipped state is energetically more favorable than the unslipped state.DNA pol β Shows More Strand Displacement Activity at the CAG Gap at All dNTP ConcentrationsA marked difference between pol β extension of the CAG-Nick and CAG-Gap strands is observed in the 10 μm dNTP reaction (Fig. 2 B). At 10 μm dNTP, pol β shows much more strand displacement activity at the 3′-end of the CAG Gap compared with CAG Nick and CTG Nick (Fig. 2 A) and to CTG Gap (Fig. 2 B). In the CAG Gap case (Fig. 2 B, right), pol β extends 3′-primer ends by strand displacement to a blunt-end state not only from the unslipped and −1 slipped states, but also from the −2 slipped state to yield a termination band at 37 bases added (Fig.2 B, right). The 40 bases-added band appears most intense, with the 37 bases-added band being about half as intense, comparable to the intensity of the 43 bases-added band. The greater intensity of bands from negatively slipped primer ends again indicates that negatively slipped states are energetically more favorable than the unslipped state in the gap context.Strong Strand Displacement by KFexo− Prevents Slippage-ExpansionIn contrast to our results with pol β, extension of the Nick and Gap constructs by KFexo−presents a much simpler result, extremely rapid strand displacement into non-repeat sequence with little or no expansion of triplet repeats (Fig. 3, A and B). Unlike pol β (Fig. 2, A and B), where triplet repeat expansions progress with time at dNTP concentrations up to 10 μm and are only inhibited by strand displacement into non-repeat sequence at high dNTP (100 μm), KFexo− shows immediate strand displacement into non-repeat sequence at all dNTP concentrations used (Fig. 3, A andB, dNTP = 0.2, 2, and 20 μm). Even at 0.2 μm dNTP, a limiting substrate condition, the extension reaction with KFexo− is almost entirely by strand displacement into non-repeat sequence, yielding some complete termination product within 0.5 min, e.g. 42 bases added (Fig. 3 A, CTG Nick); 40 and 43 bases added (Fig.3 B, CTG Gap).When given 2 μm dNTP or higher (20 μm), KFexo− extends all strands almost exclusively in a terminal strand displacement mode, to yield prominent termination bands like those seen with pol β at much higher (100 μm) dNTP (Fig. 2, A and B). In the cases of CTG-Nick and CAG-Nick with KFexo− (Fig. 3 A), within 15 s of reaction, almost all the products are in the termination band at exactly 42 bases added and there is very little change after this time. When extending CTG-Gap (Fig. 3 B, left), KFexo− produces strong termination bands at 43 and 40 bases added (with the 40 bases-added band being most intense). When extending CAG-Gap (Fig. 3 B, right), KFexo− produces termination bands at 43, 40, and 37 bases added (again with 40 bases-added band being most intense and all bands reaching their maximum intensity within 0.5 min). The strand displacement by KFexo− not only occurs much more quickly than with pol β but also at 10–100-fold lower enzyme and dNTP concentrations.Although KFexo− extends a majority of strands immediately by strand displacement into non-repeat sequence, some strands still undergo limited slippage-expansion as evidenced by bands forming in a triplet periodicity above the major strand displacement products. However, the faintness of these upper bands in KFexo−reactions leaves little signal to assign to slippage-expansion products including fill-in of gapped molecules. Thus, it is evident that only a small percentage of molecules could initially be in slipped states with small gaps of 1 or 2 triplets and essentially none could have larger gaps.Negatively Slipped 3′-Primer Ends Occur Specifically in the Gap ConstructIn Figs. 2 and 3, only the Gap construct shows terminal strand displacement products smaller than expected from the unslipped state (42 or 43 bases added for Nick and Gap, respectively). We expect these shorter termination products (40 or 37 bases added, Fig.2 B) to form by extension of 3′-ends that have displaced one or two 5′-downstream repeat units as illustrated for −1 slippage (Fig.1 B). In the Gap construct, such displacement of downstream repeats by −1 and −2 slippage yields small 2 or 5 base flaps at the 5′-end. We term the downstream realignment of repeat units as “negative” slippage as opposed to “positive” slippage that occurs in the opposite direction away from 5′-sequence.Polymerase Extensions of CTG Strands in the Absence of dATP and CAG Strands in the Absence of dTTPIn designing our dual hairpin molecules (Fig. 1, A and B), we specifically anticipated the possibility that slippage and extension of triplet repeats at a given 3′-primer end of one strand could affect the expansion rate at the 3′-primer end of the other strand. To address the issue we performed extension reactions in the absence of dATP (−dATP) when using radiolabeled CTG-Nick or CTG-Gap strands and in the absence of dTTP (−dTTP) when using radiolabeled CAG-Nick or CAG-Gap strands (Fig. 4). In the absence of the appropriate nucleotide, polymerase can only add triplet repeats to the radiolabeled strand and synthesis by strand displacement is limited to the triplet repeat region. While allowing strand displacement into the 2 downstream triplet repeats, strand displacement into non-repeat sequence is inhibited, because the missing nucleotide is required to correctly cross the repeat/non-repeat boundary in each case (Fig. 1, Aand B). The results shown for pol β (Fig. 4 A) were obtained with 10 μm concentrations of each of the three dNTPs indicated; those shown for KFexo− (Fig.4 B), with 5 μm concentrations.Further Evidence of Limited Displacement-assisted Repeat ExpansionBy withholding one dNTP to limit strand displacement to the repeat region, we observe dramatic changes in the results with KFexo− (Figs. 4 B versus 3) but relatively small changes in the results with pol β (Figs.4 A versus 2), as expected. In stark contrast to the static patterns produced by strand displacement in the presence of all four dNTPs (Fig. 3), KFexo− now produces a dynamic slippage expansion pattern that builds over time (Fig. 4 B) much like the patterns produced by pol β at 10 μm dNTP concentration (Figs. 2 and 4 A). The ability of KFexo− to expand triplet repeats when strand displacement is limited to within the repeat tract lends credence to the idea that a limited strand displacement activity is capable of assisting slippage-expansion.While expanding triplet repeats in the absence of one dNTP, KFexo− shows a tendency to strand displace into non-repeat template sequence by misinsertion with some probability. Misinsertion at the first non-repeat template base is to be expected in the absence of the correct dNTP. Such misinsertion converts some fraction of each major triplet repeat expansion product into a static termination band longer by 1 nucleotide in each Nick and Gap case (Fig. 4 B). The occurrence of prominent misinsertion only after major triplet pause bands indicates that KFexo− catalyzes slippage-expansion by strand displacement up to the repeat/non-repeat boundary rather than by filling in gapped molecules. The observation provides further evidence that strand displacement is involved in the slippage-expansion process.CTG Strands Slip and Expand Independently of Extension and Slippage Realignment of CAG 3′-Primer EndsExtensions of CTG-Nick and CTG-Gap strands by pol β −dATP show a remarkable degree of consistency with each other and in particular with extension in the presence of all four dNTPs (Figs. 2 and 4 A). Therefore, in the absence of a growing CAG-Nick or CAG-Gap strand, CTG-Nick and CTG-Gap strands are slipping and being extended by pol β independent of extension from the CAG strand. Additionally, the CTG-Gap strand slips and expands in the presence of pol β and 10 μm of all four dNTP, despite a pronounced strand displacement of the CAG-Gap strand into non-repeat sequence that prevents 3′-primer realignment (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, CTG strands may slip and expand independently of slippage realignment at the CAG 3′-primer ends as well.DISCUSSIONWe find simple strand breaks in the form of nicks or 1-base gaps within CTG/CAG repeat tracts are sufficient to cause reiterative repeat expansion in the presence of human DNA pol β at physiological dNTP concentrations. At 10 μm or less of each dNTP, the strand displacement activity of pol β is sufficiently low to prevent extension of 3′-primer ends through a downstream barrier of 2 repeat units and into surrounding non-repeat template. The inability of the weak strand displacement activity to extend the 3′-primer end beyond the repeat template into non-repeat template preserves the repeat motif of the primer and explains the continuation of slippage-expansion with time.A recent study of T4 DNA polymerase and dinucleotide repeat stability highlighted the need for a barrier to replication into surrounding non-repeat sequence for microsatellite instability to occur (22Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31528-31535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In that study, proofreading 3′-exonuclease activity and a downstream oligonucleotide enabled the 3′-primer end to remain within the repeat tract sufficiently long to allow for primer misalignment and T4 polymerase extension to catalyze expansion. Here we observe how limited strand displacement activity in the complete absence of exonuclease activity may achieve similar results in causing microsatellite instability. Others have also observed the inverse relationship between strand displacement and slippage (31Canceill D. Viguera E. Ehrlich S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27481-27490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Pausing by pol β at particular bands during slippage-expansion has led us to suggest how limited strand displacement, accompanied by enzyme dissociation in the repeat region, facilitates the slippage process required for expansion (Fig. 5). We propose that strand displacement in the repeat region creates 5′-flaps that by exchanging with 3′-flaps promotes the kind of slippage required for repeat expansion. Such exchange of 5′- and 3′-flaps has previously been suggested to mediate both polymerase as wells as ligase-catalyzed repeat instability (9Henricksen L.A. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A.

On the left (indicated by vertical arrows), polymerase-catalyzed 5′-end displacement occurs in steps of single nucleotide insertion creating 5′-flaps that rearrange to form 3′-flaps (shown in equilibrium). The 3′-flaps act as intermediates to promote 3′-slippage in steps of triplet repeats, enabling repeat expansion by gap-filling (indicated on the right by vertical arrows). In our construct (Fig. 1), the non-repeat sequence (Hb or Ha) placed next to the short 5′-end repeat sequence (5′-CTGCTG or 5′-CAGCAG) inhibits 5′-slippage of the kind proposed in ligation-mediated expansions (7Gordenin D.A.

Compared with mitochondria from transfected yeast, StUCP is present at very low levels in intact potato mitochondrial membranes (at least thirty times lower) as shown by immunodetection with anti-UCP1 antibodies. Under conditions that ruled out undesirable effects of nucleotides and free fatty acids on uncoupling activity measurement in plant mitochondria, the linoleic acid-induced depolarization in potato mitochondria was insensitive to the nucleotides ATP, GTP, or GDP. In addition, sensitivity to linoleic acid was similar in potato and in control yeast mitochondria, suggesting that uncoupling occurring in potato mitochondria was because of a UCP-independent proton diffusion process. By contrast, yeast mitochondria expressing StUCP exhibited a higher sensitivity to free fatty acids than those from the control yeast and especially a marked proton conductance in the presence of low amounts of linoleic acid. However, this fatty acid-induced uncoupling was also insensitive to nucleotides. Altogether, these results suggest that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and heat production cannot be the dominant feature of StUCP expressed in native potato tissues.

Indeed, a protein fraction containing a purine nucleotide-sensitive, free fatty acid-activated uncoupling activity, called PUMP, has been isolated from potato tuber mitochondria and characterized after reconstitution in proteoliposomes (1Vercesi A.E.

In addition, various cDNAs coding for putative UCPs were identified in plants such as potato, Arabidopsis thaliana, and skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus), a thermogenic plant from the Aracea family (3Laloi M.

At the mitochondrial level, it has been proposed that ATP, GTP, or GDP were absolutely required to get a fully coupled state in potato tuber mitochondria oxidizing succinate (1Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24-25Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Jezek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol.

Similarly, it has been suggested that the fatty acid-induced uncoupling in wheat mitochondria was sensitive to purine nucleotides (11Pastore D. Fratianni A., Di Pede S. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this paper, we sought to characterize better the properties of plant UCP-like protein by comparing the fatty acid-dependent uncoupling capacity of either native UCP present in intact potato mitochondria or StUCP expressed at a high level in yeast mitochondria. It is shown that StUCP increases the proton conductance in yeast expressing StUCP but not in native mitochondrial membranes in which the protein is present at a too low level. Similarities in behavior and properties between StUCP expressed in yeast and PUMP are discussed. Chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L., cv Bintje) were from a local producer and kept at 4 °C at least for 1 week before use. Potato tuber mitochondria were isolated using a classical procedure and purified on Percoll density gradient containing 0.1% BSA (12Rustin P. Moreau F. Lance C. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 457-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing in a medium containing 300 mm mannitol, 10 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% BSA (fatty acid-free), they were resuspended in a minimum volume of the above medium with or without 0.01% BSA. Yeast were grown at 30 °C in liquid basal medium (1.7% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% CSM-urea, 0.1% KH2PO4, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, 40 mg/liter adenine, pH 4.5, 2% lactate, 0.1% glucose) until 4–5-Aunits. The culture was then diluted to a final absorbance of 0.3 units and either grown overnight (control cells) before harvesting or grown for 2 h before inducing UCP expression by adding 2% galactose to the medium and then growing overnight before harvesting. Spheroplasts were obtained from 10 g of yeast cells by digestion in the presence of 1.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 50 mg of Zymolase in 100 ml of digestion buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) at 30 °C. Zymolase was eliminated by two washes in digestion buffer and the final pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of mitochondria buffer (0.6m sorbitol, 4 mm EGTA, 75 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 0.2% BSA). Spheroplasts were then gently lysed by mechanical shearing and mitochondria were purified by differential centrifugations and washed in mitochondria buffer containing only 0.01% BSA (13Arechaga I.

Membrane potential was measured continuously and simultaneously to oxygen consumption using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+)-sensitive electrode in the presence of 4 μm TPP+ and a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 20 °C (14Caiveau O. Fortune D. Cantrel C. Zachowski A. Moreau F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5788-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The membrane potential values were calculated using the equation of Kamo et al.(15Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) without corrections for cation binding and assuming a mitochondrial volume of 1 μl/mg of protein. Air-saturated electrode medium contained: 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mmphosphate buffer, 10 mm MOPS, 30 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, for potato mitochondria and 0.65 m mannitol, 20 mm MOPS, 0.5 mmEGTA, 10 mm K2HPO4, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8, in the case of yeast mitochondria (16Rial E.

Routinely, 2 μm oligomycin, 6 μm carboxyatractiloside and nigericin (400 ng/mg of protein) were added to the medium if not indicated otherwise, and 5 mm succinate (in the presence of 10 μmrotenone) or 1 mm external NADH were used as substrate. For potato mitochondria, measurements were performed in the absence or presence of BSA (0.01 or 0.1%). Unless otherwise indicated, measurements on yeast mitochondria were carried out in the presence of 0.01% BSA (1.6 μm) as described in Ref. 16Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S.

Proton conductance curves were determined as the plots of oxidation ratesversus membrane potential in the resting state (with either 5 mm succinate or 1 mm NADH as substrate) using increasing concentrations of cyanide (ranging between 0 and 1 mm) to progressively inhibit the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial membrane potential changes were separately monitored at 20 °C with 5 μm safranine O by measuring fluorescence at 586 nm when excited at 495 nm (slit widths set at 5 nm) on a PerkinElmer fluorimeter. The standard medium (2 ml) contained: 0.25 mg of mitochondria, 0.125 m sucrose, 65 mm KCl, 0.33 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mmHepes, pH 7.2 (15Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Routinely, 2 μm oligomycin, 6 μm carboxyatractyloside and nigericin (400 ng/mg of protein) were added. The StUCP coding sequence was introduced into recombinant expression vectors previously used for UCP1 (13Arechaga I. Raimbault S. Prieto S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Zaragoza P. Miroux B. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 693-700Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and UCP2 (17Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwitt R. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Integrity of all expression vectors was checked by PCR using specific StUCPprimers and diploid yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain W303 was transformed with these modified vectors using the thermal shock method described by Chen et al. (18Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Expression of StUCP in mitochondrial membranes was checked by Western blot analysis using anti-UCP1 antibodies (19Miroux B. Casteilla L. Klaus S. Raimbault S. Grandin S. Clément J.M. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13603-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoretic separation on 11% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE), proteins were electrotransferred for 30 min at 135 mA on a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blot semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) system and Towbin transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3). Detection of plant UCP was performed with affinity purified anti-UCP1 antibodies, referred to as 375.5 (19Miroux B. Casteilla L. Klaus S. Raimbault S. Grandin S. Clément J.M. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13603-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 4000-fold and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-sheep IgGs as secondary antibodies according to the manufacturers recommendations for the Western blot chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance Kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantification was performed with ImageQuant software. To characterize UCP in potato tuber mitochondria, we used an antibody raised against mammalian UCP1 that was first tested for its ability to recognize specifically the 32-kDa potato UCP (StUCP) expressed in yeast. Fig. 1 Ashows a specific hybridization with mitochondria from yeasts that express the StUCP cDNA (lane 1), or from control yeasts that were not induced for StUCP (lane 2). The hybridized band exhibited a lower molecular weight (32,000) than mammalian UCP1 (lane 3). By contrast, control yeast showed a total absence of signal under the same conditions, indicating that the antibodies did not recognize any of the major components of the membrane including other members of the mitochondrial carrier family (2Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). To assess further the antibody specificity for StUCP, competitive hybridization was performed using the purified UCP1 protein as competitor (Fig. 1 B): a progressive extinction occurred with increasing amounts of competitor. The anti-UCP1 antibodies used in this study recognized A. thaliana UCP (AtUCP1) expressed in yeast as well, indicating that they are good tools for UCP detection in plants (data not shown). With potato mitochondria, a faint but significant hybridization with anti-UCP1 antibodies was obtained when 40 μg of total mitochondrial protein were loaded (Fig. 1C, lane 4), indicating the presence of UCP-like protein in potato mitochondria as reported in the literature (20Jezek P. Engstova H. Zackova A.E. Vercesi A.E. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, 5 μg of mitochondrial protein from yeast expressing StUCP (lane 2) were sufficient to show an important signal, whereas control yeast showed a total absence of detection under these conditions (lanes 3 and 6). This result clearly indicates the presence of a very low level of StUCP protein in potato tuber mitochondria (about 30 times less than in yeast expressing StUCP). UCP-like protein found in potato mitochondria has been supposed to function similarly to the uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue in mediating a fatty acid-dependent proton leak sensitive to nucleotides (especially ATP) (8Jezek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C. Sluse F.E.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, ATP exerts several effects on mitochondria oxidizing succinate in the resting state: activation/deactivation of succinate dehydrogenase (21Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4763-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,22Moore A.L. Dry I.B. Wiskich J.T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), activation of F0F1-ATPase (23Valerio M. Diolez P. Haraux F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of ATP on nonphosphorylating respiration rate, membrane potential, and proton conductance in potato mitochondria using two different respiratory substrates (succinate and external NADH) in the presence of inhibitors of ATP synthase and ADP/ATP carrier (oligomycin and atractyloside, respectively). Fig.2 shows that addition of 1 mmATP to mitochondria (depleted in free fatty acids) oxidizing succinate in state 4 produced an increase of about 5 mV in membrane potential associated with an increase of oxidation rate (Fig. 2 A, trace 1). By contrast, the value of membrane potential triggered by addition of external NADH immediately reached the same value as that obtained with succinate + ATP, and subsequent addition of 1 mm ATP had no effect on membrane potential. Similar effects were obtained with ATP concentrations ranging between 200 μm and 2 mm (data not shown). These data indicate that ATP was not required to obtain fully coupled mitochondria but rather that ATP led to succinate dehydrogenase activation. When experiments were carried out in the absence of BSA in the respiration medium, values of membrane potential in the resting state were lower because of the presence of endogenous free fatty acids, as evidenced by the increase in membrane potential after addition of BSA (Fig. 2 B, traces 1 and 2). However, in the absence of BSA, the potential reached with external NADH was higher than with succinate and the subsequent addition of 1 mm ATP had no effect on membrane potential, whereas it produced an increase of about 10 mV in the value of membrane potential generated by succinate oxidation, thus equalizing ΔΨ in both situations. It has to be emphasized that the ATP-dependent repolarization of mitochondria respiring succinate was associated with an increase in the oxidation rate (between 30 and 40%) (Fig. 2, A and B, traces 1). Further determinations of proton conductance curves (Fig. 2 C) in potato mitochondria containing endogenous free fatty acid showed that ATP increased both succinate oxidation and membrane potential. This provides evidence that ATP increased the rate of proton flux through the respiratory chain without changing the rate of proton backflow and the proton conductance of mitochondria, whatever the membrane potential between 220 and 140 mV (Fig. 2 C). By contrast, as expected, removal of endogenous free fatty acids by BSA led to a shift of the conductance curve toward higher values of membrane potential. Taken together, these results suggest that the ATP-induced change in succinate oxidation was not compatible with increased coupling in potato mitochondria. If plant uncoupling protein had to function as the uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue, its activity should be stimulated by addition of exogenous free fatty acids and inhibited by nucleotides such as ATP, GTP, or GDP (8Jezek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C. Sluse F.E.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, we have studied the linoleic acid-induced uncoupling activity in potato mitochondria in the nonphosphorylating state. Either succinate or external NADH was used as respiratory substrate and safranine as membrane potential probe (as in Refs. 10Nantes I.L. Fagian M.M. Catisti R. Arruda P. Maia I.G. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Pastore D. Fratianni A., Di Pede S. Passarella S.

Biomembr. 1999; 31: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); alternatively a TPP+ electrode coupled with a simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption gave direct access to flux-force relationships. It should be mentioned that these methods exhibit different response curves toward changes in membrane potential (15Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 26Akerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the two methods provided slightly different results. Safranine fluorescence measurements, presented in Fig. 3, A andB, indicated that the addition of 10 μm LA to mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein) oxidizing either succinate or external NADH caused an immediate release of safranine (increase of fluorescence) that was followed by a slow re-uptake of the probe (decrease of fluorescence). This effect was totally abolished in the presence of nigericin (an ionophore that exchanges H+ and K+), suggesting that safranine re-uptake was due either to a change in transmembrane ΔpH and/or to mitochondrial swelling triggered by LA itself as previously evidenced (8Jezek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because this effect was also detectable with the TPP+ electrode, nigericin was included in all further experiments (Fig. 3, C andD). To test UCP involvement in the LA-induced depolarization, ATP, GTP, or GDP were added to mitochondria to inhibit the UCP-dependent proton leak. Whatever the substrate (succinate or NADH), GTP (1 mm) (or GDP, data not shown) did not exhibit a re-coupling effect (Fig. 3, C andD). Only ATP was able to repolarize mitochondria when succinate was present and this repolarization was associated with an increase in oxidation rate (Fig. 3, A and C). With external NADH, no nucleotide-dependent repolarization of mitochondria could be detected (Fig. 3, B andD). Thus, either StUCP was involved in the LA-induced depolarization of potato mitochondria as previously suggested (8Jezek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Nantes I.L. Fagian M.M. Catisti R. Arruda P. Maia I.G. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but it had to be insensitive to nucleotides, or this uncoupling is UCP-independent and unspecific. To elucidate the role of plant UCP in uncoupling of potato mitochondria, StUCP was expressed at a high level in yeast and the effects of LA and nucleotides on isolated mitochondria respiring on external NADH in the nonphosphorylating state were studied. Experiments carried out in the absence of exogenous free fatty acid (in the presence of 16 μm BSA) showed that membrane potential and respiratory rate were similar in yeast mitochondria expressing StUCP and controls (212 ± 2 and 216 ± 2 mV for ΔΨ, respectively, and 193 ± 20 and 154 ± 15 nmol of O2·min−1·mg−1 protein for respiration, respectively). As a consequence, the proton conductance in the resting state (assuming an H+/O2 ratio of 12 for external NADH oxidation) was comparable in the two cases (10.9 ± 0.75 and 8.7 ± 0.35 nmol H+·min−1·mg−1·protein mV−1). Uncoupling of yeast mitochondria by exogenous free fatty acid under the conditions described in Ref. 16Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar is shown in Fig4. For LA concentrations ranging between 2 and 10 μm (corresponding to a molar LA:albumin ratio between 1.2 and 6), the oxidation rate was significantly enhanced in StUCP mitochondria while no changes occurred in control yeast or in potato mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). In the same range of LA concentrations, a progressive depolarization occurred in StUCP mitochondria while no or little change was found in control yeast or potato mitochondria (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, for higher LA concentrations, oxidation rates increased in parallel in the three categories of mitochondria. Because in control yeast mitochondria, the LA-dependent respiration and depolarization reflected a UCP-independent uncoupling process, we can thus assume that StUCP expressed in yeast was responsible for an uncoupling that required the lowest LA concentrations. Under these conditions, a maximal UCP-dependent uncoupling corresponding to a depolarization of about 35 mV and enhancement in oxidation rate of ∼40% corresponding to 80 nmol·min−1·mg−1 protein was obtained in the presence of about 10 μm LA. To assess the effect of nucleotides on LA-induced activity of plant uncoupling protein expressed in yeast, the flux-force relationships were established in the presence of 7.5 μm LA (molar ratio LA:albumin of 4.5) to activate StUCP and in the presence or absence of nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 4 C, respiration and membrane potential were slightly inhibited by ATP, GTP, or GDP (1 mm), suggesting that nucleotides affected the respiration without directly affecting proton leaks. Indeed, proton conductance curves established in the presence of nucleotides clearly showed that changes in ΔΨ followed changes in respiration and that the relationships between oxidation rate and membrane potential were identical (same conductance curves). By contrast, removal of added LA by 0.1% BSA led to a shift of proton conductance curve toward higher values of membrane potential (i.e. lower values of proton conductance). This result suggests that StUCP expressed in yeast mediated proton leak and mitochondrial uncoupling, which were insensitive to nucleotides. To characterize the functional aspects of a plant uncoupling protein (StUCP), the gene encoding this protein was expressed inS. cerevisiae and the level of peptide found in the mitochondria was probed using antimammalian UCP1 antibodies. In the yeast system, the level of expression of UCP was similar between StUCP and UCP1. Based on data reported for UCP1 (27Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11871-11875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of StUCP is about 10% of the total mitochondrial protein. We showed that StUCP yeast mitochondria exhibited a diminished resting potential and a high sensitivity to uncoupling by LA. The StUCP-dependent uncoupling activity measured in yeast (expressed as LA-stimulated oxidation rate) was similar in mitochondria from yeast expressing StUCP (this work) and mammalian UCP2 (16Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), namely about 80 nmol of O2·min−1·mg−1 protein or 1 μmol of H+·min−1·mg−1protein, assuming a H+/O2 ratio of 12 for external NADH oxidation. Because StUCP represented at most 10% of the total mitochondrial protein, the minimal proton transport capacity of StUCP could be estimated as ∼10 μmol of H+·min−1·mg−1 UCP protein, under these conditions. With the exception of UCP1 (28Echtay K.S. Liu Q. Caskey T. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Bienengraber M. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this value is consistent with those reported for all mammalian UCPs (from 8 to 30 μmol of H+·min−1·mg−1 UCP protein) when expressed in E. coli and reconstituted in proteoliposomes (7Borecky J. Maia I.G. Costa A.D.T. Jezek P. Chaimovich H. de Andrade P.B.M. Vercesi A.E. Arruda P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Jaburek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E.

StUCP protonophoric activity in yeast mitochondria is also in agreement with the ability of plant UCP reconstituted in proteoliposomes to collapse the proton gradient, as evidenced with AtUCP1 expressed in E. coli (7Borecky J. Maia I.G. Costa A.D.T. Jezek P. Chaimovich H. de Andrade P.B.M. Vercesi A.E. Arruda P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or with the PUMP fraction isolated from potato mitochondria (1Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24-25Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Pedron e Silva M.A. Moreau F. Zachowski A. Mesneau A. Roussaux J. Plant Sci. 1999; 143: 27-33Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, in the case of PUMP it is difficult to make a precise comparison because the amino acid sequence of PUMP is still unknown. In our experiments we assayed the uncoupling activity of the StUCP peptide in recombinant yeast, whereas Verseci et al. (1Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24-25Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar) found a protonophoric activity after reconstitution in proteoliposomes of a hydroxyapatite column fraction. Therefore it is unclear whether both uncoupling activities are related to the same protein, i.e.whether StUCP and PUMP are the same peptide. If they are, then the nucleotide-binding properties of StUCP are somehow different in liposomes and in yeast mitochondria. StUCP would be inhibited by nucleotides in liposomes but not in yeast mitochondria. The protein contains the sequence motifs for nucleotide sensitivity (5Watanabe A. Nakazono N. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A.

Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and a low nucleotide sensitivity (inhibition constant between 0.8 and 1.7 mm) was found for AtUCP1 reconstituted from E. coli (7Borecky J. Maia I.G. Costa A.D.T. Jezek P. Chaimovich H. de Andrade P.B.M. Vercesi A.E. Arruda P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As proposed for mammalian UCP2 or UCP3 (16Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Echtay K.S. Liu Q. Caskey T. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Bienengraber M. Klingenberg M.

Acta. 2001; 1504: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), potato UCP might undergo re-organization during its importation to the mitochondrial inner membrane and to the liposomes, leading or not to nucleotide sensitivity. Finally, our results suggest that StUCP operates as a real uncoupling protein when it is expressed in large amounts but it appears that the uncoupling activities of StUCP found in liposomes or yeast mitochondria are probably not physiologically relevant. Under appropriate conditions (namely, external NADH as respiratory substrate in the presence of nigericin), free fatty acid-depleted potato mitochondria were fully coupled in the absence of nucleotides. Surprisingly, both potato tuber and control yeast mitochondria were equally poorly sensitive to LA. In addition, nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and GDP) had no effect on LA-induced uncoupling of potato mitochondria. Therefore, the low amount of StUCP present in vivo (30 times less compared with its expression level in yeast) is not sufficient to trigger the uncoupling activity observed in recombinant systems. Indeed, based on the minimal proton capacity of StUCP measured in yeast (see above), the maximal proton backflow it induced in potato mitochondria would be ∼0.03 μmol of H+·min−1·mg−1 of total mitochondrial protein (equivalent to an increase in uncoupled respiration of 2.5 nmol of O2·min−1·mg−1 protein), a value not detectable experimentally. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that StUCP is expressed in few cells but at a high level. This should be further investigated by detection of StUCP in situ. Besides potato tuber, we tested several plant tissues, including potato flower and cauliflower buds, soybean and rapeseed hypocotyls, andA. thaliana culture cells, and in all cases, UCP-like polypeptides were detected as very minor components (data not shown). In mitochondria isolated from climacteric fruits, a plant-like UCP has been observed and is increased during the respiratory crisis and senescence process (25Costa A.D.T. Nantes I.L. Jezek P.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1619-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that for plant UCPs, as for mammalian UCP2 and UCP3, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and heat production are not the dominant features. A role in preventing reactive oxygen species production has been proposed (24Kowaltowski A.J. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and was recently demonstrated for UCP2 and UCP3 using knockout mice (35Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S.

It has also been suggested that reactive oxygen species could directly activate the UCPs (37Echtay K.S. Roussel D., St- Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C.

However, such a reactive oxygen species that induced mild uncoupling has not been confirmed for UCP2 (38Couplan E. Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Alves-Guerra M.C. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. J. Biol.

Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Google Scholar). PDZ domain containing proteins have been shown to play important roles in diverse cellular processes including receptor/ion channel clustering, signaling complex assembly, and protein targeting (2Craven S.E.

A typical PDZ domain contains ∼90 amino acid residues folded into a compact globular structure comprising a six-stranded β-barrel flanked by two α-helices (5Morais Cabral J.H. Petosa C.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Google Scholar). The majority of PDZ domain-mediated interactions involves the binding of short peptide fragments located at the extreme carboxyl termini of target proteins to grooves formed by the second α-helix (αB) and the second β-strand (βB) of the PDZ domains (6Doyle D.A.

Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 417-421Google Scholar). The carboxyl peptide augments the βB strand in an anti-parallel fashion. Amino acid residues at the 0 and −2 positions of the carboxyl peptide play dominant roles in the peptide binding to a cognate PDZ domain, although residues at the −1 and −3 positions and those at further upstream positions also contribute to the binding (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Google Scholar). In addition to binding to carboxyl peptides, PDZ domains can also use the αB/βB-target-binding groove to interact with internal short peptide fragments with defined structures (9Tochio H. Zhang Q.

Glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) contains seven PDZ domains and interacts through PDZ4 and PDZ5 with the COOH-terminal “ESVKI” sequence of the GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA receptors (13Dong H.

GRIP1 has several closely related gene products, GRIP2 and AMPA receptor binding protein (ABP), and they are all able to bind to AMPA receptors (15Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G.

Genetic studies have shown thatGRIP1 −/− mice are embryonic lethal, and the mutant embryos develop abnormalities in the dermo-epidermal junction (20Bladt F. Tafuri A. Gelkop S. Langille L. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6816-6821Google Scholar). GRIP1 additionally interacts through its PDZ7 with GRASP-1, a Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that regulates the synaptic distribution of AMPA receptors (21Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Google Scholar). The interaction between GRIP1 PDZ7 and GRASP-1 is rather unusual, as GRASP-1 does not contain obvious PDZ-interacting sequence at its carboxyl terminus. Biochemical analysis has indicated that a 100-residue fragment located at the COOH-terminal end of GRASP-1 is responsible for the interaction of the protein with GRIP1 (21Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Google Scholar). The solution structure of the PDZ7 of GRIP1 determined in this study shows that the conventional target-binding groove formed by the αB helix and the βB strand adopts a closed conformation that is not likely to be capable of interacting with carboxyl peptides. Unexpectedly, GRIP1 PDZ7 contains a solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface formed by the βE strand, the αB helix, and the loop connecting the two secondary structural elements. We show that GRIP1 PDZ7 interacts with GRASP-1 via this hydrophobic surface. The data presented in this study uncover a novel mode of PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interaction. The seventh PDZ domain of rat GRIP1 (amino acid residues 980–1070) and the COOH-terminal 100-residue fragment of rat GRASP-1 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the respective full-length cDNAs of the proteins with specific primers. The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into a modified version of pET32a (Novagen) in which the DNA sequences encoding the S-tag and thioredoxin were removed. The resulting recombinant plasmid harboring the respective target genes were individually transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cells for large scale protein productions. Uniformly 15N- and15N/13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 minimal medium using15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and13C6-glucose (1 g/liter) as stable isotope sources. Recombinant GRIP1 PDZ7 and GRASP-1 fragment were purified by a combination of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant proteins contained an NH2-terminal His tag carried over from the cloning vector. Four NMR samples were prepared for structural determination of GRIP1 PDZ7 with a protein concentration of ∼1.0 mm (unlabeled PDZ7 in 99.9% D2O,15N-labeled protein in 90% H2O/10% D2O, two 15N/13C-labeled samples in 99.9% D2O and in 90% H2O/10% D2O). The protein was dissolved in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 (direct meter reading). The15N-labeled sample in 90% H2O/10% D2O was also used for backbone relaxation data measurements. All of the NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Varian Inova 500 and 750 spectrometers equipped with 5 mm z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes. NMR spectra were processed with the nmrPipe software package (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Sequential backbone resonance assignments of the protein were obtained by standard heteronuclear correlation experiments including HNCO, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH and confirmed by a three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY experiment (24Bax A.

The coordinates of the structures of GRIP1 PDZ7 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1M5Z), and the chemical shift assignments of PDZ7 have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number 5499). To investigate the mechanism of the interaction between GRIP1 and GRASP-1, we determined the three-dimensional structure of GRIP1 PDZ7 by NMR spectroscopy. A total of 1826 experimentally derived distance and torsion angle restraints allowed us to determine the three-dimensional structure of PDZ7 with high precision (Table I). Fig.1 A shows a stereoview of the best-fit superposition of a family of 20 structures of PDZ7. As expected, PDZ7 adopts a typical PDZ domain conformation consisting of six β-strands (from βA to βF) and two α-helices (αA and αB) (Fig. 1 B).

Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence analysis reveals that PDZ7 from the GRIP family proteins (GRIP1/2 and ABP) have very high sequence identities with one another. The amino acid sequence of PDZ7 is also highly conserved throughout the evolution (Fig.2). In contrast, the rest of PDZ domains in the data base have rather limited amino acid sequence identities with that of PDZ7 (the PDZ1 of Calliphora vicinaInaD has the highest sequence identity with GRIP1 PDZ7 of 37%). We further note that the amino acid residue in the first residue of the αB helix (αB1) of GRIP PDZ7 is an absolutely conserved Cys residue (Cys-1048). A data base search revealed that no other known PDZ domains contain a Cys residue in the αB1 position (1Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Google Scholar). The amino acid residue in the αB1 position is known to play a critical role in recognizing the −2 residue in target carboxyl peptides (6Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Google Scholar, 10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Google Scholar). We analyzed the structural features of this residue as well as the αB/βB-groove in detail, hoping to gain insight into the potential target-binding mechanism of this PDZ domain. Fig.3 A compares the conformation of the αB/βB-grooves of PDZ7 and PSD-95 PDZ2. The side chain of Cys-1048 in GRIP1 PDZ7 is packed with hydrophobic residues from both αB and βB (see an example of NOE contacts between Cys-1048 β-protons and side chains of Val-1004, Val-1013, and Val-1052 in Fig.4 A). Because of the relatively small size of Cys-1048, the NH2-terminal end of αB in PDZ7 is slightly closer to βB with respect to the αB helix in PSD-95 PDZ2. In addition, the whole αB-helix rotates ∼18° anti-clockwise toward βB (Fig. 3 A), resulting in a significantly smaller αB/βB-groove. The size of the αB/βB-groove in PDZ7 is not likely to accommodate a target carboxyl peptide, which is supposed to assume a β-strand conformation when binding to the PDZ domain. Additionally, the conformation of the carboxyl group-binding pocket of PDZ7 is not suited to interact with negatively charged carboxyl groups in the target peptides. The βA/βB-loop of PDZ7 (corresponding to the carboxyl group-binding loop of conventional PDZ domains) contains two additional residues (Fig. 2). The conformation of this loop is largely defined (Fig.1 A) by a number of NOE contacts between amino acid residues from this loop with those from the COOH-terminal end of the αB helix (see Fig. 4 B for an example). The limited conformational freedom of the βA/βB-loop is also supported by the order parameter values (S2) of the backbone amides in this region measured from the NMR relaxation experiments (Fig. 4 C). Fig. 3,B and C, compares the surface structures of the αB/βB-grooves of PDZ7 and PSD-95 PDZ2. Because of the packing of the βA/βB-loop with the αB helix, PDZ7 does not have a hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the side chain of the target peptide residue at the 0 position (Fig. 3 B). Additionally, a highly conserved positively charged residue that functions to stabilize the negative charge of the carboxyl group of target peptide (Lys-233 in PSD-95 PDZ2) (Fig. 3 C) is missing in PDZ7. Instead, several negatively charged residues (Glu-998, Asp-999, and Glu-1057) surround the remaining small hydrophobic surface in PDZ7 (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, we conclude that the GRIP1 PDZ7 αB/βB-groove adopts a closed conformation. We predict that GRIP1 PDZ7 is not likely to be able to interact with carboxyl peptides using its αB/βB-groove. Consistent with our prediction, no proteins with classical PDZ-binding carboxyl termini were found to interact with GRIP1 PDZ7 in a recent yeast two-hybrid screening (21Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Google Scholar). 2R. Huganir, personal communication. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that GRIP1 PDZ7 may undergo a large conformational change in the αB/βB region, rendering an interaction of the domain with carboxyl peptides.Figure 3The GRIP1 PDZ7 contains a closed αB/βB-groove.

For easy comparison, the secondary structure of the protein is included in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Structural analysis shows that the space between the backbones of αB and βE of PDZ7 is larger than that of PSD-95 PDZ2 (as well as other PDZ domains with known structures) (Fig.5 A). A prominent hydrophobic surface formed by amino acid residues from βE to αB can be observed in PDZ7 (Fig. 5 B). We term this hydrophobic surface as the βE/αB-surface. The entire αB helix of GRIP PDZ7 is composed of hydrophobic amino acid residues, and it contributes four residues (Cys-1049, Leu-1050, Pro-1053, and Leu-1054) to the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface (Figs. 2 and 5 B). Furthermore, the amino acid residues forming the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface are highly conserved in both GRIP1 and GRIP2 (Fig. 2). Such hydrophobic surface is not observed in other PDZ domains including PSD-95 PDZ2 (Fig. 5 C). It is possible that GRIP1 PDZ7 may use the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface rather than the αB/βB-groove to interact with its binding partner(s). The binding of GRASP-1 to GRIP1 PDZ requires a ∼100-residue fragment at the COOH-terminal end of GRASP-1, and this 100-residue PDZ7-binding domain of GRASP-1 contains neither a classical PDZ-binding motif at its carboxyl terminus nor a PDZ-like fold (21Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Google Scholar). Preliminary NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies of the purified COOH-terminal 100-residue PDZ7-binding domain of GRASP-1 indicated an α-helix-rich structure, and the domain forms a large molecular multimer in solution (data not shown). We titrated15N-labeled PDZ7 with the unlabeled PDZ7-binding domain of GRASP-1. The addition of substoichiometric amounts of GRASP-1 resulted in chemical shift as well as peak intensity changes of a number of backbone amides of PDZ7 (Fig.6 A), confirming that GRASP-1 indeed interacts with GRIP1 via direct binding to its PDZ7 domain (21Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 6 B summarizes the backbone amide chemical shift changes of PDZ7 induced by GRASP-1 binding. The amino acid residues at the COOH-terminal end of βD, the whole βE as well as part of αB facing the βD/βE-strands, experience the largest amplitude of GRASP-1-induced chemical shift changes. The region that shows obvious GRASP-1-induced chemical shift changes closely overlaps with the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface shown in Fig. 5 B, indicating that GRASP-1 binds to PDZ7 via the distinct βE/αB-hydrophobic surface. In contrast, we do not observe any GRASP-1-induced chemical shift changes of the residues in the “DFGF-loop” (the conventional carboxyl group-binding motif) as well as those in the entire βB-strand (Fig. 6). In addition, no chemical shift changes could be detected for the Cys-1048 in the αB1 position of PDZ7 upon the addition of GRASP-1. Taken together, the chemical shift perturbation data indicate that the conventional target-binding groove (i.e. the βB/αB-groove) is not involved in GRASP-1 binding. Chemical shift perturbation data also indicate that GRASP-1 binding induces localized conformational changes to PDZ7 (in the βE/αB-region). To our knowledge, the data presented here demonstrate for the first time that a PDZ domain can interact with its target via a site distinct from the well characterized target-binding βB/αB-groove. PDZ domain-mediated dimerization/multimerization is a common feature for a number of PDZ domain proteins. It is possible that a PDZ domain may dimerize and/or multimerize via the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface seen in GRIP1 PDZ7 (30Zhang Q. Fan J.S. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43216-43220Google Scholar, 31Xu X.Z. Choudhury A., Li, X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Google Scholar, 32Fouassier L. Duan C. Feranchak A.P. Yun C.H. Sutherland E.

Further work is ongoing to directly prove or refute whether some of the above mentioned PDZ domain multimerizations are indeed mediated via the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface seen in GRIP1 PDZ7. In addition, it will be interesting to experimentally test whether other atypical PDZ domain-mediated interactions such as CLP-36 PDZ binding to spectrin-like repeats of α-actinin (39Vallenius T. Luukko K. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11100-11105Google Scholar) are mediated via the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface. In summary, the three-dimensional structure of GRIP1 PDZ7 determined in this work shows that the PDZ domain has a deformed βB/αB-groove that is not likely to be capable of binding to carboxyl peptide ligands. Instead, GRIP1 PDZ7 contains a distinct hydrophobic surface largely composed of the residues from the βE to αB regions of the protein. Unexpectedly, GRIP1 PDZ7 binds to its target GRASP-1 via the βE/αB-hydrophobic surface instead of the conventional target-binding βB/αB-groove. The novel protein-binding surface revealed in this work may help us to understand the molecular basis of frequently observed PDZ domain-mediated multimerization of multimodular scaffold proteins.

We found that three catecholamine-synthesizing genes were transcriptionally up-regulated in cloned PC12D cells overexpressing V-1, a protein that is highly expressed during postnatal brain development (1Yamakuni T.

To reveal the molecular mechanism to regulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine biosynthesis, we analyzed the transcription factors responsible for TH induction in the V-1 clonal cells. First, by using reporter constructs, we found that the transcription mediated by cAMP-responsive element (CRE) was selectively enhanced in the V-1 cells, and TH promoter activity was totally dependent on the CRE in the promoter region of the TH gene. Next, immunoblot analyses and a transactivation assay using a GAL4 reporter system revealed that ATF-2, but not cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), was highly phosphorylated and activated in the V-1 cells, while both CREB and ATF-2 were bound to the TH-CRE. Finally, the enhanced TH promoter activity was competitively attenuated by expression of a plasmid containing the ATF-2 transactivation domain. These data demonstrated that activation of ATF-2 resulted in the increased transcription of the TH gene and suggest that ATF-2 may be deeply involved in the transcriptional regulation of catecholamine-synthesizing genes during neural development.

TH is the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine biosynthesis.

Three of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, i.e. TH, AADC, and DBH, were up-regulated in cloned PC12D cells overexpressing V-1 (1Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar). V-1 is an adaptor-like protein, the expression of which is transiently high during postnatal brain development (24Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Google Scholar, 25Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kubota M. Minegishi A. Song S.-Y. Yamakuni T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Google Scholar). Therefore, V-1 potentially participate TH gene expression in postnatal brain development. We were interested in the intracellular events in the V-1-overexpressing PC12D cells, because none of the transcription factors are known to induce these catecholamine-synthesizing genes simultaneously. In the present study, we found that the transcription mediated by CRE was specifically and highly elevated in the V-1 cells, and that transcription of the TH gene is enhanced by activation of ATF-2, which directly acted on the CRE in the TH promoter. Our results suggest that ATF-2 is involved in the expression of the TH gene during neural development. Two PC12D clones stably and highly expressing V-1, named V1-46 and V1-69, and two vector control clones, termed C-7 and C-9, were established as described previously (1Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar). Parental PC12D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. The stable clones were cultured in medium containing 280 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Mouse TH genomic DNA containing 5.5 kb of its 5′-flanking region, and exon 1 was originally isolated from a mouse genomic library and cloned into the pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid (mTH5.5-pBS). First, to produce mTHpro0.8-Luc, which contains the region of −752 bp from the transcriptional start site to the translational start site of the mouse TH gene, we amplified a fragment containing about 1.2 kb of the mouse TH 5′-flanking region by PCR using primers GTTCCCTTAGTGAGAGGACAC (forward) and GGAATTCCATGGTGCAAGCTGGTGGTC (reverse) and mTH5.5-pBS. The region between −752 bp from the transcriptional start position and the translational start site was ligated to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, PGV-B2 (Toyoink, Tokyo). The entire sequence of the inserted TH 5′-flanking region was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Next, to produce mTHpro4.3-Luc, a fragment that corresponded to the region between −4326 and −753 bp from the transcriptional start position was isolated by the digestion of mTH5.5-pBS with XhoI and then inserted into theXhoI site of mTHpro0.8-Luc. To produce a CRE mutant of mTHpro0.8-Luc that contained a 4-base deletion in a canonical CRE sequence of the TH promoter region (TGACGTCA), we digested the wild-type mTHpro0.8-Luc with AatII to result in a plasmid cut in the middle of the CRE sequence, blunted the end with T4 exonuclease, and then religated it. Firefly luciferase reporter plasmids containing a cyclic AMP-, AP-1-, NF-κB-, glucocorticoid-, heat shock protein-, or serum-responsive element upstream of a TATA-like promoter (PTAL) region taken from herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter were purchased from Clontech. The following plasmids were purchased from Stratagene as parts of PathDetect trans-reporting systems: pFC-MEKK and pFC-PKA are MEKK (amino acids 380 to 672) and PKA (catalytic subunit) expression vectors, respectively; pFA2-CREB and pFA-ATF-2 are expression vectors that consist of CREB (amino acids 1–280) and ATF-2 (amino acids 1–96) transactivation domains fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD, amino acids 1–147), respectively; pFC-dbd is the control vector for GAL4DBDonly; and pFR-Luc reporter is a reporter plasmid containing five copies of the GAL4-responsive element. Seapansy luciferase vectors, pRL-CMV and pRL-TK (Toyoink), were used as an internal control to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected by lipofection using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). One day prior to transfection, the cells were plated on 24-well plates and transfected at ∼50% confluence. In the experiments shown in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, the cells were transfected with 0.75 μg of the firefly reporter plasmids and 0.05 μg of pRL-CMV per well. In experiments using the GAL4 system shown in Fig. 6, cells were transfected with 0.65 μg of pFR-Luc, 0.05 μg of pFA2-CREB or pFA-ATF-2, and 0.05 μg of pRL-TK per well. As a positive control, 0.05 μg of a PKA-expression vector (PKA) or a MEKK-expression vector (MEKK) was used for co-transfection of the parental PC12D cells, and otherwise, pBluescript plasmid was used as a carrier DNA. In the experiments shown in Fig. 7, the cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of mTHpro4.3-Luc or PGV-C2 (a SV40 promoter luciferase vector, Toyoink), 0.5 μg of pFA-ATF2, pFA2-CREB, or pFC2-dbd, and 0.05 μg of pRL-CMV per well. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and assayed for firefly and seapansy luciferase activities by using a PicaGene Dual luciferase assay kit (Toyoink).Figure 2Enhancement of CRE-mediated transcription in the V-1 clones.

The luciferase reporter vector (pFR-Luc) confers GAL4 responsiveness.

For preparation of nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated proteins, the cell pellet was lysed, and nuclear proteins were extracted as described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) except that all buffers contained 0.10 volume of a Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma) substitute for phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and contained 0.01 volume of Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails I and II (Sigma). Protein concentration of the nuclear extract was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), with bovine γ-globulin used as a standard. For preparation of whole-cell extracts for immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated proteins, the cell pellet was directly lysed in SDS-sample buffer, and the supernatant was collected as the whole-cell extract. The cell lysates were stored at −80 °C in small aliquots until assayed. Sense and antisense strands of rat TH-CRE oligonucleotides (sense, GAGGGGCTTTGACGTCAGCCTGG) were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by use of T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed as described by Nankovaet al. (18Nankova B.B. Rivkin M. Kelz M. Nestler E.J. Sabban E.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5647-5653Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, the basic binding buffer contained 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 1 ng of end-labeled TH-CRE oligonucleotide (∼35,000 cpm), and 10 μg of nuclear extract. Double-stranded oligonucleotides or antibodies (1 μl; Cell Signaling Technology) were preincubated on ice for 1 h prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. The mixture was then incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Electrophoresis was performed as described by Kapatoset al. (28Kapatos G. Stegenga S.L. Hirayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5947-5957Google Scholar), and radioactivity was visualized by exposing the x-ray film for 12 h at −80 °C. Phosphorylated form-specific and nonspecific antibodies against CREB, ATF-2, and c-Jun were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Immunoblotting were performed following the supplier's protocol. The cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized with ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). Student's t test was used for statistical evaluations. A level of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. We previously described that TH enzymatic activity, protein level, and mRNA level were all elevated in V-1-overexpressing clones (V1-46 and V1-69) compared with their values for the control (C-7 and C-9) clones (1Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar). To examine the transcription of the TH gene in the V-1 and control clones, we transfected the cloned cells with plasmid constructs containing 4.3 kb of mouse TH 5′-flanking region fused to a luciferase reporter gene (mTHpro4.3-Luc). Reporter activity relative to pRL-CMV was significantly increased in the V-1 clones compared with that in the control clones (Fig.1), suggesting that the increased level of TH mRNA in the V-1 clones was mainly due to an increased transcriptional rate and that cis-acting DNA elements located within the 4.3 kb of 5′-flanking region of the TH gene were required for the overexpression of the TH gene. To explore the transcriptional events changed in the V-1 clones, we measured promoter activities of reporter genes containing cAMP-, AP-1-, NF-κB-, glucocorticoid-, heat shock protein-, and serum-responsive elements. In the V-1 clones, we found that the transcriptional activity mediated by CRE was greatly elevated compared with that in the control clones, whereas that mediated by the other elements was unchanged (Fig.2). A CRE consensus motif (TCACGTCA) exists in the 5′-flanking region of the rat TH gene (29Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Google Scholar), and the sequence and its location (near the TATA-box) are highly conserved among rat, mouse, and man (30Tinti C. Yang C. Seo H. Conti B. Kim C. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19158-19164Google Scholar). It was earlier shown that the TH-CRE was essential for both basal and cyclic AMP-induced transcription of the TH gene in various cell lines, including PC12 cells (3Kim K.S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Google Scholar, 31Ghee M. Baker H. Miller J.C. Ziff E.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 101-114Google Scholar) and a subclone of PC12 (29Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of the increased activity of CRE-mediated transcription to the increased transcription of the TH gene in the V-1 clonal cells, we made wild-type and CRE-mutagenized TH reporter vectors containing about 0.8 kb of the mouse TH 5′-flanking region upstream from the transcriptional start site (mTHpro0.8-Luc; Fig.3 A). The reporter activity of the wild-type mTHpro0.8-Luc was markedly increased in V1-69 cells (Fig.3 B), as had been the case for mTHpro4.3-Luc (Fig. 1). The reporter activity of the CRE mutant was almost the same as that of the promoter-less vector, PGV-B2 in V1-69, C-7, and the parental PC12D cells (Fig. 3 B). Results for the other V-1 clone, V1-46, were similar to those for V1-69 (data not shown). These results indicated the importance of the CRE-mediated transcription for the regulation of the TH gene expression in the V-1 cells. To identify transcriptional factors that might be involved in the CRE-mediated transcription of the TH gene, we conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts of PC12D cells and analyzed binding proteins that made a complex with the TH-CRE (Fig. 4). There were major bands (Bands 1–3) that disappeared in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of excess amounts of cold TH-CRE competitor (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5). However, an excess molar amount of TH-CRE mutant also decreased the amount of Band 3 to the same extent as did the TH-CRE wild type, whereas Bands 1 and 2 remained almost unaffected (Fig. 4, lanes 6–8), indicating that Bands 1 and 2 represented the protein-DNA complexes specific to the TH-CRE. An anti-CREB antibody supershifted Band 2 to Band B (Fig.4, lane 13), and an anti-ATF-2 antibody supershifted Band 1 to Band A (Fig. 4, lane 14), indicating that Bands 1 and 2 represented complexes containing ATF-2 and CREB, respectively. Since ATF-2 was reported to bind to CRE as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with c-Jun (32Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Google Scholar, 33Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Google Scholar, 34Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Google Scholar), we examined whether c-Jun was contained in the TH-CRE complex. An anti-c-Jun antibody did not supershift Band 1 containing ATF-2 (Fig. 4, lane 15). We also conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using TH-CRE and nuclear extracts of V-1 and control clones. There was no significant difference in band patterns between V-1 or control clones and the parental PC12D cells (data not shown). These data suggest that proteins binding to the TH-CRE, including CREB and ATF-2, were not dramatically changed in the V-1 clones. CREB and ATF-2 are well characterized among ATF/CRE binding proteins; phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 (11Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar, 12Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Google Scholar) or phosphorylation of ATF-2 on Thr69/71 (35Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Google Scholar, 36Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar) activates the CRE-mediated transcription. Since we identified CREB and ATF-2 as transcription factors binding to the TH-CRE as was shown in Fig. 4, we next examined the phosphorylation and expression of CREB and ATF-2 in the V-1 clones by Western blot analysis using phosphorylated form-specific and nonspecific antibodies against CREB or ATF-2. As positive controls, PC12D cells were treated with forskolin (FSK) or nerve growth factor (NGF) for 15 min (11Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar, 37Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Google Scholar). In whole-cell extracts of FSK- or NGF-stimulated PC12D cells, the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB was much increased (Fig.5 A, upper panels). Faster running bands that were immunostained with the antibody against CREB phosphorylated on Ser133 appeared, and the intensity of bands immunostained with anti-CREB antibody was reduced by FSK- and NGF-stimulation (Fig. 5 A, upper panels), suggesting that CREB was rapidly degraded after its activation. In addition, phosphorylation of ATF-2 was also increased by FSK or NGF stimulation in PC12D cells, while the total amount of ATF-2 protein was unchanged (Fig. 5 A, lower panels). In the V-1 clones, although there were no or few changes in the expression and phosphorylation of CREB compared with those in the control clones and the non-stimulated parental PC12D cells (Fig. 5 A,upper panels), the level of the phosphorylated form of ATF-2 (on Thr71) was increased without any significant change in the expression of ATF-2 (Fig. 5 A, lower panels). Previous mutation analysis of Thr69 and Thr71of ATF-2 strongly indicated that the dual phosphorylated form of ATF-2,i.e. the protein phospho-Thr69 and -Thr71, is the transcriptionally active form (35Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Google Scholar, 36Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar). This form of ATF-2 was greatly increased in nuclear extracts of the V-1 clones, compared with that in those of the control clones (Fig.5 B). On the other hand, the amount of ATF-2 was not increased in the nuclear extracts of the V-1 clones (Fig.5 B). We also used the GAL4 reporter assay to examine expression vectors expressing the transactivation domain of CREB or ATF-2 (CREBTAD, amino acids 1–280 or ATF-2TAD, amino acids 1–96, respectively) fused to a GAL4-DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD). Although the GAL4DBD-CREBTAD activity in the parental PC12D cells transiently co-transfected with a PKA expression vector was dramatically increased, this activity in the V-1 clones was unchanged compared with that in the control clone and the non-stimulated parental PC12D cells (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the GAL4DBD-ATF-2TAD activity in the V-1 clones was greatly increased and was comparable with that in PC12D cells transiently co-transfected with an active MEKK expression vector as a positive control (Fig. 6 B). These data demonstrate that,"

Bath application of 30 μm PB significantly prolonged the decay time constant of the spontaneous glycinergic mIPSC without changing its amplitude and frequency. Co-application of 0.3 mm PB reduced the peak amplitude, affected the macroscopic desensitization and deactivation of the response to externally applied Gly in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the recovery of Gly response from desensitization was also prolonged by PB. However, PB did not change the desensitization and deactivation kinetics of the taurine-induced response. The GABAAR antagonist bicuculline (10 μm) did not affect the effect of PB on the Gly response. Thus, PB prolonged the spinal glycinergic mIPSCs by slowing desensitization and deactivation of GlyR. Two other structurally different intravenous anesthetics, i.e. propofol (10 μm) and etomidate (3 μm), prolonged the duration of the glycinergic mIPSC in the rat spinal dorsal horn neurons.

Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1278-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of general anesthesia still remain unclear. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have shown that all of these drugs mimic and/or potentiate the inhibition mediated by the GABAA1receptor (GABAAR) in the brain and that their potency and efficacy in exerting GABA-like and/or GABA-potentiating actions correlate with their abilities to induce anesthesia (2Belelli D. Pistis M. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that GABAAR plays an important role in general anesthesia.The glycine receptor (GlyR), like GABAAR-Cl−channel complexes, is another major inhibitory receptor in the adult mammalian spinal cord and brain stem (3Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although GlyR and GABAAR are highly homologous in both structure and function, we know much less about the effects of general anesthetics on GlyR than on GABAAR. Recently, several lines of evidence have indicated that GlyR is positively modulated by volatile ether and alkanes, n-alcohols and chloral derivatives (4Beckstead M.J. Phelan R. Mihic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24959-24964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but is much less sensitive to the barbiturates, propofol and etomidate (ET) (2Belelli D. Pistis M. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).One approach to understanding the receptor mechanisms of the general anesthetics is to investigate the anesthetic-induced modulation of receptor desensitization and deactivation.

However, little information is available for the effects of general anesthetics on GlyR kinetics. On the other hand, a piece of evidence has shown that the anesthetic targets involved in the suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli may lie in the spinal cord (10Antognini J.F.

Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), where glycine is known to be a key transmitter. In the present study we investigated the modulation of a hypnotic-anesthetic barbiturate, pentobarbital (PB), on the glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) as well as GlyR desensitization and deactivation in the acutely dissociated rat spinal dorsal horn neurons. Knowing that PB significantly prolonged the duration of the glycinergic mIPSCs and affected the kinetics of GlyR, we further examined the effects of two other widely applied intravenous general anesthetics, propofol and ET, on the glycinergic mIPSCs. The present results suggest that on the GlyR-Cl− channel complexes action site(s) of intravenous general anesthetics may exist, through which intravenous general anesthetics augment the spinal inhibitory neurotransmission by slowing the desensitization and deactivation of the GlyR.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrated that the general anesthetics PB, propofol and ET all prolonged the duration of mIPSCs in the rat spinal dorsal horn neurons. Furthermore, PB slowed GlyR desensitization and deactivation, which might in turn result in the prolongation of the glycinergic mIPSCs.Spinal GlyR as An Important Target for General AnestheticsThe relevant components of anesthesia (amnesia, analgesia, unconsciousness, and immobility in response to a noxious stimulus) have traditionally been thought to be the result of anesthetic action in the brain. However, recent evidence seems to provide support for a spinal control of anesthesia (10Antognini J.F. Schwartz K. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Rampil I.J. Mason P. Singh H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 78: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 12Rampil I.J. Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, anesthetics could act on the site of brain for amnesia and unconsciousness by decreasing the transmission of noxious information from the spinal cord to the brain (20Kendig J.J. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 1161-1162PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the spinal cord is an important site of anesthetic action in suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli (21Antognini J.F. Carstens E. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 100–101: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Antognini J.F. Carstens E. Tabo E. Buzin V. Anesthesiology. 1997; 87: A292Crossref Google Scholar, 23Collins J.G. Kendig J.J. Mason P. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Spinal sensory processing and its ascending transmission are under local tonic inhibitory control which is largely mediated by the inhibitory amino acid receptors, GABAAR and GlyR. Current available evidence, however, suggests that the potential role of the GlyR in clinical anesthesia is likely to be restricted to the mediation of an aspect of volatile anesthetic action (2Belelli D. Pistis M. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Cheng G. Kendig J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Downie D.L. Hall A.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The present results clearly show that three classic intravenous general anesthetics, PB, propofol, and ET, all prolonged the duration of the glycinergic mIPSCs in the rat spinal dorsal horn neurons. Previous studies have shown that the prolongation of IPSCs duration primarily reflects receptor gating and the unbinding of agonist rather than diffusion of transmitter within the cleft (17Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 26Maconochie D.J. Zempel J.M. Steinbach J.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Therefore, the anesthetic actions of PB produced expectantly by the reduction in both unbinding and desensitizing rates as well as slowing the deactivation and the recovery from paired-pulse depression of the GlyR. These results provided a strong support for our conclusion that PB prolonged the glycinergic mIPSCs by slowing GlyR desensitization and Gly unbinding rate which leads to the prolongation of GlyR deactivation in spinal dorsal horn neurons. Thus, this study suggests that GlyR is an important target for not only volatile but also intravenous general anesthetic action.Two Discrete Mechanisms of PB Modulation on GlyRThe present results show that PB reduced the peak amplitude of the Gly-induced current (I Gly) and accelerated theI Gly macroscopic desensitization, and that the extent of the macroscopic desensitization increased with the rise of PB concentrations (Fig. 6 B). These effects may be caused by two mechanisms: one is the putative channel-blocking effect of PB and the other is allosteric modulation.Previous studies have shown that barbiturates at concentrations over millimolar values can block GABAAR, leading to a reduced peak response (28Akaike N. Maruyama T. Tokutomi N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 85-98Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Rho J.M. Donevan S.D. Rogawski M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 509-522Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Akk G. Steinbach J.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Molecular biological evidence has shown that GABAAR and GlyR belong to the same ligand-gated ion channel protein superfamily (31Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and that mutations of GlyR subunit (at two amino acid positions 159 and 161) render the receptor responsive to GABA (32Schmieden V. Kushe J. Betz H. Science. 1993; 262: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting a close relationship between the two receptor systems. Thus, it is very likely that PB acts as an open-channel blocker on a block site of GlyR-Cl− channel complexes to accelerate the macroscopic desensitization ofI Gly, similar to the effect of MK-801 on NMDA receptor-mediated current (33Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y. Lin Y. Araneda R.C. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin RS. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (Fig.11). The presence of a tail (rebound) current after washout of agonists is a direct evidence for this hypothesis. After the washout of PB and Gly, the PB molecule binding to the block site was removed and the undesensitized GlyR might be re-activated by the agonist which did not have sufficient time to unbind, thereby producing the rebound current (Fig. 11). The rebound current was only induced by the removal of Gly and PB, and did not occur in the sequential application mode (Fig. 5). Moreover, the removal of Gly and PB at a low concentration (0.03 mm) (Fig. 6 A) did not induce the rebound current, indicating that the PB blockage is state- and concentration-dependent. The result of the voltage-dependence experiment (Fig. 4) is further in favor of such an open-channel block mechanism. The present experiments were performed at pH 7.4 at which 20% of PB is in anionic form (30Akk G. Steinbach J.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When the membrane potential exceeded 0 mV, the driving force for anionic PB molecule was directed toward intracellular, leading to a potentiation of the blocking effect. The corollary is a more significant acceleration of macroscopic desensitization at positive holding potentials (Fig. 4).On the other hand, PB might allosterically modulate the function of GlyR, resulting in the slowness but not acceleration of GlyR desensitization. The result that the preperfusion of PB prior to the application of Gly caused the prolongation of the time constant ofI Gly desensitization (Fig. 5 Ac) indicated the possibility of PB slowing the GlyR desensitization in the absence of the blockage effect. On the other hand, no effect of low concentration PB on the amplitude of glycinergic mIPSC and the macroscopic desensitization of I Gly (Fig. 6) could be caused by the counteraction of the slight blockage effect and the allosterical modulation due to the low concentration of PB. According to several previous reports (34Wu J. Harata N. Akaike N. Brain Res. 1994; 645: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Li Y.X. Schaffner A.E., Li, H.R. Nelson R. Barker J.L. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 102: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 36Lei S. Orser B.A. Thatcher G.R. Reynolds J.N. MacDonald J.F. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 2030-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the augmentation of the current noise during co-application of PB and Gly, or PB and taurine, which reflected channel opening with different conductance or opening probability, hinted that a modulation site of PB existed on GlyR. Moreover, the incomplete recovery of desensitization, which appeared in the wash traces (Figs. 4 A and 6 A) also indicates the effect of PB on the desensitization of GlyR. Due to the fact that the GlyR deactivation induced by low-potency agonist taurine mainly depends on agonist unbinding, the small effect of PB on GlyR deactivation after channel activation by taurine (Fig. 7) suggests that PB reduces the unbinding rate of Gly, leading to a slower deactivation of GlyR. With regard to the negligible effect of PB on macroscopic desensitization induced by taurine, a possible interpretation is that the rapid dissociation of taurine from GlyR impairs the action of PB. Therefore, although speculating, GlyR-Cl− channel complexes may contain not only block site(s) but also allosteric modulation site(s) (Fig. 11), and in the presence of low concentrations of PB, allosteric modulation is dominant (Figs. 1 and 5). Furthermore, the effect of preperfusion and the slow recovery ofI Gly desensitization indicate that other mechanisms might contribute to the allosterical modulation of PB, which remain to be studied.Comparison of GlyR and GABAAR ModulationThe anesthetic effect of barbiturates is thought to result, at least in part, from actions on GABAARs. Depending on the dose, PB has three effects on GABAAR. At low micromolar concentrations, PB potentiates the activation of GABAAR (37Akaike N. Tokutomi N. Ikemoto Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C452-C460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At high micromolar concentrations, PB directly gates the GABAAR (29Rho J.M. Donevan S.D. Rogawski M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 509-522Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Akk G. Steinbach J.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Akaike N. Tokutomi N.

At millimolar concentrations PB blocks the opening channels of GABAAR (29Rho J.M. Donevan S.D. Rogawski M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 509-522Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Akk G.

Bracamontes J. Steinbach J.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 649-676Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The actions appear to be mediated via different sites (39Serafini R. Bracamontes J. Steinbach J.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 649-676Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Dalziel J.E. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Birnir B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 385: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Similar to GABAAR, PB at high micromolar concentration (300 μm) had a significant effect on the desensitization and deactivation of I Gly by modulating the gating of GlyR. However, the block effect of PB appeared synchronously, not needing to reach millimolar concentration, suggesting that PB may have a stronger block action on GlyR than that on GABAAR. Thus, similar to GABAAR, PB can act on at least two different sites of GlyR. Additionally, the present results clearly show that the peak amplitude of I Gly was reduced by PB at either low or high concentrations. Since there is evidence supporting that co-transmission between GABAergic and glycinergic transmitter systems may occur in the spinal dorsal horn (41Jonas P. Bischofberger J. Sandkuhler J. Science. 1998; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 42Xu T.L. Pang Z.P., Li, J.S. Akaike N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Wu L.J., Li, Y. Xu T.L. NeuroReport. 2002; 13: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the different effects of PB on GABAAR and GlyR would be functionally important. At clinical relevant concentrations, PB enhances the function of GABAAR, but reduces theI Gly. This would provide a mechanism for the modulation balance of PB, as a clinical anesthetic, between these two inhibitory transmitters.With respect to the reduction of macroscopic peak current ofI Gly induced by PB, the acceleration of macroscopic desensitization of I Gly cannot explain it fully due to the fact that PB (0.03 mm) inhibited the peak I Gly significantly but did not affect the current desensitization at all (Fig. 6 B). Also, the preperfusion effect of PB (Fig. 5 Ac) and the result that the reduction of the peak I Gly was not voltage-dependent whereas the change of the desensitization was voltage-dependent (Fig. 4 C) suggest that the open-channel-block mechanism could not be the rational explanation. Moreover, the cross-inhibition betweenI Gly and GABA-induced response recently observed in the rat spinal dorsal horn neurons (43Wu L.J., Li, Y. Xu T.L. NeuroReport. 2002; 13: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was dependent on the agonist concentrations (44Li Y. Xu T.L. NeuroReport. 2002; 13: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), while the inhibition of the peakI Gly by PB was not Gly concentration-dependent (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, the effect of PB on I Gly is independent of the activation of GABAAR because BMI, the specific GABAAR antagonist, failed to alter the effects of PB on the peak and kinetics of I Gly (Fig. 9). Thus the most likely explanation is the intracellular mechanisms and/or the lipid solubility. Additional experiments are needed to address the above mentioned possibilities.In summary, PB acted on spinal GlyR allosterically modulating or blocking the I Gly, indicating that on GlyR both modulation and block site(s) may exist (Fig. 11). The results presented herein provide evidence at the cellular level for the anesthetic action of general anesthetic on inhibitory receptor in spinal cord neurons. The functional change of spinal glycinergic neurotransmission in the presence of anesthetic may, at least in part, contribute to produce anesthesia. A wide range of chemically diverse compounds, including barbiturates, steroids, propofol, alcohols, and inhalation agents such as halothane, isolurane, and enflurane, induce general anesthesia in animals and humans (1Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1278-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of general anesthesia still remain unclear. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have shown that all of these drugs mimic and/or potentiate the inhibition mediated by the GABAA1receptor (GABAAR) in the brain and that their potency and efficacy in exerting GABA-like and/or GABA-potentiating actions correlate with their abilities to induce anesthesia (2Belelli D. Pistis M. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that GABAAR plays an important role in general anesthesia. The glycine receptor (GlyR), like GABAAR-Cl−channel complexes, is another major inhibitory receptor in the adult mammalian spinal cord and brain stem (3Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although GlyR and GABAAR are highly homologous in both structure and function, we know much less about the effects of general anesthetics on GlyR than on GABAAR. Recently, several lines of evidence have indicated that GlyR is positively modulated by volatile ether and alkanes, n-alcohols and chloral derivatives (4Beckstead M.J. Phelan R. Mihic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24959-24964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but is much less sensitive to the barbiturates, propofol and etomidate (ET) (2Belelli D. Pistis M. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One approach to understanding the receptor mechanisms of the general anesthetics is to investigate the anesthetic-induced modulation of receptor desensitization and deactivation. The general anesthetic propofol (5Orser B.A. Wang L.Y. Pennefather P.S. MacDonald J.F. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7747-7760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bai D.L. Pennefather P.S. MacDonald J.F.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 899-907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the neurosteroid 3α-21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (THDOC) (8Zhu W.J. Vicini S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pregnenolone sulfate (9Shen W.X. Mennerick S. Covey D.F. Zorumski C.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3571-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been observed to affect GABAAR deactivation and/or desensitization. However, little information is available for the effects of general anesthetics on GlyR kinetics. On the other hand, a piece of evidence has shown that the anesthetic targets involved in the suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli may lie in the spinal cord (10Antognini J.F. Schwartz K. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Rampil I.J. Mason P. Singh H.

In the present study we investigated the modulation of a hypnotic-anesthetic barbiturate, pentobarbital (PB), on the glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) as well as GlyR desensitization and deactivation in the acutely dissociated rat spinal dorsal horn neurons. Knowing that PB significantly prolonged the duration of the glycinergic mIPSCs and affected the kinetics of GlyR, we further examined the effects of two other widely applied intravenous general anesthetics, propofol and ET, on the glycinergic mIPSCs. The present results suggest that on the GlyR-Cl− channel complexes action site(s) of intravenous general anesthetics may exist, through which intravenous general anesthetics augment the spinal inhibitory neurotransmission by slowing the desensitization and deactivation of the GlyR. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrated that the general anesthetics PB, propofol and ET all prolonged the duration of mIPSCs in the rat spinal dorsal horn neurons. Furthermore, PB slowed GlyR desensitization and deactivation, which might in turn result in the prolongation of the glycinergic mIPSCs.Spinal GlyR as An Important Target for General AnestheticsThe relevant components of anesthesia (amnesia, analgesia, unconsciousness, and immobility in response to a noxious stimulus) have traditionally been thought to be the result of anesthetic action in the brain. However, recent evidence seems to provide support for a spinal control of anesthesia (10Antognini J.F. Schwartz K.

In addition, anesthetics could act on the site of brain for amnesia and unconsciousness by decreasing the transmission of noxious information from the spinal cord to the brain (20Kendig J.J.

Brain Res. 1999; 70: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and overexpression of PAG608 resulted in apoptotic cell death of human p53-null tumor cells (1Israeli D. Haupt Y. Elkeles A. Wilder S. Amson R. Telerman A. Oren M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Hellborg F. Qian W. Mendez V.C. Asker C. Kost A.M. Wilhelm M. Imreh S. Wiman K.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5466-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, PAG608 is thought to be activated by p53 and to be associated with neuronal apoptotic cell death. The pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative disorders has been linked to apoptosis (7Volbracht C. Fava E. Leist M. Nicotera P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3645-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Nagai M. Aoki M. Miyoshi I. Kato M. Pasinelli P. Kasai N. Brown R.J. Itoyama Y. J.

It is well known that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)1 is a neurotoxin that causes selective degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and has been used to generate animal models of Parkinson's disease. Recently, using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and hematoxylin staining, apoptotic morphological changes were detected in the substantia nigra of parkinsonian rats lesioned by 6-OHDA (10Zuch C.L.

Brain Res. 2000; 858: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, 6-OHDA is known to induce p53 expression and neuronal apoptotic cell death in cultured tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neuronal cells (12Blum D., Wu, Y. Nissou M.F. Arnaud S. Alim L.B. Verna J.M. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Coelln R. Kugler S. Bahr M. Weller M. Dichgans J. Schulz J.B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 263-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Clarkson E.D. Edwards P.J. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether PAG608 is associated with 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic cell death. We present evidence that PAG608 and p53 expression was increased by 6-OHDA treatment in PC12 cells and that 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic events, such as up-regulation of p53 and Bax, collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential and the appearance of apoptosis-related morphological changes, were inhibited in PC12 cells transfected with antisense PAG608 cDNA. We also found that overexpression of PAG608 increased p53 expression in neuronal cells. Furthermore, the first zinc finger domain-deleted mutant of PAG608 dramatically inhibited 6-OHDA-induced cell death and disturbed the nuclear and nucleolar localization of PAG608, suggesting that this first zinc finger domain is necessary for induction of apoptosis and the nuclear and nucleolar localization of PAG608. PC12 cells (Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Rat neuroblastoma, B65 cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Culture, Salisbury, UK) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 60 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate (Wako Chemical Co., Hiroshima, Japan). All culture dishes and chamber slides were purchased from BD Biosciences. PC12 cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) or B65 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/cm2) were plated on two-well collagen I-coated or noncoated chamber slides, respectively. After an overnight culture, cells were treated with 25–200 μm 6-OHDA for 8 h and stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Nuclear morphology was examined by fluorescence microscopy using a mercury lamp through a 360–370 nm bandpass filter to excite Hoechst 33342. To obtain ratPAG608 cDNA, reverse transcription-PCR was performed using total RNA isolated from the brain of a male Sprague-Dawley rat (9 weeks old; Charles River, Yokohama, Japan) by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using gene-specific primers 5′-ggaattccctttcctgccttgatgattct-3′ and 5′-ggggtaccccatcactgaacgtagcccaggttctcc-3′ harboring anEcoRI and KpnI site, respectively. To construct the antisense PAG608 cDNA expression vector, a fragment of PAG608 cDNA was ligated between the EcoRI and KpnI sites in pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen). To generate a polyhistidine metal-binding (His)-tagged wild-type PAG608construct, a cDNA fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of PAG608 was amplified by PCR using the antisensePAG608 expression vector as a template upper primer uHis/PAG, 5′-gggaattctgatgattcttttgcagcaggtc-3′, and lower primer 5′-ccgctcgagcggtcactgaacgtagccca-3′ and ligated between theEcoRI and XhoI sites in pcDNA3.1/HisA (Invitrogen). His-tagged mutant PAG608 constructs (ΔC582 and ΔC741) were generated by amplifying cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–194 and 1–174 by PCR using the antisensePAG608 expression vector as a template, with upper primer uHis/PAG and lower primers 5′-ggatatcctcattgccccgcctctgcagagtc-3′ and 5′-ggatgtcctcagtaaaactggccacttg-3′, respectively. The fragments were ligated independently between the EcoRI and EcoRV sites in pcDNA3.1/HisA. His-tagged mutant PAG608constructs (ΔN207 and ΔN522) were constructed by amplifying cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 69–289 and 174–289 by PCR using the antisense PAG608 expression vector as a template, lower primers lHis/PAG and 5′-ggatatcctcactgaacgtagccca-3′, respectively, and upper primers 5′-ggaattctcttctgcaaactctgc-3′, and 5′-ggaattcttcgtctggccga-3′, respectively. The fragments were ligated independently between the EcoRI and EcoRV sites in pcDNA3.1/HisA. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type PAG608 construct was generated by amplifying a cDNA fragment encoding the PAG608 open reading frame by PCR using the antisense PAG608 expression vector as a template, upper primer 5′-tctcgaggatgattcttttgcagcaggtc-3′ and lower primer 5′-ccccgggtcactgaacgtagcccaggttct-3′, and ligating the product between the XhoI and SmaI sites in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. After overnight culture of PC12 cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) in a 60-mm collagen I-coated dish, 10 μg of empty or antisense PAG608cDNA expression vector was cotransfected with 2 μg of a pcDNA/Hygro/lacZ plasmid (Invitrogen) encoding the β-galactosidase gene into cultured cells using the calcium phosphate method (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with BES (Sigma)-buffered saline 4 h after the transfection and cultured in fresh medium for 36 h. Cells were treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA (Sigma) for 8 h and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-galactopyranoside (Sigma) solution as reported previously (17Bossy W.E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). PC12 cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) were plated on two-well collagen I-coated chamber slides. After an overnight culture, 2 μg of empty vector, pcDNA3.1/HisA, or His-tagged mutant PAG608 construct (ΔN522) was cotransfected with 1 μg of empty GFP expression vector (pEGFP-C2) into cultured cells using lipofection (LipofectAMINE; Invitrogen) (18Chiang M.Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18162-18171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 100 μm6-OHDA for a further 24 h. GFP-positive cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a mercury lamp through a 470–490 nm bandpass filter to excite GFP. To establish the empty vector-transfected PC12 cell line (PC12/CTL) and antisense PAG608 cDNA-transfected PC12 cell line (PC12/PAG608AS), PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. After overnight culture, 10 μg of empty or antisense PAG608 expression vector was transfected into cultured cells using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were rinsed with BES-buffered saline 4 h after transfection. Normal culture medium was added, and the cells were incubated for 72 h in 5% at 37 °C. The cells were trypsinized and replated at 4 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and then incubated for 24 h. The culture medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin and thereafter replaced every 3–4 days. Individual Geneticin-resistant colonies were isolated 2 weeks later and expanded into cell lines. Total cell lysates from PC12 cells and transformant PC12 cells (PC12/CTL and PC12/PAG608AS) treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA for various times were prepared with 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) in ice-cold RIPA buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonident P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). To overexpress PAG608, 2 μg of empty vector, pcDNA3.1/HisA, or His-tagged wild-type PAG608 construct was transfected into PC12 cells (1 × 105cells/cm2) and B65 cells (2.5 × 104cells/cm2) by lipofection. Total cell lysates from thesePAG608-transiently transfected cells were also prepared 24 or 48 h after the treatment. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Asanuma M. Nishibayashi S. Kondo Y. Iwata E. Tsuda M. Ogawa N. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse/rat p53 (Novacastra Laboratories, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK; 1:300 dilution), rabbit anti-rat Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:200 dilution), rabbit anti-rat Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:150 dilution), or goat anti-rat PAG608 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:150 dilution) polyclonal antibody and then reacted with donkey anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After washing with 20 mm Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Sample loading and transfer were normalized by using 2 mg/ml Ponceau S solution or goat anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:250 dilution). PC12, PC12/PAG608AS and/or PC12/CTL cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) were plated on each well of 96-well collagen I-coated plates. After a 24-h attachment period, these cells were treated with 50–100 μm 6-OHDA or 50–200 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Wako). At 24 h after treatment, the cell viability was assessed by quantitative colorimetric assay with WST-1 (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan), a modification of the standard MTT assay (20Higashi Y. Asanuma M. Miyazaki I. Ogawa N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1771-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PC12 or PC12/PAG608AS cells (5 × 105cells/ml) were plated on each well of six-well collagen I-coated plates as reported previously (21Solder F. Weller M. Haid S. Beinroth S. Miller S.W. Wullner U. Davis R.E. Dichgans J. Klockgether T. Schulz J.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After a 24-h attachment period, these cells were treated with 250 μm1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) (Sigma). At 48 and 72 h after treatment, cells were removed from the culture dish by 0.125% trypsin in PBS and were added to 0.5% trypan blue (Wako) in PBS. The cell number of trypan blue exclusion (live) cells was counted using a counting chamber. To determine caspase 3 activity in PC12 cells and PC12/PAG608AS cells treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA, a caspase-3 assay kit (Sigma) was used. PC12 or PC12/PAG608AS cells (1 × 105cells/cm2) were plated on six-well collagen I-coated plates. After a 24-h attachment period, the cells were treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA. At 4 h after treatment, total cell lysates from PC12 cells and PC12/PAG608AS cells were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CHAPS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and then were incubated with 0.2 mm acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Aspp-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA), a colorimetric substrate for caspase-3 at 37 °C for 90 min. The activity of caspase-3 was determined by measuring of absorption of paranitroaniline release from Ac-DEVD-pNA. To detect cells undergoing apoptosis, a colorimetric TUNEL system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used. PC12 or PC12/PAG608AS cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) were plated on two-well collagen I-coated chamber slides. After a 24-h attachment period, the cells were treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA. At 8 h after treatment, the cells were washed with 10 mm PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer. Cells were washed with 10 mm PBS and permeabilized with Triton X-100 for 5 min. After a rinse with 10 mm PBS, each slide was equilibrated and then incubated with terminal dUTP transferase at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped with 2 × SSC, and the slides were examined under a microscope. PC12 or PC12/PAG608AS cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) were cultured on two-well collagen I-coated chamber slides for 24 h and then treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA. At 4 h after treatment, the cells were washed with 10 mm PBS and stained with 10 μg/ml JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) solution in culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. After staining, mitochondrial membrane potentials in the cells were observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510), using the Windows-based Zeiss LSM program (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The 488 nm line of an argon-ion laser attenuated to 5% of the maximal intensity with a neutral density filter and the 543 nm line of a helium-neon laser without attenuation were used to excite the green fluorescent JC-1 monomer. The 543 nm line of a helium-neon laser without attenuation was used to excite red fluorescent J-aggregates formed by JC-1. Light emitted from the green fluorescent JC-1 monomer was collected through a 505–530 nm bandpass filter in multitrack. Light emitted from red fluorescent J aggregates was collected through a 560 nm longpass filter. Filtered beams were detected by photomultiplier tubes. Images were recorded with a 20× objective (Plan NeoFluar, 0.50 NA or 0.30 NA, Zeiss) at 2× zoom (0.9 μm/pixel). PC12 cells (1 × 105 cells/cm2) were plated on each well of two-well collagen I-coated chamber slides. After a 24-h attachment period, 2 μg of empty or His-tagged wild-type or mutantPAG608 expression vectors were co-transfected with 1 μg of GFP-tagged wild-type PAG608 cDNA expression vector into cultured cells by lipofection. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer and then stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. GFP-tagged wild-type PAG608 transformant cells and nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342 were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a mercury lamp through a 470–490 nm bandpass filter and 360–370 nm bandpass filter to excite GFP and Hoechst 33342, respectively. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using one- or two-way ANOVA, followed by apost hoc Fisher's PLSD multiple comparison test. Ap value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. In rat catecholaminergic neuronal PC12 cells and B65 cells, small but significant increases in the proportions of apoptotic cells appeared after exposure to 6-OHDA (PC12 cells, 50–100 μm; B65 cells, 25–50 μm) for 8 h (Fig. 1). Therefore, 6-OHDA was used in the following experiments at concentration of 100 μm for PC12 cells and 50 μm for B65 cells. p53 protein expression was induced in PC12 cells at 3–12 h after treatment with 100 μm 6-OHDA (Fig. 2,A and C), coinciding with the 6-OHDA-induced p53 expression described in previous studies (12Blum D., Wu, Y. Nissou M.F. Arnaud S. Alim L.B. Verna J.M. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Ochu E.E. Rothwell N.J. Waters C.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2637-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Changes in PAG608 expression were examined during 6-OHDA-induced cell death of PC12 cells. An increase in PAG608 expression in PC12 cells was detected at 6–12 h after 6-OHDA treatment (Fig. 2, A and C). In B65 cells, 50 μm 6-OHDA treatment also led to induction of PAG608 expression after an increase in p53 (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of p53 and PAG608 in PC12 and B65 cells treated with 6-OHDA. Total cell lysates from PC12 cells (A) or B65 cells (B) which were treated with 6-OHDA (100 μm for PC12 cells or 50 μmfor B65 cells) for 3–24 h were analyzed by Western blot using anti-p53 or anti-PAG608 antibodies. Anti-actin antibody was used to normalize for loading and transfer artifacts. C, changes in p53 and PAG608 in PC12 cells treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA.

There were no morphological differences between β-galactosidase-positive PC12 cells transfected with the antisensePAG608 cDNA expression vector and empty vector (Fig. 3,A and B). A recent study reported that apoptosis-related morphological changes in PC12 cells were detectable 8 h after treatment with 6-OHDA (23Woodgate A. MacGibbon G. Walton M. Dragunow M. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we exposed transfected PC12 cells to 100 μm 6-OHDA for 8 h and examined cell morphology; ∼11% of β-galactosidase-positive cells transfected with an empty vector exhibited shrunken cell size and condensed chromatin after treatment with 6-OHDA (Fig. 3, C and E). In contrast, cells transfected with antisense PAG608 cDNA remained predominantly normal and healthy after the addition of 6-OHDA, although they were β-galactosidase-positive (Fig. 3, D andE). To confirm the association of PAG608 with apoptotic cell death, we generated a clone of stable transformant PC12 cells, which were transfected with an empty vector (PC12/CTL) or an antisensePAG608 cDNA expression vector (PC12/PAG608AS) and then selected with Geneticin. Western blot analyses using anti-PAG608 antibody revealed that the expression of PAG608 decreased in PC12/PAG608AS cells (Fig. 4 A). At 24 h after treatment with 100 μm 6-OHDA, the numbers of surviving naive and empty vector-transfected PC12 cells diminished to 52.6 ± 5.0% and 31.8 ± 2.7%, respectively, of the control (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to these control cells, cell death induced by 6-OHDA was prevented in PC12/PAG608AS cells (Fig. 4 B), consistent with the results after transient transfection of antisense PAG608 cDNA shown in Fig. 3. PC12/PAG608AS cells were also resistant to 200 μmH2O2-induced cell death, whereas the viability of naive PC12 cells was reduced by 42.6 ± 5.0% 24 h after the 200 μm H2O2 treatment (Fig.5, A and B).Figure 5Prevention of cell death induced by H2O2 in PC12/PAG608AS cells. Viability of PC12 cells and PC12/PAG608AS cells treated with 50–200 μm H2O2 for 24 h was measured by a modification of the standard MTT assay (A). Data are the mean ± S.E. (n = 6).

Weller M. Haid S. Beinroth S. Miller S.W. Wullner U. Davis R.E. Dichgans J. Klockgether T. Schulz J.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Treatment with MPP+ inhibited cell proliferation and led to cell death of PC12/PAG608AS cells at 48 and 72 h as well as naive PC12 cells (Fig. 6). It has been reported that caspase-3 mediates 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells (22Ochu E.E. Rothwell N.J. Waters C.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2637-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows the inhibitory effects of PAG608 expression on caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation in PC12 cells after treatment with 6-OHDA. At 4 h after 6-OHDA treatment, no significant increase in the activity of caspase-3 was observed in PC12/PAG608AS cells in contrast to the increase in naive PC12 cells (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, no appearance of DNA fragmentation in PC12/PAG608 cells treated with 6-OHDA for 8 h was detected by TUNEL assay, although the TUNEL-positive signals were increased in 6-OHDA-treated naive PC12 cells (Fig. 7 B). PAG608 could potentially mediate 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic cell death via a collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential because the mitochondrial membrane potential is reportedly decreased during p53-induced apoptosis, and 6-OHDA is known to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and membrane permeability in PC12 cells (24Li P.-F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 25Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, using JC-1, which is an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential, we examined changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential in PC12/PAG608AS cells after treatment with 6-OHDA (Fig.8). JC-1 exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, as indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (488 nm) for the reduced form of JC-1 to red (543 nm) for the oxidized form. Consequently, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is indicated by green fluorescence. The intensity of green fluorescence was maintained in PC12 cells treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA for 4 h (Fig. 8 B). Untreated PC12/PAG608AS cells exhibited red fluorescence, which was similar to naive PC12 cells (Fig. 8,A and C). In contrast to 6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells, the intensity of red fluorescence in PC12/PAG608AS cells treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA was similar to that in untreated PC12 cells (Fig. 8 D). Because the mitochondrial membrane potential in PC12/PAG608AS cells was not disrupted by 6-OHDA (Fig.8 D), we investigated the effects of inhibition of PAG608 expression on several apoptosis-related molecules that are particularly associated with a collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot analyses showed that expression of both p53 and Bax was increased by 100 μm 6-OHDA in naive PC12 cells. In contrast, neither p53 nor Bax expression was induced by 100 μm6-OHDA in PC12/PAG608AS cells (Fig. 9,A and B). Treatment of both naive PC12 and PC12/PAG608AS cells with 100 μm 6-OHDA induced no changes in the expression of Bcl-2 (Fig. 9), which prevents oxidative stress-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and consequent apoptosis (27Satoh T.

https://openalex.org/W1984004135,"In a hyperthermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) consists of two non-identical polypeptide subunits (α and β), different from the canonical LeuRS, which has a single polypeptide chain. By PCR, using genome DNA of A. aeolicus as a template, genes encoding the α and β subunits were amplified and cloned in Escherichia coli. The α subunit could not be expressed stably in vivo, whereas the β subunit was overproduced and purified by a simple procedure. The β subunit was inactive in catalysis but was able to bind tRNALeu. Interestingly, the heterodimer αβ-LeuRS could be overproduced in E. coli cells containing both genes and was purified to 95% homogeneity as a hybrid dimer. The kinetics of A. aeolicus LeuRS in pre-steady and steady states and cross-recognition of LeuRS and tRNALeufrom A. aeolicus and E. coli were studied. Magnesium concentration, pH value, and temperature aminoacylation optima were determined to be 12 mm, 7.8, and 70 °C, respectively. Under optimal conditions, A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS is stable up to 65 °C. In a hyperthermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) consists of two non-identical polypeptide subunits (α and β), different from the canonical LeuRS, which has a single polypeptide chain. By PCR, using genome DNA of A. aeolicus as a template, genes encoding the α and β subunits were amplified and cloned in Escherichia coli. The α subunit could not be expressed stably in vivo, whereas the β subunit was overproduced and purified by a simple procedure. The β subunit was inactive in catalysis but was able to bind tRNALeu. Interestingly, the heterodimer αβ-LeuRS could be overproduced in E. coli cells containing both genes and was purified to 95% homogeneity as a hybrid dimer. The kinetics of A. aeolicus LeuRS in pre-steady and steady states and cross-recognition of LeuRS and tRNALeufrom A. aeolicus and E. coli were studied. Magnesium concentration, pH value, and temperature aminoacylation optima were determined to be 12 mm, 7.8, and 70 °C, respectively. Under optimal conditions, A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS is stable up to 65 °C. aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases connective peptide high pressure liquid chromatography circular dichroism The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs,1 EC 6.1.1) catalyze the esterification of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs (1Cusack S.

They are specific for both amino acid and tRNA substrates to ensure the high fidelity required by translation (6Schimmel P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 125-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The alignments of the sequences of aaRSs and tRNAs have been widely used to study their specific interactions. The 20 aaRSs can be divided into two classes of 10 members each on the basis of conserved sequences and characteristic structural motifs (7Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Class I contains two signature peptides, HIGH and KMSKS, located in the active site that is built as the characteristic dinucleotide binding fold (Rossmann Fold, βαβαβ). Connective peptides (called CP domains) are often inserted between the different strands of the Rossmann fold (8Burbaum J.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16965-16968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site of class II aaRSs is built around an antiparallel β sheet partly closed by helices, which contains three conserved motifs (4Carter Jr., C.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Except for arginyl-, glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS, GluRS and GlnRS) (9Mehler A.H. Mitra S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Papas T.S. Peterkofsky A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4602-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), aminoacylation of tRNA catalyzed by the other 17 aaRSs is a two-step reaction: (a) activation of amino acids with ATP by formation of aminoacyl adenylate and (b) transfer of the aminoacyl-moiety from the aminoacyl adenylate to the cognate tRNA substrate (11Schimmel P. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 601-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The activities of these two steps are independent, and substrate tRNA is unnecessary for amino acid activation. The accuracy of aminoacylation depends on both the specific recognition of amino acids during their activation and the pre- or posttransfer editing that corrects errors at either the stage of aminoacyl adenylate formation or at the step of aminoacyl transfer to tRNA (12Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Hopfield J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS, EC 6. 1. 1. 4) belongs to the class I aaRSs and catalyzes leucylation of tRNALeu on the 2′-OH of the ribose of the 3′-terminal adenosine (7Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). The primary sequences of LeuRSs from over 50 sources are known. LeuRS are large monomeric enzymes (860 amino acids residues for the Escherichia colienzyme), which are homologous to other synthetases from class Ia: isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRS), and valyl-tRNA synthetases (ValRS), methionyl-tRNA synthetases (MetRS), arginyl-tRNA synthetases, and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS). LeuRSs are more closely related to the large monomeric IleRS and ValRS, which exhibit large CP domains involved in the editing process and several zinc binding domains. The conservation of the monomeric structure of these enzymes is universal, except for the LeuRS from Aquifex aeolicus, which is an αβ heterodimer (15Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 47-58Crossref Scopus (966) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence alignments, CP1 of E. coli LeuRS extends from residues 126 to 389, and CP2 spans residues 424–582 (16Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A. aeolicus is one of the most primitive bacteria. With a growth-temperature maximum near 95 °C,A. aeolicus is one of the most thermophilic bacteria known. It grows at 85 °C under an H2/CO2/O2 (79.5:19.5:1.0) atmosphere in a medium containing only inorganic components. Its complete genome was sequenced in 1998 (15Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 47-58Crossref Scopus (966) Google Scholar). According to the analysis of its genomic DNA and alignment of the gene sequence of other LeuRSs, the A. aeolicus LeuRS appears to be separated into two subunits that were named α and β subunit, respectively. Here, we report the cloning and expression of the two subunits ofA. aeolicus LeuRS followed by the purification of the αβ-LeuRS and its β subunit alone. We also report the tRNA binding with its cognate tRNA, the kinetic properties, and thermal stability of these molecules. The cross-recognition of LeuRS and tRNALeufrom E. coli and A. aeolicus was studied. l-leucine, dithiothreitol, ATP, nucleotide triphosphate, 5′-GMP, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. [14C]leucine (300–400mCi/mmol) and32P-labeled tetrasodium pyrophosphate were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. GF/C filters were from Whatman Company. Kinase, ligase, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Sangon Company, Shanghai Branch. E. coli LeuRS was purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Blue-Sephacel from the overproducting E. coli strain in our laboratory (17Li T. Xia X. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica. 1995; 27: 279-286Google Scholar). Its concentration was determined by A 280of the enzyme solution; 1.62 mg of protein/ml equals 1 optical density unit at 280 nm. E. coli total tRNA containing 50% of tRNALeu2 (GAG) was isolated from an overproducing strain constructed in our laboratory (18Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci. China Ser. C Life Sci. 1998; 41: 225-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purified from an overproducing strain in our laboratory (19Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pSML104 was constructed from pACYC184 and pKK-233–2 (20Li T., Li, Y. Guo N. Wang E. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9084-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It contains the p15A replicon from pACYC184, the strong trc promoter, a multicloning site, two sequences for transcription termination (T1 and T2) of the ribosomal operon rrnB from pKK233–2, and the resistance to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Plasmid pBCP378 contains the trc promoter, resistance to ampicillin, and an NdeI site at its translation start point without altering the amino acid sequence of the synthesized protein, while ptrc and the lacIQ gene confer inducible and controllable expression (21Velterop J.S. Dijkhuizen M.A. van't Hof R. Postma P.W. Gene. 1995; 153: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The A. aeolicus genome contains five tRNALeu genes. We cloned and expressed its most frequently used isoacceptor, which decodes CUC codons. The tRNALeu gene with anticodon GAG is located from 5988 to 6072 in the A. aeolicus genome. Its sequence is GCCGGAGTGGCGGAACTGGCAGACGCGCCGTCTTGAGGGGACGGTGCCCTTTACGGGCGTGCGGGTTCACTCCCGCCTCCGGCA (anticodon is in bold italic). The cloning of the A. aeolicus tRNALeu gene was performed as outlined previously (22Wu J. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica (in Chinese). 1999; 31: 226-232Google Scholar). Six complementary and overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the gene and its complementary chain were synthesized chemically by Sangon Company, Shanghai Branch. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, hybridized, and ligated between the EcoRI and PstI sites of pTrc99B and then introduced by transformation into E. coli strain MT102. Transformants were checked by DNA sequencing, the cells were grown, and the crude tRNA extracts containing the A. aeolicus tRNALeu were isolated as previously described (22Wu J. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica (in Chinese). 1999; 31: 226-232Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying A. aeolicus and E. colitRNALeu genes were prepared by procedures described previously (20Li T., Li, Y. Guo N. Wang E. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9084-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). T7 transcripts were generated in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmnucleotide triphosphates, 10 mm 5′-GMP,BstNI-digested template DNA (50 μg/ml), 1 unit/ml of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 2 mg/ml of pure T7 RNA polymerase for 4 h. The transcripts were purified by 20% (W/V) denaturing PAGE and annealed by heating for 2 min in 2 mm MgCl2at 75 °C and allowed to slow cool to 30 °C. The accepting activities of A. aeolicus and E. colitRNALeu transcripts were 760 and 650 pmol/A 260, respectively. The tRNALeutranscripts were incubated with calf intestinal phosphatase for 3 h at 37 °C to remove the 5-terminal phosphate groups. This was followed by a phenol:chloroform extraction. Then, the labeling of the T7 transcripts was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled tRNALeu transcripts were extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol and suspended in an appropriate volume of water. The genomic DNA from A. aeolicus was a gift from Dr. R Huber (University of Regensburg, Germany). The genes encoding α and β subunits of LeuRS were amplified by PCR. The α subunit gene withNdeI and HindIII site at its ends was inserted into pBCP378 using the same sites. The gene of β subunit withNdeI and SacI sites at its ends was ligated into pBCP378 or pSML104 using the same sites. E. coli TG1 was transformed with the recombinant plasmids. The recombinant vectors pBCP378-lrsa, pBCP378-lrsb were used to overexpress the individual subunits. To overexpress the heterodimeric form αβ-LeuRS, both pBCP378-lrsa and PSML104-lrsb were co-transformed into the E. coli TG1 cells. Transformants harboring the recombinant plasmids were grown in 25 ml of LB with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 20 μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 37 °C to stationary phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 4 ml of disruption buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA), and sonicated for 6 × 20 s at 15 W with a high-intensity ultrasonic processor (375W model). The crude extract was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 40 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Clarified extract was heated to 75 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 40 min. For purification, 4 liters of cells were treated as described above. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a (3 × 18 cm) DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with lysis buffer and eluted with a potassium phosphate gradient from 50 to 500 mm. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, and applied to a (3.5 × 18 cm) Blue-Sepharose CL-6B column. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer (from 50 to 500 mm). The fractions containing A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS or its β subunit were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 50% glycerol. Protein-tRNA interactions were examined by a gel-shift assay. Increasing concentrations of the β subunit were mixed with 0.05–0.1 μm 5′-[32P]tRNALeu in a 20-μl volume containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 unit/μl RNasin at 20 °C for 30 min. A 20% sucrose solution (3 μl) containing tracer dyes was added immediately before loading. The final mixture was then loaded on a 1-mm thick, 8% native polyacrylamide gel in the reaction buffer for 3 h at 100 V at 15 °C. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and exposed. The molecular mass of αβ-LeuRS from A. aeolicus was determined by mass spectrometry analysis using an electrospray ionization-Quadrupole Ion Traps-mass spectrometry apparatus. The molecular mass of the β subunit and its complex with tRNALeu was determined by HPLC on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. Protein samples at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml (for A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS) or 0.2 mg/ml (for β subunit) were analyzed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter with nitrogen purge at room temperature. A 1-mm path-length cuvette was used, and spectra were accumulated over five scans. Estimation of the secondary structure by CD spectrum was calculated according to the method from Yang (23Yang T.J. Wu C.S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). ATP-PPi exchange and aminoacylation activities of LeuRS were measured at 37 °C as described (24Chen J.F. Guo N.N., Li, T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation activity was determined at 37 °C in the reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm tRNALeu, and appropriate amounts of [14C]-labeled amino acids and enzymes. The kinetic constants of enzymes were determined using various concentrations of the relevant substrates. The same assays were carried out at 60 °C. Pre-steady state kinetics was performed with a quenched-flow apparatus according to Ref. 25Gangloff J. Schutz A. Dirheimer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. The rate of aminoacylation was measured at 40 °C in the following reaction mixture: 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 30 mm KCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 3.34 μm tRNA, 5.67 μm [14C]leucine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm GSH, and 1.66 μm A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS. The titration was performed according to method of A. Fersht (26Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L.E. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the amino acid activation reaction, when the initial concentration of ATP ([ATP]0) was much higher than that of A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS ([E]0), the number of moles of aminoacyl adenylate/mole of A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS, that is the number of active sites (n), may be deduced from the following equation: [ATP]t = [ATP]0 –n[E]0 – n[E]0k2 t, where [ATP]t is the concentration of ATP at time t, k2 is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the hydrolysis of the aminoacyl adenylate complex. The intercept (I) of the plot of [ATP]t against t is [ATP]0 –n[E]0. The n may be calculated by the equation: n = ([ATP]0 − I)/[E]0 (26Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L.E. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The titration was performed as follows. 20 μm [γ-P32]ATP (20μCi/ml), 12 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm leucine, and 10 u/ml yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were incubated at 60 °C. Before adding LeuRS, a 15-μl aliquot of the mixture was withdrawn and added into 200 μl of 7% perchloric acid and 8% activated charcoal in water to determine the zero time radioactivity of ATP for calculation of the relationship between [ATP] and cpm of ATP. The reaction was initiated by adding A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS to a concentration of 5 μm([E]0). 15-μl aliquots were taken and quenched in various time intervals (t) as described above. The quenched samples were filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filter, washed, and dried. The [γ-P32]ATP adsorbed on the charcoal was counted to obtain [ATP]t values. The number of active sites was calculated through above equation. The plasmid containing A. aeolicus tRNALeu (GAG) gene was constructed and used to transform E. coli MT102. In this strain, which overexpresses tRNALeu, the charge of [14C]leucine on the tRNA reaches 724 pmol/A 260. As the accepting activity of pure tRNALeu was considered to be 1600 pmol/A 260, tRNALeu should be about 45% of the total tRNA. This crude overexpressed A. aeolicustRNALeu was used to assay A. aeolicus LeuRS activity and binding property. The low content of endogeneous E. coli tRNALeu was considered to be negligible compared with the overexpressed A. aeolicus tRNALeu. When compared with the sequence of Thermus thermophilus LeuRS, it appears that, except for 30 residues at the C-terminal end, the α subunit sequence corresponds to the 580 first residues of the T. thermophilus LeuRS (Fig.1). Except for the first 40 residues, the β subunit sequence is similar to the peptide fragment 636–878 ofT. thermophilus LeuRS. Thus, at the junction of the two peptides, two additional domains of about 30 and 40 residues may form some connecting structure between the two subunits (Fig. 1). Theoretically, the molecular masses of α and β subunits are 74.0 and 33.5 kDa, respectively. The genes encoding α and β subunits of LeuRS were amplified by PCR. Both DNA fragments were ligated into pBCP378 or pSML104. The resulting recombinant vectors, pBCP378-lrsa, pBCP378-lrsb and PSML104-lrsb were used to transform E. coli TG1. After growth of the different transformants and disruption of the cells, a strong signal corresponding to the β subunit was detected by SDS-PAGE (lane 5, Fig.2 A). However the α subunit was not detected in the crude extract (lane 4, Fig.2 A). The β subunit was purified to 85% homogeneity by heating the crude extract at 75 °C for 30 min and centrifugation (lane 6, Fig. 2 A).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of A. aeolicus LeuRS. A, expression of the α and β subunits of A. aeolicus LeuRS. Crude E. coli extracts expressing the different subunits of the A. aeolicus LeuRS were separated by SDS-PAGE and compared with protein standards (97.4, 66.2, 55.0, 42.7, 40.0, and 31.0 kDa (fromtop to bottom, lane 1) and to a non-overproducing strain (lane 7, 30 μg of crude extract). Bacterial extracts expressing both subunits were loaded before and after one-step heating (lane 2, 30 μg of crude extract;lane 3, 5 μg of heated extract). The α subunit could not be expressed alone (lane 4, 30 μg of crude extract) as opposed to the β subunit (lane 5, 30 μg of crude extract and lane 6, 5 μg of heated extract). The arrowsindicate the positions of α subunit (top) and β subunit (low). B, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified A. aeolicus LeuRS (lane 2, 5 μg of purified protein) compared with protein standards (lane 1, 66.7, 43, and 31.0 kDa from top to bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To overexpress the heterodimeric form αβ-LeuRS, both pBCP378-lrsa and PSML104-lrsb were co-transformed into theE. coli cells. In these conditions, the α and β subunits were detected in the crude extract (lanes 2 and 3, Fig.2 A). A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS was purified to about 70% homogeneity after heating at 75 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation. Thus, in vivo, in the presence of the β subunit, the α subunit was stable and thermostable. After growth of the transformants in 4 liters of Luria broth medium (16 g of wet cells) about 20 mg of purified A. aeolicusαβ-LeuRS was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified A. aeolicusαβ-LeuRS was 95% homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE (lane 2, Fig. 2 B). A. aeolicus LeuRS consisting of α and β subunits was active, and the molecular mass of the enzyme was 107.5 kDa as measured by mass spectrometry determination. These data demonstrate that A. aeolicus LeuRS is a hybrid dimer active in its dimeric form. To understand why the α subunit was unstable, the secondary structures of A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS and its β subunit alone were compared for their CD spectra. The parameters of their secondary structures were estimated, as summarized in TableI (23Yang T.J. Wu C.S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The β subunit contains more α helix and β sheet, less β turn and random thanA. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS. Thus, the β subunit is more structured and probably more rigid than A. aeolicusαβ-LeuRS, probably due to the association with the α subunit, which is probably less structured and less stable than the β subunit as suggested by its inability to be overexpressed in vivo.Table ICD estimates of A. aeolicus αβ-LeuRS and its β subunitProtein secondary structureαβ-LeuRSβ Subunitα-Helix33.6%38.8%β-Sheet26.7%31.7%β-Turn5.9%0.9%Random33.8%28.6%The concentration of A. aeolicus LeuRS and β subunit was 0.6 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Open table in a new tab The concentration of A. aeolicus LeuRS and β subunit was 0.6 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Molecular mass of the β subunit was 33.5 kDa as determined by HPLC gel filtration. It means that β subunit is a monomer when expressed independently from the α subunit. However, the β subunit is inactive and cannot bind ATP and leucine as shown by competition assay and gel-shift assay (data not shown). By gel-shift assay we detected the binding of the β subunit to the tRNALeu from A. aeolicus (Fig.3 A). The binding constant,K d, calculated by screening the area of the bands was about 20 ± 3 μm, an unusually high value for an aaRS:tRNA interaction. This is in contrast with theK d value measured for the whole enzyme (0.5 μm, data not shown). In general, theK d of aaRS for the cognate tRNA is <2 μm, which means that the binding of the β subunit to tRNALeu is not very tight. Interestingly, a supershift appears on increasing the concentration of unlabeled tRNALeu during the competition assay (Fig. 3 B). Thus, it seems that the β subunit may form two kinds of complexes, the upper band corresponding to the β subunit with a probable tRNA/enzyme stoichiometry of 2/1. Alternatively, the β subunit can bind labeled E. coli tRNALeu (data not shown) and tRNAArg (Fig. 3 C) with two forms also. The assay of specificity was extended to tDNA encoding A. aeolicus tRNALeu, the tDNA competed with the homologous A. aeolicus tRNALeu, but the large complex did not appear (Fig. 3 D). To confirm the existence of two tRNA binding sites on the β subunit the complex was generated according to the experimental conditions of Fig. 3 and analyzed by gel filtration on HPLC. Two species were separated, with M r of 63.5 and 93.3 kDa, corresponding to the β subunit associated with one or two tRNALeu respectively. Thus, the isolated β subunit exhibits two tRNA binding sites, one of them being nonspecific at the level of its tRNA recognition specificity. At 60 °C, the plot of [ATP]t against t was a straight line (Fig.4 A). The number of active sites was 1.1 ± 0.1 (the value averaged from three independent determinations), which is consistent with that from E. coliLeuRS (27Granda S. Hustedt H. Flossdorf J. Kula M.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 24: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The specific activities and kinetic parameters of A. aeolicusαβ-LeuRS in amino acid activation and aminoacylation reactions were assayed at 37 °C in order to directly compare them with those ofE. coli LeuRS under reaction conditions, which are optimized for that of the E. coli enzyme. The E. coli and A. aeolicus LeuRS display a remarkable difference in the aminoacylation reaction conditions. For the A. aeolicus enzyme, the magnesium/ATP ratio required for optimal activation and charging reaction is 3 (8 mmexcess of free magnesium), an unusually high value for a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Compared with the stoichiometric ratio of magnesium/ATP used for the E. coli enzyme (28Shi J.P. Lin S.X. Miao F. Wang Y.L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica. 1988; 20: 76-81Google Scholar), this suggested that additional magnesium ions are used by the thermophilic enzyme to stabilize the productive enzyme-substrate complex. In the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) values for leucine and ATP were 1.3 and 360 μm, respectively, and k cat were 3.5 and 3.3 s−1, respectively. Compared with the E. coli LeuRS, these values only reach 2% of the level of activity (Table II, (24Chen J.F. Guo N.N., Li, T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)). In the aminoacylation reaction, K m values for leucine, ATP, and tRNALeu (A. aeolicus) were 6.4, 550, and 0.38 μm; k cat values were 0.39 s−1 (Table II). Except K m for ATP in aminoacylation reaction, all of the constants were lower than those forE. coli LeuRS (Table II) (24Chen J.F. Guo N.N., Li, T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L.

In amino acid activation, theK m values for both leucine and ATP were identical to those at 37 °C. In the aminoacylation reaction, theK m value for leucine was unchanged, whereas theK m value for ATP was slightly increased.

https://openalex.org/W2075790671,"We have shown previously that association of reversible active site ligands induces a conformational change in an omega loop (Ω loop), Cys69–Cys96, of acetylcholinesterase. The fluorophore acrylodan, site-specifically incorporated at positions 76, 81, and 84, on the external portion of the loop not lining the active site gorge, shows changes in its fluorescence spectrum that reflect the fluorescent side chain moving from a hydrophobic environment to become more solvent-exposed. This appears to result from a movement of the Ω loop accompanying ligand binding. We show here that the loop is indeed flexible and responds to conformational changes induced by both active center and peripheral site inhibitors (gallamine and fasciculin). Moreover, phosphorylation and carbamoylation of the active center serine shows distinctive changes in acrylodan fluorescence spectra at the Ω loop sites, depending on the chirality and steric dimensions of the covalently conjugated ligand. Capping of the gorge with fasciculin, although it does not displace the bound ligand, dominates in inducing a conformational change in the loop. Hence, the ligand-induced conformational changes are distinctive and suggest multiple loop conformations accompany conjugation at the active center serine. The fluorescence changes induced by the modified enzyme may prove useful in the detection of organophosphates or exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors.

AChE is one of most efficient enzymes known with hydrolysis of its natural substrate reaching diffusion-controlled limits. Inhibitors of AChE target two sites in the active site gorge: an active center at the base of a narrow gorge 20 Å in depth and a peripheral site at the gorge rim (4Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). At the active center, a residue triad (Ser203-Glu334-His447) promotes acyl transfer and hydrolysis of the substrate, whereas Trp86 at the gorge base primarily stabilizes choline moiety of the substrate through a cation-π interaction. Active site inhibitors block substrate binding either by associating with the tryptophan in the choline binding site (tacrine and edrophonium) or by reacting irreversibly with catalytic serine (carbamates and organophosphates). Peripheral site inhibitors, such as propidium and gallamine, inhibit catalytic activity through both steric blockade and allosterically altering catalytic efficiency of the active center residues (4Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 5Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1966; 2: 369-392PubMed Google Scholar, 6Berman H.A. Taylor P.

To elucidate the conformational changes associated with mechanistically distinctive inhibitors, we developed a means for physically monitoring the conformation of purified mouse AChE by site-directed labeling with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore, acrylodan. Six single cysteine mutants were prepared for acrylodan conjugation (Fig. 1). Three were on the Cys69–Cys96 omega loop (Ω loop) flanking the active site gorge: L76C near the tip of the loop, and E81C and E84C on the outer surface not lining the gorge. Two residues on the opposing face of the gorge, H287C and Y124C, were selected, solvent exposure of which would be expected to be occluded by bound ligands that extend to the outer reaches of the gorge. A final residue, A262C, on a distal disulfide loop and whose temperature coefficient (B factor) would indicate flexible loop movement (9Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol.

This residue is not anticipated to be influenced by ligand-induced changes in conformation. Our previous study showed a bathochromic emission shift of acrylodan conjugated at Ω loop residues 76, 81, and 84 upon binding of inhibitors, such as tacrine, edrophonium, huperzine A, andm-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)trifluoromethyl acetophenone, that interact with Trp 86 in the choline binding site (11Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Acrylodan fluorescence is exquisitely sensitive to dipole moment of the surrounding solvent or macromolecular milieu (12Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed.

This pattern likely results from a concerted movement in the Cys69–Cys96 Ω loop upon binding of reversible inhibitors. Because a conformational change in the Ω loop induced by ligand is not reflected in the crystal structures of the AChEs studied to date (9Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P.

Sussman J. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we developed a means to measure directly conformation and solvent exposure in and around the active center gorge. In this study, we investigate the conformational changes reflected in acrylodan fluorescence for peripheral site inhibitors and for a congeneric series of carbamates and organophosphates that react covalently with the active center serine. Fluorescence measurements, combined with kinetics of inhibitor association, reveal a linkage between inhibition and a conformational change in the Ω loop. Ligand conjugation at the active center and association at the peripheral site induce distinctive conformational changes in the loop. Because the character of the spectral changes is dependent on chirality and dimensions of the ligand as well as its site of association, the Ω loop exhibits considerable flexibility in the solution conformations of AChE. Acetylthiocholine iodide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DFP, dithiothreitol, physostigmine, gallamine, neostigmine, and paraoxon were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acrylodan was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), echothiophate was obtained from Ayerst Laboratories (Philadelphia, PA), and DDVP was obtained from Bayer Inc. (West Haven, CT). Rivastigmine was obtained as the commercial product (Exelon) from Novartis. Fasciculin 2 (purified from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps) was a gift of Dr. Pascale Marchot (University of Marseille, Marseille, France). Drs. Yacov Ashani and Bhupendra P. Doctor (Walter Reed Army Research Center, Washington, DC) kindly provided 7-[[(methylethoxy)phosphinyl]oxyl]-1-methylquinolinium iodide (MEPQ) and procainamide-linked Sepharose CL-4B resin.

Mouse AChE was produced by transfection of expression plasmid (pCDNA3, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing an encoding cDNA where the AChE sequence was terminated at position 548. The plasmid was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Cells were selected with G418 to obtain stable producing cell lines, and AChE was expressed as a secreted soluble enzyme in serum-free media (21Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated by standard mutagenesis procedures, and cassettes containing the mutation were subcloned into pCDNA3 (21Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Nucleotide sequences of the cassettes were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing to ensure that spurious mutations were not introduced. Affinity chromatography permitted one-step purification of AChE. From 4–6 liters of media, mutant and wild type enzyme were purified in quantities ranging between 5 and 25 mg, as previously described (22Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C.

Purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE and by specific activity determination. The cysteine-substituted enzymes show kinetics of acetylcholine hydrolysis similar to wild type enzyme (11Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were pretreated with 0.25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature to ensure reduction of the introduced cysteine. Excess dithiothreitol was removed by use of a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. Conditions for acrylodan labeling and stoichiometry estimates have been described previously (11Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Stoichiometry of labeling of the various preparations, estimated from a comparison of enzyme concentration by protein (280 nm) to acrylodan (360–380 nm) absorbance, ranged as follows: L76C, 0.7–1.0; E81C, 0.77–1.0; E84C, 0.77–1.0; Y124C, 0.78–1.0; A262C, 0.69–0.92; and H287C, 0.78–1.0. Specificity of labeling was assessed by comparison of areas under the fluorescence emission curves for acrylodan-treated mutant and wild type enzymes. Specific labeling for each mutant was: L76C, 72–85%; E81C, 81–92%; E84C, 85–93%; Y124C, 83–92%; A262C, 77–93%; H287C, 70–82%. Picomolar concentrations of enzyme in 0.01% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were reacted with covalent inhibitor in the absence of substrate at 25 °C. Typically, four inhibitor concentrations were used. Inhibition was monitored by measuring residual enzyme activity by removal of aliquots during the course of the reaction. Bimolecular rate constants (ki) were determined by the plot of pseudo first order rate constant (k obs) against inhibitor concentration (25Radic Z. Gibney G. Kawamoto S. MacPhee-Quigley K. Bongiorno C. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9760-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Steady state emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jobin Yvon/Spex FluoroMax II spectrofluorometer (Instrument S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ) with the excitation and emission bandwidths set at 5 nm. The excitation wavelength for acrylodan was set at 359 nm, and emission was monitored between 420 and 600 nm. Spectral changes in the presence of irreversible inhibitors were determined by allowing the reaction of the acrylodan-labeled enzymes to proceed until ≥99% inhibition was achieved. In the case of inhibitors with chromogenic leaving groups, the inhibited enzyme was passed through a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove the leaving group. Quantum yield changes in presence of MEPQ and paraoxon were determined by measuring the concentration of labeled enzyme by tryptophan emission and area of acrylodan fluorescence emission curve before and after organophosphate conjugation. Association of echothiophate and neostigmine with acrylodan-labeled E81C and E84C was assessed from the kinetics of change in fluorescence at 470 and 477 nm, respectively, following addition of a stoichiometric excess of inhibitor at several concentrations. Data were fitted to a single exponential approach to equilibrium. Bimolecular rate constants (ki) were determined by the plot of pseudo first order rate constant (k obs) against inhibitor concentration (25Radic Z. Gibney G. Kawamoto S. MacPhee-Quigley K. Bongiorno C. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9760-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Association of rivastigmine with acrylodan-labeled E81C was monitored from the kinetics of the increase in fluorescence at 460 nm. To ensure the observed change in fluorescence upon rivastigmine association was caused by carbamoylation and not reversible binding of rivastigmine, the enzyme was reacted with the fluorescent carbamoylating agent, M7C, to ascertain the concentration of residual reactive serines (26Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4622-4633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We determined the bimolecular rate constants (ki) for echothiophate, neostigmine, and rivastigmine with unmodified and modified mAChE (Table I). For the wild type, E81C, and E84C mutant enzymes, the constants (ki) were obtained from measurements of enzyme activity, whereas changes in fluorescent signal were used to monitor reaction with the acrylodan-modified enzyme. A typical example of monitoring of the fluorescence change is shown in Fig.2. The data in Table I show that substitution of cysteine at the 81-position does not affect the carbamoylation and phosphorylation rates, whereas the modification at the 84-position causes a 3–4-fold reduction in rate. Upon modification of the introduced cysteine with acrylodan, reaction rates are reduced 3–4-fold compared with wild type following conjugation at the 81-position, whereas the reduction is 40–50-fold upon conjugation at the 84-position. It is important to note that the magnitude of these reductions in carbamoylation or phosphorylation rates by mutation and conjugation at each position is nearly the same, despite the inhibitors differing in their reactivity by a few orders of magnitude. In the case of rivastigmine, we measured the reaction rates by competition with excess M7C (26Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4622-4633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and achieved similar kinetics of inhibition. This indicates that the spectral shift produced by rivastigmine likely reflects a conformational change induced by progressive carbamoylation rather than formation of a reversible complex.Table IBimolecular rate constants for reaction of wild type and mutated AChE with echothiophate, neostigmine, and rivastigmine in the presence and absence of fluorescent (acrylodan) labelingEnzymeEchothiophateNeostigmineRivastigminek ik i,WT/k i, mutantk ik i,WT/k i, mutantk ik i,WT/k i, mutant104m−1min−1104m−1min−1104m−1min−1Wild typeaKinetic constants derived from measurements of inhibition of acetylthiocholine catalysis.235 ± 17571 ± 7372 ± 8E81CaKinetic constants derived from measurements of inhibition of acetylthiocholine catalysis.199 ± 141.2566 ± 81372 ± 21E81C-acrylodanbKinetic constants derived from intensity of the fluorescence signals.71 ± 103.3134 ± 194.398 ± 83.8E84CaKinetic constants derived from measurements of inhibition of acetylthiocholine catalysis.86 ± 42.7175 ± 33.395 ± 63.9E84C-acrylodanbKinetic constants derived from intensity of the fluorescence signals.4.8 ± 0.25015 ± 0.4399 ± 0.441Data shown as means ± standard deviation typically from three experiments.

Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrback K. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, New York1960: 501-520Google Scholar), presumably generating a pentavalent trigonal bipyramidal intermediate before dissociation of leaving group. The resulting phosphorylated complex resembles the tetrahedral transition states of acylation and deacylation of the trigonal esters. The diethylphosphoryl conjugate at the active site serine formed by reaction with echothiophate produces very little perturbation at positions 76, 262, and 287, consistent with their positions being well removed from the phosphorylation site (Table II). A bathochromic emission shift is observed at position 84, although of smaller magnitude when compared with the shift induced by other ligands (TablesTable II, Table III, Table IV, Table V). Interestingly, large hypsochromic shifts and enhancements of quantum yield are observed at positions 81 and 124. This pattern appears to be unusual, because the reversible active center ligands studied previously (11Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the dimethylphosphoryl conjugate formed from DDVP, which yields a phosphoryl serine with one methylene group shorter than echothiophate, confer little shift at position 124 and a large bathochromic shift at position 81.Table IIEffect of organophosphorates on fluorescence emission parameters of mouse AChE mutants labeled with acrylodanData are shown as mean values of at least three determinations.

The fluorescence emission spectrum of (R p)-DMBMP conjugate with E81C is shown in Fig. 3. To confirm that the chromic shift is a result of conjugation of diethylphosphoryl group, not the retention of the thiocholine leaving group in the gorge, we examined the effect of paraoxon conjugation on chromic shift. Following reaction with the active site serine, paraoxon produces the same diethylphosphoryl conjugate as echothiophate. However, its leaving group is a neutral aromatic moiety rather than the cationic moiety of echothiophate. Because a similar spectral shift follows paraoxon conjugation, the conformational change is induced by the conjugated phosphorate, rather than being influenced by binding of residual leaving group. If we extend additional methylene units to the diisopropyl phosphoryl conjugate formed by DFP, we observe a chromic shifts at the 81- and 84-positions similar to the diethylphosphoryl conjugate. However, the hypsochromic shift at the 124-position becomes slightly smaller for the diisopropyl phosphoryl conjugate. Measurements were made immediately after reaction to preclude aging (i.e. spontaneous loss of an alkoxy moiety rendering an anionic conjugate) of the diisopropyl phosphoryl moiety (28Aldridge W.N. Reiner E. Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates: Interactions of Esterases with Esters of Organophosphorus and Carbamic Acids. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1972Google Scholar). To compare phosphoryl and phosphonyl conjugates of similar dimensions, racemic MEPQ was used to generate an ethyl methylphosphonyl conjugate. Kinetic studies show an enantiomeric preference of MEPQ, where presumably the S penantiomer reacts ∼10-fold faster than the R penantiomer. 2Z. Radić, unpublished observation. Hence, reaction with a stoichiometric excess of MEPQ should ensure one enantiomer covalently reacts preferentially with the enzyme. No discernable emission changes are observed at residues 262 and 287. Similar to DDVP, a bathochromic shift is observed for acrylodan at both positions 81 and 84. A moderate hypsochromic shift is observed at the 124-position, and very small change at the 76-position. Table III also shows the changes in acrylodan emission for a series ofS p methylphosphonates with increasing alkoxy substituent dimensions. Because the absolute stereochemistry of the methylphosphonates is known (29Berman H.A. Leonard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3942-3950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chiral S pmethylphosphonates will direct their phosphonyl oxygen toward the oxyanion hole, the small methylphosphonyl moiety will be directed to the acyl pocket, and the more bulky alkoxy group directed to choline binding site (30Hosea N.A. Berman H.A. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11528-11536Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For the three S p enantiomers, very little or no change in emission maxima for acrylodan at positions 124, 262, and 287 is discerned. Similar to reversible active site ligands that interact with choline binding site (11Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), bathochromic shifts are observed at the Ω loop positions with the largest shift at E84C, an intermediate value at E81C, and only small change at L76C. The ethyl methylphosphonyl conjugate, which contains the smallest alkoxy moiety among S p conjugates, induces the smallest bathochromic shift at the 81- and 84-positions. R p alkyl methylphosphonates react far more slowly with the enzyme than the S p enantiomers (30Hosea N.A. Berman H.A. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11528-11536Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and we use formation of the (R p)-3,3-dimethylbutyl methylphosphonyl enzyme as an example. Formation of initial reversible complex can be detected by an immediate reduction in quantum yield of acrylodan at 81 with little change in emission maximum (Fig.3). This is followed by a progressive hypsochromic shift that reflects the covalent reaction with the active center serine. The isoemissive point at 510 nm, evident through the course of the slow reaction, likely reflects the presence of two species (i.e. the reversible DMBMP-TCh … AChE complex and the conjugated DMBMP-AChE being the dominant species in the progressive reaction). The resulting hypsochromic shift of conjugated acrylodan to 459 nm markedly contrasts with theS p enantiomer with its bathochromic shift in emission spectrum. These two enantiomers provide the critical clue for linking fluorescence emission maxima at the 81-position to the characteristics of structural perturbations of the Ω loop. Formation of a carbamoyl serine conjugate of AChE affords an alternative means for forming a relatively stable modified enzyme conjugate (27Wilson I.B. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrback K. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, New York1960: 501-520Google Scholar). Kinetic studies and crystallographic evidence show the carbamoyl oxygen of the covalent conjugate directed toward the oxyanion hole, and the alkyl carbamoyl group pointing toward the acyl pocket (25Radic Z.

https://openalex.org/W2013210070,"Sex-specific gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated in part by the Doublesex (DSX) transcription factor. Male- and female-specific splicing isoforms share a novel DNA-binding domain, designated the DM motif. This domain is conserved among a newly recognized family of vertebrate transcription factors involved in developmental patterning and sex determination. The DM motif consists of an N-terminal zinc module and a disordered C-terminal tail, hypothesized to fold on specific DNA binding as a recognition α-helix. Truncation of the tail does not perturb the structure of the zinc module but impairs DNA binding and DNA-dependent dimerization. Chemical protein synthesis and alanine scanning mutagenesis are employed to test the contributions of 13 side chains to specific DNA binding. Selected arginine or lysine residues in the zinc module were substituted by norleucine, an isostere that maintains the aliphatic portion of the side chain but lacks a positive charge. Arginine or glutamine residues in the tail were substituted by alanine. Evidence is obtained that both the zinc module and C-terminal tail contribute to a bipartite DNA-binding surface. Conserved arginine and glutamine residues in the tail are required for high affinity DNA recognition, consistent with its proposed role as a nascent recognition α-helix."
https://openalex.org/W2058371933,"Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are integral membrane proteins, composed of four subunits, each comprising six (S1–S6) transmembrane segments. S1–S4 comprise the voltage-sensing domain, and S5–S6 with the linker P-loop forms the ion conducting pore domain. During activation, S4 undergoes structural rearrangements that lead to the opening of the channel pore and ion conduction. To obtain details of these structural changes we have used the engineered disulfide bridge approach. For this we have introduced the L361C mutation at the extracellular end of S4 of the Shaker K channel and expressed the mutant channel inXenopus oocytes. When exposed to mild oxidizing conditions (ambient oxygen or copper phenanthroline), Cys-361 formed an intersubunit disulfide bridge as revealed by the appearance of a dimeric band on Western blotting. As a consequence, the mutant channel suffered a significant loss in conductance (measured by two-electrode voltage clamp). Removal of native cysteines failed to prevent the disulfide formation, indicating that Cys-361 forms a disulfide with its counterpart in the neighboring subunit. The effect was voltage-dependent and occurred during channel activation after Cys-361 has been exposed to the extracellular phase. Although the disulfide bridge reduced the maximal conductance, it caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the conductance-voltage relationship and reduced the deactivation kinetics of the channel. The latter two effects suggest stabilization of the open state of the channel.

The pore domain forms the water-filled, potassium ion-selective pore across the plasma membrane of the cell, whereas the voltage-sensing domain regulates the opening and closing of activation gates situated at the cytoplasmic end of the pore domain (1Sigworth F.J.

The gates are closed at negative (resting) membrane potentials but open upon membrane depolarization to allow K+ ions to enter the pore. Due to the lack of three-dimensional structural data for any of the Kv channel proteins, it is not clear how the voltage sensor detects changes in membrane potential and transmits the signal to the activation gates. Kv channels are made up of four subunits, each of which contains six transmembrane segments, named S1–S6. The S5–S6 and the “P-loop” connecting these segments form the central pore domain in Kv channels (2Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The structure of the pore domain is thought to be similar to that of the bacterial potassium channel, KcsA, whose structure has been determined by x-ray diffraction (5Doyle D.A. Morais C.J.

The remaining transmembrane segments, in particular the S2 to S4 segments, are thought to comprise the voltage-sensing domain of the channel (2Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,9Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys.

Of the four segments, S4 plays a pivotal role. When the membrane is depolarized, it moves out of the membrane, thereby carrying its charged residues (arginine and lysine), known as gating charges, across the membrane electric field (11Larsson H.P.

It is this movement that appears to trigger the opening of the activation gates. Molecular modeling (10Durell S.R. Hao Y. Guy H.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 263-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and mutagenic (18Monks S.A. Needleman D.J. Miller C. J. Gen.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) studies suggest that one face of the S4 segment is in direct contact with the pore domain, whereas the rest is surrounded by S1–S3, which seem to protect the charged S4 segment from the energetically unfavorable lipid environment by providing counter charges. Because of these extensive interactions that S4 appears to be engaged in, when S4 moves one would expect major changes in residue-residue contacts with the neighboring helices. Indirect evidence indicates that the S4 movement is accompanied by changes in the electrostatic interactions between its positive charges and the negatively charged residues present in the S2 and S3 segments (21Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Lin M.A. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Defining the residue-residue contacts between S4 and the segments with which it is in contact and how they change during channel activation is critical for an appreciation of the molecular mechanism by which S4 is able to sense changes in membrane potential and transmit the signal to the pore domain. Toward this end, we set out to use the engineered disulfide approach. This approach allows determination of the residue-residue contacts within the three-dimensional context of a protein (22Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and also allows structural changes underlying the activation of a protein to be elucidated (23Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The approach involves the introduction of pairs of cysteine residues at positions that are thought to lie in close proximity and then investigating which cysteine pairs can be induced to form a disulfide bridge. The formation of disulfide bridges will often impair or alter the course of further motions, thereby producing a change in the functional properties of the protein (23Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the absence of measurable functional changes, however, disulfides can be detected biochemically (22Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Formation of a disulfide bridge is interpreted in terms of the residues being in close proximity. Any changes in the pattern of disulfide formation between the resting and activated states of the protein will reflect structural motions underlying the activation. The power of this approach has been illustrated with a number of membrane proteins, including potassium channels (23Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 24Krovetz H.S. van Dongen H.M. van Dongen A.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 117-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to identify which residues (from other segments) are in close proximity to Lys-361 of the Shaker potassium channel. We focused our attention on this residue because it occupies a critical position in the channel. It is located within the bilayer yet close to the extracellular boundary (11Larsson H.P. Baker O.S. Dhillon D.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Yusaf S.P. Wray D. Sivaprasadarao A. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 433: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Baker O.S. Larsson H.P. Mannuzzu L.M. Isacoff E.Y.

(Lond). 1999; 521: 315-326Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This means that when S4 moves out this residue is expected to sever all interactions with the neighboring membrane embedded segments. More importantly, its substitution with cysteine does not alter the net charge of S4, and hence would not be expected to disrupt electrostatic interactions that may be critical for the helical packing and normal functioning of the channel. Our results show that the mutant channels are susceptible to oxidation and that this oxidation occurs during depolarization of the membrane. Western blotting showed a dimeric Shaker protein band, indicating that oxidation leads to a disulfide bond between neighboring subunits. Removal of all the native cysteines failed to prevent the oxidation, which led us to suggest that the cysteine at position 361 forms an intersubunit disulfide with its counterpart from a neighboring subunit. Finally, we show that oxidation occurs at potentials where C-type inactivation is absent, indicating that the disulfide formation occurs during the activation of the mutant channel. Taken together, data presented here suggests that the N-terminal ends of the S4 segments move toward each other during the activation of the channel. Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the inactivation ball (residues 6–46)-removed Shaker potassium channel (25Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), or into its cysteine-less version (C-less Shaker), by site directed mutagenesis. cRNA transcripts were made fromHindIII-linearized plasmid (pKS-Bluescript) constructs containing the wild-type and mutant cDNA sequences using the MEGAScript kit (Ambion). All methods are as previously described (12Yusaf S.P. Wray D. Sivaprasadarao A. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 433: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Oocytes were isolated fromXenopus laevis and anesthetized by immersion in 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma). The animals were then killed by cervical dislocation. Dumont stage V or VI oocytes were selected, defolliculated, and injected with 5–20 ng of cRNA. The oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's solution containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT),1 and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with penicillin (10 units ml−1) and streptomycin (0.1 mg ml−1). Whole cell currents were recorded between 2 and 3 days after injection using the standard two-electrode voltage clamp configuration (12Yusaf S.P. Wray D. Sivaprasadarao A. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 433: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in Ringer's solution containing 82 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 5 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2. Microelectrodes were made from borosilicate glass and filled with 3 m KCl and had resistance that varied between 0.5 and 2.0mΩ. Steady-state currents were measured from the injected oocytes during brief (50–500 ms) depolarising steps to +40 mV, given at 10 s intervals, from a holding potential of −80 mV. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 4 kHz. To examine the effect of modification reagents, after measuring currents in Ringer's solution (control recordings), cells were superfused with 1–100 μm copper (II) phenanthroline (Cu (II) Phe, 1:3 ratio) or 100 μm para-chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (pCMBS) solution made up in Ringer's solution. Current (I)-voltage (V) relationships were measured from oocytes by stepping to positive potentials in 10 mV increments from a holding potential of −80 mV. The steps were applied at 10 s intervals and lasted for 50–500 ms. A series of 20 hyperpolarizing steps of 10 mV were also applied to measure leak currents. The leak currents were averaged and subtracted from the current records. The leak subtracted I-V data were fitted to the Boltzmann function, I/Imax = 1/(1+exp(V0.5−Vtest)/k), where V0.5 is the midpoint of half-maximal current and k is the slope factor (= RT/zF, where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, z is the valence, and F is the Faraday's constant). Activation time constants were calculated by fitting the upper 50% of the raising phase of the current data to an exponential function. Deactivation kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the tail current traces (measured in 100K (100 mmK+) Ringer's solution) to a bi-exponential decay equation. Oocytes expressing wild-type or L361C Shaker RNA were superfused with 100 μmCu (II) phe while the cells were repeatedly pulsed to +40 mV (from −80 mV), until the currents at +40 mV were maximally inhibited. Following this, oocytes were perfused with Ringer's solution supplemented with 2 mm EDTA (to chelate any metals that could potentially induce disulfides in the subsequent steps). The oocytes were then gently homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 83 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.9, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma, P-2714). Yolk and other debris were removed from the homogenate by repeated 10-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g (all operations were performed at 4 °C). The supernatant containing crude cell membranes was subjected to Western blotting. Oocyte membranes were solubilized in a buffer containing 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Equal amounts of membranes were treated with water (non-reduced) or 1 mm DTT (reduced) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7%) electrophoresis and transferred on to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Following transfer the membrane was soaked in 100% methanol for 15 s and allowed to dry for 30 min at 37 °C. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (10% nonfat dried milk in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline) containing a 1:500 dilution of affinity purified anti-Shaker antibodies, raised in the rabbit against the synthetic peptide, CKKSSLSESSSDIMDLDDGID (residues 517–536). The membranes were then washed three times for 2 min each in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation in blocking buffer containing a 1:2500 dilution of the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugate of goat-anti rabbit antiserum, Bio-Rad). Protein was detected using the ECL plus chemiluminiscence kit (AmershamBiosciences). Oxidation of closely placed cysteine thiols to a disulfide bridge can be enhanced by using Cu (II) Phe as a catalyst (22Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because the Shaker potassium channel contains 28 cysteines (7 cysteines per subunit) that could potentially form disulfides, we have first examined the effect of Cu (II) Phe on the wild-type channel. For this, the channel was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the effect of perfusion of Cu (II) Phe on the properties of the channel was examined by two-electrode voltage clamp. Fig.1 shows that the reagent has no effect on the current-voltage (I-V) relationship (Fig. 1 C) or the activation (Fig. 1, B and D) and deactivation (Fig. 1 E) kinetics of the channel. This suggests that under these experimental conditions, none of the native cysteines are close enough to undergo disulfide oxidation. An alternative explanation would be that any disulfides formed have no effect on the functional properties of the channel. Fig. 2 shows that the application of Cu (II) Phe to oocytes expressing the L361C mutant channel caused rapid inhibition (time constant, τ = 1.46 ± 0.16 min; n = 4) of currents. The inhibition could not be reversed by Cu (II) Phe removal alone (Ringer's wash), but could be fully reversed with DTT (1 mm) (Fig. 2 A), a reagent capable of reducing disulfide bridges to cysteines. The inhibition was incomplete, with about 30% of the currents remaining, when the inhibition reached a steady state. The residual currents displayed slowed activation kinetics (τa at +40 mV, before = 1.73 ± 0.1 ms; after Cu (II) Phe = 18.6 ± 1.9 ms) (Fig. 2, D and E) and a negative shift (13 mV) in the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2 C). There was also a significant decrease in the effective gating valence (z values were 1.96 ± 0.25 before and 1.08 ± 0.07 after oxidation). In addition, the deactivation kinetics were dramatically reduced (Fig. 2 F), with nearly 50% of the current remaining even after a 500 ms deactivating pulse at −110 mV. There was also some reduction in the rate of C-type inactivation (Fig. 2 E) (inactivation time constants measured at +40 mV before and after Cu (II) Phe treatment are 4.38 ± 0.3 s and 6.6 ± 0.7 s, respectively). These changes in the properties argue that the residual currents are not due to channels that escaped oxidation but due to channels modified by Cu (II) Phe. The reagent used in the above experiment has 100 μmCu2+ and 300 μm phenanthroline (commonly used concentrations) (22Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At this metal ion to chelating agent ratio (1:3), a significant amount of free, uncomplexed Cu2+ would be expected to be present in the reagent. To eliminate the possibility that the inhibition could be due to the binding of free copper (II) to cysteines, we have reduced the concentration of Cu (II) to 5 μm and increased the concentration of phenanthroline to 200 μm. The resulting reagent (ratio of Cu (II) to Phe 1:40), which would contain a negligible amount of free copper, showed no significant effect on the rate (1.46 ± 0.3 min with 1:3 Cu (II) Phe and 1.28 ± 0.18 min with 1:40 Cu (II) Phe) or the extent of inhibition (66.7 ± 4.0% with 1:3 Cu (II) Phe and 63.1 ± 4.4% with 1:40 Cu (II) Phe) of the mutant channel current (Fig.2 G), suggesting that the effect is not due to the binding of free Cu2+ to the cysteine at position 361. Free Cu2+ also inhibits, but the effect, unlike that produced by Cu (II) Phe, is fully reversed by Ringer's wash alone (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the observed inhibition is likely to be due to the oxidation of cysteine thiols to disulfides. Data in Fig. 2 showed that Cu (II) Phe produces very rapid oxidation of the mutant channel. We wondered if the ambient oxygen itself is adequate to induce oxidation. To test this, we have incubated the injected oocytes in ND-96 medium without DTT (we routinely included 50 μm DTT in our medium). These oocytes expressed low currents and displayed slow activation kinetics with a time constant (20.8 ± 1.2 ms) (Fig. 3,C and D) that is similar to the Cu (II) Phe oxidized mutant channel (18.6 ± 1.9 ms) (Fig. 2, D andE). Application of DTT caused a rapid increase in steady-state currents (Fig. 3 A), which was accompanied by an increase in the rate of activation (τa = 5.9 ± 2.8 ms) (Fig. 3, C and D). We found that when the oocytes were incubated in ND-96 lacking DTT currents at the end of DTT application were routinely higher than the currents seen at the beginning of the recording, although there were differences from oocyte to oocyte and batch to batch with respect to the extent of increase. These observations argue against the possibility that the reduced currents are due to oxidation of cysteine thiols to sulfinic and sulfonic acid derivatives, which generally require harsh oxidative conditions. The data thus support the idea that the oxidation of cysteines at position 361 leads to disulfides. As mentioned above, there are seven native cysteines in each of the subunits of the Shaker channel. Of these, three are in the transmembrane portion of the channel (at positions 245 in S2, 286 in S2, and 462 in S6), which are potentially available for disulfide bonding with the cysteine at position 361. The disulfide could be with a cysteine in the same subunit or from a neighboring subunit. Although detection of intrasubunit disulfides is hard by biochemical means, an intersubunit disulfide can be readily detected, as the size of the cross-linked species will increase 2-, 3-, or 4-times depending upon the manner in which the disulfide bridges occur. To investigate this, we treated the oocytes expressing the L361C mutant channels with Cu (II) Phe while pulsing to +40 mV and subjected the membranes isolated from them to Western blotting using an anti-Shaker antibody. Fig.4 A shows a dimeric band of ∼220 kDa (lane 3), which could be reduced to the monomeric form (∼110 kDa) with DTT (lane 4). No dimeric band was detectable with wild-type Shaker (lane 1) or L361C channels not treated with Cu (II) Phe (lane 5), indicating that S4 cysteines may form an intersubunit disulfide. Because we found that L361C channels undergo spontaneous oxidation when the oocytes are incubated in a medium lacking DTT (Fig. 3), we have also subjected the membranes isolated from these oocytes to Western blotting. Fig.4 B shows that dimers are indeed formed through spontaneous oxidation by the ambient oxygen. A significant amount of monomeric protein was also seen; this is consistent with the expectation that oxidation by ambient oxygen would be slow and incomplete. These data indicate that Cys-361 forms an intersubunit disulfide bridge with a cysteine in a neighboring subunit. To identify the cysteine with which the cysteine at position 361 forms the intersubunit disulfide bridge, we have introduced a single cysteine at position 361 of a Shaker mutant channel from which all native cysteines have been removed (referred to as C-less Shaker) (26Boland L.M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 694-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The idea was to subsequently introduce cysteines at the native positions and examine the effect of Cu (II) Phe. However, when we tested for the effect, Cu (II) Phe caused inhibition of currents through this mutant channel (Fig.5, A and B). Moreover, oocytes (expressing the Cys-361 C-less Shaker channels) incubated in DTT minus medium elicited currents that increased with the application of DTT (Fig. 5 D), indicating that ambient oxygen can also inhibit the mutant channel currents. The ability of DTT to reverse the effects of ambient oxygen and Cu (II) Phe suggests that, as in the wild-type channel, cysteines (at 361) in the C-less background also undergo oxidation to disulfides. The low levels of expression of C-less Shaker channels in oocytes prevented us from confirming this by Western blotting; thus, we were unable to completely rule out the possibility that oxidation might lead to products other than disulfides. As an alternative, we have tested the ability of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to reverse the effect of Cu (II) Phe. The mechanism of action of TCEP is different from that of DTT, and TCEP, unlike DTT, is highly specific for reducing disulfide bridges (27Ruegg U.T. Rudinger J. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 (E andF) shows that TCEP fully reversed the effect of Cu (II) Phe, confirming the fact that disulfide formation is the cause of inhibition by Cu (II) Phe. Because this mutant channel contains no cysteines other than those at position 361, we conclude that Cys-361 of one subunit forms a disulfide bridge with its counterpart in the neighboring subunit. We next investigated the voltage-dependence of current inhibition by Cu (II) Phe for the L361C mutant channel (Fig. 6). In these experiments, oocytes were held at various potentials (−120 mV to −20 mV) for 200 s while superfusing the oocyte with the reagent. This was followed by repeated pulsing to +40 mV (from a holding potential of −80 mV) to record the currents. Fig. 6 (A and B) shows that inhibition of currents through L361C was highly voltage-dependent and occurred with a V0.5(voltage at which 50% of the channels were inhibited) value of −77 mV and a slope factor of 3.08 ± 0.16 mV. The data suggest that it is during depolarization that S4 segments move close enough toward each other to result in a disulfide between the cysteines at position 361. It may be noted that the voltage-dependence is not due to the effect of the electric field on the reagent, because the reagent used here is a catalyst (neutral or slightly positive), which generates free radicals from the ambient oxygen. During depolarization the Δ(6–46) Shaker channel undergoes fast activation followed by slow C-type inactivation (2Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,28Olcese R. Latorre R. Toro L. Bezanilla F. Stefani E. J. Gen.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There is evidence that S4 undergoes distinct conformational changes during both these steps (29Loots E. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Loots E. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 623-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Gandhi C.S. Loots E. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus the observed disulfide bridge formation can occur during either of these steps. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we have followed C-type inactivation of L361C as a function of membrane voltage. As can be seen from Fig. 6 B, C-type inactivation occurs at much more (∼90 mV) positive potentials (V0.5 = 13.6 ± 1.4 mV) than disulfide cross-linking (V0.5 = −77 ± 0.17 mV), suggesting that oxidation to disulfides must have occurred during activation. To provide further evidence, we have allowed the channels to inactivate maximally (∼80% current loss) by using a long pulse to +40 mV and then applied Cu (II) Phe for 2 min while holding the cells at 0 mV to prevent recovery from inactivation (Fig.7). Washing with Ringer's solution reversed over 40% of the lost current. Because the Cu (II) Phe effect is not reversible by Ringer's solution, this reversal must represent recovery from inactivation. It also suggests that the inactivated channels were unaffected by Cu (II) Phe. Subsequent application of DTT produced further recovery from inhibition (∼20%), which might represent channels that have not undergone inactivation during the long inactivation pulse, and hence are susceptible to the Cu (II) Phe effect. Following maximal reversal of currents, when Cu (II) Phe was re-applied it produced the normal rapid inhibition (reversible by DTT), the magnitude (∼55%) of which is larger than that (20%) produced by the reagent when applied to channels during the long inactivating pulse. These data argue that cross-linking of adjacent cysteines at position 361 occurs during activation rather than during C-type inactivation. We also investigated whether the intersubunit disulfide formation occurs before or after S4 begins to move out of the membrane electric field. For this, we studied the movement of cysteine at position 361 out of the membrane bilayer, as a function of voltage, using pCMBS. pCMBS, a membrane-impermeable cysteine reagent, like the water-soluble methanethiosulphonate reagents (11Larsson H.P. Baker O.S. Dhillon D.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 13Yang N. Horn R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 213-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), reacts with S4 cysteines only when they move out of the membrane bilayer, thereby reporting the outward movement of an S4 residue (12Yusaf S.P. Wray D. Sivaprasadarao A. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 433: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The data (Fig. 6 B) show that the outward movement of the cysteine at position 361 begins at more negative potentials (by ∼30 mV) compared with the disulfide cross-linking, suggesting that the exposure of S4 to the extracellular phase may precede cross-linking. Previous studies (11Larsson H.P. Baker O.S. Dhillon D.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Yusaf S.P. Wray D.

(Lond). 1999; 521: 315-326Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that in response to membrane depolarization the S4 segment of the Shaker potassium channel moves out of the transmembrane field by exposing over 7 residues to the extracellular phase. It is believed that this movement is accompanied by changes in its interaction with the other segments of the channel that ultimately lead to the activation of the channel. To investigate this, we have used the engineered disulfide method (22Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), an approach that has been successfully used to reveal changes in residue-residue interactions during the activation of channels (23Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and receptors (35Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Our data reveal that during activation the intersubunit distance between the N-terminal ends of S4 decreases such that cysteines engineered at position 361 form an intersubunit disulfide. When the Shaker channel containing a cysteine at position 361 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and exposed to ambient oxygen or to the mild oxidising agent Cu (II) Phe, there was a reduction in the current flowing through the channel (Fig. 2). This was due to the formation of a disulfide bridge as the effect was reversed by DTT (Figs. 2 and 3) and TCEP (Fig. 5), and a dimeric band (Fig. 4) was detected when the oxidized L361C channel protein was subjected to Western blotting. The latter finding also indicates that the disulfide was formed between cysteines from neighboring subunits, rather than from within a subunit, of the channel. In an attempt to identify the cysteine with which Cys-361 forms the disulfide bridge, we have first examined the effect of Cu (II) Phe on the Shaker channel containing cysteines at position 361 but depleted of all native cysteines (Fig.5). Rather unexpectedly, this mutant was also inhibited by Cu (II) Phe. The most plausible interpretation of this finding is that the cysteine at position 361 forms an intersubunit disulfide with its counterpart in a neighboring subunit. We found that the intersubunit disulfide formation between the cysteines at position 361 does not occur at −90 mV, where the channels are in their closed state. Upon depolarization, however, they undergo rapid oxidation to disulfides (Fig. 6). These data suggest that in the closed state of the channel the 361 cysteines were not close to one another, but during depolarization, when the channel begins to open (and may also begin to inactivate), they move close enough to undergo disulfide oxidation. Previous studies (11Larsson H.P. Baker O.S. Dhillon D.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Yusaf S.P. Wray D.

(Lond). 1999; 521: 315-326Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that the cysteine at position 361 can be fully exposed to the extracellular phase at −90 mV (also see Fig. 6 B). This means that the cysteines from the neighboring subunits move toward each other's proximity after the residues have been exposed to the extracellular phase, i.e.after S4s have, at least partially, moved out of the membrane electric field. Consistent with this suggestion, we found that cross-linking reduces the effective gating charge (z) from 1.96 ± 0.25 to 1.08 ± 0.07. Depolarization of the membrane has two effects on the Shaker channel (N-type inactivation-removed), a fast activation followed by a slow C-type inactivation (2Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Previous studies (2Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,28Olcese R.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have shown that the structural changes associated with the activation motion of S4 are distinct from those occurring during the inactivation process. The motions observed in this study are more likely to occur during activation rather than during inactivation. The reasons are as follows: (i) C-type inactivation for L361C begins to occur at more positive potentials (∼ 90 mV) than disulfide cross-linking (Fig. 6 B); (ii) cross-linking reduces rather than stabilizing C-type inactivation in the L361C mutant channel (Fig.2 E); (iii) and finally, and more importantly, application of Cu (II) Phe to L361C channels that had already undergone maximal C-type inactivation does not cause irreversible inhibition of channel currents (Fig. 7). Thus we conclude that the movement of cysteine residues at position 361 into each other's proximity occurs during the activation of the channel rather than during C-type inactivation. Our data suggesting that during activation the intersubunit distance between positions 361 is reduced are obtained from the L361C mutant channel. It therefore raises the critical question: does this occur in the native channel? Could the effect be due to structural change imparted by the mutation? In the absence of direct structural data, this is a very difficult question to address. However, the facts that residues at position 361 are not conserved among Kvchannels and that substitution of cysteine at this position does not affect the net charge of S4 and, more importantly, the functional properties of the channel (11Larsson H.P. Baker O.S. Dhillon D.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Yusaf S.P. Wray D. Sivaprasadarao A. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 433: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggest that any structural change induced by the mutation is likely to be subtle rather than substantial. Thus, we are tempted to suggest that the depolarization-induced motions may reduce the intersubunit distance between positions 361 of S4 in the native channel."

To date, there have been few reports describing polyamide-induced down-regulation of endogenous gene expression in intact cells, which may be related to the observation that nuclear localization is cell type-dependent (8Belitsky J.M.

Likewise, inhibition of cell growth or antitumor activity has not been reported. The fact that binding of polyamides to DNA is reversible, and their inability to permanently damage DNA may account for the absence of cellular activities. In contrast to polyamides, the cyclopropylpyrroloindole (CPI) DNA alkylating agents represent a class of antitumor drugs whose members include some of the most biologically active agents (9Reynolds V.L. McGovren J.P. Hurley L.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). CPI drugs interact with the DNA minor groove in A/T-rich sequences and alkylate the N3 position in adenine at the 3′ end of the binding site. They inhibit DNA replication through cis- ortrans-acting mechanisms, mainly at the stage of initiation (10Sun D. Hurley L.H.

The sequence-specific DNA alkylating agent that integrates two separate moieties, one for DNA recognition and the other for alkylation, led us to further investigate its biological activities. In this study, SV40 DNA was utilized to assess the ability of 1-CBI to damage target DNA and affect DNA function.

Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 358-363PubMed Google Scholar)) was incubated at 37 °C with 1-CBI in 20 μl of TE buffer for up to 16 h (naked DNA) or for 4 h (minichromosomes). No DNA strand breakage was observed in controls for up to 16 h incubation at 37 °C. Following treatment, minichromosomes were incubated with 1% SDS for 30 min at 37 °C to dissociate nucleosomal-like structures. All samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (PCI, 25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in TE buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Samples were then incubated at 70 °C for 2 h to convert alkylated bases to DNA strand breaks. DNA was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels in 1× Tris-acetate electrophoresis (TAE) buffer for 16 h at 1 V/cm, stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and quantitated using densitometry and ImageQuaNT program (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was carried out according to the published procedure (22Woynarowski J.M. Chapman W.G. Napier C. Herzig M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Herzig M.C. Rodriguez K.A. Trevino A.V. Dziegielewski J. Arnett B. Hurley L. Woynarowski J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer (5′-GCAGCTCCAAAGGTTCCC-3′) starting from position 1991 (reverse) on the SV40 genome was synthesized by the Biopolymer Facility at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. The primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and excess radioactive label was removed using a G25 MicroSpin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amplification mixture consisted of 50 ng of treated SV40 DNA, 0.5 μm labeled primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase in 1× polymerase buffer (Invitrogen). Reaction was carried out using 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 55 s at 72 °C. The dideoxy cycle sequencing reaction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (SequiTherm Excel II sequencing kit, Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) using the same primer and non-treated SV40 DNA template. DNA fragments were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide/8.3 m urea sequencing gel and then visualized and quantitated using phosphorimaging techniques. Cell extracts were prepared from exponentially growing 293 cells as described earlier (18Dziegielewski J. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), disrupted by three rapid freeze/thaw cycles, and incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. After removing the cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min, protein concentration of the resulting extract was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Agent-modified template DNA was prepared by incubating SV40 DNA (0.3 μg, form I) with 1-CBI at 37 °C for 16 h followed by PCI extraction and ethanol precipitation as described. The replication reaction mixture contained 50 μg of 293 cell extracts, 30 ng of drug-treated SV40 DNA, 0.6 μg of SV40 T-antigen, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP in replication buffer (4 mmATP, 0.2 mm CTP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.2 mmUTP, 0.1 mm dCTP, 0.1 mm dGTP, 0.1 mm dTTP, 0.025 mm dATP, 7 mmMgCl2, 0.024 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 40 mm phosphocreatine). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the replication products were isolated on a G50 MicroSpin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel at 1 V/cm for 18 h in 1× TAE. Gels were dried, and DNA replication products were quantitated following exposure to a phosphorimaging screen. BSC-1 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish and grown for 24 h until 70–80% confluent. Cells were infected with SV40 virus (multiplicity of infection > 1) in MEM containing 2% calf serum (MEM-2) for 2 h at 37 °C. After virus-containing medium was removed, cells were incubated an additional 22 h in fresh MEM-2. At 24 h after infection, 1-CBI was added to the medium for 16 h treatment, and the SV40 DNA was extracted from cells according to the modified Hirt extraction procedure (24Arad U. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 760-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In short, phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, and 1% SDS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase followed by an additional 30-min treatment with proteinase K (final concentration, 1 mg/ml). Cellular proteins were precipitated by the addition of 0.35 ml of 3 m CsCl, 1 m potassium acetate, and 0.67 m acetic acid and incubation for 15 min on ice. Supernatants recovered by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 ×g were loaded onto Qiagen spin columns (Valencia, CA). Columns were washed with 0.75 ml of 80 μm potassium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 40 μm EDTA, and 60% ethanol, and SV40 DNA was recovered with 50 μl of TE. The effects of 1-CBI on SV40 DNA intracellular replication were analyzed by neutral/neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using a previously described method (12Cobuzzi Jr., R.J. Burhans W.C. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19852-19859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, SV40 DNA isolated from virus-infected and 1-CBI-treated BSC-1 cells was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI that cuts the SV40 molecule only once. Samples were electrophoresed on 0.6% agarose gels in 1× TAE and 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 24 h at 0.7 V/cm. DNA was excised and placed in a slot cut into the top of the second-dimension gel (1% agarose, 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in Tris-borate electrophoresis buffer (TBE)) perpendicular to the direction of the first-dimension gel. The second-dimension gel was electrophoresed at 4 °C in 1× TBE and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 19 h at 4 V/cm. The second-dimension gels were subjected to Southern blotting, and blots were hybridized to an α-32P-labeled full-length linear SV40 DNA probe (∼1 × 106 cpm/ml) prepared by the random priming ofBamHI-linearized SV40 DNA using random primed DNA labeling kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). BSC-1 cells were treated with1-CBI for 16 h followed by an additional 24-h incubation in drug-free medium. Cells fixed in 5 ml of ice-cold 75% ethanol at −20 °C overnight were stained in sodium citrate buffer containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) and RNaseA (100 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA content of the stained cells (104 cells/sample) was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a long pass (> 600 nm) emission filter and WinList 5.0 program (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Conjugate-induced cell growth inhibition was determined by assaying the cell number after 4 days of continuous exposure. BSC-1 cells were plated on a 96-well plate at 103 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Exponentially growing cells were treated with the tested agents for 4 days. Cells were then fixed in 1:6 trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 1 h, stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine-B, rinsed with 1% acetic acid, and suspended in 10 mm Tris. Cell growth was quantitated based on the amount of cellular proteins measured as an absorbance at 570 nm. 1-CBI is a polyamide-based ligand (Fig.1) that contains a CBI moiety related to the natural alkylating agent CC-1065 that binds and alkylates DNA. Heating of alkylated DNA at 70 °C resulted in strand breaks at the drug binding site (25Reynolds V.L. Molineux I.J. Kaplan D.J. Swenson D.H. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Zsido T.J. Woynarowski J.M. Baker R.M. Gawron L.S. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3733-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether similar heat-labile DNA lesions resulted from 1-CBI treatment was determined using an SV40 forms conversion assay. In this assay, induction of DNA strand breaks can be detected by changes in DNA forms distribution using agarose gel electrophoresis. Conversion of fast migrating SV40 DNA form I (supercoiled circular) to slow migrating form II (nicked circular) requires one strand break per DNA molecule, whereas the formation of form III (linear) requires a frank double-strand break or at least two single-strand breaks, closely spaced on opposite strands. The ability of 1-CBI to damage SV40 DNA is shown in Fig.2. After incubating DNA for 16 h with 1 μm 1-CBI at 37 °C, DNA lesions can be converted to strand breaks by heating at 70 °C. The 2 h of heating resulted in the quantitative conversion of the alkylated form I SV40 DNA to form II and form III, while leaving non-treated control DNA undamaged (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). First, the time dependence of DNA alkylation by 1-CBI was determined at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 A, DNA damage can be detected after a 1–2-h incubation at 37 °C, as indicated by a loss of form I molecules and increases in form II and form III (lanes 5 and6). A complete loss of form I and significant increase in form III were observed only after a 16-h incubation. The results demonstrate that DNA alkylation is time-dependent and that a 16-h 1-CBI incubation produces maximum DNA lesions. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, a 16-h treatment with1-CBI was used in the subsequent studies. Next, the dose dependence of 1-CBI-induced DNA damage was evaluated (Fig. 2 B). SV40 DNA was treated for 16 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of 1-CBI. The quantitation of the gels showed that at 0.1 μm, the amount of supercoiled DNA (form I) was reduced by ∼50%, whereas 0.2 μm 1-CBI converted more than 90% of the supercoiled DNA to forms II and III. Treatment with higher concentrations of the agent resulted in a significant increase in the form III band (2 μm, lane 7), suggesting alkylation of the closely spaced sites, which can be converted to double-strand break. Under the same experimental conditions, no DNA strand damage was observed with parent polyamide 1, which binds reversibly to DNA but cannot alkylate it (data not shown). 1-CBI alkylation of naked SV40 DNA and SV40 minichromosomes was compared to determine whether DNA association with nucleoproteins affected alkylation. SV40 minichromosomes are formed in cells during lytic infection, when the viral genome associates with histones and other nuclear proteins to form circular molecules of nucleosomal chromatin. Minichromosomes provide a good model of mammalian chromatin in vitro because the virus uses the chromatin components of the host, and the minichromosomes with their full complement of DNA-associated proteins can be separated from the cellular genome. However, to examine DNA alkylating activity on chromatin structure, it is necessary to define a condition that can prevent 1-CBI from binding to DNA during the post-lysis period. Since it is experimentally difficult to remove free agent from minichromosomes after the reaction, there is a possibility that1-CBI could bind naked DNA after dissociating nucleoprotein from the minichromosomal DNA. A previous study showed that some detergents, including SDS, are able to prevent CPI drugs from binding to DNA (27McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Likewise, 1% SDS effectively prevented 1-CBIfrom binding to SV40 DNA without causing removal of 1-CBIalready covalently bind to DNA (data not shown). 1-CBI alkylating activity on minichromosomal SV40 DNA was determined by the forms conversion assay (Fig. 2 C), using SDS to prevent free agent from binding to DNA once nucleoproteins had been dissociated from minichromosomes. SV40 minichromosomes were treated with increasing concentrations of 1-CBI at 37 °C for 4 h (longer incubation at 37 °C resulted in disruption of minichromosomal structure) followed by the addition of 1% SDS for an additional 30 min. After free agent and proteins were removed by PCI extraction and ethanol precipitation, strand breaks were induced by heating the alkylated DNA at 70 °C for 2 h. 1-CBIdamages minichromosomal DNA in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 C. Fifty percent conversion of DNA form I to II and III was calculated from quantitated gels at 0.18 μm 1-CBI, the range similar to that observed for naked SV40 DNA. Thus, 1-CBI appears to be equally effective at alkylating both naked and minichromosomal DNA. Confirmation that 1-CBI could be prevented from binding DNA by 1% SDS was obtained when the detergent was added to the minichromosomes prior to the agent, resulting in no detectable increase in DNA damage (Fig. 2 C, lane 8). Naturally occurring CPI compounds alkylate N-3 of adenine within AT-rich regions, thereby exhibiting sequence preference but not sequence specificity (28Warpehoski M.A. Harper D.E. Mitchell M.A. Monroe T.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2502-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The polyamide portion of 1-CBI is designed to bind a specific DNA sequence, 5′-(A/T)GG(A/T)C(A/T)-3′. This binding positions the agent to alkylate a single adenine located 2 bp away from the polyamide-targeting site. The sequence-specific alkylation by 1-CBI has been confirmed previously on a 277-bp DNA fragment (17Chang A.Y. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 4856-4864Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further test this characteristic on a more complex DNA molecule (5243 bp), the RPE assay was performed using agent-treated SV40 DNA as a template. In this assay, DNA nascent chain elongation driven by polymerase stops at sites of the damage on template DNA, and the partial DNA synthesis products indicate the positions of DNA damage (22Woynarowski J.M. Chapman W.G. Napier C. Herzig M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Initially, naked SV40 DNA was treated with 1-CBI for 16 h at 37 °C and then extracted and precipitated to remove free1-CBI. Agent-modified and control non-treated DNA was used as template in linear amplification reactions. The experiments demonstrated that 1-CBI induced DNA damage in vitro at the specific site, the polyamide-targeted site (Fig.3). One μm 1-CBIeffectively damaged DNA at an adenine site 2 bp adjacent to the polyamide binding site, 5′-AGGACTTA-3′ (Fig. 3, lane 7, thearrow indicates presumed alkylated adenine). The parent polyamide 1 (at 3 μm) did not induce DNA damage under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). It was also noted that 1-CBI introduced DNA damage at a site composed of six contiguous adenines but not at other AT-rich regions in the analyzed DNA fragment. To compare 1-CBI sequence specificity in cellular and cell-free environments, the RPE assays were performed using SV40 DNA isolated from virus-infected and then agent-treated BSC-1 cells (Fig.3, lane 6). At 24 h after infection with SV40, BSC-1 cells were treated with 1-CBI for 16 h, and SV40 DNA was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiments showed that 1-CBI alkylates the same DNA sequence on intracellular SV40 as on naked DNA (lanes 6 and7). Since cell lysis was performed in the presence of 1% SDS, which prevents rebinding to DNA as described earlier in the cell-free study, we conclude that post-lysis 1-CBI-DNA interactions did not contribute to the SV40 DNA damage observed. 1-CBIinduces DNA lesions that could stop DNA polymerase, as shown in RPE experiments. Therefore, whether 1-CBI-alkylated SV40 DNA could serve as a template in the more complex DNA synthesis system (such as cell-free SV40 DNA replication) was examined (Fig.4 A). Naked SV40 DNA was treated with 1-CBI for 16 h at 37 °C followed by removal of free 1-CBI. The replication reaction containing extracts of 293 cells, control, or agent-treated SV40 DNA template and SV40 T-antigen was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reduced DNA replication competence was noted when the SV40 DNA template was treated with 0.1 μm 1-CBI (lane 2), and the reduction was maximal with 0.5–1 μm 1-CBI (lanes 4 and5). The inhibition curve (Fig. 4 B) shows that 0.25 μm 1-CBI decreased SV40 DNA replication by ∼50%. Since the cell extract was not agent-treated and free agent was removed after template treatment, the inhibition of replication activity is likely due to 1-CBI-induced covalent damage to the DNA template. No inhibition of SV40 DNA replication was detected when the SV40 DNA template was pretreated with up to 10 μm polyamide 1 (data not shown). Since it was found that 1-CBI inhibited cell-free SV40 replication, we examined whether similar activity can be observed in the intact cells. It has been shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that CPI drugs can block intracellular SV40 replication at the level of initiation (12Cobuzzi Jr., R.J. Burhans W.C. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19852-19859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14McHugh M.M. Kuo S.R. Walsh-O'Beirne M.H. Liu J.S. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11508-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). At 24 h after infection with SV40, BSC-1 cells were treated with 1-CBI for 16 h, and the isolation of SV40 DNA was carried out as described. Naked DNA was separated on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 1-CBItreatment caused a concentration-dependent decrease in intracellular SV40 replication intermediates detected in the form of bubble arc, as indicated by the arrows in Fig.5; the bubble arc intensity was reduced at 0.1 μm and diminished completely at 3–10 μm agent concentration. One of the cellular responses following DNA damage induced by CPI agents is a delay in S phase and block at the G2/M transition in the cell cycle (29Bhuyan B.K. Crampton S.L. Adams E.G. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4227-4232PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the cell cycle progression of BSC-1 cells treated with 1-CBI. Asynchronously growing cells were treated with 1-CBI for 16 h and postincubated in agent-free medium for 24 h, and then cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide, and DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig.6). In control non-treated samples, the majority of cells were in G1 (∼62%) with the remaining distributed through S and G2/M. With the increase of1-CBI concentration, the delayed progression through S and the G2/M arrest were observed. Twenty-four h after treatment with 1 μm 1-CBI, the majority of cells were in late S (∼55%) and G2/M (30%). Under similar conditions, no effects on cell cycle were observed in BSC-1 cells treated with polyamide 1 (data not shown). Since 1-CBIexhibited the ability to damage and interfere with DNA functions in whole cells, one can expect that it is capable of inhibiting cell growth. Growth of BSC-1 cells following 1-CBI treatment was measured using standard sulforhodamine-B staining of cellular proteins. The cell growth curve (Fig. 7) shows that ∼0.3 μm 1-CBI inhibits cell growth by 50%, whereas polyamide 1 has no effect up to 10 μm. To address the possible cell line specificity of this activity, the cell growth inhibition induced by 1-CBI was also analyzed using human 293 and NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) cells. Similar levels of growth inhibition were observed in all tested cell lines at 0.1–10 μm 1-CBI concentrations (data not shown). In addition, the ability of 1-CBI to inhibit cell growth was evaluated using a pair of human breast cancer cell lines, MDA435/LCC6 wild type and MDA435/LCC6 multidrug-resistant (MDR) (30Leonessa F. Green D. Licht T. Wright A. Wingate-Legette K. Lippman J. Gottesman M.M. Clarke R. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As compared with the wild type (sensitive) cell line, ∼3.5-fold higher concentration of 1-CBI is required to inhibit the growth of MDR cells by 50% (IC50) (TableI). By comparison, a 12-fold higher concentration of the DNA cross-linking CPI agent bizelesin was required to inhibit growth of the MDR cell line as compared with the wild type cell line, whereas both cell lines were equally sensitive to CC-1065 and adozelesin (monoalkylating CPI agents).Table IGrowth inhibition induced by 1-CBI and related CPI agents in sensitive (MDA435/LCC6) and multidrug-resistant (MDA435/LCC6 MDR) human breast cancer cell linesAgentMDA435/LCC6MDA435/LCC6RatioIC50aCells were agent-treated for 4 days, and then the growth was quantitated based upon sulforhodamine-B staining of cellular proteins and absorbance measurements at 570 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.”IC50(MDR/sensitive)1-CBI0.36 μm1.23 μm3.5CC-10656.3 nm6.1 nm0.9Adozelesin6.1 nm6.9 nm1.1Bizelesin11 pm132 pm12a Cells were agent-treated for 4 days, and then the growth was quantitated based upon sulforhodamine-B staining of cellular proteins and absorbance measurements at 570 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab In the current study, we evaluated the DNA binding agent1-CBI, which combines the sequence specificity of a polyamide and the alkylating function of a CPI agent. A prior study provided information on the ability of 1-CBI to alkylate a target sequence contained within a short linear DNA molecule (17Chang A.Y. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 4856-4864Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The degree to which this agent can interact and alkylate more complex DNA structures and how the ability to damage DNA translates into its biological activity are described in this study. Analysis of DNA damage using an SV40 forms conversion assay showed that1-CBI alkylates DNA after incubation at 37 °C and that lesions can be converted to strand breaks by heating alkylated DNA at 70 °C for 2 h. The DNA damaging activity of 1-CBI is only 2–3-fold less than that of its parent alkylating agent CC-1065 based on the conversion of 50% of form I SV40 (∼0.1versus ∼0.05 μm) (Fig. 2, A andB, and Ref. 27McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a 16-h incubation is required to produce the maximum amount of DNA damage, whereas only 15 min is needed for maximal CC-1065-induced damage (27McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Examination of the form conversion data obtained using naked (Fig. 2, A andB) and minichromosomal (Fig. 2 C) DNA indicated that the presence of chromatin structure components had little effect on the level of damage introduced by 1-CBI. In addition, supercoiled DNA (form I) was converted predominantly to nicked circular DNA (form II), and a significant increase in linear form III was observed only at higher 1-CBI concentrations (>1 μm). Since conversion from form I to II requires one single-strand break, these results indirectly confirm the monoalkylating activity of 1-CBI. Classical CPI agents target the N-3 of adenine on DNA (28Warpehoski M.A. Harper D.E. Mitchell M.A. Monroe T.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2502-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and their DNA sequence selectivity is limited to the AT-rich region (27McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The polyamide moiety of 1-CBI, however, is designed to target the agent to specifically alkylate a single adenine flanking the polyamide binding site 5′-(A/T)GG(A/T)C(A/T)-3′. Our cell-free RPE experiments using 1-CBI-treated DNA showed that a single adenine was alkylated in a dose-dependent fashion in the analyzed SV40 DNA region. The alkylated adenine is 2 bp away from the 3′-terminal of the polyamide-binding sequence 5′-AGGACT-3′ (Fig. 3,lane 7). Furthermore, similar sequence specificity was observed on an intracellular SV40 DNA target that was isolated from1-CBI-treated, SV40 virus-infected cells (Fig. 3, lane 6). Therefore, the ability of 1-CBI to alkylate a polyamide-specific DNA sequence in both cell-free and intracellular environments has been demonstrated. These results are consistent with earlier findings which showed that CPI agents produce similar DNA damage profiles regardless of whether the target is naked or nucleosomal DNA (11Woynarowski J.M. McHugh M.M. Gawron L.S. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13042-13050Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We note in the RPE analysis (Fig. 3,lower part of the gel) that 1-CBIintroduces lesions at two adenines in the 5′-AAAAAA-3′ tract proximal to a polyamide match sequence 5′-GGACA-3′. One biological activity often associated with DNA damaging agents is their ability to inhibit DNA replication via a cis-acting mechanism due to the presence of lesions on the replicating template. We studied drug-induced inhibition of DNA replication under cell-free conditions using SV40 templates treated with 1-CBI. Replication inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm (Fig. 4). At the same concentration range, ∼50% of SV40 DNA form I was converted to form II and form III in the forms conversion assay (Fig. 2), indicating that 50% of SV40 DNA molecules acquired at least one DNA lesion, rendering them inactive in the replication assay. Our results showed that the 1-CBIconcentrations required for DNA replication inhibition and DNA damage in cell-free system are similar, suggesting direct relationships between both events. However, the accessibility of cellular DNA to the alkylation by1-CBI might be limited by factors such as cell membrane permeability or protein interference. To explore1-CBI-induced inhibition of DNA replication under cellular conditions, two-dimensional electrophoresis gel analysis was performed using the well defined SV40 DNA replication system in BSC-1 cells. This technique had been used in previous studies to demonstrate that CPI agents, adozelesin (12Cobuzzi Jr., R.J. Burhans W.C. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19852-19859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and bizelesin (14McHugh M.M. Kuo S.R. Walsh-O'Beirne M.H. Liu J.S. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11508-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), can inhibit cellular DNA replication at the level of initiation. Like these CPI agents, inhibition of intracellular SV40 DNA replication by 1-CBIwas indicated by a loss of replication intermediates with increasing1-CBI concentration (Fig. 5). Although this profile is consistent with a blockage of the initiation of DNA replication, further studies would be needed to verify the effects on elongation. Another consequence of exposing cells to 1-CBI is interference with cell cycle progression. Previous studies showed that cells treated with DNA-alkylating CPI agents slow their progression through S phase and arrest in the G2/M phase of cell cycle (29Bhuyan B.K. Crampton S.L. Adams E.G. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4227-4232PubMed Google Scholar). Our flow cytometry results clearly indicated that1-CBI delayed S-phase progression and blocked cells in G2/M phase (Fig. 6). The potency of a DNA damaging agent is related to its cytotoxic potential. Although 1-CBI shows the ability to inhibit cell growth (Fig. 7), it requires a 50-fold higher concentration of the hybrid compound to inhibit cell growth in comparison with the classical CPI agents (31Zsido T.J. Beerman T.A. Meegan R.L. Woynarowski J.M. Baker R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This could be partially explained by the relatively large molecular weight of 1-CBI, which may hinder its cellular uptake. Nevertheless, since the parent polyamide 1was virtually inactive even at higher concentrations (>10 μm), this finding demonstrates that addition of the alkylating activity to the polyamide confers an ability to inhibit cell growth. The cell growth inhibition of 1-CBI was observed at levels similar to those required for the detection of cellular DNA damage, DNA replication inhibition, and cell cycle arrest in BSC-1 cells. This is distinct from previous reports with some CPI agents in which cell growth inhibition was observed at much lower levels than those required for the detection of either DNA damage or DNA synthesis inhibition (13Woynarowski J.M. Beerman T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Gawron L.S. Otani T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the MDR phenotype could affect the activity of CPI drugs (31Zsido T.J. Beerman T.A. Meegan R.L. Woynarowski J.M. Baker R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As compared with the wild type cell line, the 12-fold higher concentration of bizelesin was required to inhibit the growth of MDR cells in 50%. On the other hand, adozelesin or CC-1065 was equally active against sensitive and MDR-resistant cells. Interestingly, 1-CBI evoked intermediate differences between sensitive and resistant cells (3.5-fold). We hypothesize that the deviation of 1-CBI from patterns established for other mono-alkylating CPI drugs (adozelesin and CC-1065) could be partial related to its higher sequence selectivity. The high binding affinity and sequence specificity of polyamides suggest that they may be useful in both basic research and drug development. Although the displacement of transcription factors by polyamides under cell-free conditions has been observed, there are few reports of cellular responses that result from the actions of polyamides in whole cells. Our study suggests that 1-CBI can target cellular DNA in a sequence-specific fashion and exert an effect on DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell growth. The polyamide-CBI conjugate combines the characteristics of both parent compounds and yet possesses novel activity in intact cells. Whether conjugates of this type have the potential to target specific genes in cell culture remains an open question and will be reported in due course.

Activated T lymphocytes can trigger the expression of Fas-ligand on non-lymphoid tissue, such as intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), and this, in turn, can induce apoptosis in the T cells. Here, we examine the role of TNFα in this feedback regulation. Injection of TNFα into mice caused a rapid up-regulation of Fas-ligand mRNA in IEC. TNFα-induced activation of the Fas-ligand promoter in IEC requires NF-κB as this was blocked by an I-κBαM super-repressor and by mutation of an NF-κB site in the Fas-ligand promoter. Activation of T cells by antigen induced Fas-ligand expression in IEC in vivo in wild type, but not in TNFα−/− or TNFR1−/− mice. These results define a novel pathway wherein TNFα, produced by activated T cells in the intestine, induce Fas-ligand expression in IEC.

Destruction of villi is associated with infiltration of activated lymphocytes, which are believed to be the primary mediators of tissue destruction (2MacDonald T.T. Spencer J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Infiltrating lymphocytes in ulcerative colitis lesions express high levels of the death ligand, Fas-ligand (3Ueyama H. Kiyohara T. Sawada N. Isozaki K. Kitamura S. Kondo S. Miyagawa J. Kanayama S. Shinomura Y. Ishikawa H. Ohtani T. Nezu R. Nagata S. Matsuzawa Y. Gut. 1998; 43: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and Fas/Fas-ligand have been shown to be key mediators of epithelium destruction (4Iwamoto M. Koji T. Makiyama K. Kobayashi N.

Additionally, apoptotic destruction of the lamina propria by transferred CD4+ T cells into SCID1 mice led to similar colitis lesions (6Bregenholt S. Petersen T.R. Claesson M.H. Immunol. Lett. 2001; 78: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Diseases resulting from autoimmune destruction of intestinal epithelia may be due to dysregulation of a protective mechanism utilized by the epithelium that contributes to peripheral lymphocyte deletion. The epithelium of the small intestine encounters many lymphocytes that percolate through the region, possibly as part of maintenance of immunity at the mucosal barrier. In healthy tissue intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) have been shown to contribute to deletion of activated lymphocytes during clonal contraction (7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T. Lin T.

In a model similar to that observed in the thyroid (8Stassi G., Di Liberto D. Todaro M. Zeuner A. Ricci-Vitiani L. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Farina F. Zummo G. De Maria R. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), infiltrating lymphocytes induce the expression of non-lymphoid Fas-ligand, which in turn causes induction of apoptosis in Fas-bearing lymphocytes (7Bonfoco E.

Failure to do so results in autoimmune destruction of the epithelium induced by the activated lymphocytes (see (1Pinkoski M.J. Brunner T. Green D.R. Lin T. Am. J.

An inability to regulate this process may also contribute to the mechanism of intestinal destruction in severe graft-versus-host disease (9van den Brink M.R. Moore E. Horndasch K.J. Crawford J.M. Murphy G.F. Burakoff S.J. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 184-191PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that TNFα and its receptor, TNFR1 (p55) are required for efficient deletion of activated lymphocytes (10Zheng L. Fisher G. Miller R.E. Peschon J. Lynch D.H. Lenardo M.J.

Taken with our previous observations that Fas-ligand expression is induced in the epithelium of the small intestine in response to peripheral lymphocyte activation (7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T.

Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) we investigated the possibility that TNFα produced by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-activated T lymphocytes (14Kramer B. Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar) is a mediator of Fas-ligand expression in the intestinal epithelium. Consistent with this model we found that IEC, which constitutively express TNFR1 (p55), respond in vitro and in vivoto TNFα with induction of Fas-ligand mRNA. TNFα-dependent expression of Fas-ligand in IEC was mediated through an NF-κB regulatory element in the proximal promoter of the Fas-ligand gene and was inhibited by an IκB super-repressor of NF-κB. We also found that TNFα−/− and TNFR1−/− mice did not display an increase in IEC Fas-ligand following superantigen-induced lymphocyte activation observed in wild type animals. C57BL/6, C57BL/6-Tnfr1tm1Mak (TNFR1−/−), B6129SF2, B6,129-Tnftm1Gk1 (TNF−/−), BALB/cByJ, and BALB/cByJSmn-Prkdcscid (SCID) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed under pathogen-free conditions at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology. IEC were isolated from small intestines as previously described (15Lin T. Brunner T. Tietz B. Madsen J. Bonfoco E. Reaves M. Huflejt M. Green D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Reporter constructs containing the 1.2-kb human Fas-ligand promoter and its variants in the plasmid HsLuc have been described previously (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine TNF was purified as described (17Rooney I. Butrovich K. Ware C.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 345-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SEB was purchased from Sigma. Anti-FasL (N-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-actin from ICN (Aurora, OH). All other antibodies were obtained from BD-Pharmingen (La Jolla, CA) unless noted otherwise. Peripheral lymphocytes were isolated from spleens and inguinal lymph nodes as described previously (15Lin T. Brunner T. Tietz B. Madsen J. Bonfoco E. Reaves M. Huflejt M. Green D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After blocking with CD16/CD32 (FcγIII/II receptor), lymphocyte preparations were labeled with anti-CD3-CyChromeTM (145–2C11) and anti-Vβ8 T-cell receptor-PE (F23.1) (BD-Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA). Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan and analyzed using the Cellquest® software. For protein extraction, cells were washed twice in PBS, lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm, pH 8.0, Tris-HCl, 0.1% sodium-SDS, and 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate in the presence of protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (20 min; 15,000 × g), and supernatants collected. For Western blot, after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (AmershamBiosciences), membranes were incubated for at least 1 h with 5% non-fat milk in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 1× PBS) and for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti mouse secondary antibodies were then added for 30–60 min, and proteins revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from primary intestinal epithelial cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random hexamers (Invitrogen). For Fas-ligand gene expression, primers were located in separate exons in genomic DNA to eliminate the possibility signal due to genomic DNA contamination. Sequence specific primers for murine Fas-ligand (forward primer: 5′-TGAATTACCCATGTCCCCAG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-AAACTGACCCTGGAGGAGCC-3′); TNF (forward primer: 5′-ACAGAAAGCATGATCCGCG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GCCCCCCATCTT TTGGG-3′); luciferase (forward primer: 5′-TGGATTACGTCGCCAGTCAAG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ACTCCTCCGCGCAACTTTT-3′); β-actin (forward primer: 5′-ttcgttgccggtccaca-3′); reverse primer: 5′-accagcgcagcgatatcg-3′); and 18 S (forward primer: 5′-ATGGTAGTCGCCGTGCCTAC-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CCGGAATCGAACCCTGATT-3′) were used. Real time PCR was performed with AmpliTaq GoldTM polymerase in a PE Biosystems 5700 thermocycler using SyBr GreenTM detection protocol as outlined by the manufacturer. Murine TNFα cDNA was first cloned by RT-PCR from total RNA using TNFα forward primer (5′-atgagcacagaaagcatgatccgc-3′) and TNFα reverse primer (5′-tcacagagcaatgactcc-3′) at its respective ATG start and TGA stop codons. Amplified fragment was cloned directly into pcDNA3.1V5-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression vector for IκBαM (18Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar) was described previously (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Transient expression was performed using Superfect™ (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 μg of each vector. Transfected IEC were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C before analysis by real time-PCR. Antagonist anti-TNFR1 antibody (clone 55R-170) was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Transfection efficiencies were measured by analysis of lacZ or luciferase reporter gene expression. We reported previously that Fas-ligand expression in epithelial cells of the small intestine (IEC) is induced by activated T cells (7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T. Lin T. Griffith T.S. Gao Y. Nakajima H. Henkart P.A. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In keeping with our previous observations, we observed a significant increase in Fas-ligand protein levels in response to superantigen-induced activation of peripheral lymphocytes (Fig.1 A). To study the induction of Fas-ligand expression, we developed a quantitative real time RT-PCR assay. Fig. 1 B shows that the increases in Fas-ligand mRNA correlated with increases in Fas-ligand protein levels. Although this phenomenon has been observed in all mouse strains tested, C57BL/6 mice consistently showed a lower relative induction of Fas-ligand mRNA and protein. This is due to a higher level of constitutive Fas-ligand expression in C57BL/6 than in Balb/c and related strains. To identify a mechanism by which antigen-induced lymphocyte activation leads to Fas-ligand expression in IEC, we analyzed IEC for expression of receptors for factors produced by peripheral lymphocytes to which IEC respond. We performed RNase protection assays on primary IEC and found constitutive expression of TNFR1 (p55) (Fig. 1 C), consistent with a previous observation of TNFR1 protein on the surface of IEC (19Inagaki-Ohara K. Yada S. Takamura N. Reaves M., Yu, X. Liu E. Rooney I. Nicholas S. Castro A. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Lin T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because TNFα is produced by activated lymphocytes infiltrating the small intestine (20Trobonjaca Z. Leithauser F. Moller P. Bluethmann H. Koezuka Y. MacDonald H.R. Reimann J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that TNFα acts through the TNFR1 on IEC to induce Fas-ligand in IEC following SEB-induced activation of peripheral lymphocytes. TNFα is an inflammatory cytokine implicated in inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. In light of recent observations that TNFα is involved in both peripheral lymphocyte deletion (12Speiser D.E. Sebzda E. Ohteki T. Bachmann M.F. Pfeffer K. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and a number of enteropathies involving intestinal epithelia (22Plevy S.E. Landers C.J. Prehn J. Carramanzana N.M. Deem R.L. Shealy D. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6276-6282PubMed Google Scholar, 23Powrie F. Leach M.W. Mauze S. Menon S. Caddle L.B. Coffman R.L.

Gastroenterol. 1995; 30: 56-60PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that TNFα is a mediator of Fas-ligand induction in non-lymphoid tissue after peripheral lymphocyte activation. To ascertain the effects of TNFα on IEC, we treated primary IECex vivo with various doses of TNFα (Fig.2). At 2 h there was a significant induction of Fas-ligand mRNA expression at low doses of TNFα (Fig. 2 A) and by 6 h a significant increase in Fas-ligand protein levels (Fig. 2 B). To further analyze the effects of TNFα on IEC, we expressed TNFα in primary IEC by transient transfection and assayed the effects on Fas-ligand mRNA levels. IEC were isolated and transfected with TNFα-pcDNA, cells were harvested 20 h later, and RNA analyzed. Fas-ligand mRNA levels were measured relative to the internal control of 18 S RNA levels for each sample. TNFα mRNA was also measured as a transfection control. As shown in Fig. 2 C, there was a significant, dose-dependent increase in endogenous Fas-ligand mRNA levels in TNFα-transfected IEC. Additionally, the TNFα-dependent effects on Fas-ligand were reduced to background levels when an anti-TNFR1 antagonistic antibody was added to the medium during the transfection (Fig. 2 D). Using this system, we performed co-transfections on primary IEC with TNFα in conjunction with a reporter construct containing the human Fas-ligand promoter driving the luciferase gene, hFasLpro-HsLuc. This system allowed us to perform simultaneous analyses on various Fas-ligand promoter constructs compared with activity of the endogenous Fas-ligand gene. 20 h after transfection, RNA populations were analyzed for luciferase, TNFα, and endogenous Fas-ligand expression by real time RT-PCR. Similar to its effects on endogenous Fas-ligand, expression of TNFα also caused a significant increase in luciferase expression mediated through the Fas-ligand promoter (Fig.3). Luciferase mRNA was quantitated relative to luciferase DNA as a control of transfection efficiency for each sample. When TNFα−pcDNA was co-transfected with the Fas-ligand promoter construct lacking the NF-κB site, ΔNFκB-hFasLpro-HSLuc, the effects of TNFα were reduced to background levels similar to that observed with empty vector. This demonstrated that the effects of TNFα on the up-regulation of Fas-ligand mRNA in IEC were dependent NF-κB sites in the Fas-ligand proximal promoter (Fig. 3). In the same experiments we found that TNF-induced expression of endogenous Fas-ligand was not affected, demonstrating that ablation of the effects due to TNFα was the result of removing the NF-κB site and not due to inhibition of some other aspect of TNFα signaling. To further investigate the role of NF-κB in TNF-mediated Fas-ligand expression, we utilized a mutant IκB, IκBαM, which is not phosphorylated or degraded and thereby inhibits activation of NF-κB (18Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). Expression of IκBαM by transient co-transfection in primary IEC blocked TNFα−mediated induction of Fas-ligand reporter construct (Fig. 3). Further, IκBαM also blocked expression of endogenous Fas-ligand mRNA in TNFα-transfected IEC, confirming that TNF-mediated effects in IEC occur via NF-κB activation, which in turn utilizes the NF-κB site of the Fas-ligand proximal promoter (13Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that we observed a complete inhibition of Fas-ligand promoter activity despite a maximum transfection efficiency of 50%. This is likely due to autocrine effects of TNFα in co-transfected cells, which also accounts for the observation that activity of the endogenous Fas-ligand gene was inhibited by IκBαM. To study the effects of TNFα on IEC Fas-ligand expression in vivo, we injected TNFα into mice to assess the response in the epithelium of the small intestine, with respect to induction of Fas-ligand expression. TNFα in PBS or PBS alone was administered intraperitoneal to Balb/c mice. Initial experiments were performed with a range of TNFα over a very short time period so as to minimize the possibility for indirect effects. Within 4 h we observed a significant increase in IEC Fas-ligand mRNA levels (Fig.4 A); however, in subsequent analyses, we utilized a lower dose of TNFα (2 μg/mouse) over a longer time frame (12 h) to reduce potentially toxic effects to the animals. IEC were isolated 12 h postinjection and analyzed by real time RT-PCR for Fas-ligand expression. As shown in Fig. 4 B, injection of TNFα resulted in a significant increase in IEC Fas-ligand expression in vivo. These results do not exclude the possibility for indirect effects of TNFα on IEC, but clearly demonstrate that the effects occur very early after administration. After demonstrating that TNFα is capable of inducing Fas-ligand expression in IEC, we asked if it is necessary for up-regulation of Fas-ligand in IEC after antigen-driven immune activation. To investigate this possibility, we utilized the superantigen SEB, which causes an increase in Fas-ligand in a number of non-lymphoid tissues, including the epithelium of the small intestine (7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T. Lin T. Griffith T.S. Gao Y. Nakajima H. Henkart P.A. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TNFα−/−, TNFR1−/− and wild type controls (B6129SF2 and C57BL/6, respectively) were injected with SEB (75–100 μg intraperitoneally), and 3 days later IEC mRNA was isolated and assayed by real time RT-PCR for Fas-ligand expression. Control mice displayed a marked increase in Fas-ligand mRNA, but little or no increase in Fas-ligand expression was detected in TNFα−/− or TNFR1−/− mice (Fig.5 A). To rule out the possibility that TNFα−/− and TNFR1−/− mice had an abnormal response to superantigen, we analyzed peripheral lymphocytes from SEB-treated knockout animals. As shown in Fig. 5 B, we observed virtually identical expansion of Vβ8+ cells in both knockout strains compared with C57BL/6 control mice. Therefore, the knockout mice still developed signs of lymphocyte activation indicative of an appropriate response to SEB, but without the attendant increase in IEC Fas-ligand mRNA. Fas-ligand expression that we measured in SEB-treated wild type IEC correlated with Fas-ligand-specific killing activity toward Fas-bearing targets ((7) and data not shown). This demonstrates that Fas-ligand expression correlates with the presence of functional Fas-ligand on the epithelial cell surface. To establish the role of lymphoid cells in the TNFα-mediated Fas-ligand induction in response to SEB, we compared Balb/c-SCID treated with SEB or TNFα. In these immune-deficient mice we did not observe any up-regulation of Fas-ligand following administration of SEB (Fig. 6). Balb/c-SCID recipients were injected with TNFα, and IEC were isolated 12 h later. IEC RNA was analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR and Balb/c-SCID displayed increased expression of IEC Fas-ligand in response to administration of TNFα, similar to Balb/c (Fig. 6). This rules out the possibility that the effects we observed in the small intestine were a direct action of SEB on the intestinal epithelium. In contrast, Balb/c-SCID treated with TNFα showed a rapid induction of Fas-ligand in IEC. These data provide strong support for the idea that TNFα acts directly on IECin vivo to mediate the up-regulation of Fas-ligand mRNA and that induction of IEC Fas-ligand in response to superantigen requires peripheral lymphocytes. Taken together, these data support the model in which TNFα, produced by lymphoid cells after activation by superantigen (14Kramer B. Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar), interacts with TNF-R1 (p55) on the surface of IEC to induce expression of Fas-ligand. Expression of Fas-ligand appears to be triggered by NF-κB, a well characterized component of TNF-R signaling (25Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu.

In this paper we have shown that intestinal epithelial cells respond to TNFα via the expression of Fas-ligand, a protein implicated in apoptosis induction of Fas-expressing cells and the maintenance of immune privilege (29Griffith T.S.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We found that TNFα directly induces expression of the endogenous Fas-ligand gene in intestinal epithelial cells. Injection of the superantigen, SEB, into mice also induces Fas-ligand expression on intestinal epithelium (Ref. 7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T. Lin T. Griffith T.S. Gao Y. Nakajima H. Henkart P.A.

IEC express TNFR1 (19Inagaki-Ohara K. Yada S. Takamura N. Reaves M., Yu, X. Liu E. Rooney I. Nicholas S. Castro A. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Lin T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and animals lacking TNFR1 are similarly resistant to induction of IEC Fas-ligand expression following SEB injection. TNFα signaling via TNFR1 induces the activation of NF-κB (26Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 31Chan K.F.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and this transcription factor has been implicated in the control of Fas-ligand expression (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). We have found that co-expression of a non-degradable form of IκB (IκBαM) (18Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar) inhibits endogenous Fas-ligand gene expression as well as activity of a human Fas-ligand promoter reporter construct upon co-expression with a TNFα expression plasmid (Fig. 3). A human Fas-ligand promoter lacking an NF-κB site (13Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) failed to respond to TNFα, confirming this role for NF-κB. NF-κB has been implicated in the inflammatory response induced by TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines. The induction of Fas-ligand by NF-κB might contribute to inflammation by recruitment of neutrophils, which occurs under some conditions of enforced Fas-ligand expression (33Chen J.J. Sun Y. Nabel G.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 34Nelson D.P. Setser E. Hall D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hewitt T. Klevitsky R. Osinska H. Bellgrau D. Duke R.C. Robbins J.

J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 518-522PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have not observed neutrophil infiltration into the intestines of animals treated with either SEB or TNFα to induce Fas-ligand expression (not shown). The primary function of Fas-ligand is the induction of apoptosis, particularly in activated T cells and other Fas-expressing cells (36Pinkoski M.J. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,37Lenardo M. Chan K.M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that expression of non-lymphoid Fas-ligand in immunologically privileged sites inhibits immune responses by inducing apoptosis in infiltrating T cells (29Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 30Griffith T.S., Yu, X. Herndon J.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have provided evidence that inducible Fas-ligand expression in peripheral tissues during the response to superantigen contributes to the deletion of activated T cells following the peak of an immune response (7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T. Lin T. Griffith T.S. Gao Y. Nakajima H. Henkart P.A. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been reported that activated peripheral T cells express TNFα (20Trobonjaca Z. Leithauser F. Moller P. Bluethmann H. Koezuka Y. MacDonald H.R. Reimann J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and also that TNF sensitizes activated T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (38Elzey B.D. Griffith T.S. Herndon J.M. Barreiro R. Tschopp J. Ferguson T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this report we provide the first evidence for a link between TNF and epithelial cell Fas-ligand expression in the small intestine. If Fas-ligand is expressed on T cells (which clearly is the case, see Ref. 37Lenardo M. Chan K.M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) why is this not sufficient to mediate peripheral deletion and thereby regulate the extent of T cell-mediated damage to peripheral tissues? Previous studies have shown that primary murine T cells and some T cell lines undergo activation-induced cell death only through “fratricide,” that is, they express Fas-ligand and induce apoptosis in neighboring T cells but not in themselves (7Bonfoco E. Stuart P.M. Brunner T. Lin T. Griffith T.S. Gao Y. Nakajima H. Henkart P.A. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, in peripheral tissues where individual activated T cells are dispersed, their damaging effects will not be effectively regulated by T cell Fas-ligand. Peripheral non-lymphoid Fas-ligand can perform this function. Perhaps more importantly, the peripheral tissue acts as a monitor that functionally determines when an immune response can become harmful to the tissue. In the case of IEC, TNF produced by infiltrating T cells causes damage, and these cells respond by expressing Fas-ligand. The idea that this serves to protect the epithelium from the effects of the T cells is supported by a study of one model of inflammation, in which CD4+ T cells were observed to undergo Fas-dependent apoptosis in the lamina propria (5Bregenholt S. Claesson M.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,6Bregenholt S. Petersen T.R. Claesson M.H. Immunol. Lett. 2001; 78: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is possible that the intestinal epithelium “senses” infiltration of lymphocytes by the presence of cytokines, in this case TNFα, produced by the lymphocytes. Induction of non-lymphoid Fas-ligand in this situation may represent a mechanism wherein the non-lymphoid compartment limits the number of lymphocytes that traffic through gut, thus providing a regulatory control on intestinal inflammation. A similar scenario has been suggested for the control of immune responses in the thyroid. In this case, the cytokines produced by infiltrating lymphocytes can elicit opposing responses in the thyrocytes. Thyrocytes express a basal level of Fas-ligand (39Giordano C. Stassi G., De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), which has cytotoxic activity for infiltrating lymphocytes, however, IFN-γ secreted by TH1 cells renders thyrocytes sensitive to Fas-ligand-mediated fratricide (8Stassi G., Di Liberto D. Todaro M. Zeuner A. Ricci-Vitiani L. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Farina F. Zummo G. De Maria R. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thyrocyte apoptosis induced in this manner is held as the underlying cause of tissue destruction in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. It had been proposed that thyrocyte Fas-ligand serves to limit the numbers of lymphocytes in the thyroid as a mechanism of both immune homeostasis and thyroid protection (40Pinkoski M.J. Green D.R. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In a study of inflammation accompanying infection with cytomegalovirus, the clearance of infiltrating T cells from various peripheral tissues was found to depend on functional Fas and Fas-ligand, although the clearance of the virus was independent of either protein (41Zhang H.G. Fleck M. Kern E.R. Liu D. Wang Y. Hsu H.C. Yang P. Wang Z. Curiel D.T. Zhou T. Mountz J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of Fas-ligand in non-lymphoid tissues, as we observed here, could help to limit lymphoid infiltration following the clearance of an infectious disease organism. Infiltrating T cells have been observed in a number of models of inflammatory bowel disease (2MacDonald T.T. Spencer J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Trobonjaca Z. Leithauser F. Moller P. Bluethmann H. Koezuka Y. MacDonald H.R. Reimann J. J.

Med. 1988; 167: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Similarly, intestinal tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease has been related to increased infiltration and immune destruction by transplanted lymphocyte populations (15Lin T. Brunner T. Tietz B. Madsen J. Bonfoco E. Reaves M. Huflejt M. Green D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Nikolic B. Lee S. Bronson R.T. Grusby M.J. Sykes M. J.

Grau G.E. Allet B. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Consistent with our proposal that inducible expression of Fas-ligand contributes to the control of infiltrating lymphocytes, van den Brink et al.(9van den Brink M.R. Moore E. Horndasch K.J. Crawford J.M. Murphy G.F. Burakoff S.J. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 184-191PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that Fas-ligand-deficient gldmice are more susceptible to acute graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic bone marrow transplant than wild type animals with functional Fas-ligand. Also, gld versus wild type recipients showed a significant increase in donor T cell expansion and intestinal pathology, which included massive lymphocyte infiltrates and crypt destruction (9van den Brink M.R. Moore E. Horndasch K.J. Crawford J.M. Murphy G.F. Burakoff S.J. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 184-191PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that TNF in the small intestine impacts its surroundings by inducing Fas-ligand expression, which is then proposed to induce apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes. TNF has been implicated in peripheral lymphocyte deletion based on the observations that TNF-dependent signaling is required for activation-induced cell death (10Zheng L. Fisher G. Miller R.E. Peschon J. Lynch D.H. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 11Sytwu H.K. Liblau R.S. McDevitt H.O.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 3055-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, these results did not exclude the possibility that TNF could contribute to peripheral deletion via an indirect (i.e. non-lymphoid) intermediate, and the connection between IEC Fas-ligand induction following peripheral lymphocyte activation and peripheral deletion is the focus of ongoing studies. The two proposed modes of action for TNF (direct/lymphoid and indirect/non-lymphoid) are not mutually exclusive, nor do we exclude the possible involvement of other factors that mediate inducible expression of Fas-ligand and other death ligands in the intestinal epithelium and other involved non-lymphoid tissues. We thank Drs. H. Beere and T. Ferguson for helpful discussions."

Specific glutamyl residues are methylated and demethylated in reactions catalyzed by methyltransferase CheR and methylesterase CheB. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, efficient adaptational modification by either enzyme is dependent on a conserved pentapeptide sequence at the chemoreceptor carboxyl terminus, a position distant from the sites of modification. For CheR-catalyzed methylation, previous work demonstrated that this sequence acts as a high affinity docking site, enhancing methylation by increasing enzyme concentration near methyl-accepting glutamates. We investigated pentapeptide-mediated enhancement of CheB-catalyzed demethylation and found it occurred by a distinctly different mechanism. Assays of binding between CheB and the pentapeptide sequence showed that it was too weak to have a significant effect on local enzyme concentration. Kinetic analyses revealed that interaction of the sequence and the methylesterase enhanced the rate constant of demethylation not the Michaelis constant. This allosteric activation occurred if the sequence was attached to chemoreceptor, but hardly at all if it was present as an isolated peptide. In addition, free peptide inhibited demethylation of the native receptor carrying the pentapeptide sequence at its carboxyl terminus. These observations imply that the allosteric change is transmitted through the protein substrate, not the enzyme.

In bacterial chemotaxis, adaptation is accomplished through covalent modification of transmembrane chemoreceptors (1Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Specific glutamyl residues in the chemoreceptor cytoplasmic domain (2Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc.

In the well studied chemosensory systems of Escherichia coli andSalmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (see Refs. 5Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Control of receptor methylation and demethylation determines steady state cellular behavior, the ability of the chemosensory system to provide exact adaptation over a wide dynamic range, and the process of molecular memory. Thus the means by which receptor modification is modulated are of great interest.Chemoreceptors form complexes with the chemotaxis-specific histidine kinase CheA, enhancing an otherwise low rate of autophosphorylation (12Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and providing phosphoryl groups for transfer to two response regulators, CheY and CheB (13Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Phospho-CheY binds the flagellar rotary motor and determines the direction of rotation (14Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). CheB is phosphorylated on its regulatory domain, activating its catalytic domain (15Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Binding of chemoattractant to receptor reduces kinase activity (12Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and thus cellular levels of phospho-CheY, resulting in a change in rotational bias and thus an altered pattern of swimming (16Barak R. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, these changes are short-lived because an increase in ligand occupancy also initiates the feedback loop of adaptation. Stimulated receptors accumulate methyl groups through a combination of a reduced cellular level of phospho-CheB and occupancy specific activation of methyl-accepting sites (17Borczuk A. Staub A. Stock J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 918-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Russell C.B. Stewart R.C. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3609-3618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased methylation creates a compensatory change in the receptor-kinase complex (19Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that restores CheA activity to its null, receptor-activated state even though the increased level of attractant persists.What determines the efficiency of adaptational methylation and demethylation? Sites of modification are spaced seven apart in the receptor sequence (2Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), are on solvent-exposed surfaces of the chemoreceptor cytoplasmic domain (20Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and are bracketed by sequences that share common features and influence kinetic preferences among sites (8Nowlin D.M.

In E. coli and Salmonella, a conserved sequence, asparagine-tryptophan-glutamate-threonine-phenylalanine (NWETF), at the carboxyl terminus of high abundance chemoreceptors (Fig. 1) interacts with the methyltransferase (22Wu J., Li, J., Li, G.

For methyltransferase CheR, it provides a high affinity docking site that increases enzyme concentration near the methyl-accepting glutamates (22Wu J., Li, J., Li, G. Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the current work we investigated enhancement of CheB-catalyzed demethylation by the pentapeptide sequence. We found that it occurs through a distinctly different mechanism of allosteric activation.DISCUSSIONWe found that enhancement of CheB-catalyzed demethylation by the NWETF pentapeptide sequence at the carboxyl terminus of a chemoreceptor occurred in a way distinctly different from its enhancement of CheR-catalyzed methylation. For the methylation reaction, the sequence provides a high affinity docking site for the CheR methyltransferase and thus increases the effective concentration of the enzyme in the neighborhood of substrate methyl-accepting sites (22Wu J., Li, J., Li, G. Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, interaction of CheB with receptor-borne pentapeptide enhanced demethylation allosterically. Consistent with an allosteric action, the sequence bound too weakly to the CheB methylesterase to cause a significant increase in local concentration of the enzyme.Different Mechanisms of EnhancementOf the two kinds of CheR-interaction sites on a chemoreceptor, the strongest binding is not at the sites of catalysis (the methyl-accepting glutamyl residues) but instead at the carboxyl-terminal NWETF sequence. CheR binds with the same dissociation constant of ∼2 μm to pentapeptide alone, to the isolated cytoplasmic domain of chemoreceptor Tsr carrying the pentapeptide sequence and three methyl-accepting sites, and to intact receptor carrying the sequence and from one to five methyl-accepting sites, but exhibits no detectable binding to isolated cytoplasmic domains containing methyl-accepting sites but missing the carboxyl-terminal sequence (22Wu J., Li, J., Li, G. Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Differences in rates of methylation for Tar and TarΔpp imply that binding of CheR to its substrate sites is ∼20-fold weaker than binding to the pentapeptide sequence (26Le Moual H. Quang T. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13441-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations show that the sequence acts as a high affinity docking site for the methyltransferase, enhancing the methylation reaction by recruiting the enzyme to the vicinity of its substrate sites and thus increasing the probability of binding at the methyl-accepting glutamyl residues.Our data indicate that this is not the mechanism by which receptor-borne pentapeptide enhances CheB-catalyzed demethylation. Kinetic analysis of demethylation revealed that the NWETF sequence at the carboxyl terminus of a receptor substrate enhanced k cat not K m, and thus indicated that pentapeptide-enzyme interaction affected catalysis not binding. It is interesting to note that phosphorylation, which activates CheB independent of interaction with the pentapeptide (23Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10667-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), also enhances k cat rather thanK m (39Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Enhancement of k catnot K m was consistent with the weak binding we observed for the enzyme and pentapeptide sequence, a binding insufficient to enhance enzyme action by increasing concentrations of CheB near substrate sites. As documented in Figs. 4 and 5, CheB bound to the free pentapeptide NWETF with a K d ∼ 150 μm, and the concentrations of free peptide necessary to inhibit phospho-CheB activity (Fig. 7) indicated that phosphorylation of the enzyme did not make the affinity substantially stronger. Investigation of CheB binding to the sequence at its natural location at the carboxyl terminus of a chemoreceptor indicated a similarly weak interaction. The short lifetime of phospho-CheB kept us from performing direct measurements of binding of phosphorylated enzyme to receptor-borne pentapeptide, but a strong binding for only this combination could not explain enhancement by the receptor-borne pentapeptide of demethylation catalyzed by CheB that is not phosphorylated (23Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10667-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), nor the effect of the receptor-borne pentapeptide on k cat rather than K m. Estimates of the cellular content of chemoreceptors range from 2,500 to 10,000 (41Hazelbauer G.L. Engstrom P. Harayama S. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 43-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Clarke S. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9695-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Stock J.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10826-10833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the content of CheB has been estimated at 2,000 (44Simms S.A. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8537-8543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These values translate to cellular concentrations between 4 and 16 μm for chemoreceptors and ∼3 μm CheB. At such concentrations, a CheB-pentapeptide complex with aK d of ∼150 μm, would involve only a small proportion of total cellular CheB and this complex would not create a significant increase in concentration of CheB in the neighborhood of its sites of enzymatic action.There is a disparity between the ∼150 μm K d of pentapeptide and CheB or phospho-CheB and theK m of ∼3 μm for demethylation by either CheB or phospho-CheB. We do not fully understand this disparity, but it can be understood if we assume that K mapproximates K d for enzyme and substrate methyl ester (see below for the conditions under which this assumption would be valid). In this case, the interaction of the enzyme and substrate site would be significantly stronger that the interaction of the enzyme and receptor-borne pentapeptide. This stronger binding, as reflected inK m, would not be a function of the presence or absence of the pentapeptide sequence on a receptor (this is what we observe), and allosteric enhancement of CheB-mediated catalysis would be the result of binding of pentapeptide to enzyme bound to or near the substrate site. Using K m to approximateK d is valid if the rate constant of dissociation for unreacted substrate from the enzyme-substrate complex is substantially higher than k cat and the catalytic mechanism does not involve a covalent intermediate. These issues are currently under investigation. No matter what the affinity of enzyme for its substrate sites, the weak affinity of enzyme for pentapeptide indicates that this interaction could not assist CheB in passing through a receptor array by the “molecular brachiation” process postulated for CheR (40Levin M.D. Shimizu T.S. Bray D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1809-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Kinetic parameters for phospho-CheB acting on NWETF-containing receptor, K m ∼ 2.8 μm andk cat ∼ 190 mmol of methanol s−1mol of CheB−1, are quite similar to the parameters for CheR, which are K m = 2.1 μm andk cat = 170 mmol s−1 mol of CheR−1 (44Simms S.A. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8537-8543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the dynamic equilibrium of adaptational modification, in which the population of unstimulated or adapted receptor is maintained at a constant level of methylation by a balance between rates of methylation and demethylation (45Kehry M.R. Doak T.G. Dahlquist F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Allosteric Activation of DemethylationThe pentapeptide-binding site on CheB is separated from the active site (24Barnakov A.N. Barnakova L.A. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32984-32989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and thus enhancement of catalysis through an effect on the enzyme would be an effect of binding at a site distance from the site of catalysis, i.e. an allosteric effect. However, the substrate itself is a protein, so it was possible that interaction of its carboxyl-terminal sequence with the methylesterase could allosterically alter the receptor to enhance demethylation. The data are consistent with this second alternative, that allosteric activation is principally through the receptor, not the enzyme. If binding of the NWETF sequence induced an allosteric activation in the methylesterase, then it should not be crucial whether this sequence were present in its natural location at the carboxyl terminus of a chemoreceptor or as a free pentapeptide. Fig. 6 documents that free pentapeptide provided only a few percent of the activation created by the receptor-borne sequence. If allosteric activation required that the pentapeptide sequence be coupled to the chemoreceptor, then free pentapeptide should inhibit demethylation of receptors carrying the carboxyl-terminal sequence. Fig. 7 documents that this is the case. Taken together, these two results imply that the vast majority of the enhancement of demethylation generated by interaction of the receptor-borne sequence and CheB is conveyed through a change in the receptor, not the enzyme. Thus the primary allosteric effect appears to be through the protein substrate. However, the issues require additional investigation, because we have not yet demonstrated directly induction of a conformation change in the receptor by interaction of CheB and receptor-borne pentapeptide. Such investigations are underway.Substrate-transmitted Allostery and Signal AmplificationChemotactic response in E. coli exhibits striking signal amplification (46Mesibov R. Ordal G.W. Adler J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 47Segall J.E. Block S.M. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this amplification is not yet understood, but recent observations have implicated methylesterase CheB as a crucial participant (48Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 49Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). If CheB binding to receptor-borne, carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide induces substrate-transmitted allostery, this conformational change could be related to the role of CheB in signal amplification. Sensory systems are designed to adapt to persistent stimulation. In bacterial chemotaxis, adaptation is accomplished through covalent modification of transmembrane chemoreceptors (1Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Specific glutamyl residues in the chemoreceptor cytoplasmic domain (2Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) are methylated by methyltransferase CheR (3Springer W.R. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to form carboxyl methyl esters. These esters can be hydrolyzed by methylesterase CheB (4Stock J.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the well studied chemosensory systems of Escherichia coli andSalmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (see Refs. 5Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Control of receptor methylation and demethylation determines steady state cellular behavior, the ability of the chemosensory system to provide exact adaptation over a wide dynamic range, and the process of molecular memory. Thus the means by which receptor modification is modulated are of great interest. Chemoreceptors form complexes with the chemotaxis-specific histidine kinase CheA, enhancing an otherwise low rate of autophosphorylation (12Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and providing phosphoryl groups for transfer to two response regulators, CheY and CheB (13Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Phospho-CheY binds the flagellar rotary motor and determines the direction of rotation (14Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). CheB is phosphorylated on its regulatory domain, activating its catalytic domain (15Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Binding of chemoattractant to receptor reduces kinase activity (12Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and thus cellular levels of phospho-CheY, resulting in a change in rotational bias and thus an altered pattern of swimming (16Barak R. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, these changes are short-lived because an increase in ligand occupancy also initiates the feedback loop of adaptation. Stimulated receptors accumulate methyl groups through a combination of a reduced cellular level of phospho-CheB and occupancy specific activation of methyl-accepting sites (17Borczuk A. Staub A. Stock J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 918-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Russell C.B. Stewart R.C. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3609-3618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased methylation creates a compensatory change in the receptor-kinase complex (19Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that restores CheA activity to its null, receptor-activated state even though the increased level of attractant persists. What determines the efficiency of adaptational methylation and demethylation? Sites of modification are spaced seven apart in the receptor sequence (2Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), are on solvent-exposed surfaces of the chemoreceptor cytoplasmic domain (20Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and are bracketed by sequences that share common features and influence kinetic preferences among sites (8Nowlin D.M. Bollinger J. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6039-6045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nowlin D.M. Bollinger J. Hazelbauer G.L.

A. 1995; 92: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, a crucial determinant is at the chemoreceptor carboxyl terminus, separated from the sites of modification. In E. coli and Salmonella, a conserved sequence, asparagine-tryptophan-glutamate-threonine-phenylalanine (NWETF), at the carboxyl terminus of high abundance chemoreceptors (Fig. 1) interacts with the methyltransferase (22Wu J., Li, J., Li, G.

By using various dTC analogs, we measured the interactions of specific dTC functional groups with amino acid positions in the AChR γ-subunit. Because data for mutations at residue γTyr117 were the most consistent with direct interaction with dTC, we focused on that residue. Double mutant thermodynamic cycle analysis showed apparent interactions of γTyr117 with both the 2-N and the 13′-positions of dTC. Examination of a dTC analog with a negative charge at the 13′-position failed to reveal electrostatic interaction with charged side-chain substitutions at γ117, but the effects of side-chain substitutions remained consistent with proximity of Tyr117 to the cationic 2-N of dTC. The apparent interaction of γTyr117with the 13′-position of dTC was likely mediated by allosteric changes in either dTC or the receptor. The data also show that cation-π electron stabilization of the 2-N position is not required for high affinity binding. Molecular modeling of dTC within the binding pocket of the acetylcholine-binding protein places the 2-N in proximity to the residue homologous to γTyr117. This model provides a plausible structural basis for binding of dTC within the acetylcholine-binding site of the AChR family that appears consistent with findings from photoaffinity labeling studies and with site-directed mutagenesis studies of the AChR.

It is a pseudo-symmetric pentamer with a subunit stoichiometry of α2βγδ. The agonist-binding sites, which are responsible for activating channel opening, lie at the interfaces between the α- and γ-subunits and between the α- and δ-subunits (1Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The two sites are similar and share conserved features contributed by their respective α-subunits as well as the amino acids that remain constant among the homologous γ- and δ-subunits. The γ- and δ-subunits, however, also determine affinity differences of the two sites for various ligands. Affinity differences between the sites extend to both agonists, such as epibatidine (2Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and carbamylcholine (3Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and to competitive antagonists, such as d-tubocurarine (4Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Identification of binding site residues has been carried out by affinity and photoaffinity labeling, by cross-linking studies, by analysis of expressed chimeric receptors, and by site-directed mutagenesis (5Corringer P.J., Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). These approaches have found that the binding sites consist of residues from two subunits from several regions (also referred to as loops) that are distant in the linear subunit sequences. Loop c in the α-subunit includes residues α184–α198, which constitute a significant part of the binding determinant for α-bungarotoxin (6Wilson P.T. Hawrot E. Lentz T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar). It also includes an unusual, highly conserved vicinal disulfide bond between αCys192 and αCys193 (7Kao P.N. Karlin A. J. Biol.

The two other regions within the α-subunit include the residues αTyr93 (8O'Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cohen J.B.

The alternating pattern of residues contributing to binding in this region led to the proposal that the sequence makes a hairpin turn in their vicinity of the binding site (13Chiara D.C. Xie Y.

The detailed interactions between ligands and this sizable set of amino acid residues are largely unknown. However, the prevalence of aromatic amino acids as well as detailed studies using unnatural amino acid substitution support the hypothesis that cation π-electron interaction are critical for stabilizing the ammoniums of agonists (11Zhong W. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y., Li, L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar,17Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R.

Such studies also yielded observations on the possible interactions of several other aromatic residues; Nowak et al. (17Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C.G. Silverman S.K. Zhong W. Thorson J. Abelson J.N. Davidson N. Schultz P.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Science. 1995; 268: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that αTyr93 is likely to act as a hydrogen bond donor, whereas the aromatic ring of αTyr198appears to interact with the quaternary ammonium of acetylcholine. Antagonists such as dTC have been utilized to study binding site interactions, partly because of the significant affinity difference between the two binding sites. dTC has ∼100–500-fold higher affinity for the αγ site than the αδ site (4Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, α-subunit residues also affect binding of dTC. αTyr198 has a strong impact on dTC affinity; when mutated to αY198F, the AChR displayed ∼10-fold greater affinity for dTC, but the mutation had little effect on acetylcholine affinity or efficacy (18Filatov G.N. Aylwin M.L. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 237-241PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests a unique interaction between the αTyr198 hydroxyl and dTC. Because mutations at αTyr198 and γTyr117 had similar effects on metocurine (sometimes referred to as dimethyl-tubocurarine) affinity, it was proposed that these amino acids each stabilize one of the two quaternary ammoniums on metocurine through cation-π electron interactions (19Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent atomic resolution structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein from Lymnaea stagnalis (AChBP), a protein homologous to the N-terminal, ligand-binding domain of the AChR, shows that many of the residues implicated by the studies listed above are in proximity to a binding pocket where they can contribute to stabilization of binding of agonists and antagonists (20Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The structure included a solvent Hepes molecule that indicates the likely binding locus. The structure is in accord with many of the prior observations regarding ligand-binding site structure and substantially refined the current thinking about ligand-receptor interactions. However, the details of the interactions with cholinergic ligands remain to be fully elucidated, as do the conformational changes that correlate with channel opening and desensitization. Our previous studies (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Papineni R.V. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24891-24898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have taken advantage of dTC analogs to examine the importance of various functional groups to binding interactions and conformational transitions. The structures of the analogs are shown in Fig. 1. For both mouse and TorpedoAChR, we demonstrated that the stereochemistry at the 1 carbon was important for high affinity binding but that the ammoniums at the 2- and 2′-positions need not be quaternary for high affinity binding (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dTC ring D, which includes the 12′- and 13′-positions, interacts in a site-selective manner, consistent with a possible interaction with the γ- and δ-subunits. 13′-Modification further altered the propensity of dTC to desensitize the TorpedoAChR, an observation that may serve as a clue for the structural changes that occur upon conformational shifts of the AChR. In order to pinpoint such interactions between a ligand functional group and a particular amino acid residue, ligand binding energies must be examined in concert with receptor mutagenesis. In this study, we utilize a double mutant thermodynamic cycle analysis to analyze the interaction between our library of dTC analogs (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and residues in the AChR-binding site, with particular emphasis on the interaction with residue γTyr117. We demonstrate that both the 2-N and the 13′-positions of dTC appear to interact with this amino acid but with a proximal interaction only to the 2-N. Based on this conclusion and using the structure of the AChBP, we present a plausible structural model for the orientation and position of dTC within the binding pocket. The α-subunit cDNA clone of the mouse nicotinic AChR was a gift from Dr. Mike White (MCP Hahnemann University); the β-, γ-, and δ-subunit cDNAs were gifts from Dr. James Patrick (Baylor College of Medicine). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen or from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The QuickChange mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and Endo-free Mega and Giga kits were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). PEI was obtained either from Miles or from Aldrich. 125I-α-Bungarotoxin was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Whatman GF/C filters were obtained through VWR Scientific (Houston, TX). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or from standard sources. Synthesis of most of the d-tubocurarine analogs was described previously (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Synthesis of several new analogs is described as follows. For 13′-sulfo-d-tubocurarine (sulfo-dTC, 7′,12′-dihydroxy-6,6′-dimethoxy-13′-sulfonate-2,2′,2′-trimethyltubocuraranium trifluoroacetate), 1 g of dTC was treated with 5 ml of concentrated H2SO4 on ice for 3 h. The product was precipitated by dilution with 500 ml of cold ether and collected by centrifugation. The product was purified by cation exchange chromatography over a CM-25 Sephadex column (AmershamBiosciences) and eluted with a gradient of 50–400 mmammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Pure fractions were collected and lyophilized with a net yield of 58%. The material was desalted on a reversed phase Beckman C-18 Ultrasphere preparative HPLC column (22 × 150 mm). The column was eluted with a gradient of 10–40% of 0.9% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN. The final product was lyophilized to a white powder. The identity was verified by mass spectroscopy (m/z = 689 and 345, for the di-cation). For diacetyl-d-tubocurarine (7′,12′-diacetoxy-6,6′-dimethoxy-2,2′,2′-trimethyltubocuraranium dinitrate), 1.07 g of dTC was treated with 2.5 ml of acetic anhydride in 8 ml of glacial acetic acid and 874 mg of sodium acetate, essentially according to Dutcher (23Dutcher J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 2221-2225Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The product was isolated by crystallization of the nitrate salt with a yield of 66%. This product was 95% pure as judged by reversed phase HPLC; the remaining contaminant corresponded to a monoacetylated compound. For iodo-chondocurarine (7′,12′-dihydroxy-6,6′-dimethoxy-13′-iodo-2,2,2′,2′-tetramethyltubocuraranium ditrifluoroacetate), ICl (0.5 mmol) in MeOH was slowly added to 0.2 mmol of chondocurarine (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) dissolved in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 5.6, 100 ml) on ice. After 30 min of reaction, 0.5 mmol of neat 2-mercaptoethanol was added to quench the excess ICl. The mixture was diluted to 250 ml, adjusted to pH 8.0 using NH4OH, and subjected to a CM-25 Sephadex cation exchange column chromatography. The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 300 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0. The fractions containing pure product were identified by reversed phase HPLC, pooled, and lyophilized. The dry salts were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O and applied to a 21.2 × 150-mm Ultraprep C18 reversed phase HPLC column (Beckman) in four batches and then eluted with a gradient of 20–50% CH3CN over 60 min. The pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized to a white powder (47.4 mg, 49 μmol, 25%). This product was judged pure by HPLC, UV-visible spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy (two aromatic protons were shifted to δ7.62 and δ7.12 compared with δ7.11 and δ7.06 of chondocurarine), and mass spectrometry (m/z = 749.2, m/z = 375.1 for the double ion). For di-demethyl-d-tubocurarine (6,6′,7′,12′-tetrahydroxy-2,2′,2′-trimethyltubocuraranium ditrifluoroacetate), dTC (10 mg) was heated to 160 °C in 300 μl of phosphoric acid. The reaction mixture was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O and applied to a preparative reversed phase HPLC column. A major and a minor product were isolated, both essentially pure, and lyophilized. The major product corresponded to 6,6′-didemethyl-d-tubocurarine by mass spectroscopy (m/z = 581.2 and m/z = 291.2 for the double ion). The minor product was singly demethylated. For the expression studies, the cDNA of each subunit of the mouse muscle AChR (α, β, γ, and δ) was released from the original plasmid by using appropriate combinations of restriction enzymes and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA for each of the four subunits was subsequently cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) to create the expression plasmids pCDNA3.NA-α, pCDNA3.NA-β, pCDNA3.NA-δ, and pCDNA3.NA-γ, respectively. The pCDNA3.NA-γ plasmid was digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRV andXhoI, and the resulting two DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The small DNA fragment (NA-γ.S) contained the sites for introducing the desired mutations, and the large DNA fragment (pCDNA.NA-γ.L) contained the remainder of the γ-subunit cDNA attached to the pCDNA vector; it was saved for later use. The NA-γ.S DNA fragment was subsequently cloned into the pBlueScript vector (Stratagene), which was pre-digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRV and XhoI. Point mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate pairs of mutation-specific oligonucleotide primers and the QuickChange mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, the plasmid DNA was transformed into the Escherichia coliXL-1 blue. Overnight cultures of three to four colonies from each transformation plate were grown, and plasmids were purified from these cultures using the Wizard plasmid purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequence of the entire DNA insert of each putative mutant plasmid was analyzed to confirm the desired mutation and to verify the sequence fidelity of the rest of the DNA. The NA-γ.S DNA fragment containing a given mutation was then released from the plasmid using the restriction enzymes EcoRV andXhoI, purified by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated with the previously purified pCDNA.NA-γ.L DNA fragment (see above). After verification by DNA sequencing, a recombinant plasmid containing the mutated full-length NA-γ cDNA was selected for large scale purification. Large scale purifications were carried out using either the Endofree Plasmid Mega (for 500 ml of culture) or the Endofree Plasmid Giga (2,500 ml of culture) kit. This purification was necessary for optimal expression of AChRs. HEK293 cells were grown to 70–90% confluence in 100-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 unit/ml penicillin, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin. Generally, cells passaged less than 15 times in culture were used for transient expression of the wild type and the mutant AChRs. For transient expression, the pCDNA3-based AChR subunit expression plasmids were mixed in a ratio of 2:1:1:1 of α/β/γ/δ (21 μg of total DNA/100-mm dish). A stock solution of PEI (25kD, branched form) was prepared at a concentration of 4.3 mg/ml (0.1 m in nitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (24Densmore C.L. Orson F.M., Xu, B. Kinsey B.M. Waldrep J.C. Hua P. Bhogal B. Knight V. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 180-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For each dish, 6.3 μl of PEI stock was diluted with 1.5 ml of sterile PBS, and the DNA was then added and mixed. The PBS/PEI/DNA mixture was incubated for 20–45 min at ambient temperature before addition to 9 ml of culture medium. The old culture medium was then removed from the dish, and the PBS/PEI/DNA mixture was added. Cells were returned to the incubator and harvested 48–72 h after transfection. [3H]Acetylcholine binding and binding of 125I-α-BgTx to Torpedo AChR was carried out as described previously (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For determination of binding constants to mutant mouse AChR expressed in tissue culture cells, the following protocol was observed. Cells were scraped into PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in high potassium/Ringer's containing 140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, with 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (16Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with the indicated concentration of competing ligand for 30 min at ambient temperature before the addition of 0.1–0.3 nm125I-α-BgTx (2000 Ci/mmol). A first order binding rate was observed for more than 2 h. Binding was stopped at 2 h with excess, cold, non-radioactive BgTx, and the samples were stored on ice. Samples were filtered and washed with PBS over GF/C filters that had been soaked cold overnight with 4% Carnation Instant Nonfat Dry Milk in potassium/Ringer's buffer. Filters were counted in a gamma counter (Beckman). Data were plotted and analyzed using SigmaPlot (Jandel, SPSS, Chicago, IL). To block binding to the αδ site, 30–80 nm CTX was added to each assay for most experiments; experiments using wild type receptors confirmed that this concentration of conotoxin only blocks ligand binding to the αδ site and does not change the affinity of the αγ site (25Papineni R.V. Sanchez J.U. Baksi K. Willcockson I.U. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23589-23598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We observed that the mouse AChR expressed in HEK293 cells displayed higher affinity for tubocurine and for iodo-dTC than the affinities observed previously for binding to the mouse AChR expressed by BC3H1 cells (22Papineni R.V. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24891-24898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that the lower affinities observed earlier had been due to the higher pH conditions of the former assays (∼7.5–8.0) and also to unidentified components in the former tissue culture media that specifically affected the binding of iodo-dTC. Nonetheless, the affinity changes of tubocurine and iodo-dTC described below were consistent with our earlier conclusions that the 2′-N likely interacted with the α-subunits or with conserved aspects of the heterologous subunits (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Papineni R.V. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24891-24898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and that the 12′, 13′ region interacted with the heterologous subunits. For each binding curve, theK I was determined by fitting to the equation for single site binding f =A(K I/(K I +L)) + background, where A represents maximum fmol bound, and L is the ligand concentration. Binding curves obtained in the absence of CTX were fitted to models for two-site binding with either equal or unequal site stoichiometries as described previously (22Papineni R.V. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24891-24898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine the degree of interaction between a site on the ligand and a site on the receptor, we used a double mutant thermodynamic cycle analysis (26Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 27Pedersen S.E. Lurtz M.M. Papineni R.V. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Four different binding curves were obtained in a single experiment; two ligands differing in a discrete position were measured with both wild type and mutant AChR. The interaction factor Ω was then calculated from theK I values using the equation Ω = (K W,L1/K W,L2)/(K m,L1/K M,L2), where the subscripts indicate the following: W for wild type AChR, M for mutant receptor, and L1 andL2 for the two ligands being compared. An Ω value significantly different from 1 indicates an interaction between the functional group on the ligand and the amino acid of the receptor. Energy minimizations of dTC and the AChBP (Ref. 20Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 1I9B) were conducted with the software package HyperChem (versus 5.1, Hypercube Inc., Gainesville, FL) using the MM+ force field. The initial structure of dTC was taken from the coordinates of a crystal form (28Reynolds C.D. Palmer R.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1976; 32: 1431-1439Crossref Google Scholar) and was energy-minimized, which produced only minor changes in the structure. Initial simulations were sped up by using a reduced structure of the AChBP. Three of the five subunits were deleted; of the remaining two subunits, only the amino acids in immediate ligand contact plus one layer of surrounding amino acids were considered during energy minimization. For the initial manual alignment of dTC in the AChBP-binding site, dTC was placed in the binding site with the 2′-ammonium at the site of the ethanesulfonic acid-piperazine nitrogen of Hepes, a ligand found in the original structure of the binding site (20Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). dTC was energy-minimized in several rounds without allowing changes in protein structure. To resolve steric conflicts or trapping in local energy minima, occasional manual changes in dTC location were made. When a preliminary structure was obtained for bound dTC, it was then merged with two complete subunits of the acetylcholine-binding protein. Subsequent dTC energy minimization included minimization of all contact residues in the context of two complete AChBP subunits. To mimic the structure of the mouse AChR αγ-binding site, the aligned, homologous mouse residues were substituted for the side chains of contact residues. The substituted side chains are shown in Fig.8 C. After each substitution, the side chain was minimized to conform to the surrounding protein environment. dTC was then energy-minimized in the context of the new structure. Two separate rounds of minimizations were conducted. First, dTC was minimized while the protein was kept rigid. Second, after the approximate dTC conformation was found, dTC and 31 nearby residues were then all minimized collectively to yield the final structure. In order to examine the proximal relationship of AChR amino acid residues to functional groups on dTC, we assessed the degree of interaction by double mutant thermodynamic cycle analysis. In general, the affinities of mutant and wild type AChRs were measured for a pair of dTC analogs. The four K I values thus obtained were used to determine the value of the interaction coefficient, Ω (see “Experimental Procedures”). An initial goal was to identify amino acids that had specific interactions with dTC. Our previous work (21Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Papineni R.V. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24891-24898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) had shown that modification of dTC to metocurine or to iodo-dTC shifted the ligand affinities and that the magnitude of the shifts differed at the two binding sites. Comparison of dTC with these analogs would test for interactions at the 2-N ammonium and at the 7′-, 12′-, and 13′-C positions. Therefore, our preliminary experiments utilized these two analogs, although not exclusively. To determine amino acids likely to interact at these dTC sites, we focused on those γ-subunit residues that had been identified to contribute to site-selective binding. Because dTC binds with higher affinity to the αγ site than the αδ site on bothTorpedo AChR and mouse AChR, γ-subunit amino acids were initially mutated to those amino acids found in the homologous, aligned positions of δ- or ε-subunits of either Torpedo or mouse muscle AChR. We first examined those residues identified by chimeric constructs to contribute to site-selective dTC binding: γIle116, γTyr117, and γSer161(16Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Conservative mutations of γI116M and γI116V displayed small, 2–4-fold affinity increases for metocurine over the wild type AChR and small affinity decreases for"

Qualitative and quantitative defects of α-spectrin are present in the erythrocytes of many patients with abnormalities of red blood cell shape including hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis. We wished to determine the regulatory elements that determine the erythroid-specific expression of the α-spectrin gene. We mapped the 5′ end of the α-spectrin erythroid cDNA and cloned the 5′ flanking genomic DNA containing the putative α-spectrin gene promoter. Using transfection of promoter/reporter plasmids in human tissue culture cell lines, in vitro DNase I footprinting analyses, and gel mobility shift assays, an α-spectrin gene erythroid promoter with binding sites for GATA-1- and NF-E2-related proteins was identified. Both binding sites were required for full promoter activity. In transgenic mice, a reporter gene directed by the α-spectrin promoter was expressed in yolk sac, fetal liver, and erythroid cells of bone marrow but not adult reticulocytes. No expression of the reporter gene was detected in nonerythroid tissues. We conclude that this α-spectrin gene promoter contains the sequences necessary for low level expression in erythroid progenitor cells. α-Spectrin is a highly expressed membrane protein critical for the flexibility and stability of the erythrocyte.

Spectrin, the most abundant protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, is composed of two structurally similar but nonidentical proteins, α- and β-spectrin, encoded by separate genes (1Winkelmann J.C.

In erythropoiesis, differentiation of early erythroid progenitor cells into morphologically defined erythroblasts is associated with significant changes in the synthesis and expression of membrane proteins. In splenic erythroblasts isolated from mice early after Friend virus infection, there is marked synthesis of spectrin with a significant excess of α-spectrin over β-spectrin (20Pteres L.L. White R.A.

Sahr K.E. Howard D. Palek J. Blood. 1992; 80: 530-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at this stage, only a small fraction of this newly synthesized spectrin is incorporated into the membrane skeleton (21Hanspal M. Hanspal J.S. Kalraiya R. Liu S.C. Sahr K.E. Howard D. Palek J. Blood. 1992; 80: 530-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During terminal differentiation, α- and β-spectrin synthesis are decreased, but a markedly increased amount of spectrin is incorporated into the membrane. Studies of erythropoiesis in avian and rat cells have shown that the increased α-spectrin synthesis in early erythropoiesis is controlled at the transcriptional level (21Hanspal M. Hanspal J.S. Kalraiya R. Liu S.C. Sahr K.E. Howard D. Palek J. Blood. 1992; 80: 530-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hanspal M. Palek J. J.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate the tissue or developmental stage-specific expression of α-spectrin, including the mechanisms that control the increase in α-spectrin gene transcription to high levels during the early stages of erythropoiesis, are unknown. The identification and characterization of the regulatory elements that control α-spectrin gene expression have important implications for several biological processes including the pathogenesis of α-spectrin-linked hemolytic anemia and erythrocyte membrane protein biosynthesis and assembly. Furthermore, because α-spectrin is synthesized in large amounts in erythroid cells, identification of the regulatory elements directing this high level, tissue-specific expression may provide important tools in directing other erythroid-specific genes in gene therapy applications. To provide insight into the regulation of the human α-spectrin gene, we have identified and characterized the human α-spectrin gene promoter. Our results demonstrate that the human α-spectrin gene promoter requires GATA-1- and NF-E2-binding proteins to direct high level expression in erythroid cells in vitro. In transgenic mice, a reporter gene directed by the α-spectrin promoter directed expression exclusively in erythroid progenitor cells at early stages of erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that the minimal α-spectrin gene promoter contains the sequences necessary for low level expression in erythroid progenitor cells and that additional regulatory elements are required for late developmental stage expression of the α-spectrin gene in erythroid cells. Total RNA was prepared from human tissues or from the human tissue culture cell lines K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis with erythroid characteristics; ATCC, CCL 243) or HeLa (epithelial-like carcinoma; cervix, CCL 2) as described (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

Primer D (see Table I) was 5′ end-labeled with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then ethanol was precipitated with 20 μg of total K562 cell RNA. The pellets were resuspended in hybridization buffer, heated to 60 °C for 90 min, and then precipitated. The pellets were resuspended, and the primer was extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 1 h. The RNA was then digested with RNase A. Extension products were ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in loading buffer, and analyzed on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. A human α-spectrin cDNA fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of the coding region, α19 (see Fig.1 A) (4Sahr K.E. Laurila P. Kotula L. Scarpa A.L. Coupal E. Leto T.L. Linnenbach A.J. Winkelmann J.C.

The library is a Charon 4A bacteriophage library containing fragments of genomic DNA partially digested with AluI and HaeIII withEcoRI linkers added. Selected recombinants that hybridized to α19 were purified and subcloned into pGEM-7Z plasmid vectors (Promega). Subcloned fragments were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, Southern blotting, and nucleotide sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from K562 and HeLa cells by hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described by Andrews and Faller (28Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) or Dignam et al. (29Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Probes for DNase I footprinting were produced by PCR amplification of an α-spectrin genomic fragment as template and a pair of oligonucleotide primers, E and F (see Table I). One oligonucleotide, either E or F, was 5′ end-labeled with [32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase prior to use in PCR. Reaction mixes contained K562 cell nuclear extracts, 10,000 cpm of labeled probe, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After digestion with DNase I, samples were electrophoresed in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. A 793-bp fragment corresponding to 5′ flanking α-spectrin genomic DNA was amplified using primers G + H (see TableI), which contain sites for KpnI and XhoI, respectively. The 793-bp amplification product was digested withKpnI and XhoI and then subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the plasmid pGL2B (Promega). Serial truncations of this 793-bp fragment in the pGL2B plasmid were constructed using PCR amplification. Integrity of all test plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. All plasmids tested were purified using Qiagen columns or cesium chloride plasmid purification, and at least two preparations of each plasmid were tested in triplicate. 107 K562 cells were transfected by electroporation with a single pulse of 300 V at 960 microfarad with 20 μg of test plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ, a mammalian reporter plasmid expressing β-galactosidase driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (Clontech) (30Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of test plasmid and 0.25 μg of the pCMVβ plasmid by lipofection using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and the activity of both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was determined in cell extracts. All assays were performed in triplicate. Differences in transfection efficiency were determined by co-transfection with the pCMVβ plasmid. COS cells (107) were transfected with 20 μg of the expression plasmids pMT/BKLF (31Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Drs. M. Crossley and S. Orkin) or pSG5/EKLF (32Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr. J. Bieker) as described above. Forty-eight h after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared for use in gel shift analyses. Binding reactions were carried out as described (33Mason P. Enver T. Wilkinson D. Williams J. Hames B. Higgins S. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 47-54Google Scholar). Competitor oligonucleotides were added at molar excesses of 100-fold. Antibodies to GATA-1, p45 NF-E2, and Sp1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Reaction mixes electrophoresed through 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 21 °C at 200 watts for 2 h. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. A 793-bp α-spectrin gene promoter fragment was excised from plasmid p793 as a SmaI/BglII fragment and ligated into the EcoRV/BamHI sites of pSP72. A 2266-bp EcoRV/AatII fragment containing the humanAγ-globin gene was excised from a pSP72 plasmid containing a 1909-bp BsaHI/HindIII fragment of the human Aγ-globin gene (34Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated into theAatII/PvuII sites of the pSP72 plasmid to generate αSp/Aγ. This plasmid construct was sequenced to confirm that the α-spectrin promoter was correctly fused to the γ-globin gene. Finally, a 2694-bp α-spectrin promoter/Aγ-globin gene fragment (see Fig. 8) was excised from this plasmid with KpnI and HindIII for microinjection. Transgenic mice were generated as described by Hogan et al. (35Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) and Sabatinoet al. (34Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were collected from superovulated FVB/N female mice ∼9 h after mating to CB6F1 male mice. After purification, α-spectrin promoter/Aγ-globin DNA fragments were microinjected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs. The injected eggs were transferred into pseudopregnant CB6F1 foster mothers. Founders were identified by Southern blotting of genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsies. Founder animals were crossed to FVB/N mice for propagation. Copy number was determined by comparing the γ-globin signals from Southern blot analysis of transgenic mouse and K562 DNA using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Statistical analysis of copy number and expression data was analyzed by linear regression using GraphPad Prism® version 2.0 software. Total cellular RNA was extracted from mouse tissues, including adult reticulocytes and separated splenic cells, using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Splenic cells were separated into erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid fractions using the following method. Total spleen cells were dissociated by passage through 16- and then 21-gauge needles. The single cell suspension was washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% fetal calf serum two times and suspended at 107 cells per ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% fetal calf serum. Ten ml of this was used to prepare RNA by TRIZOL. To the remaining 10 ml, 250 μl of TER 119 antibody was added. The cells were incubated for 25 min on ice with mixing every 5 min. The cells were underlayed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal calf serum and spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 10-ml goat and rat magnetic beads in 5% fetal calf serum for 30 min on ice with mixing every 5 min. The cells were applied to a magnet for 10 min. The beads and adherent cells were collected and processed directly to yield erythroid RNA. The nonadherent cells were collected and placed in a new tube to which 50 μl of anti-CD4 and 50 μl of anti-CD8 were added, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with mixing. CD4/8-positive cells were collected as above from the magnet and processed for lymphoid RNA. The remaining nonadherent cells were treated with antibodies against MAC-1 (50 μl) and Gr-1 (50 μl), and myeloid cells were collected for myeloid RNA. Expression of the erythroid α-spectrin promoter/Aγ-globin reporter transgene was analyzed using an RNase protection assay. Linear DNA templates for the RNase protection assay were prepared by EcoRI digestion of a human α spectrin/Aγ-globin plasmid or by HindIII digestion of a murine α-globin plasmid. Templates were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit; Ambion Incorporated, Austin, TX). The probe (1 × 105 cpm per assay) was hybridized to template RNA at 42 °C overnight. Template RNAs in these reactions were 1 μg of total RNA from yolk sac, fetal liver, adult reticulocyte, bone marrow, muscle, brain, heart, kidney, and splenic cells separated into erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid cells or 10 μg of tRNA. Hybrids were digested with a mixture of the nucleases RNase A and RNase T1. After digestion, protected fragments were detected by autoradiography after electrophoresis in 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Primary screening of a human genomic DNA library with the α-spectrin cDNA probe α19 (Fig.1 A) yielded multiple hybridization-positive plaques. Selected recombinants were analyzed, and one clone was identified, λ3021, that spanned ∼16.5 kb of DNA containing the α-spectrin gene. A limited restriction map of this region is shown in Fig. 1 B. To identify the 5′ end of the human α-spectrin cDNA, primer extension was performed using total RNA from K562 cells. These experiments identified a single transcription initiation site (Fig.2) and predicted the presence of an additional 17 bp in the mRNA upstream of the 5′ end of the sequence obtained from cDNA cloning. These additional 17 bp of upstream 5′ untranslated sequence were obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Sequences obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Fig. 1 A) were verified by comparison to corresponding genomic DNA sequences (Fig. 3). The sequences around the transcription start site, GTA+1TGTC, closely match transcription initiation recognition sequences, YYA+1NWYY (36Javahery R. Khachi A., Lo, K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). No additional ATGs were present in the 5′ untranslated sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that this sequence is at or very near the 5′ end of the human α-spectrin erythroid cDNA.Figure 35′ flanking genomic DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′ flanking genomic DNA of the human α-spectrin gene is shown. Consensus sequences for potential DNA-protein binding sites are underlined. The transcription initiation site, +1, is denoted by the arrow above theA. The sequences beginning intron 1 are shown inlowercase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The nucleotide sequence of the 5′ flanking genomic DNA upstream of the human α-spectrin cDNA transcription start site is shown in Fig.3. Inspection of the sequence reveals features lack consensus TATA or CCAAT sequences. Consensus sequences for a number of potential DNA-binding proteins, including GATA-1 (three sites), NF-E2, AP-1, and Sp1/CACCC-related proteins are present in the 5′ flanking sequences. To investigate whether the region from −793 to +1 was capable of directing expression of a reporter gene in cultured mammalian cells, test plasmid p793 was transiently transfected into K562 cells. The relative luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection and compared with the activity obtained with pGL2B, a negative control, the promoterless plasmid, and pGL2P, a positive control, the luciferase reporter gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the putative α-spectrin gene erythroid promoter plasmid, p793, directed high level expression of the luciferase reporter gene in erythroid cells. Transient transfection analysis of deletions of this α-spectrin gene erythroid promoter fragment identified a 195-bp minimal promoter fragment, p194, that directed expression of the reporter gene in erythroid cells (Fig. 4 A). This minimal promoter fragment contains potential binding sites for GATA-1, as well as Sp1 and CACCC-related proteins, a combination shown to be adequate for expression of a minimal promoter in other erythroid-specific genes. There was minimal or no reporter gene activity of either p793 or p194 in transfected HeLa cells. To identify binding sites for transcription factors within the core α-spectrin promoter, DNase I footprinting analysis with nuclear extracts from K562 cells was performed (Fig. 5). A single long footprint was observed. This site contains consensus binding sequences for GATA-1, NF-E2, and CACCC binding proteins. To determine whether nuclear proteins could bind the three GATA-1 sites present in the α-spectrin gene promoter in vitro, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the corresponding α-spectrin promoter GATA-1 sequences (site 1, I + J; site 2, K + L; site 3, M + N) (see Table I) or control GATA-1 sequences (O + P; see Table I) (37Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were prepared and used in gel shift analyses. When oligonucleotides containing the upstream GATA-1 sequences were used in gel shift analyses, a single retarded species was observed in K562 (erythroid) extracts when probes corresponding to either site 2 (Fig. 6) or site 3 (not shown) but not site 1 (not shown). These species migrated at the same location as a control oligonucleotide containing a GATA-1 consensus sequence. This species was effectively competed both by an excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide and by an excess of unlabeled control GATA-1 oligonucleotide (not shown). The inclusion of GATA-1 antisera abolished most or all of the DNA binding of the site 2 (Fig. 6) and site 3 probes (not shown). When oligonucleotides with mutation of the consensus GATA-1 binding sequences (GATA to GTTA) (38Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These data indicate that GATA-1 binds to the two downstream GATA-1 sites but not the upstream GATA-1 site of the α-spectrin gene promoter in vitro. To determine whether nuclear proteins could bind the NF-E2 consensus binding sequences in vitro, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the corresponding α-spectrin promoter NF-E2 sequences (Q + R; see Table I) or control sequences (S + T; see Table I) (39Mignotte V.

These species migrated at the same location as a control oligonucleotide containing an NF-E2 consensus sequence. This species was effectively competed both by an excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide and by an excess of unlabeled control NF-E2 oligonucleotide. The inclusion of p45 NF-E2 antisera abolished most or all of the DNA binding (Fig.7). When a double-stranded oligonucleotide with mutation of the α-spectrin promoter consensus NF-E2 binding sequences (GCTGAGTCA to TCTGAGTCA) (39Mignotte V. Eleouet J.F. Raich N. Romeo P.H. Proc. Natl.

These data indicate that NF-E2-binding proteins bind in vitro to the α-spectrin gene promoter. The protected region obtained in DNase I footprinting included the sequence, 5′-CCACCC-3′, a consensus binding site for CACCC box-binding proteins.
