Inhibiting fibrillogenesis is thus one approach toward disease therapy. Rational design of fibrillogenesis inhibitors requires elucidation of the stages and kinetics of Aβ fibrillogenesis. We report results of studies designed to examine the initial stages of Aβ oligomerization. Size exclusion chromatography, quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy, and electron microscopy were used to characterize fibrillogenesis intermediates. After dissolution in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and removal of pre-existent seeds, Aβ chromatographed almost exclusively as a single peak. The molecules composing the peak had average hydrodynamic radii of 1.8 ± 0.2 nm, consistent with the predicted size of dimeric Aβ. Over time, an additional peak, with a molecular weight >100,000, appeared. This peak contained predominantly curved fibrils, 6–8 nm in diameter and <200 nm in length, which we have termed “protofibrils.” The kinetics of protofibril formation and disappearance are consistent with protofibrils being intermediates in the evolution of amyloid fibers. Protofibrils appeared during the polymerization of Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), and Aβ-(1–40)-Gln22, peptides associated with both sporadic and inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that protofibril formation may be a general phenomenon in Aβ fibrillogenesis. If so, protofibrils could be attractive targets for fibrillogenesis inhibitors. Fibrillogenesis of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is a seminal pathogenetic event in Alzheimer's disease.

Fibrillar amyloid plaques in the cerebral parenchyma and vasculature are a cardinal neuropathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, amyloid β-protein; QLS, quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HFIP, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol; RIA, radioimmunoassay; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). Aβ is a normal component of the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, occurring as a soluble 40- or 42-residue peptide (3Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M.G. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 4Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Thus, a central question in the etiology of AD is the mechanism(s) by which these soluble Aβ molecules are converted into plaque-associated fibers (5Selkoe D.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This question is particularly relevant because Aβ fibers, unlike nonfibrillar Aβ, are neurotoxic in vitro and are associated with damaged neuropil in vivo(6Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that inhibiting fiber formation would be an effective approach toward AD therapy. However, if these efforts are to succeed, fiber formation must be understood at the molecular level. Aβ fibrillogenesis is a nucleation-dependent polymerization process (7Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 8Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The kinetics of this type of process is controlled by two key parameters, nucleation rate and elongation rate. Past studies of the kinetics of Aβ fibrillogenesis, utilizing techniques including turbidity, sedimentation, and thioflavine T binding, could only provide information on the appearance of high molecular weight aggregates (7Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 9LeVine III, H.

J. 1994; 67: 1216-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Neither rate constants nor structures of fibrillogenesis intermediates could be determined by these approaches. In contrast, the technique of quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy (QLS) is particularly well suited for resolving individual stages of polymerization processes and for examining polymerization kinetics (14Cohen R.J. Benedek G.B. Immunochemistry. 1975; 12: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). QLS was used initially to monitor late stages of Aβ fibrillogenesis (15Tomski S.J. Murphy R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 630-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Shen C.-L. Scott G.L. Merchant F. Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2383-2395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a model system was developed for the highly reproducible growth of Aβ fibers (8Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). This allowed QLS monitoring of polymer size during all phases of fibrillogenesis and determination of the rates of Aβ fibril nucleation and elongation (8Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The QLS approach is less useful for studying small structures, such as Aβ monomers and oligomers, when they exist in mixtures with larger polymers. Because these prefibrillar intermediates are potential targets for fibrillogenesis inhibitors, it is important to characterize them. One method for doing so is SDS-PAGE (17Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 18Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C.

However, since many Aβ polymers are SDS-labile, interpreting SDS-PAGE studies of Aβ polymerization is problematic. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is an attractive alternative to SDS-PAGE because it fractionates on the basis of molecular weight and is performed using nondenaturing and nondisaggregating buffers. SEC has been used to study the aggregation state of Aβ in solution (20Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Barrow C.J.

Brain Res. 1995; 703: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but its potential in kinetic studies has not been exploited. We report here the use of SEC, coupled with QLS and electron microscopy, to characterize the temporal evolution and structures of oligomeric intermediates in the pathway of Aβ fibrillogenesis. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma and, unless otherwise stated, were of the highest purity available. Solvents were HPLC grade and were obtained from Fisher. Water was double-distilled and deionized using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Peptides were synthesized as described by Lomakin et al. (8Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Crude Aβ-(1–40) was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac phenyl column (22 × 250 mm) and a linear gradient of 28–56% B over 50 min (A: 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; B: 70% (v/v) acetonitrile (CH3CN), 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Aβ-(1–42) was purified using a PLRP-S column (25 × 150 mm) and a linear gradient of 20–60% B over 80 min (A: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.1; B: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.1, containing 54% (v/v) CH3CN and 6% (v/v) 2-propanol) at a flow rate of 15 ml/min (24Naslund J. Karlstrom A.R. Tjernberg L.O. Schierhorn A. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following purification, Aβ-(1–42) was dialyzed against 0.15m ammonium hydroxide in 40% (v/v) CH3CN, lyophilized, and converted to its trifluoroacetic acid salt by dissolution in 100% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide mass, purity, and quantity were determined by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, analytical HPLC, and quantitative amino acid analysis, respectively. Purified peptides were aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at−20 °C until used. Aβ-(40–1) was generously provided by Dr. Dennis Selkoe (Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School). A description of columns and buffers is found in Table I. Superdex, Superose and TSK columns were attached to a Rainin HPLC system consisting of a HPXL pump, a Rheodyne 7161 injector, and a Dynamax UV-1 detector. Columns were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and peptides detected by UV absorbance at 254 nm. Sephadex G-50 (superfine) media were prepared using either 1 × 30 cm or 1 × 50 cm borosilicate Econo-columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and eluted at 0.17 ml/min using an LKB Microperpex S peristaltic pump. Peptides were detected by UV absorbance at 254 nm using a Pharmacia UV-1 single path monitor. Each experiment was performed at least two times. Pre-packed columns were washed with 50% (v/v) formic acid between experiments. Sephadex columns were prepared from fresh resin prior to each experiment.Table IChromatographic properties of Aβ-(1–40)ColumnSeparation range (kDa)Elution buffer1-aMPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBSE, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 50 μmEDTA.Aβ MrVoid peakCorrelation coefficient (r 2)Superdex 75 (1 × 30 cm)3 –70PBS10,000−0.98PBS, 20% sucrose10,500−0.98PBS, 20% MPD9,000−0.96PBS, 20% ethylene glycol8,000±0.98PBS, 50% ethylene glycol6,000±0.980.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.415,000+0.81Superdex 200 (1 × 30 cm)10 –6000.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.414,000+0.77Superose 12 (1 × 30 cm)1 –3000.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.415,000+0.79PBS12,000±0.92TSK G2000sw (0.7 × 30 cm)5 –1000.1% trifluoroacetic acid8,000−0.85PBS18,000±0.58G50sf (1 × 28 cm)1.5 –300.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.49,000−0.98G50sf (1 × 28 cm)TBS8,000−1.0G50sf (1 × 47 cm)TBSE7,500−0.98G50sf (1 × 47 cm)50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.45,000−0.98Aβ-(1–40) was chromatographed on five different size exclusion media, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each study, the appropriate column was equilibrated with at least three column volumes of elution buffer and then calibrated with five molecular weight standards: avian ovalbumin (44,000); equine myoglobin (17,000); equine cytochrome C (12,384); bovine aprotinin (6,500); and vitamin B12 (1,350).

A small void peak appeared after 24 h of incubation in some experiments. 400 μg of Aβ-(1–40) were dissolved in 200 μl of water and then vortexed briefly. 200 μl of 2 × buffer were then added, and the sample was vortexed again. Following centrifugation (17,000 × g, 3 min), 100 μl of the supernatant was chromatographed. For kinetic analyses, samples were incubated at room temperature for various periods prior to centrifugation. For quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and gel electrophoresis, Aβ-(1–40) was dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (0.46 mm), incubated at room temperature for 48 h, and then chromatographed as above. Similarly, Aβ-(1–40)-Gln22 and Aβ-(1–42) were dissolved at concentrations of 1 mg/ml (0.23 and 0.22 mm, respectively) and incubated at room temperature for 6 h, and then 300 μl of each were chromatographed as above. Peak fractions of 50–200-μl volume were collected and analyzed. Disaggregation experiments were performed by dissolving 800 μg of Aβ-(1–40) in 160 μl of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. The HFIP was removed by evaporation under a gentle stream of argon, leaving a slightly yellow film that was resuspended in 80 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and sonicated for 30 min. The solution was then filtered through an Anotop 10 Plus filter (20 nm, Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) and diluted 1:9 (v/v) with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide (Tris buffer). After centrifugation (17,000 × g, 3 min), 100 μl of supernatant were injected onto a Superdex 75 column. The remainder of the solution was incubated at room temperature and sampled at 1, 4, 8, and 24 h. To search for low abundance intermediates, radioiodinated Aβ-(1–40) (125I-Aβ, ∼2000 Ci/mmol) was prepared according to Maggio et al.(25Maggio J.E. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Allen C.J. Dahl C.E. Whitcomb D.C. Vigna S.R. Vinters H.V. Labenski M.E. Mantyh P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 100 pm in Tris buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Me2SO. After incubation at room temperature for 0, 8, or 24 h, samples were centrifuged (17,000 × g, 3 min), and 100-μl aliquots were injected onto a Superdex 75 column. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and their radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. To examine the effect of varying Aβ concentration, 3 μl of appropriately diluted Aβ-(1–40) were added to 597 μl of Tris buffer containing 100 pm125I-Aβ, to yield final Aβ concentrations of 1 × 10−10, 1 × 10−9, 1 × 10−7, 1 × 10−5, and 2.3 × 10−4m. Samples were then incubated and analyzed as above. A RIA procedure was used to detect trace levels of oligomeric fibril intermediates. Aβ-(1–40) was dissolved in HFIP, lyophilized, dissolved to a suitable concentration in Me2SO, and then diluted 1:200 (v/v) with 0.1 m Tris buffer. Final Aβ concentrations were 1 × 10−7, 1 × 10−6, 1 × 10−5, and 1 × 10−4m. Samples were then incubated and chromatographed as in the radiotracer experiments. Fractions were frozen at −20 °C until assayed. Aβ-(1–40) content in each fraction was determined by RIA (26Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Jennings J.M. Ghilardi J.R. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Fractions from SEC were collected directly into cuvettes and analyzed within 1 min of elution. QLS was carried out essentially as described (8Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Langley Ford model 1097 autocorrelator and Coherent argon ion lasers (model Innova 90 or Innova 90-plus) operated at 514 nm. 10 μl of sample were applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA) and incubated for 60 s. The droplet was then displaced with an equal volume of 0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution and incubated for an additional 60 s. The grid then was washed with four or five drops of water and wicked dry. Finally, the peptide was stained with 10 μl of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) for 2 min. This solution was wicked off, and the grid was air-dried. Samples were examined using a JEOL CX100 electron microscope. To examine insoluble material, pellets of Aβ were suspended in a small volume of buffer and prepared as above. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 16.5% Tricine gels as described by Schagger and Von Jagow (27Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each chromatographic fraction (20 μl) were mixed with 3 × SDS sample buffer (10 μl) and boiled for 5 min immediately prior to electrophoresis. Gels were silver-stained using the Bio-Rad silver stain kit and photographed. To monitor oligomerization of Aβ, an analytical method is necessary that can resolve monomeric Aβ and its oligomers under nondenaturing, nondisaggregating conditions. We reasoned that SEC would be appropriate for this purpose. Initial analysis of presumably monomeric Aβ revealed a single peak with a molecular weight of 10,000 (Table I). This unexpectedly high molecular weight suggested that Aβ might not be monomeric or was partially excluded from the column matrix, indicating a nonideal analyte-matrix interaction. Because accurate molecular weight determination was critical for the proper interpretation of our experiments, we determined whether the chromatographic behavior of Aβ varied depending on column matrix or elution conditions (Table I). When Aβ-(1–40) from the same peptide lot was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and chromatographed on Superdex 75 (dextran-agarose), Superose 12 (agarose), or TSK (silica) matrices, the relative molecular weight of Aβ varied from 10,000 to 18,000. Similarly, when Aβ-(1–40) was dissolved in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then analyzed, molecular weights of 9,000–15,000 were observed. Other solvent conditions resulted inMr values ranging from 5,000 to 10,500. One explanation for the variations in Mr was nonideal chromatographic behavior of Aβ. This was confirmed in experiments in which the elution buffer was modified by the addition of ethylene glycol, an agent used to inhibit solute-column interactions. Under these conditions, a concentration-dependent decrease in Aβ Mr from 10,000 to 6,000 was seen. We also found that Mr values varied depending on the calibration standards used. Thus, for consistency, all columns were calibrated using the same five standards. In each experiment, Aβ-(1–40) chromatographed as a single peak in the included volume of the column, but because of its nonideal behavior, the oligomerization state of Aβ within these peaks was unclear. If noncovalent multimers composed these peaks, then treating Aβ with strong denaturants or solvents prior to chromatography might disaggregate these complexes and reduce the Mr. In fact, pretreatment of Aβ with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, Me2SO, HFIP, or 90% formic acid, had no effect on itsMr. In addition, Aβ-(40–1), the “reverse” peptide of Aβ-(1–40) and one that does not polymerize readily, co-eluted with Aβ-(1–40) on the Superdex 75/Tris-HCl system (data not shown). A time-dependent decrease in the magnitude of the gel-included peak was observed under all conditions examined (data not shown). In the Superdex 75/Tris-HCl system, this decrease was accompanied by the appearance of a new peak in the void volume of the column (Fig. 1). For linear polymers such as dextran, this would be consistent with a molecular weight in excess of 30,000. To better estimate the size of the aggregates in this peak, chromatography was also performed on Superdex 200 and Superose 12 columns, which have exclusion limits (for dextrans) of ∼100 kDa. A peak was observed in the void volume of these columns as well, suggesting that the Aβ multimers had molecular masses in excess of 100 kDa, or that they too behaved anomalously on SEC. Experiments using Aβ-(1–42) yielded essentially identical results (data not shown). To estimate the actual sizes of Aβ particles in the peaks obtained by SEC, QLS was used to measure the average diffusion coefficient of the particles. Particle size is expressed as the radius of a sphere with an identical diffusion coefficient. This quantity is termed the hydrodynamic radius (RH) (for a review, see Ref. 28Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering: Applications of Photon Correlation Spectroscopy.in: Pecora R. Plenum Press, New York, NY1985Crossref Google Scholar) and is conceptually equivalent to a Stoke's radius in gel permeation chromatography. For spherical particles, RH = r, wherer is the geometric radius. For a fibril,RH depends on the length, diameter, and flexibility of the particle. RH is always less than the radius of the sphere circumscribed around the particle. Immediately after dissolution in Tris-HCl and centrifugation (17,000 × g, 3 min), but prior to SEC, soluble Aβ-(1–40) had an average RH of ∼40–200 nm (Fig. 2 A). Because scattering intensity is proportional to molecular weight, monomers and small oligomers can be difficult to detect in the presence of larger polymers and aggregates. However, by fractionating the Aβ mixture using SEC, we observed a gel-included fraction, with an extrapolated molecular weight of 15,000, which had an average RH of 1.8 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 2 B). Geometric considerations predict that a 4,331-Da peptide in dimeric form will have aRH = 1.5–2.1 nm. For comparison, QLS analysis of aprotinin (6,500 Da) fractionated by SEC yielded an averageRH of 1.6 ± 0.6 nm (Fig. 2 C). These data argue that Aβ existed as a dimer 2For simplicity, Aβ within the gel-included peak will be referred to as “dimeric.” However, the QLS data alone do not eliminate the possibility that Aβ within this peak is monomeric. in the gel-included fraction, not as a trimer or tetramer as suggested by SEC. We next sought to determine the size(s) of the Aβ oligomers in the gel-excluded fraction. To produce sufficient material for analysis, Aβ-(1–40) was incubated for 48 h prior to chromatography. QLS analysis of the pre-SEC supernatant (17,000 × g) revealed a broad distribution of particles sizes (range 4 to >100 nm) (Fig. 2 E). Comparison of this distribution with that obtained from Aβ immediately after dissolution (Fig. 2 A) shows that particles of intermediate size form during fibrillogenesis. Dimers were not resolved clearly in this experiment due to the predominance of larger Aβ oligomers/polymers, as discussed above. QLS analysis of the gel-excluded peak showed that the majority of intermediate particles ranged in size from ∼10 to 50 nm (Fig. 2 F). For a solution of noninteracting rods with diameters of 8 nm, this range corresponds to lengths of 30–500 nm. These lengths would be significantly smaller if rod-rod interactions were occurring. On the other hand, if the rods were flexible, the lengths would be even larger. Taken together, our SEC and QLS data indicate that the gel-included peak contained dimeric Aβ, the gel-excluded peak contained a distribution of oligomers, and the pellet obtained prior to chromatography was composed of higher molecular weight polymers and aggregates. To determine the morphology of the Aβ species observed in the SEC experiments, electron microscopy was performed. For both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42), no structures were detected in the gel-included fractions, while the 17,000 ×g pellets obtained prior to chromatography contained a mesh of fibers 6–10 nm in diameter (Fig. 3,A and B). These fibers were indistinguishable from those found in senile plaques (29Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition, particularly in the case of Aβ-(1–42), short fibrils were seen associated with the longer fibers. Generally, one end of each fibril appeared to adhere to the side of a fiber, while the other end was free. Similar fibrils were found in the void volume peaks, where they appeared as short, curly fibrils 6–10 nm in diameter and 5–160 nm in length, on average (Fig. 3, C and D). We have termed these structures “protofibrils” to distinguish them from the mature, amyloid-type fibers found in the pellets. Low molecular weight oligomers (larger than dimers) were not detected in the prior SEC experiments. Oligomerization could be thermodynamically unfavorable or be suppressed kinetically due to rapid consumption of precursor by growing fibrils. Fibril formation would be accelerated by the presence of pre-existing aggregates (seeds) in the starting material. Freshly prepared solutions of Aβ-(1–40) did, in fact, contain high molecular weight species that might act as seeds (Fig. 2 A). To determine if rapid fibril formation affected Aβ oligomerization, we sought to eliminate seeds prior to our experiments by dissolving Aβ in HFIP, lyophilizing the solution, dissolving the lyophilizate in Me2SO, and then filtering the solution through a filter containing 20-nm pores. The chromatographic behavior of peptides “deseeded” in this way did not differ from that of peptides prepared without deseeding (data not shown). An included peak was observed initially, which was replaced over time by a peak in the void volume of the column. These data suggest that formation of stable low molecular weight oligomers is a relatively unfavored process. Our results suggested that, if present, steady state levels of oligomeric fibril precursors would be extremely low, making their detection by UV absorbance difficult. For this reason, two sensitive methods were utilized to monitor Aβ polymerization: 1) radioiodinated peptide was used as a tracer in mixtures with unlabeled peptide; and 2) SEC fractions were assayed for Aβ content by RIA. Radioiodinated Aβ-(1–40) (125I-Aβ-(1–40); 100 pm final concentration) was mixed with unlabeled Aβ (1 mg/ml) in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, chromatographed on a Superdex 75 column, and detected in column fractions by scintillation counting. At 0 h, a single peak was observed coincident with unlabeled Aβ (Fig. 4). After incubation at room temperature for 8 or 24 h, an additional peak of radioactivity was detected in the void volume (Fig. 4; at ∼7.4 ml). The radioactivity and UV absorbance of this peak increased at the same rate over time, suggesting that the labeled and unlabeled peptides polymerized in an analogous manner. In the above experiment, given that ∼33,000 cpm of Aβ were used, oligomers representing as little as 1% of the initial protein mass could have been detected. Asymmetry in the void and dimer peaks, indicated by trailing and leading shoulders, respectively, mirrored the behavior of the unlabeled peptide (cf. Figs. 1 and 4). RIA analysis of Aβ-(1–40) SEC fractions produced using the same protocol as above yielded results similar to those presented in Fig. 4 (data not shown). Experiments were also performed at much lower Aβ concentrations by using tracer alone; however, below 10−5"
https://openalex.org/W1849928642,"According to the state of mitochondrial respiration, the respiratory chain generates superoxide anions converted into hydrogen peroxide. Two uncoupling proteins (UCP) able to modulate the coupling between the respiratory chain and ATP synthesis are now identified and could be involved in mitochondrial H2O2 generation. UCP1 is specific to brown adipose tissue (BAT) whereas UCP2 is expressed in numerous tissues, particularly in monocytes/macrophages. Preincubation of BAT mitochondrial fractions with GDP, an inhibitor of UCP1, induced a rise in mitochondrial membrane potential (assessed by rhodamine 123 uptake) and H2O2 production. An uncoupling agent reversed this effect. Liver mitochondria exhibited a similar phenotype. GDP was also able to raise membrane potential and H2O2 production of the mitochondria from nonparenchymal cells expressing UCP2, but was completely ineffective on mitochondria from hepatocytes deprived of UCP2. The GDP effect was also observed with mitochondrial fractions of the spleen or thymus, which highly expressed UCP2. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that UCP2 is sensitive to GDP and that the UCPs, particularly UCP2, are able to modulate H2O2 mitochondrial generation. This supports a role for UCP2 in cellular (patho-) physiological processes involving free radicals generated by mitochondria, such as oxidative damage, inflammation, or apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2147402069,"Newly assembled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, together with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calreticulin, interact with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) through a molecule called tapasin. The molecular cloning of tapasin revealed it to be a transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by an MHC-linked gene. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with a probable cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Up to four MHC class I–tapasin complexes were found to bind to each TAP molecule. Expression of tapasin in a negative mutant human cell line (220) restored class I–TAP association and normal class I cell surface expression. Tapasin expression also corrected the defective recognition of virus-infected 220 cells by class I–restricted cytotoxic T cells, establishing a critical functional role for tapasin in MHC class I–restricted antigen processing."
https://openalex.org/W2127160263,"In the present study, we showed that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human central cannabinoid receptor (CB1) exhibit high constitutive activity at both levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and adenylyl cyclase. These activities could be blocked by the CB1-selective ligand, SR 141716A, that functions as an inverse agonist. Moreover, binding studies showed that guanine nucleotides decreased the binding of the agonist CP-55,940, an effect usually observed with agonists, whereas it enhanced the binding of SR 141716A, a property of inverse agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that CB1-mediated effects of SR 141716A included inhibition of MAPK activation by pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor-tyrosine kinase such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors but not by pertussis toxin-insensitive receptor-tyrosine kinase such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor. We also observed similar results when cells were stimulated with Mas-7, a mastoparan analog, that directly activates the Gi protein. Furthermore, SR 141716A inhibited guanosine 5′-0-(thiotriphosphate) uptake induced by CP-55,940 or Mas-7 in CHO-CB1 cell membranes. This indicates that, in addition to the inhibition of autoactivated CB1, SR 141716A can deliver a biological signal that blocks the Gi protein and consequently abrogates most of the Gi-mediated responses. By contrast, SR 141716A had no effect on MAPK activation by insulin or IGF1 in CHO cells lacking CB1 receptors, ruling out the possibility of a direct interaction of SR 141716A with the Gi protein. This supports the notion that the Gi protein may act as a negative intracellular signaling cross-talk molecule. From these original results, which considerably enlarge the biological properties of the inverse agonist, we propose a novel model for receptor/ligand interactions.

It is now known that Δ9-THC, and other potent synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists as well as anandamide, the putative endogenous ligand (1Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G.

The central cannabinoid receptor (CB1) was cloned from both rat and human (2Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I.

Although to a lower extent, CB1 mRNA has also been found in testis (3Gérard C.M. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), spleen (6Kaminski N.E. Abood M.E. Kessler F.K. Martin B.R. Schatz A.R. Mol.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A second cannabinoid receptor (CB2) has been cloned and recently characterized. CB2 is expressed in macrophages from the marginal zone of spleen, in B lymphocytes, and NK cells but not in brain tissues (8Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M.

Biochem. 1995; 232: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Both CB1 and CB2 receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. CB1 has been associated with several biological responses including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and modulation of ion channels (10Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar,11Mackie K. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3825-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that treatment by cannabinoid agonist of CHO cells expressing CB1 or U373 MG cells induced activation of both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and immediate-early geneKrox 24, also known as NGFI-A, zif/268, egr-1,and TIS 8 (12Bouaboula M.

These cannabinoid effects were mediated by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi protein) and prevented by the potent CB1-selective antagonist SR 141716A (12Bouaboula M.

Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 19Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol.

Nature. 1995; 374: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The first to be characterized were the β-carbolines acting toward the ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (22Braestrup C. Schmiechen R. Neef G. Nielsen M. Petersen E.N. Science. 1982; 216: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These molecules contrast with classical antagonists in that they exhibit a biological activity by blocking the signal transduction mediated by constitutively activated receptors. Most of the other inverse agonist molecules identified so far are ligands for receptors of the GPCR superfamily (23Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored in detail the pharmacological and biological properties of the CB1-selective antagonist SR 141716A, using CHO cells transfected with human CB1. We here demonstrated that SR 141716A functions not only as an antagonist of cannabinoid-mediated effects but also as an inverse agonist. We next provided evidence for a coupling between CB1 and receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK) transduction pathways, involving a PTX-sensitive Gi protein. These results suggest that biological functions of inverse agonists have been underestimated and enable us to conceive a new ligand/receptor interaction model. [3H]CP-55,940, [3H]SR 141716A, and [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN (Paris, France). [γ32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. (Les Ullis, France). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, bovine myelin basic protein (MBP), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), WIN 55212-2, and pertussis toxin (PTX) were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). Wortmannin was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). SR 141716A (N-(piperidino-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) and CP-55,940 were synthesized at the Chemistry Department of Sanofi (Montpellier, France). Anti-p44 (C-16, anti-ERK-1) and anti-p42 (C-14, anti-ERK-2) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mastoparan analog (Mas-7) was from Calbiochem (Meudon, France). G418 was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France); Ro 20–1724 was from Research Biochemicals International (Illkirch, France). GDP and GTPγS were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France). A synthetic oligonucleotide containing six cAMP-response elements (CREs) was obtained as described (24Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Google Scholar). This CRE cassette was placed upstream from the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (tk) promoter and cloned into the pSE1 plasmid (25Minty A. Chalon P. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Liauzun P. Magazin M. Miloux B. Minty C. Ramond P. Vita N. Lupker J. Shire D. Ferrara P. Caput D. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1993; 4: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar) in place of the SV40 early enhancer-promoter. The interleukin-2 coding sequence was then replaced with luciferase, and the resulting CRE-luciferase reporter construct was called p661. For stable expression of the CRE-luciferase gene, the CHO dihydrofolate reductase negative cell line was co-transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) with the p661 plasmid mixed with a tk-neo plasmid. Selection was achieved by culturing cells for 12 days in α-essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 300 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were tested for an inducible expression of luciferase following stimulation with 1 μm forskolin as described below. The selected clones were subcloned by limiting dilution, and the clone Z661.11.9, exhibiting an induction rate of 80–100-fold upon stimulation with forskolin, was chosen for further studies. For stable expression of CB1, Z661.11.9 cells were transfected as indicated above with plasmid p1211 coding for human CB1 and selected for dihydrofolate reductase expression as described previously (12Bouaboula M. Poinot-Chazel C. Bourrié B. Canat X. Calandra B. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The CHO-CRE-CB1 cell line that exhibited the highest response to Δ9-THC was chosen for further analyses. CHO wild-type (CHO-WT) cells were routinely grown as monolayers at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in α-essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 60 μg/ml tylocine, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. CHO cells stably transformed with CB1 (CHO-CB1) or CB1 plus CRE luciferase (CHO-CRE-CB1) were grown in MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS, 40 μg/ml l-proline, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 60 μg/ml tylocine, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were washed and incubated for 30 min in serum-free medium containing Ro-20–1724 (0.1 mm) and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mm). Cells were either pretreated or not with cannabinoid receptor ligands for 5 min before a 20-min stimulation with forskolin (3 μm). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA. The determination of cAMP levels was performed by a radioimmunoassay (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each value is the mean of triplicate determinations ± S.E. Cells were seeded at 104cells/well in white 96-well microplates for luminescence, in MEM medium supplemented with 5% FCS. Twenty-four hours later, cells were pretreated for 5 min with various concentrations of cannabinoid receptor ligands before stimulation with 1 μm forskolin. Four hours after cell stimulation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of cell culture lysis buffer from the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Charbonnières, France). Measurement of light emission was determined after the addition of reconstituted luciferase assay reagent following the supplier's instructions. Luminescence was detected by a CCD camera (MTP Reader, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The quantitation of light emission was made by accumulation of photon counting, and mean values from triplicate determinations were expressed as percentage of values from forskolin-stimulated cells. Cells grown to confluence were collected by scraping and spun at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Crude membranes were prepared by homogenization of cells in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and stored at −80 °C until use. To determine the effect of GTPγS on displacement of [3H]CP-55,940 or [3H]SR 141716A, membranes (50 μg of protein) were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7) with 0.25 nm [3H]CP-55,940 or 0.8 nm[3H]SR 141716A and increasing concentrations of unlabeled SR 141716A or CP-55,940, respectively, in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS. Effects of GTPγS were also studied by incubating membranes at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.25 nm[3H]CP-55,940 or 0.8 nm [3H]SR 141716A and increasing concentrations of GTPγS. A rapid filtration technique using Whatman GF/B filters (pretreated with 0.5% (w/v) polyethyleneimine) and a 48-well filtration apparatus (Brandel) was used to harvest and rinse labeled membranes with cold buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Filter-bound radioactivity was counted with 4 ml of biofluor liquid scintillator. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm CP-55,940. The [35S]GTPγS binding was measured as described by Selleyet al. (27Selley D.E. Stark S. Sim L.J. Childers S.R. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes from CHO-CB1 cells (30 μg of protein) were incubated with various drugs for 60 min at 30 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 0.1 nm[35S]GTPγS and 50 μm GDP, in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was carried out in 96-well microtitration plates (Multiscreen FB Glass Fiber, Millipore). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μmunlabeled GTPγS. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration, washing 5 times with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and bound radioactivity was determined. MAPK activity was measured as described previously (12Bouaboula M. Poinot-Chazel C. Bourrié B. Canat X. Calandra B. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown to 80% confluence in 6-well plates were placed in medium containing 0.5% FCS for 24 h before assay. After treatment, cells were washed twice in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmglycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4) and lysed for 15 min in buffer A containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Solubilized cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min, and supernatants (100 μg of proteins) were incubated for 3 h with the agarose-coupled anti-p44 and anti-p42 antibodies. The protein contents in the supernatants were determined using micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Immune complexes were assayed for phosphorylation of MBP as a substrate. Reaction was initiated by the addition of buffer containing 150 μg/ml MBP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C (linear assay condition) and was stopped by spotting on Whatman P-81 filter papers which were then dropped into 0.1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. Papers were washed in this solution, rinsed with ethanol, and air-dried, and radioactivity incorporated in MBP was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs was determined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described (12Bouaboula M. Poinot-Chazel C. Bourrié B. Canat X. Calandra B.

Briefly, quiescent cells were incubated in 6-well plates for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of various compounds. Cells were further washed once in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate and then directly lysed in Laemmli's loading buffer containing 6m urea. Proteins were heated for 10 min at 95 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE on 11% acrylamide gel. Following gel transfer onto nitrocellulose filters in 25 mm Tris, 0.19m glycine, 20% methanol, membranes were blotted in TN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl) supplemented with 10% dried milk powder. Blots were then incubated with anti-p42 and anti-p44 antibodies (0.25 μg/ml) in blotting TN solution containing 2% dried milk powder for 3 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in TN buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) was added for 45 min at room temperature. After 5 washes, immunostained MAPKs were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Corp.) and subjected to autoradiography. Quiescent cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of various compounds and lysed in the Laemmli's buffer, and proteins were analyzed for MAPK activity using an in-gel kinase assay as already described (28Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2 mg/ml MBP. The gel was incubated once in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 20% methanol for 20 min, once in buffer A for 30 min, twice in buffer A containing 6 m guanidine-HCl for 30 min, twice in buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 16 h, and once in buffer A containing 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 50 μCi of [γ32P]ATP for 2 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by intensive washing of the gel in 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The biological properties of the CB1 selective antagonist SR 141716A were studied in CHO cells stably expressing the human CB1 (CHO-CB1 cells) in which we measured MAPK activity. MAPK activity was assayed toward MBP as substrate, after specific immunoprecipitation of p42 and p44 MAPK isoforms. We showed that stimulation of CB1 by the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP-55,940 resulted in a strong activation of MAPKs which is in agreement with our previously described results (12Bouaboula M. Poinot-Chazel C. Bourrié B. Canat X. Calandra B. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This effect was not observed in parental cells (CHO-WT) (Fig. 1 A) and was completely prevented in CHO-CB1 cells by treatment with SR 141716A (data not shown). Interestingly, a comparison of CHO-CB1 and CHO-WT cells showed an enhanced basal MAPK activity in CHO-CB1 cells (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, this basal activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by SR 141716A with an IC50 of 5 nm (Fig. 1 B). A concentration of 30 nm SR 141716A reduced the basal level of MAPKs in CHO-CB1 cells to that observed in CHO-WT cells, whereas SR 141716A treatment had no effect on CHO-WT cells. Pretreatment of CHO-CB1 cells by PTX induced an inhibition of MAPK basal level, whereas it had no significant effect in CHO-WT cells. When CHO-CB1 cells were co-treated with PTX and SR 141716A, no additive inhibitory effects were observed (data not shown). This suggested that the enhanced MAPK activation was related to a CB1-coupled PTX-sensitive Giprotein. Activation of MAPKs has been described to lead to the appearance of slower migrating forms in SDS-PAGE, resulting from the phosphorylation on specific threonine and tyrosine residues of p42 and p44 MAPK isoforms (29Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In CHO-CB1 cells, the presence of phosphorylated proteins, which was markedly enhanced by treatment with CP-55,940, was clearly apparent in the untreated cells (Fig. 2 A). Treatment with SR 141716A abolished the CP-55,940-induced forms and also the constitutively activated forms. Similar results were obtained in an in-gel kinase assay performed with proteins extracted from CHO-CB1 cells and run in SDS-PAGE. Intact MBP protein, trapped in the polyacrylamide gel, was efficiently phosphorylated by p42/44 MAPKs from unstimulated cells or cells treated with CP-55,940 (Fig. 2 B). Again, the intensity of MAPKs was decreased by treatment with SR 141716A in cells stimulated with CP-55,940 as well as in unstimulated cells. In a control experiment, we did not observe any modulation of p42/p44 MAPKs by SR 141716A in either Western blot or in-gel kinase assays on CHO-WT cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the enhanced basal MAPK activity in CHO cells expressing CB1 is related to the autoactivation of CB1 receptors and that it is specifically decreased by SR 141716A which thereby acts as an inverse agonist.Figure 2Effect of SR 141716A on basal MAPK activity in CHO-CB1 cells.

Previous studies have established that cannabinoids alter cAMP production through the GTP-binding protein Gi (10Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar, 30Howlett A.C. Fleming R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of intracellular cAMP levels leads to the activation of protein kinase A. The catalytic subunit of the activated protein kinase A is translocated to the nucleus where it phosphorylates the cAMP response element binding protein which thereafter binds to cAMP response elements (CREs), leading to an increase in gene transcription (31Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To monitor cAMP metabolism, we generated a cAMP-responsive reporter construct by linking CRE sequences to the luciferase gene, and we stably transfected this chimeric gene in CHO-WT cells (CHO-CRE). As expected, forskolin, by elevating intracellular cAMP, strongly stimulated luciferase gene expression. The CHO-CRE cell line was used as recipient to stably transfect human CB1, and transformants were denoted as CHO-CRE-CB1 cells. We further analyzed the effects of cannabinoid receptor ligands on forskolin-induced CRE-luciferase response in CHO-CRE-CB1 cells. CP-55,940, WIN 55212-2, and Δ9-THC decreased forskolin-induced luminescence in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 0.16 ± 0.023, 17.95 ± 3.15, and 2.25 ± 0.024 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The higher potency of CP-55,940 compared with that of the agonists Δ9-THC or WIN 55212-2 to inhibit AC is consistent with their respective ability to displace [3H]CP-55,940 binding (17Rinaldi-Carmona M. Pialot F. Congy C. Redon E. Barth F. Bachy A. Brelière J.-C. Soubrié P. Le Fur G. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SR 141716A not only reversed the inhibition induced by 10 nmCP-55,940 in a dose-dependent manner but dramatically enhanced forskolin-induced CRE-luciferase gene expression by 5-fold above the control level. On its own, SR 141716A produced similar effects at a 20-fold lower concentration (Fig. 3 B). No stimulation of luciferase by SR 141716A was observed in the absence of forskolin, excluding a direct stimulation of GTP-binding protein Gs by SR 141716A (data not shown). The effects of SR 141716A per se on CRE-luciferase are consistent with the blockage of AC inhibition mediated by autoactivated CB1 receptors. As an additional control, we observed that when experiments were carried out with CHO cells transfected with CRE-luciferase but lacking CB1 (CHO-CRE cells), neither CP-55,940 nor SR 141716A affected the level of luciferase induced by forskolin (data not shown). These results were confirmed by direct measurement of cAMP levels (Table I), which showed that SR 141716A treatment induced a marked increase in forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner in CHO-CB1 cells. Under the same conditions, CP-55,940 inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO-CB1 cells.Table IEffect of SR"
https://openalex.org/W2123687793,"Butyrate is a well known colonic luminal short chain fatty acid, which arrests cell growth and induces differentiation in various cell types. We examined the effect of butyrate on the expression of WAF1/Cip1, a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, and its relation to growth arrest in a p53-mutated human colon cancer cell line WiDr. Five millimolar butyrate completely inhibited the growth of WiDr and caused G1-phase arrest. WAF1/Cip1 mRNA was rapidly induced within 3 h by treatment with 5.0 mM butyrate, and drastic WAF1/Cip1 protein induction was detected. Using several mutant WAF1/Cip1 promoter fragments, we found that the butyrate-responsive elements are two Sp1 sites at -82 and -69 relative to the transcription start site. We also found that a TATA element at -46 and two overlapping consensus Sp1 sites at -60 and -55 are essential for the basal promoter activity of WAF1/Cip1. These findings suggest that butyrate arrests the growth of WiDr by activating the WAF1/Cip1 promoter through specific Sp1 sites in a p53-independent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2078030859,"The SGS1 gene of yeast encodes a DNA helicase with homology to the human WRN gene. Mutations in WRN result in Werner's syndrome, a disease with symptoms resembling premature aging. Mutation of SGS1 is shown to cause premature aging in yeast mother cells on the basis of a shortened life-span and the aging-induced phenotypes of sterility and redistribution of the Sir3 silencing protein from telomeres to the nucleolus. Further, in old sgs1 cells the nucleolus is enlarged and fragmented-changes that also occur in old wild-type cells. These findings suggest a conserved mechanism of cellular aging that may be related to nucleolar structure."
https://openalex.org/W1988950487,"Abstract Promoter region CpG island methylation is associated with tumor suppressor gene silencing in neoplasia. GenBank sequence analyses revealed that a number of CpG islands are juxtaposed to multiple Alu repeats, which have been proposed as “de novo methylation centers.” These islands also contain multiple Sp1 elements located upstream and downstream of transcription start, which have been shown to protect CpG islands from methylation. We mapped the methylation patterns of the E-cadherin(E-cad) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene CpG island regions in normal and neoplastic cells. Although unmethylated in normal tissue, these islands were embedded between densely methylated flanking regions containing multiple Alu repeats. These methylated flanks were segregated from the unmethylated, island CpG sites by Sp1-rich boundary regions. Finally, in human fibroblasts overexpressing DNA methyltransferase, de novomethylation of the E-cad CpG island initially involved sequences at both ends of the island and the adjacent, flanking regions and progressed with time to encompass the entire CpG island region. Together, these data suggest that boundaries exist at both ends of a CpG island to maintain the unmethylated state in normal tissue and that these boundaries may be progressively overridden, eliciting thede novo methylation associated with tumor suppressor gene silencing in neoplasia."

In the present study, we investigated downstream effector molecules of Ras and Rac proteins upon Fas receptor stimulation. Activation of Jurkat cells via the Fas receptor or with synthetic ceramides resulted in a Ras- and Rac1-dependent stimulation of JNK and p38-K. The functional significance of the Fas- and ceramide-initiated signaling pathway from Ras via Rac to JNK/p38-K is indicated by an almost complete inhibition of Fas- or C6-ceramide-mediated programmed cell death after transfection of the cells with transdominant inhibitory Ras, Rac1, or an inhibitory Jun construct (Tam67) and simultaneous treatment with a specific pharmacological blocker (SB 203580) of p38-K suggesting an important function of the described signaling pathway in the regulation of Fas-mediated programmed cell death. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany, if not otherwise cited. Human leukemic Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol (all from Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany.) For activation, cells were washed twice in Hepes-buffered saline (H/S: 132 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4) and incubated at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml monoclonal anti-human Fas antibody (clone CH-11, Dianova-Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany) or 5 μm C6-ceramide (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) for the indicated times. Co-transfection of Jurkat cells with transdominant inhibitory pEF-N17ras, pCEV-N17rac1, pRc/CMV-tam67 (each 50 μg/20 × 106 cells) or vector control (pEF, pCEV) with an expression vector for CD20 (pRc/CMV-cd20) (10 μg) was performed as described previously (9Gulbins E. Bissonette R. Mahboubi A. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). N17Ras, N17Rac, or Tam67 have been shown previously to inhibit the function of Ras, Rac, or JNK, respectively (17Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar, 49Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Schlottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were electroporated using a BTX electroporator at 5 pulses (99 μs) and 500 V. 12 h later, viable cells were purified by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and cultured for an additional 24 h. CD20+ cells were then selected by incubation with 50 μg/ml anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) (60 min, 4 °C), three washes, and further incubation (60 min, 4 °C) with magnetic beads coated with a sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) (25Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Since the ratio of 5:1 for pEF-N17ras, pCEV-N17rac1, or pRc/CMV-tam67:pRc/CMV-cd20 drives expression of N17Ras, N17Rac1, or Tam67 in any CD20+ cell, the selection of CD20+ cells permits effective sorting for N17Ras- or N17Rac1-expressing cells. The fraction of CD20-positive and thus N17Ras-transfected cells was determined by in vivo labeling of the cells with [3H]thymidine as described previously (9Gulbins E. Bissonette R. Mahboubi A. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the labeled cells were counted prior and after sorting via magnetic beads. These experiments showed that approximately 10% of all cells were CD20-positive. Nonspecific binding of the cells to the magnetic beads did not exceed 0.5% of all cells, as determined by incubation of cells with an irrelevant monoclonal mouse antibody (50 μg) and magnetic beads. Purified cells were allowed to recover for 30 min at 37 °C and then used for determination of JNK, p38-K, Rac1, or Ras activity and apoptosis. Inhibition of p38-K was achieved by preincubation with the specific kinase inhibitor SB 203580 (10 μm, kindly provided by Dr. B. MacKintosh, University of Dundee). Untransfected Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells co-transfected with N17Ras, N17Rac1, pCEV, or pEF and CD20 were washed twice in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, resuspended in the same medium complemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and labeled for 4 h with 1 mCi/ml32Pi. Cells were stimulated with anti-Fas (2 μg/ml) or C6-ceramide (5 μm) for the indicated time or left untreated. Stimulation was terminated by lysis in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm MgCl2, 450 mm NaCl, and 100 μg each of aprotinin and leupeptin (lysis buffer). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g) at 4 °C for 15 min. Ras or Rac1 were immunoprecipitated from the lysates at 4 °C for 45 min using the monoclonal anti-Ras antibody Y13–259 or a polyclonal, affinity-purified anti-Rac1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The anti-Rac1 antibody detects amino acids 179–188 of the C-terminal protein domain and does not cross-react with Rac2, Ras, or other known small G-proteins. It has been shown previously to immunoprecipitate active Rac1 proteins (49Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Schlottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26389-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were collected by further incubation with protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz). Precipitates were washed seven times in lysis buffer and once in 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2, and 125 mm NaCl; bound nucleotides were eluted in 1 mm EDTA at 68 °C for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the nucleotides in the supernatant were separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Machery & Nagel, Dueren, Germany) with 0.75 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.5). The TLC plates were analyzed by autoradiography, the spots corresponding to GDP and GTP were scraped from the plate, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Activation of Ras or Rac1 is expressed by an increase of the GTP/(GDP + GTP) ratio. Cell stimulation was terminated by lysis in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm each NaF, Na3VO4, and sodium pyrophosphate and 10 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin (RIPA buffer), the lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × gfor 20 min, and JNK or p38-K were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants overnight at 4 °C using 3 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK or anti-p38-K antiserum (Santa Cruz). All control immunoprecipitates were performed with polyclonal rabbit immunoglobulins. After addition of protein A/G-agarose, incubation was continued for at least 60 min. Immunocomplexes were washed six times in lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer (60 mmTris (pH 6.8), 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Separation of proteins was performed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by an electrophoretic transfer to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Blots were blocked and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-JNK or anti-phospho-p38-K antibodies (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany). Each antibody was diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoblots were developed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad) and a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham). All blots were stripped by a 45-min incubation in 20 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 70 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 70 °C after primary analysis and reprobed to test for equal amounts of immunoprecipitated protein. Alternatively, an aliquot of the immunoprecipitates was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for equal amounts of protein in all immunoprecipitates. To measure the activity of JNK and p38-K, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer as above after stimulation via Fas or with C6-ceramide. Lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min, and JNK or p38-K were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants at 4 °C for 4 h using polyclonal rabbit anti-human JNK or p38-K antisera. Immunocomplexes were immobilized on agarose-coupled protein A/G; incubated for an additional 60 min at 4 °C; washed twice in RIPA buffer; twice in H/S, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4; once in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl; and finally twice in kinase buffer 12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4. After washing, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 10 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), 10 μm ATP, and 1 μg/ml GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) or GST-ATF-2 (amino acids 1–96). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped by addition of 5 μl of boiling 5 × reducing SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and laser densitometry. The substrates GST-c-Jun and GST-ATF-2 were expressed in DH5α bacteria after transformation, growth for 12 h, and incubation with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (200 μm) for 4 h. Bacteria were lysed in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin; GST fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose and eluted in kinase buffer with 20 mm glutathione. Purity of the preparations was tested by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. To determine the serine/threonine phosphorylation of GADD153, Jurkat cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi for 4 h, stimulated with anti-Fas or C6-ceramide, and lysed in RIPA buffer as above. GADD153 was immunoprecipitated from the post-centrifugation supernatant using a polyclonal rabbit anti-GADD153 antibody (Santa Cruz) as above, the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon membrane, and phosphorylation of GADD153 was analyzed by autoradiography. After analysis, the blots were reprobed with anti-GADD153 antibodies to test for equal amounts of protein in all lanes. In addition, GADD153 was immunoprecipitated from unlabeled, stimulated, or unstimulated cells and the immunoprecipitates were separated and blotted as above. The blots were blocked and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine antibodies (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G and a chemiluminescence kit. The blots were stripped after primary analysis and reprobed to test for equal amounts of immunoprecipitated GADD153. Phosphorylation of GADD153 after cellular stimulation with anti-Fas or C6-ceramide was further analyzed by incubation of recombinant GADD153 (0.1 μg/sample, Santa Cruz) with cell lysates from stimulated or unstimulated samples. Cells were lysed in 12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 1% Triton, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, centrifuged, and recombinant GADD153 and 10 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP were added to the supernatants. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of boiling SDS sample buffer and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography and laser densitometry. Fas-induced cell death was determined by metabolic labeling of Jurkat cells for 12 h with 10 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (8.3 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) (9Gulbins E. Bissonette R. Mahboubi A. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Cells were washed, aliquoted, and incubated with anti-Fas (200 ng/ml) or left untreated. Cell death was determined after 3 h by DNA fragmentation and trypan blue staining. Briefly, cells were disrupted by one cycle of freezing at −20 °C and thawing, after which unfragmented genomic DNA was collected by filtration through glass fiber filters (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and counted by liquid scintillation (9Gulbins E. Bissonette R. Mahboubi A. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as % DNA fragmentation ± S.D. compared with control samples. Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated three times. In all experiments an aliquot of the cells was analyzed for cell death by trypan blue. Apoptosis was identified by the typical morphological changes, in particular membrane blebbing, condensation, and fragmentation of nuclei. Comparison of the DNA fragmentation method and the morphologic changes permits exact determination of apoptosis versusnecrosis. In all experiments initial rates of apoptosis did not exceed 5% of all cells. We recently demonstrated an activation of the Ras signaling pathway upon Fas receptor triggering or cellular treatment with ceramides (9Gulbins E. Bissonette R. Mahboubi A. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To identify downstream targets of this signaling pathway initiated by Fas or ceramide, we tested the activation of JNK/p38-K. Fas receptor triggering resulted in an approximately 15-fold stimulation of JNK- and p38-K -activity (Fig. 1, A and B). The stimulation of JNK or p38-K after Fas was comparable to the activation of the kinases up"
https://openalex.org/W2021825316,"Activation domains are functional modules that enable sequence-specific DNA binding proteins to stimulate transcription. The structural basis for the function of activation domains is poorly understood. A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and biochemical experiments revealed that the minimal acidic activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein undergoes an induced transition from random coil to α helix upon binding to its target protein, hTAF II 31 (a human TFIID TATA box – binding protein-associated factor). Identification of the two hydrophobic residues that make nonpolar contacts suggests a general recognition motif of acidic activation domains for hTAF II 31."
https://openalex.org/W2007305884,"Activation of the Cdc2·cyclin B kinase is a pivotal step of mitotic initiation. This step is mediated principally by the dephosphorylation of residues threonine 14 (Thr14) and tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) on the Cdc2 catalytic subunit. In several organisms homologs of the Wee1 kinase have been shown to be the major activity responsible for phosphorylating the Tyr15 inhibitory site. A membrane-bound kinase capable of phosphorylating residue Thr14, the Myt1 kinase, has been identified in the frog Xenopus laevis and more recently in human. In this study, we have examined the substrate specificity and cell cycle regulation of the human Myt1 kinase. We find that human Myt1 phosphorylates and inactivates Cdc2-containing cyclin complexes but not complexes containing Cdk2 or Cdk4. Analysis of endogenous Myt1 demonstrates that it remains membrane-bound throughout the cell cycle, but its kinase activity decreased during M phase arrest, when Myt1 became hyperphosphorylated. Further, Cdc2·cyclin B1 was capable of phosphorylating Myt1 in vitro, but this phosphorylation did not affect Myt1 kinase activity. These findings suggest that human Myt1 is negatively regulated by an M phase-activated kinase and that Myt1 inhibits mitosis due to its specificity for Cdc2·cyclin complexes.

The cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. are a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases that mediate many of the cell cycle transitions that occur during duplication. Each of these Cdk catalytic subunits associates with a specific subset of regulatory subunits, termed cyclins, to produce a distinct Cdk·cyclin kinase complex that, in general, functions to execute a specific cell cycle event (1Nigg E.A. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The placement of a specific Cdk·cyclin complex function with a particular cell cycle transition has led to the identification of key downstream substrates as well as upstream regulatory mechanisms. Well characterized Cdk·cyclin-regulated cell cycle transitions that have been identified thus far include Cdk4·cyclin D and Cdk6·cyclin D complexes with the pRB-gated G1/S transition, Cdk2·cyclin E and Cdk2·cyclin A complexes with the initiation and progression of DNA replication and Cdc2·cyclin A and Cdc2·cyclin B complexes with the initiation of mitosis (reviewed in Refs. 2Nasmyth K.

Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). Activation of the Cdk·cyclin kinases during these transitions is controlled by a variety of regulatory mechanisms. For the Cdc2·cyclin B complex, inhibition of kinase activity during S phase and G2 is accomplished by phosphorylation of Cdc2 residues Thr14 and Tyr15, which are positioned within the ATP-binding cleft (5Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 6Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr14and/or Tyr15 is believed to suppress catalytic activity by disrupting the orientation of the ATP molecule present within this cleft (8Atherton-Fessler S. Parker L.L. Geahlen R.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The abrupt dephosphorylation of these residues by the Cdc25 phosphatase results in the rapid activation of Cdc2·cyclin B kinase activity and downstream mitotic events (10Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). While phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the conserved Tyr15site in Cdk2 likely plays an important role in regulating the G1/S transition, the role that Cdk2 Thr14phosphorylation plays is less clear (11Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 12Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the corresponding inhibitory tyrosine residue in Cdk4 has also been observed (13Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Iavarone A. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation functions to permit a cell to attain a critical concentration of inactive Cdk·cyclin complexes, which, upon activation, induces a rapid and complete cell cycle transition (15Solomon M.J.

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe wee1 gene product was the first kinase identified that is capable of phosphorylating Tyr15 in Cdc2 (19Parker L.L. Atherton-Fessler S. Lee M.S. Ogg S. Falk J.L.

In vertebrate systems, where Thr14 in Cdc2 is also phosphorylated, the Wee1 kinase was capable of phosphorylating Cdc2 on Tyr15, but not Thr14, indicating that another kinase was responsible for Thr14 phosphorylation (21Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 27McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the existence of a kinase activity that phosphorylated Cdc2 on Thr14 in the membrane fractions ofXenopus egg extracts has been reported (28Kornbluth S. Sebastian B. Hunter T. Newport J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TheXenopus gene encoding this membrane-associated kinase, the Myt1 kinase, has been isolated, and its gene product was shown to be capable of phosphorylating Thr14 and, to a lessor extent, Tyr15 in Cdc2 (29Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). A human Myt1 homolog displaying similar properties has been recently identified (30Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (see “Results”). An apparently unrelated, non-membrane-associated Thr14 kinase activity has also been identified in bovine thymus cytosol (31Matsuura I. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5443-5450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While Xenopus Myt1 clearly plays an important role in regulating the rapid early embryonic cell cycles, its role in cells that have distinct G1 and G2 phases as well as growth and checkpoint controls is not known. To investigate the role of Cdk Thr14 phosphorylation in somatic cell cycle control, we have initiated a biochemical analysis of the human Myt1 kinase. The results presented reveal that Myt1, unlike Wee1, exhibits a restricted substrate specificity; it was capable of phosphorylating Thr14 only on Cdc2·cyclin and not Cdk2·cyclin complexes. We also found that endogenous Myt1 kinase activity was reduced during a drug-induced M-phase arrest, concomitant with hyperphosphorylation of the Myt1 protein, implying that Myt1 may be negatively regulated by phosphorylation. A 325-base pair DNA fragment, corresponding to an internal region of EST clones 335241 and 336264, was polymerase chain reaction-generated using oligos 5′-AGCAGCCTCTCCAGCAACTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGAGAAGACCATGGAGTTCC-3′ (5′ and 3′ primers, respectively) and the first strand cDNA synthesis of fetal brain RNA (Clonetech) as a template. This DNA fragment was32P-labeled by random priming (Pharmacia) and used as a probe to screen approximately 7 × 105 clones of a human placental Lambda ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene). Of nine positives isolated, clone 16 was found to contain the longest cDNA insert. The complete DNA sequence of this 1.98-kilobase pair insert was determined using an ABI sequencer. Frozen pellets of Sf9 cells containing baculovirus-expressed proteins were thawed and lysed by Dounce homogenization in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (1 mm Pefabloc (Boehringer), 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C, followed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 42,000 rpm in a TLA45 rotor at 4 °C. The clarified lysates were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Combinations of various Cdk, cyclin, Wee1, and Myt1 lysates were mixed together with an ATP regeneration system (5 × stock: 0.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm ATP, 350 mm phosphocreatine, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) for 25 min at 25 °C. To determine the Cdk·cyclin kinase activity in these extracts, 1 μl of the lysate was incubated with 9 μl of a histone H1 kinase mix (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg histone H1, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10–15 min at 25 °C. This reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. The coding regions of Myt1, full-length Wee1 (clone 1E-12 encoding p98/100Wee1 (22Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Tony Hunter, Salk Institute), and cyclins were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcoG such that the expressed protein contained an N-terminal EE-epitope (32Rubinfeld B.

The monomeric Cdc2 in Fig. 3 C contained a C-terminal EE-tag and the cyclin B1 complexed with Cdc2-AF in Fig. 2 A contained an N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase fusion. All other Cdc2 and Cdk2 subunits used in this study contained a C-terminal HA tag and have been described previously (11Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 33Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The coding region of Wee1Δ, which corresponds to the p49Wee1 truncated protein (20Igarashi M. Nagata A. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. Nature. 1991; 353: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was polymerase chain reaction-generated using the full-length Wee1 clone 1E-12 as a template. Cdk·cyclin complexes were obtained by mixing and incubating individual Cdk and cyclin lysates together prior to purification, except in the case of Cdk4·cyclin D1, which was obtained by co-infecting Sf9 cells with Cdk4 and cyclin D1-expressing baculoviruses. Additionally, Sf9 lysates containing Cdk-activating kinase (Cdk7 and cyclin H) (34Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) had been added to Cdc2-wild type and cyclin B1 lysates during the activation incubation. Baculovirus-expressed proteins were immunoaffinity purified from Sf9 cell lysates using anti-Glu-Glu (EE) antibody-coupled agarose beads (32Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. J.

The reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The basis of the low level of32P-labeled Cdc2 in the untreated wild-type Cdc2·cyclin B1 kinase reaction (lane 1) is unknown, but a similar observation has been reported by Watanabe et al.

Affinity-purified Cdc2·cyclin B1 complexes (lanes 1–3), monomeric Cdc2 (lanes 4–6), monomeric Cdc2 plus monomeric cyclin B1 (lanes 7–9), or monomeric cyclin B1 (lanes 10 and 11) proteins were incubated either alone or in combination with purified Myt1 or Wee1Δ (p49Wee1) in an in vitro kinase reaction and analyzed as in panel A. The faint band in lane 11 may represent an endogenous insect Cdk that co-purified with the human cyclin B1 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In vitro 32P-labeling reactions were performed by preincubating 1 μl (1–7 μg) of purified Cdk·cyclin complexes in 4 μl of KAB (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT) containing 25 μm ATP for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by addition of 0.5 μl p49Wee1 (0.78 mg/ml) or Myt1 (2.2 mg/ml) in 4.5 μl of KAB containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and incubating at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Mammalian cell lines CEM, U2-0S, and C-33A used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Various Myt1-containing DNA fragments were cloned into a derivative of mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that contained a 5′-HA epitope-coding sequence such that the expressed Myt1 proteins contained an N-terminal HA epitope tag. The expressed Myt1 proteins are designated as follows: Myt1-1b, residues 10–499; Myt1-1A, residues 75–499; Myt1-K−, residues 10–499 containing a Lys139 to Ala139 change that was created by site-directed mutagenesis; Myt1-ΔT.M., residues 10–499 containing a deletion of the transmembrane domain (residues 379–397) 2R. N. Booher, P. S. Holman, and A. Fattaey, unpublished data. (30Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The S100 and P100 fractions were prepared from Myt1-expressing cell lines that had been lysed by Dounce homogenization in an ice-chilled hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors). This lysate was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm in a TLA45 rotor at 4 °C to obtain the S100 supernatant. The membrane-bound proteins in the P100 fractions were solubilized by extracting this fraction in the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 4 °C. The remaining insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 rpm in a TLA45 rotor at 4 °C. Synchronization of CEM cells by drug treatments was performed by culturing cells for 16–23 h in the presence of either 5 mmhydroxyurea (Calbiochem), 1 mm mimosine (Sigma), or 50 ng/ml nocodazole (Calbiochem). U2-OS cells were treated with 125 ng/ml nocodazole. Myt1 peptides N2 (MPMPTEGTPPPLSGC, residues 10–23), C1 (CNSEPPRGSFPSFEPRN, residues 472–487), and C2 (CRNLLSMFEDTLDPT, residues 486–499) were coupled to activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) (via the included cysteine residues) and injected into rabbits (two per peptide), resulting in the respective sera N2-1, N2-2, C1-1, C1-2, C2-1, and C2-2. Mouse antibodies against Myt1 protein were raised by injecting three mice with purified Myt1 (residues 9–499). Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was used to detect HA-tagged proteins. Mammalian cells were lysed in ELB (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors and clarified by microcentifugation at 8200 × g for 15 min. Myt1 was immunoprecipitated by incubating 2 μl of anti-Myt1 antibody serum in 0.2–0.4 ml of ELB containing 1 mg of lysate for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by addition of 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1 slurry, Pierce). After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted, washed three times with ELB, and once with KAB. To assess kinase activity, 10 μl of Cdc2·cyclin B1 kinase reaction (1.5 μl of Cdc2·cyclin B1 Sf9 lysates mix, see above, in 8.5 μl of KAB containing 7.5 μm ATP) was added to the beads and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with periodic mixing. Additionally, 10 μm final concentration of the corresponding peptide was included during kinase assays of C-terminal antibody immunoprecipitates. This reaction was then assayed for histone H1 kinase activity by adding 5 μl of a histone H1 kinase mix (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg of histone H1, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol)) and incubating for 15 min at 30 °C with agitation. This reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. For quantitation, the labeled bands were excised, and32P-incorporation was determined by Cerenkov counting. The mean of individual kinase assays performed on two or three aliquots of the same immunoprecipitation was determined. Clarified mammalian cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, and Sf9 cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Novex) and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). The filters were blocked with Blotto (15% nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.15m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0)), washed with TBST, and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) and secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:10,000 dilution, Bio-Rad), in blocking solutions. Immunodetection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). Analysis of Myt1 proteins in Xenopus interphase and mitotic egg extracts was performed essentially as described by Stukenberg et al.(35Stukenberg T.P. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) except that the Myt1 proteins were produced from pcDNA3-containing Myt1 plasmids in a coupled transcription/translation system (TNT, Promega) in the absence of radiolabel. To identify a human homolog of the Xenopus MYT1 gene, we performed a TBLASTN search of the EST data base using the amino acid sequence encoded byXenopus MYT1 as the query (29Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). As expected, the majority of high scoring matches were protein kinases, owing to the extensive conservation of residues within the catalytic domain of protein kinases (36Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar). However, two nearly identical human ESTs (dbEST Id: 336264 and 335241) were found to match significantly amino acid tracts within the C-terminal (noncatalytic domain) 130 residues of the XenopusMyt1 kinase. A full-length cDNA clone was isolated and found to encode the recently described human Myt1 kinase (30Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To analyze human Myt1 activity, we examined its ability to inactivate Cdk·cyclin complexes in a cell-free extract system. We used the baculovirus expression system to produce insect cell extracts that individually contained high levels of either human Cdk, cyclin, Wee1, or Myt1 proteins. It has been shown previously that Cdk·cyclin kinase activation can be reconstituted upon mixing individual Cdk and cyclin-containing lysates (33Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); thus, addition of an inhibitory activity would be expected to block this activation. We first assessed the ability of this assay system to detect Wee1 activity. Lysates containing wild-type Cdc2 were mixed with cyclin B1 lysates and with either mock-infected or Wee1-containing lysates. After a brief incubation, an aliquot of this lysate mixture was removed and Cdc2·cyclin B1 kinase activity was determined by performing a histone H1 kinase reaction. As shown in Fig. 1 A, addition of Wee1 lysates effectively inhibited Cdc2·cyclin B1 kinase activation. The Wee1 inhibitory activity was dependent on the presence of the Tyr15 residue in Cdc2, since both Cdc2-F15 (Tyr15 replaced with phenylalanine) and Cdc2-AF (Thr14 and Tyr15 replaced with alanine and phenylalanine) proteins complexed to cyclin B1 retained full activity in the presence of Wee1 lysates. When Myt1 lysates were combined together with Cdc2 and cyclin B1-containing lysates, a dramatic reduction in Cdc2 kinase activation was also observed (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, Myt1 lysates inhibited both Cdc2-A14 and Cdc2-F15 activation, indicating that Myt1 can phosphorylate either Thr14 or Tyr15inhibitory sites in Cdc2; although it appears that Myt1 preferentially phosphorylates Thr14 since Cdc2-A14 lysates consistently retained some histone H1 kinase activity. To determine whether Myt1 can inactivate Cdk2·cyclin complexes, we measured the kinase activity of Cdk2 that had been activated in the presence of Myt1-containing lysates. We used the Cdk2-AF mutant as a reference to control for any non-Thr14/Tyr15phosphorylation inhibitory activity that may be present in the Myt1 lysate. As shown in Fig. 1 C, an equivalent amount of histone H1 kinase activity was present in wild-type Cdk2 and Cdk2-AF lysates that had been mixed with either cyclin A or cyclin E lysates in the presence of Myt1, indicating that neither Cdk2·cyclin A nor Cdk2·cyclin E complexes were inactivated by Myt1. However, when Cdc2 was substituted for Cdk2 in the cyclin A complex, Myt1 significantly reduced histone H1 kinase activity, as compared with mock-treated or the Cdc2-AF control lysate (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the Cdk subunit, not the cyclin subunit, is a key determinant for whether a particular Cdk·cyclin complex is recognized by the Myt1 kinase. To analyze Myt1 substrate specificity further, various combinations of affinity purified Myt1, Wee1, and Cdk·cyclin kinases were incubated together in an in vitro kinase reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the32P-labeled proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both purified Myt1 and Wee1 were capable of phosphorylating wild-type Cdc2 as well as a kinase-deficient Cdc2 mutant (K−), each of which was complexed with cyclin B1. The Cdc2-AF mutant was not32P-labeled by Myt1 or Wee1, indicating that these kinases were phosphorylating Cdc2 on residue Thr14 and/or Tyr15. Direct phosphoamino acid analysis and immunoblot analysis using anti-Cdc2 phospho-specific antibodies showed that human Myt1, while having some Tyr15 activity, preferentially phosphorylated Cdc2 on Thr14 (data not shown), consistent with previous studies of human and Xenopus Myt1 (29Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar,30Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). When Cdk2·cyclin complexes were used as substrates in these kinase reactions, we found that Myt1 failed to phosphorylate Cdk2 that was complexed with cyclins A or E, as well as Cdk4 complexed with cyclin D1 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Wee1 readily phosphorylated Cdk2 complexed with cyclins A or E, but not Cdk4 complexed with cyclin D1, as has been previously demonstrated (22Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus, using either a crude lysate system or an in vitro kinase reaction with purified components, we consistently observed that Myt1 only phosphorylated and inactivated Cdk·cyclin complexes in which Cdc2 was the catalytic subunit. To assess whether Myt1 phosphorylation of Cdc2 requires cyclin association, we performed a Myt1 kinase reaction using monomeric Cdc2 as substrate. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Myt1 did not phosphorylate monomeric Cdc2. However, reconstitution of the Cdc2·cyclin B1 complex, by preincubating monomeric Cdc2 with monomeric cyclin B1, enabled Myt1 to phosphorylate Cdc2, indicating that Myt1 can only phosphorylate Cdc2 that is complexed with a cyclin subunit. The truncated Wee1 kinase was capable of32P-labeling monomeric Cdc2, but this phosphorylation was enhanced when the cyclin-bound form was reconstituted, which is consistent with previous studies (37Parker L.L. Sylvestre P.J. Byrnes M.J. Liu F. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9638-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To examine the regulation of endogenous Myt1, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against three different peptides corresponding to Myt1 residues 10–23, 472–487, and 486–499. These antibodies are designated N2-1, C1-1, and C2-1, respectively. When used for immunoblotting of total cell lysates, cytosolic fractions, and detergent-solubilized membrane fractions prepared from asynchronously growing C-33A human cells, each of the anti-Myt1 antibodies recognized a 66-kDa membrane-associated protein (Fig. 3). This 66-kDa protein comigrated with baculovirus-expressed human Myt1 as well as Myt1 that was produced in an in vitrotranscription/translation-coupled reaction (data not shown). In Xenopus mitotic extracts, the electrophoretic mobility of Xe-Myt1 is drastically decreased, concomitant with Myt1 hyperphosphorylation and decreased kinase activity (29Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To determine whether human Myt1 exhibits similar cell cycle regulation, we examined Myt1 in lysates prepared from unsynchronized human CEM cells as well as cells that had been arrested at G1, S, and M phases of the cell cycle by treatment with mimosine, hydroxyurea, and nocodazole, respectively. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Myt1 C-terminal peptide antibodies (C1-1 and C2-1) showed that Myt1 shifted to a slower migrating form in mitotic lysates (Fig. 4 A). The main contribution to this modification is phosphorylation, since phosphatase treatment of the mitotic lysate increased the migration of Myt1 to nearly that observed in G1- and S-phase extracts (Fig. 4 B). At least five laddering Myt1 forms were detectable in the phosphatase-treated mitotic lysate, indicating that multiple residues are phosphorylated during mitosis. Further, immunoblot analysis of cytosolic and detergent-extracted membrane fractions prepared from nocodazole-arrested CEM cells revealed that human Myt1 remained membrane-associated during M-phase arrest (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, anti-Myt1 antibody N2-1 failed to recognize the slower migrating Myt1 protein in mitotic lysates but was capable of detecting Myt1 in lysates prepared from unsynchronized as well as mimosine, or hydroxyurea-arrested CEM cells (Fig. 4 A). Phosphatase treatment of the mitotic lysate alleviated this Myt1 masking effect, suggesting that this antibody recognized only unphosphorylated Myt1 (data not shown). Consistent with the immunoblot results, this N-terminal antibody was incapable of immunoprecipitating mitotic Myt1 protein (Fig. 5 A). Since Myt1 likely spans the endoplasmic reticulum membrane2(30Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), it is possible that membrane association is required for Myt1 hyperphosphorylation observed during mitosis. To investigate this question, we established a U2-OS cell line that stably expressed a non-membrane-associated Myt1 mutant, Myt1ΔT.M., which lacks the 19-residue transmembrane domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). This Myt1ΔT.M.-expressing cell line was arrested in mitosis with nocodazole, and the soluble (S100) and detergent-solubilized particulate (P100) fractions were prepared. Immunoblot analysis of these fractions revealed that the S100-containing Myt1ΔT.M. protein exhibited a reduced mobility shift similar to that seen for the endogenous Myt1 protein (Fig. 4 D) present in mitotic extracts. This result indicates that a kinase(s) exists in the cytosol that is capable of phosphorylating Myt1 during mitosis, independent of Myt1 association with endoplasmic reticulum membranes. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that this unidentified kinase is also present in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. To characterize the kinase activity of endogenous human Myt1, anti-Myt1 antibody immunoprecipitates from CEM cell extracts were tested for their ability to inactivate various Cdk·cyclin complexes. Fig. 5 A shows that the C-terminal anti-Myt1 antibodies were capable of immunoprecipitating Myt1 from lysates prepared from nonsynchronized and mitotic cells, whereas, as described above, the N-terminal antibody failed to recognize mitotic Myt1. Consistent with our analysis of recombinant Myt1, anti-Myt1 immunoprecipitates dramatically reduced the histone H1 kinase activity of Cdc2·cyclin B1 and Cdc2-F15·cyclin B1 complexes, partially inhibited Cdc2-A14·cyclin B1 complexes, and had no effect on the Cdc2-AF·cyclin B1 complex (Fig. 5 B). Likewise, anti-Myt1 immunoprecipitates failed to inactivate Cdk2·cyclin A and Cdk2·cyclin E complexes (Fig. 5 C). These results demonstrate that the endogenous Myt1 kinase phosphorylates preferentially Cdc2 on residue Thr14 and does not phosphorylate Cdk2. To determine if the kinase activity of human Myt1 was cell cycle-dependent, we compared the kinase activity of Myt1 immunoprecipitates isolated from nonsynchronized and nocodazole-arrested CEM cells. Using two different C-terminal Myt1 peptide antibodies, Myt1 immunoprecipitated from mitotic extracts had approximately 40–50% reduced kinase activity (Fig. 6 A). Analysis of Myt1 immunoprecipitates using an N-terminal Myt1 peptide antibody showed that Myt1 was active in asynchronous, as well as mimosine- and hydroxyurea-arrested cells (Fig. 6 C). As discussed above, this N-terminal peptide antibody failed to immunoprecipitate Myt1 from nocodazole-arrested cells. These results strongly suggest that Myt1 is active during G1, S, and G2 but becomes inactive during M phase, concomitant with Myt1 hyperphosphorylation. The similarity of cell cycle-dependent kinase activity and phosphorylation state for both human and Xenopus Myt1 suggested that Myt1 kinases may be regulated by a conserved mechanism. As an initial test of this possibility we compared the electrophoretic mobility of human Myt1 that had been incubated in Xenopus interphase and mitotic egg extracts. As shown in Fig. 7 A,Xenopus mitotic extracts contained an activity that drastically reduced the electrophoretic mobility of each of the four human Myt1 proteins tested. The reduced mobility observed for Myt1 truncation mutants lacking the N-terminal 57 residues (-1A,lane 4) and C-terminal 206 residues2 indicates that phosphorylated residues responsible for the Myt1 mobility shift are not contained exclusively within either of these regions. Since the Xenopus mitotic extracts were derived from interphase egg extracts that had been induced into an M-phase state by addition of exogenous cyclin B1, it is possible that Cdc2·cyclin B1 may phosphorylate Myt1 directly, perhaps acting as an autocatalytic feedback mechanism such as has been proposed for XenopusCdc25 and Wee1 (24Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 38Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we first determined whether Cdc2·cyclin B1 could affect the electrophoretic mobility of a kinase-defective Myt1 (Myt1-K−). Sf9 lysates containing Cdc2·cyclin B1 were incubated together with a Myt1-K− lysate in the presence of an ATP regeneration system. Immunoblot analysis of this reaction showed that the Myt1-K− protein migrated with a reduced mobility after Cdc2·cyclin B1 treatment (Fig. 7 B), albeit to a lesser degree than observed for Myt1 in mitotic extracts derived from human CEM cells (data not shown). Interestingly, Fig. 7 B also shows that the Myt1 N2-1 antibody exhibited a reduced ability to recognize Myt1 that had been phosphorylated by the Cdc2·cyclin B1 kinase. The direct phosphorylation of Myt1 by Cdc2·cyclin B1 was confirmed by including [γ-32P]ATP in an in vitro kinase reaction that contained immunoprecipitated Myt1 and purified Cdc2·cyclin B1 (Fig. 7 C). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that Cdc2·cyclin B1 phosphorylated Myt1 on both threonine and serine residues (data not shown). Using an Sf9 lysate system, we examined whether the activity of Myt1 was affected by Cdc2·cyclin B1 phosphorylation. A Myt1-containing lysate was first mixed with a Cdc2-AF·cyclin B1 lysate, followed by subsequent addition of wild-type Cdc2·cyclin B1. The latter Cdc2·cyclin B1 complex was isolated by immunoprecipitation and its kinase activity was determined by performing a histone H1 kinase assay. We observed that phosphorylation of Myt1 by Cdc2-AF·cyclin B1 had no affect on its ability to inactivate Cdc2 kinase activity (data not shown). Hence, phosphorylation by Cdc2 does not appear to directly block Myt1 catalytic activity. In this study we report several biochemical properties of the human Myt1 kinase. We found that human Myt1 was capable of phosphorylating and inactivating Cdc2 associated with cyclin A or cyclin B1. In contrast, however, Myt1 was unable to phosphorylate or inactivate Cdk·cyclin complexes that function earlier in the cell cycle. In particular, Myt1 did not phosphorylate Cdk4·cyclin D1, Cdk2·cyclin E, or Cdk2·cyclin A complexes. The inability of Myt1 to phosphorylate Cdk4 was not unexpected since Cdk4 contains an alanine residue at the corresponding Thr14 position. Since Myt1 readily phosphorylated Cdc2·cyclin A complexes, Myt1 specificity appears to be determined principally by the Cdk subunit. In vivo, Cdk2 Tyr15 is phosphorylated to much greater extent than Thr14 (11Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 12Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), consistent with our in vitro results that Myt1 does not phosphorylate Cdk2 on Thr14. It is possible, however, that Myt1 can phosphorylate Cdk2 that has been initially phosphorylated on Tyr15, as has been previously suggested (11Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Alternatively, additional kinases may be responsible for phosphorylating Thr14 in Cdk2, such as a non-membrane-associated Thr14 kinase activity that is present in bovine thymus cytosol (31Matsuura I. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5443-5450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In either case, the significantly greater extent of Tyr15 phosphorylation on endogenous Cdk2 suggests that Wee1, or another Wee1-like kinase, is the major kinase activity that suppresses Cdk2·cyclin kinase activity during the G1/S transition. The kinase activity of human Myt1 was decreased during M-phase arrest. This decreased activity correlated with hyperphosphorylated and electrophoretically slower forms of Myt1. Indeed, phosphorylation of the high number of TP and SP amino acid doublets in both human andXenopus Myt1, 10 and 12, respectively, could account for the dramatic Myt1 hyperphosphorylation observed during M phase. Many of these TP/SP doublets conform to the Cdc2·cyclin B1 phosphorylation consensus site (39Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), consistent with our observation that Cdc2·cyclin B1 readily phosphorylated Myt1 in vitro. Our finding that an anti-Myt1 N-terminal peptide antibody recognized interphase but not M-phase Myt1, or Myt1 phosphorylated by Cdc2·cyclin B1 in vitro, strongly suggests that a residue near the N terminus is phosphorylated during mitosis. Which kinase(s) phosphorylates Myt1 during mitosis? Our in vitro data demonstrate that Cdc2·cyclin B1 can phosphorylate Myt1 on sites that reduce its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. While this phosphorylation did not affect Myt1 kinase activity, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in vivo, Cdc2 phosphorylation of Myt1 may be a requisite for further modifications that directly block Myt1 catalytic activity. Additionally, the partial reduction in Myt1 gel mobility induced by Cdc2·cyclin B1 phosphorylation suggests that an additional kinase(s) may phosphorylate Myt1. Further experiments will be required to discern the mechanism of Myt1 regulation during the cell cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2122199512,"Direct evidence is presented for a conformational switch in 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that affects tRNA binding to the ribosome and decoding of messenger RNA (mRNA). These data support the hypothesis that dynamic changes in rRNA structure occur during translation. The switch involves two alternating base-paired arrangements apparently facilitated by ribosomal proteins S5 and S12, and produces significant changes in the rRNA structure. Chemical probing shows reciprocal enhancements or protections at sites in 16 S rRNA that are at or very near sites that were previously crosslinked to mRNA. These data indicate that the switch affects codon-anticodon arrangement and proper selection of tRNA at the ribosomal A site, and that the switch is a fundamental mechanism in all ribosomes."

Eleven distinct isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase have been identified to date, and the regulatory properties of several of these proteins have been characterized extensively (1Taussig R.

The adenylyl cyclases share a unique structure for an enzyme, resembling transporters such as the P-glycoproteins topographically. They are intrinsic membrane proteins by virtue of their two large hydrophobic domains, each of which is hypothesized to contain six membrane-spanning helices. The first of these hydrophobic regions follows a short amino-terminal sequence and precedes a roughly 40-kDa cytoplasmic domain (C1). The second hydrophobic region separates C1 from a second cytosolic domain (C2) of comparable size. Each of the two cytosolic domains includes a sequence of 200–250 amino acid residues that is typically 50% similar to its consort, 50–90% similar to the corresponding domains of other adenylyl cyclase isoforms, and 20–25% similar to the catalytic domains of membrane-bound and cytosolic guanylyl cyclases.Detailed biochemical characterization of adenylyl cyclase is impaired by the insolubility, instability, and sparsity of the native enzyme, as well as our incapacity to express necessary amounts of the protein in heterologous systems. To overcome these hurdles we have synthesized (inEscherichia coli) portions of the two cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase in the absence of the remainder of the protein, first as a 55-kDa chimeric fusion protein containing the C1adomain of type I adenylyl cyclase linked to the C2 domain of the type II enzyme (3Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16967-16974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The specific activity of this engineered enzyme is remarkably high, it is soluble in the absence of detergent, and it is adequately stable. Importantly, it is activated synergistically by Gsα and forskolin and inhibited by so-called P-site inhibitors and the G protein βγ subunit complex, providing ample justification to pursue investigation of this and similar artificial entities. To overcome the remaining hurdle of a relatively low level of accumulation of the chimera in bacterial cytosol, we and others prepared the two cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase as distinct entities and found that enzymatic activity with similar regulatory properties can be reconstituted by simple mixture of the two roughly 25-kDa proteins (5Whisnant R.E.

Large amounts (50–100 mg or more) of the C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase can be prepared readily, but similar results are difficult to achieve with the C1a domain of the type I enzyme. We have now extended this approach by utilizing a fragment of the C1 domain of type V adenylyl cyclase, which can be expressed in reasonable (but not exuberant) quantities, and we have characterized the interactions of the two cyclase fragments with each other and with Gsα.DISCUSSIONWe have expressed and purified a fragment of the C1domain of type V adenylyl cyclase, consisting of amino acid residues 364–591 and including hexa-histidine and Flag tags at the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. Although this protein itself has no adenylyl cyclase activity, catalysis of cyclic AMP synthesis is restored by simple mixture of VC1 with an appropriate fragment from the second cytosolic domain of the enzyme, such as IIC2. This interaction is similar to that described previously between IC1 and IIC2 (5Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); the major advantages are the yield of VC1, which exceeds that of IC1 by 20-fold, and the apparent homogeneity of the product. The adenylyl cyclase activity of the VC1-IIC2 mixture is stimulated markedly by either Gsα or forskolin, and these two regulators activate the enzyme synergistically when present simultaneously. These are characteristics of native type II and type V adenylyl cyclases.A notable difference between this reconstituted adenylyl cyclase and the native enzymes is the maximal stimulated activity, which typically exceeds 100 μmol/min/mg in the case of the mixture of VC1and IIC2; values of 10 μmol/min/mg typify purified preparations of native enzymes (12Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the source of this discrepancy is not known, we suspect that the values observed with the VC1/IIC2 mixture may indeed approximate a trueVmax for mammalian adenylyl cyclase. Several factors may cause underestimation of maximal activity when dealing with a native adenylyl cyclase. Overexpression of these enzymes in Sf9 cells is plagued by production of nonfunctional protein; detergents are necessary to maintain solubility of the native proteins but may alter estimates of specific activity; lengthy purification schemes may cause denaturation of these labile entities. Alternatively, it is possible that inhibitory domains have been removed from the soluble constructs described above or that the membrane spanning domains of the enzymes do not permit optimal orientation of the interacting cytosolic segments. Another notable difference between native adenylyl cyclases and the engineered soluble enzymes (whether or not the cytosolic domains are linked covalently) is the relatively low (reduced 20–50-fold) apparent affinities of the soluble enzymes for Gsα. It is possible that the transmembrane spans, the loops that connect them, and/or residues immediately surrounding the remnants of the C1 and C2 domains in the constructs utilized may contribute to the binding site for Gsα. Nevertheless, the essential features of activation of adenylyl cyclase by the G protein α subunit are retained.We demonstrate herein that the C1 and C2domains of adenylyl cyclase interact to form a catalytically active adenylyl cyclase and that the apparent affinity of C1 for C2 is enhanced in the presence of Gsα and/or forskolin. Gel filtration, equilibrium sedimentation, and cross-linking analyses all demonstrate that Gsα interacts with the C2 domain of adenylyl cyclase in a GTP-enhanced manner and that this interaction is further stabilized by C1. Direct interactions between VC1 and Gsα were not detected by gel filtration or sedimentation equilibrium. However, these two proteins could be cross-linked by disuccinimidyl suberate in a IIC2-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that Gsα, C1, and C2 form a relatively high-affinity complex with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Although this is not surprising, the similarities in the primary sequence of the C1 and C2 domains of adenylyl cyclase raised the possibility of binding sites for two molecules of Gsα. Several adenylyl cyclase isoforms are inhibited by Giα. Although high concentrations of Giαcan apparently compete for the Gsα-binding site, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by Giα is not dependent on Gsα and is not competitive with the stimulatory α subunit (15Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We presume that there is a distinct binding site for Giα on certain adenylyl cyclases; Giα may well be found to interact predominantly with C1.Homodimerization of C1 and C2 is difficult to interpret. The phenomenon may clearly be an artifact of protein engineering and have no significance with regard to the membrane-bound native enzyme. However, we have previously detected oligomers of near native adenylyl cyclases in detergent solution, suggesting the possibility of relevance of homodimerization of the cytosolic domains (16Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).The relative capacities of GTP- and GDP-bound Gα proteins to interact with their effectors has been long debated and may be dependent on the system in question. However, no such interaction has probably been examined previously in a system containing such highly purified proteins. The Gsα, VC1, and IIC2 proteins utilized herein are all expressed abundantly in bacteria, greatly facilitating their purification to a high degree. Significant levels of contaminating nucleotide kinases are extremely unlikely, obviating such concerns as conversion of GDP to GTP in the presence of ATP. Nevertheless, the apparent affinity of GDP-Gsα for adenylyl cyclase is only about 10-fold less than that of GTPγS-Gsα. The GTPase activity of a G protein α subunit thus facilitates deactivation of the system by reducing the affinity of Gα for its effector. However, the affinity of the G protein βγ subunit complex for Gα is more highly dependent on the nature of the bound nucleotide. GTP hydrolysis thus greatly favors association of α with βγ, and it is this interaction that prevents access of either α or βγ to effectors.More critical and microscopic analyses of the interactions of the two cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase with each other and with their regulators are necessary. Although this need has been recognized for a long time, progress has been greatly limited by the availability and purity of reagents. Milligram quantities of G protein-regulated adenylyl cyclase domains may now be prepared readily, as can a high-affinity complex of Gsα with the crucial components of the cyclase. We hope that all relevant tools can now be utilized to understand the complex regulatory features of these interesting enzymes. Eleven distinct isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase have been identified to date, and the regulatory properties of several of these proteins have been characterized extensively (1Taussig R.

Direct interactions between VC1 and Gsα were not detected by gel filtration or sedimentation equilibrium. However, these two proteins could be cross-linked by disuccinimidyl suberate in a IIC2-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that Gsα, C1, and C2 form a relatively high-affinity complex with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Although this is not surprising, the similarities in the primary sequence of the C1 and C2 domains of adenylyl cyclase raised the possibility of binding sites for two molecules of Gsα. Several adenylyl cyclase isoforms are inhibited by Giα. Although high concentrations of Giαcan apparently compete for the Gsα-binding site, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by Giα is not dependent on Gsα and is not competitive with the stimulatory α subunit (15Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We presume that there is a distinct binding site for Giα on certain adenylyl cyclases; Giα may well be found to interact predominantly with C1.Homodimerization of C1 and C2 is difficult to interpret. The phenomenon may clearly be an artifact of protein engineering and have no significance with regard to the membrane-bound native enzyme. However, we have previously detected oligomers of near native adenylyl cyclases in detergent solution, suggesting the possibility of relevance of homodimerization of the cytosolic domains (16Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).The relative capacities of GTP- and GDP-bound Gα proteins to interact with their effectors has been long debated and may be dependent on the system in question. However, no such interaction has probably been examined previously in a system containing such highly purified proteins. The Gsα, VC1, and IIC2 proteins utilized herein are all expressed abundantly in bacteria, greatly facilitating their purification to a high degree. Significant levels of contaminating nucleotide kinases are extremely unlikely, obviating such concerns as conversion of GDP to GTP in the presence of ATP. Nevertheless, the apparent affinity of GDP-Gsα for adenylyl cyclase is only about 10-fold less than that of GTPγS-Gsα. The GTPase activity of a G protein α subunit thus facilitates deactivation of the system by reducing the affinity of Gα for its effector. However, the affinity of the G protein βγ subunit complex for Gα is more highly dependent on the nature of the bound nucleotide. GTP hydrolysis thus greatly favors association of α with βγ, and it is this interaction that prevents access of either α or βγ to effectors.More critical and microscopic analyses of the interactions of the two cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase with each other and with their regulators are necessary. Although this need has been recognized for a long time, progress has been greatly limited by the availability and purity of reagents. Milligram quantities of G protein-regulated adenylyl cyclase domains may now be prepared readily, as can a high-affinity complex of Gsα with the crucial components of the cyclase. We hope that all relevant tools can now be utilized to understand the complex regulatory features of these interesting enzymes. We have expressed and purified a fragment of the C1domain of type V adenylyl cyclase, consisting of amino acid residues 364–591 and including hexa-histidine and Flag tags at the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. Although this protein itself has no adenylyl cyclase activity, catalysis of cyclic AMP synthesis is restored by simple mixture of VC1 with an appropriate fragment from the second cytosolic domain of the enzyme, such as IIC2. This interaction is similar to that described previously between IC1 and IIC2 (5Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); the major advantages are the yield of VC1, which exceeds that of IC1 by 20-fold, and the apparent homogeneity of the product. The adenylyl cyclase activity of the VC1-IIC2 mixture is stimulated markedly by either Gsα or forskolin, and these two regulators activate the enzyme synergistically when present simultaneously. These are characteristics of native type II and type V adenylyl cyclases. A notable difference between this reconstituted adenylyl cyclase and the native enzymes is the maximal stimulated activity, which typically exceeds 100 μmol/min/mg in the case of the mixture of VC1and IIC2; values of 10 μmol/min/mg typify purified preparations of native enzymes (12Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the source of this discrepancy is not known, we suspect that the values observed with the VC1/IIC2 mixture may indeed approximate a trueVmax for mammalian adenylyl cyclase. Several factors may cause underestimation of maximal activity when dealing with a native adenylyl cyclase. Overexpression of these enzymes in Sf9 cells is plagued by production of nonfunctional protein; detergents are necessary to maintain solubility of the native proteins but may alter estimates of specific activity; lengthy purification schemes may cause denaturation of these labile entities. Alternatively, it is possible that inhibitory domains have been removed from the soluble constructs described above or that the membrane spanning domains of the enzymes do not permit optimal orientation of the interacting cytosolic segments. Another notable difference between native adenylyl cyclases and the engineered soluble enzymes (whether or not the cytosolic domains are linked covalently) is the relatively low (reduced 20–50-fold) apparent affinities of the soluble enzymes for Gsα. It is possible that the transmembrane spans, the loops that connect them, and/or residues immediately surrounding the remnants of the C1 and C2 domains in the constructs utilized may contribute to the binding site for Gsα. Nevertheless, the essential features of activation of adenylyl cyclase by the G protein α subunit are retained. We demonstrate herein that the C1 and C2domains of adenylyl cyclase interact to form a catalytically active adenylyl cyclase and that the apparent affinity of C1 for C2 is enhanced in the presence of Gsα and/or forskolin.

https://openalex.org/W1978543489,"Arno is a 47-kDa human protein recently identified as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) with a central Sec7 domain responsible for the exchange activity and a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Chardin, P., Paris, S., Antonny, B., Robineau, S., Béraud-Dufour, S., Jackson, C. L., and Chabre, M. (1996)Nature 384, 481–484). Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) greatly enhances Arno-mediated activation of myristoylated ARF1. We show here that in the absence of phospholipids, Arno promotes nucleotide exchange on [Δ17]ARF1, a soluble mutant of ARF1 lacking the first 17 amino acids. This reaction is unaffected by PIP2, which suggests that the PIP2-PH domain interaction does not directly regulate the catalytic activity of Arno but rather serves to recruit Arno to membranes. Arno catalyzes the release of GDP more efficiently than that of GTP from [Δ17]ARF1, and a stable complex between Arno Sec7 domain and nucleotide-free [Δ17]ARF1 can be isolated. In contrast to [Δ17]ARF1, full-length unmyristoylated ARF1 is not readily activated by Arno in solution. Its activation requires the presence of phospholipids and a reduction of ionic strength and Mg2+ concentration. PIP2 is strongly stimulatory, indicating that binding of Arno to phospholipids is involved, but in addition, electrostatic interactions between phospholipids and the amino-terminal portion of unmyristoylated ARF1GDP seem to be important.We conclude that efficient activation of full-length ARF1 by Arno requires a membrane surface and two distinct protein-phospholipid interactions: one between the PH domain of Arno and PIP2, and the other between amino-terminal cationic residues of ARF1 and anionic phospholipids. The latter interaction is normally induced by insertion of the amino-terminal myristate into the bilayer but can also be artificially facilitated by decreasing Mg2+ and salt concentrations. Arno is a 47-kDa human protein recently identified as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) with a central Sec7 domain responsible for the exchange activity and a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Chardin, P., Paris, S., Antonny, B., Robineau, S., Béraud-Dufour, S., Jackson, C.

Their functions include acting as regulators of the binding of coat proteins and adaptins to intracellular membranes (3Rothman J.E.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and as activators of phospholipase D (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

It is still unclear whether phospholipase D mediates ARF signals to initiate coated vesicle formation (8Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J.

A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Like other G proteins, ARFs cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations, and they are thought to shuttle during the activation cycle between cytosol and membranes, with the possible exception of ARF6 (10Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Taking ARF1, the most abundant ARF family member, as a model, we previously assessed the importance ofN-myristoylation for GTP-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles in vitro (11Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We concluded that the increased affinity of ARFGTP for membranes cannot be ascribed to a myristoyl switch, i.e. a nucleotide exchange-dependent exposure of the myristate, as frequently proposed in reviews (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 13Harter C. Wieland F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We believe that in ARFGDP, the myristate is accessible for interacting with phospholipids and that this interaction mostly accounts for the weak binding of ARFGDP to membranes. The tight binding of ARFGTP to phospholipids can be explained by a GTP-dependent release of the amino-terminal helix from the protein core, leading to the exposure of several hydrophobic residues that insert into the lipids in addition to the myristate (14Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Conversion of ARFGDP to ARFGTP is promotedin vivo by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Complementation studies in yeast recently led to the discovery of a family of ARF nucleotide exchange factors that share a region of sequence homology with Sec7, a yeast protein necessary for intra-Golgi transport (15Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We identified as a member of this family an ubiquitously expressed ∼47-kDa human protein termed Arno (forARF nucleotide-binding site opener) (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Another protein of very similar sequence but mostly expressed in hematopoietic cells (17Liu L. Pohajdak B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) turned out to be identical to cytohesin-1, a protein described as a regulator of β2 integrin in lymphocytes (18Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Cytohesin-1 also promotes nucleotide exchange on ARF1 (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) as well as on ARF3 (19Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Arno and cytohesin-1 contain an amino-terminal coiled-coil motif, a central Sec7 domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a cluster of positively charged residues at the carboxyl terminus. Optimal exchange activity on myrARF requires the presence of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles supplemented with PIP2. Studies with truncated mutants of Arno have demonstrated that the Sec7 domain is responsible for the exchange activity, whereas the PH domain binds to PIP2 (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have addressed two questions concerning the activation of ARF1 by Arno. (a) What is the role of the binding of the PH domain to PIP2: does it serve only to recruit Arno to membranes, or is it required to activate the exchange factor? (b) What is the role of the amino-terminal helix of ARF1 in the interaction ARF-Arno? Egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylglycerol, and bovine brain PIP2 were purchased from Sigma. [35S]GTPγS was from NEN Life Science Products, [3H]GDP was from Amersham Corp., and unlabeled nucleotides were from Boehringer Mannheim. Bovine recombinant ARF1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by a single QAE-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (11Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated ARF1 was made by co-expression with a yeast N-myristoyltransferase (20Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and separated from the contaminating nonmyristoylated protein by a precipitation at 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate followed by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and Mono-S columns (12Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mutant [Δ17]ARF1, which lacks the first 17 amino acids, was purified by gel filtration with Ultrogel AcA44 (14Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Wild-type Arno, ΔPH Arno (a deletion mutant lacking the PH domain), and Arno Sec7 domain were isolated by anion exchange on QAE-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). As judged by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, final purity was >95% for ARF proteins and was between 70 and 90% for Arno proteins. Unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared by the extrusion method of Hopeet al. (21Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). A film of phospholipids of the desired composition in PC (phosphatidylcholine), PG (phosphatidylglycerol), and PIP2 was formed in a Rotavapor and resuspended at 4 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) with or without 100 mmKCl, as indicated. The suspension was vortexed for 20 min and freeze-thawed five times. Unilamellar vesicles were produced by extrusion through 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters (14Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, wild-type or truncated ARF (1 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP (10 μm, ∼1000 cpm/pmol) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2 with or without (as indicated in the figure legends) 2 mm EDTA (1 μm or 1 mm free Mg2+), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mg/ml phospholipid vesicles. At the indicated times, samples of 25 μl (25 pmol of ARF) were removed, diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, and filtered on 25-mm BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of the same buffer, dried, and counted. [Δ17]ARF1 (10 μm) and Arno Sec7 domain (10 μm) were incubated, separately or together, for 10 min at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmMgCl2, with or without 2 mm EDTA (1 μm or 1 mm free Mg2+). A 200-μl sample of each incubation was applied to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 300 μl were collected, and 60-μl samples were concentrated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As previously reported (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), optimal nucleotide exchange activity of Arno on myrARF1 requires the presence of PC/PG/PIP2 vesicles in the assay (Fig. 1 A). The stimulatory effect of PIP2 is most likely due to an interaction between this phospholipid and the PH domain of Arno (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), but two possible mechanisms can be proposed. The binding of the PH domain to PIP2 could simply concentrate Arno on the surface of vesicles and thereby facilitate its interaction with the membrane-bound fraction of myrARF1GDP. Alternatively, binding to PIP2 could induce a conformational change of Arno, leading to an increased intrinsic catalytic activity, for example, by releasing a negative constraint. To discriminate between these alternatives, we examined the effect of Arno on [Δ17]ARF1, a soluble substrate. Indeed, this deletion mutant of ARF1 lacking the 17 amino-terminal amino acids has lost the requirement for phospholipids in the nucleotide exchange reaction (22Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and remains totally soluble in the GTP-bound state, as demonstrated by lipid-protein fluorescence energy transfer measurements (14Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and by a sedimentation assay with phospholipid vesicles (data not shown). This allows monitoring of the GDP-to-GTPγS exchange in the absence of phospholipids. Fig. 1 B shows that Arno is indeed active on [Δ17]ARF1, which first indicates that the amino-terminal α-helix of ARF1 is not essential for the interaction ARF-Arno. Most notably, the exchange activity of Arno on [Δ17]ARF1 was exactly the same in the absence of phospholipids and in the presence of PC/PG/PIP2vesicles. Moreover, a similar activity was observed with ΔPH Arno, a mutant lacking the PH domain, or Arno Sec7 domain, a deletion mutant restricted to the central catalytic domain (Fig. 1 C). Altogether, these results demonstrate that in full-length Arno, there is no constraint on the catalytic site that would be alleviated by the binding of the PH domain to PIP2-containing vesicles. Accordingly, the interaction of the PH domain with PIP2does not regulate the enzymatic activity of Arno but simply mediates its membrane association. The observation that Arno Sec7 domain catalyzes nucleotide exchange on [Δ17]ARF1 (Fig. 1 C) prompted us to examine whether the interaction between these two soluble proteins could be demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. Fig. 2 shows that this is indeed the case. When a 1:1 mixture of Arno Sec7 domain and [Δ17]ARF1 (10 μm each) was applied to and eluted from a Superose 12 column, the two proteins were found to be partly associated at 1 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2 B) and nearly totally associated at 1 μm Mg2+ (Fig. 2 D). Addition of 10 μm GDP to the elution buffer at 1 μm Mg2+ markedly reduced the interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 2 E), which indicates that Arno Sec7 domain forms a stable complex specifically with the nucleotide-free state of [Δ17]ARF1. We previously reported that a soluble nucleotide exchange factor present in a retinal extract can promote GTPγS release as well as GDP release from ARF1 (23Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J.

We investigated whether purified Arno is also able to catalyze the exchange reaction in both directions. This was first examined in the absence of phospholipids with [Δ17]ARF1 as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, Arno stimulates both GDP and GTPγS dissociations from [Δ17]ARF1, but the effect is much more pronounced on GDP release. Addition of 0.1 μm Arno to 1 μm [Δ17]ARF1 increased the rate of GDP dissociation 40-fold and increased the rate of GTPγS dissociation only 3-fold, and this was not affected by the nature of the displacing nucleotide (Fig. 3). Thus, Arno seems to have in solution a better affinity for ARFGDP than it does for ARFGTPγS. This preference is less obvious when the nucleotide exchange is measured with myrARF1 in the presence of PC/PG/PIP2 vesicles (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, GDP and GTPγS releases seem to be stimulated to a similar extent by 20 nm Arno, but this is likely due to the fact that the reaction then occurs on the membrane surface, with both substrates. Indeed, if phospholipids are omitted from the assay medium, the stimulation of [3H]GDP release from myrARF1 by Arno becomes detectable only above 0.1 μm of the exchange factor (data not shown). This indicates that only the membrane-bound fraction of myrARF1GDP is a good substrate for Arno, and because myrARF1GDP is mostly soluble, this fraction must be very low as compared with myrARF1GTPγS, which is totally bound to phospholipids. Thus, differential binding of the proteins to membranes greatly complicates the kinetic analysis. This is also evidenced by the observation that in these conditions, GDP and GTPγS are no longer equivalent as displacing nucleotide. Both [3H]GDP and [35S]GTPγS dissociations from myrARF1 were more accelerated by a catalytic amount of Arno when GDP was used as the displacing nucleotide (Fig. 4). This suggests that after the exchange, Arno dissociates more rapidly from myrARFGDP than it does from myrARFGTPγS, which could be linked to the low affinity of myrARFGDP for membranes. But on the other hand, Arno-stimulated [35S]GTPγS release was less complete in the presence of GDP (Fig. 4, right panel). It did not fit a first-order kinetics, as if with time, less and less Arno was acting on [35S]GTPγS-bound myrARF1, because of a progressive trapping by the accumulating GDP-bound form of myrARF1. Altogether, these results suggest that Arno has indeed a higher affinity for ARFGDP, even though membrane-bound Arno dissociates more rapidly from myrARFGDP than it does from myrARFGTP, because the former species is less retained on phospholipids.Figure 4Effect of Arno on the dissociation of [3H]GDP and [35S]GTPγS from myrARF1 in the presence of PC/PG/PIP2 vesicles. 1 μm myrARF1 was first incubated with 10 μm[3S]GTPγS in the presence of 0.1 mmMgCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C (left panel) or with 10 μm [35S]GTPγS in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm EDTA (1 μm free Mg2+) for 10 min at 37 °C (right panel). In each case, the assay buffer also contained 100 mm KCl and 1 mg/ml PC/PG/PIP2 (65:30:5, w/w/w) vesicles. Thereafter, free Mg2+ was raised to 1 mm, and 1 mm unlabeled GDP (○, •) or GTPγS (Δ, ▴) was added, with (•, ▴) or without (○, Δ) 20 nm Arno at zero time. 100% corresponds to 16–18 pmol of bound [3H]GDP and ∼20 pmol of bound [35S]GTPγS/25 pmol of myrARF1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously reported that Arno is inactive on unmyrARF1 when tested at 1 mm Mg2+ in the presence of 100 mmKCl and azolectin vesicles (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Replacement of azolectin, whose composition in PIP2 is not known, by defined phospholipids of optimal composition (PC/PG/PIP2, 65:30:5) allows the detection of a small activation of GTPγS binding to unmyrARF1 on the addition of a 2-fold molar excess of Arno (Fig. 5, left panel), but this effect remains marginal as compared with that on myrARF1 or [Δ17]ARF1. However, this effect could be greatly amplified by changing the composition of the assay buffer: (a) decreasing the ionic strength by omission of KCl led to the rapid accumulation of a substantial fraction of activated unmyrARF1 at 1 mmMg2+ (Fig. 5, left panel), and (b) lowering the concentration of free Mg2+ to 1 μm further enhanced the activated fraction (Fig. 5,right panel). We have shown that 1 μm free Mg2+ allows optimal spontaneous GDP-to-GTPγS exchange on unmyrARF1 (11Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Mg2+ conditions that favor spontaneous nucleotide exchange seem to also favor the activation by Arno, whereas decreasing the salt concentration presumably facilitates ionic interactions between the two proteins and phospholipids. With the optimal Mg2+ and salt concentrations defined above (1 μm free Mg2+, no KCl), we reexamined the effect of phospholipids on the stimulation of GTPγS binding to unmyrARF1 by wild-type Arno and Arno Sec7 domain. In the absence of phospholipids (Fig. 6 A), [35S]GTPγS binding to 1 μm unmyrARF1 was accelerated poorly by 0.1 μm Arno and accelerated more significantly by 2 μm Sec7 domain. In fact, the initial rate of exchange was a linear function of the exchange factor concentration and was identical for full-length Arno and Arno Sec7 domain (Fig. 6 A, inset). Thus, in the absence of phospholipids, Arno and the Sec7 domain are equivalent toward unmyrARF but are both very poor activators. In the presence of PC/PG (70:30) vesicles, the stimulation by 2 μm Sec7 domain was only slightly increased, but wild-type Arno became much more active because 0.1 μm Arno was roughly equivalent to 2 μmSec7 domain under these conditions (Fig. 6 B). Inclusion of 5% PIP2 in the vesicles did not change the stimulation by the Sec7 domain but further markedly increased the stimulatory effect of Arno (Fig. 6 C). Thus, although unmyrARF1GDP is essentially soluble (12Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), its activation by Arno is greatly facilitated by the binding of Arno to PIP2-containing vesicles, which is in marked contrast with [Δ17]ARF1 (Fig. 1 B). The lack of PIP2 effect on the Sec7 domain was expected because the PH domain is missing in this mutant protein. In fact, the Sec7 domain is completely soluble; hence, the small difference in its activity observed without lipids (Fig. 6 A) or with lipids (Fig. 6, B andC) cannot be due to an interaction between the Sec7 domain and phospholipids. It must be therefore ascribed to unmyrARF1. We previously reported that phospholipids stabilize the active form of unmyrARF1 and thereby increase the binding of [35S]GTPγS (11Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this is the explanation for the effect observed here, we repeated the same experiment by monitoring [3H]GDP dissociation. Interestingly, the activation by the Sec7 domain remained higher in the presence of phospholipids than it was in their absence (Fig. 7). Sec7-catalyzed exchange (after subtraction of the spontaneous exchange) was accelerated 2-fold in the presence of lipids. This result demonstrates that interaction of unmyrARF1GDP with phospholipids facilitates its activation by the soluble truncated exchange factor, whereas it does not affect the spontaneous nucleotide dissociation at all. It can be concluded, therefore, that both Arno-phospholipid and unmyrARF1GDP-phospholipid interactions play a role in the activation of unmyrARF1 by Arno. The present study demonstrates that wild-type Arno is able to promote guanine nucleotide exchange on [Δ17]ARF1, a soluble truncated mutant of ARF1, in the absence of phospholipids. The exchange activity is unaffected by the addition of phospholipid vesicles composed of 65% PC, 30% PG, and 5% PIP2, vesicles that have been shown to bind >60% Arno (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Moreover, a comparable activity is observed with an equivalent concentration of Arno ΔPH, a mutant of Arno lacking the PH domain, or of Arno Sec7 domain, a deletion mutant restricted to the central catalytic domain. These results indicate that in wild-type Arno the catalytic site is likewise accessible to the soluble substrate, whether Arno is membrane-bound or in solution. Therefore, the binding of the PH domain to PIP2-containing vesicles does not affect the catalytic activity of Arno but simply promotes membrane recruitment of the exchange factor. The role of PIP2 binding has been examined for a number of other PH domain-containing enzymes. In two cases, namely the dynamin GTPase (24Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and the Akt/PKB kinase (25Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), the binding of phosphoinositides has been proposed to directly regulate the catalytic activity, even though in the latter case the physiological relevance of this stimulation has been recently questioned by the characterization of a 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates Akt/PKB (26Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most frequently however, the PH domain is thought to have a simple recruiting function, by facilitating anchoring of the enzyme in PIP2-enriched regions of the membrane. This has been clearly demonstrated for G protein-coupled receptor kinases (27Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and both δ and β isoforms of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (28Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S.

Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Also, for other small G protein-specific nucleotide exchange factors of the Dbl family acting on Rho-like G proteins (30Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the PH domain is believed to serve primarily to target the exchanger to specific cellular locations. Because ARF activates PLD1 (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 6Cockroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and PLD1 activity is dependent on PIP2 even after purification of the enzyme (31Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), it is possible that the recruitment of Arno by PIP2 serves to concentrate ARF in the vicinity of its PLD effector. It should be stressed that PIP2-mediated membrane association of Arno greatly enhances the activity of the exchange factor toward its membrane-bound substrate myrARF1, even though the catalytic site is not directly affected. This is likely to result from an increased local concentration of the two proteins on the membrane surface that facilitates their interaction. The fact that Arno efficiently catalyzes GDP dissociation from [Δ17]ARF1 demonstrates that the amino-terminal helix of ARF1 is not the site of interaction with the exchange factor, which contradicts the prediction of Amor et al. (32Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) based on the crystallographic structure of unmyrARFGDP. The formation of a stable complex between Arno Sec7 domain and nucleotide-free [Δ17]ARF1 (Fig. 2) should allow preparation of crystals for x-ray diffraction analysis and identification of the true contacts between the two proteins. It is noteworthy that in contrast to [Δ17]ARF1, the equally water-soluble full-length unmyrARF1GDP is not readily activated by Arno in solution. This suggests that the amino-terminal helix somehow hinders the catalyzed exchange reaction, just as it hinders the spontaneous exchange. Indeed, we previously reported that at physiological Mg2+ levels, GDP does not spontaneously dissociate from unmyrARF, whereas it is significantly released from myrARF in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (12Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because the amino-terminal helix in unmyrARFGDP is held in a hydrophobic cleft (32Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 33Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M.H. Cockroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we proposed that insertion of the myristate into the lipid bilayer might slightly displace the helix away from the protein core and thereby facilitate the opening of the nucleotide binding site (23Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when the myristate is lacking, the amino-terminal helix would stick to the protein core and maintain the nucleotide binding site in a locked conformation. In this case the only way to obtain GDP dissociation is to reduce the affinity of ARF for GDP by decreasing the Mg2+ concentration (11Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that to accelerate Arno-catalyzed GDP release from unmyrARF1, it is necessary to add phospholipids, to decrease the ionic strength of the medium and to lower the concentration of free Mg2+. Moreover, we show that the effect of phospholipids is not entirely due to Arno binding to the vesicles, because a lipid-dependent enhancement of the catalyzed exchange is still observed when Arno is replaced by the sole Sec7 domain. Previous studies measuring the co-sedimentation of ARF with vesicles of defined lipid composition have shown that myrARFGDP weakly interacts with phospholipids through both hydrophobic interaction of the myristate with the bilayer and electrostatic interactions of cationic residues with anionic lipids (14Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The ionic interactions, presumably due to the positive patch formed on the surface of the protein by residues K10, K15, K16, K59, and R178 (32Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 33Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M.H. Cockroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), were not detected between unmyrARFGDP and phospholipids at a physiological ionic strength (14Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), but they should be stronger at a lower salt concentration. Accordingly, the requirement for a low ionic strength observed here could reflect the need to reinforce these electrostatic interactions to compensate for the absence of the myristate. Whether decreasing the Mg2+ concentration only affects the affinity for GDP or also facilitates the movement of the amino-terminal helix is not known, but altogether our observations suggest that efficient activation of full-length ARF1 by Arno requires a membrane surface and involves an interaction of the bilayer with the amino-terminal portion of ARFGDP. An unresolved issue, however, is the exact sequence of events during the exchange reaction. Does the helix interact with the bilayer before or after the binding of Arno to ARF? In the first alternative, the binding site of Arno would be unmasked consecutively to the movement of the helix. In the case of the bacterial elongation factor EF-Tu and its nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts, it has been proposed that the exchanger breaks open the nucleotide binding site by disrupting the coordination pattern of the magnesium ion (34Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusak S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). If the same mechanism applies to Arno, it is possible that the nucleotide binding site of ARF has to be unlocked before the interaction with Arno. Accordingly, the nucleotide binding site of ARFGDP would take two possible conformations: (a) a closed conformation, corresponding to the crystal structure of unmyrARFGDP (32Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 33Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M.H. Cockroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and (b) a looser conformation induced by a slight release of the amino-terminal helix or/and by chelating the magnesium. Arno would recognize only the latter conformation. Alternatively, Arno could bind normally to ARFGDP with the amino-terminal helix packing against the protein core but would not be able to open the nucleotide binding site on its own, without the help of phospholipids to pull away the amino-terminal helix. We cannot presently discriminate between the two possibilities. Whatever the exact mechanism, the present findings point to the importance of the amino-terminal helix of ARF1 and of the protein-phospholipid interactions in the activation of ARF1 by Arno. We propose that efficient catalysis of GDP release by Arno can only occur on a membrane surface with the two proteins interacting with phospholipids: Arno interacting with PIP2 by its PH domain, and ARF interacting with anionic phospholipids by its amino-terminal portion. Thus, even though Arno and ARFGDP can potentially interact in solution, the presence of the amino-terminal helix precludes any futile nucleotide exchange and warrants the membrane localization of the exchange, whereas the PIP2 requirement for Arno binding may serve to target activated ARF to specific locations.

Gram-positive pathogens cause a variety of different human diseases, which often present therapeutic difficulty because of bacterial antibiotic resistance (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). The treatment of hospital-acquired infections of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium is particularly challenging since many of these strains are multiply resistant to all classes of antibiotics (2Walsh C.T. Science. 1993; 261: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In search for a novel target of antibiotic therapy, we have begun to characterize the anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of S. aureus. Staphylococcal surface proteins are thought to be instrumental during the establishment and maintenance of human infections by either promoting the attachment to specific host tissues or preventing the phagocytic clearance of the invading bacteria (3Foster T.J.

Cell wall anchoring of surface proteins in S. aureusrequires both an NH2-terminal signal (leader) peptide and a COOH-terminal cell wall sorting signal (5Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The 35-residue sorting signal harbors an LPXTG sequence motif that has been found conserved within the sorting signals of more than 100 surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria (6Fischetti V.A.

Sci. U. S.

Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that surface proteins could be anchored via an amide linkage between the carboxyl of threonine and the amino of the pentaglycine cross-bridge (9Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, previous work left unresolved the chemical structure of the cell wall anchor of surface proteins. This question was addressed here, and we demonstrate that surface proteins are linked to a branched peptide (NH2-Ala-γ-Gln-Lys-(NH2-Gly5)-Ala-COOH). This branched anchor peptide is amide-linked toN-acetylmuramic acid, thereby tethering the peptide backbone to the glycan chains of the cell wall. Unlike the highly cross-linked wall peptides within the peptidoglycan, these branched anchor peptides are not substituted at their terminal d-alanine.

S. aureus OS2 harboring pHTT4 was grown overnight in tryptic soy broth supplemented with chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) and diluted 1:40 into the same medium. Generally 4 liters of culture were grown with shaking at 250 rpm and 37 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were suspended in 100 ml of water, and the cell wall carbohydrates were extracted by the addition of 100 ml of an ethanol-acetone (1:1) mixture (14Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and incubation for 30 min on ice. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 300 ml of ice-cold water. Cell pellets were suspended in 30 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5 for lysostaphin and amidase digests, pH 6.8 for mutanolysin), and the peptidoglycan was digested with either lysostaphin (33 μg/ml, Ambi), amidase (67 μg/ml), or mutanolysin (333 units/ml, Sigma) and incubated for either 2 (lysostaphin) or 16 h (amidase and mutanolysin) at 37 °C. Peptidoglycan-released surface proteins were separated from the acetone-protoplasts (14Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min, and the collected supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size membrane. Solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws surface protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-Sepharose (Qiagen). Briefly, a column with 2 ml of bed volume was washed with 15 ml of equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), loaded with 30 ml of cell wall extract, washed first with 30 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) and then with 30 ml of equilibration buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (0.5 m imidazole, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Amidase and lysostaphin-solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws were precipitated with 7% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), solutions were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged for 15 min at 17,000 ×g, and the collected pellets were washed in acetone and dried. After affinity chromatography, the mutanolysin-solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws protein was dialyzed against 4 liters each of 50 mm of NH4HCO3 for 1, 3, and 24 h and then dried under vacuum. The dried pellets of the affinity-purified Seb-MH6-Cws proteins were suspended into 600 μl of 70% formic acid. A crystal of CnBr was added, and the reaction was incubated for 16 h at room temperature. The cleaved peptides were dried under vacuum, washed twice with 100 μl of water, and suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01m Tris, pH 8.0). A 1-ml column of Ni-NTA-Sepharose was pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A and loaded with the CnBr-cleaved peptides. The column was washed successively with 10 ml of buffer A, 10 ml of buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0), and 10 ml of buffer C (same as buffer B, but pH 6.3). The anchor peptides were finally eluted with 2 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid. The eluate was divided into equal volumes, one of which was desalted on C-18 matrix prior to MALDI-MS, whereas the other was subjected to RP-HPLC purification. Preparation of anchor peptides from 4 liter of staphylococcal culture (5 × 1013 colony forming units) typically yielded 1 nm (2 μg) of purified compound. Because of the relative small yield of anchor peptides, we chose to analyze our compounds by the more sensitive MALDI-MS and ESI-MS rather than fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The latter method has been used extensively in the past for the study of bacterial peptidoglycans (11de Jonge B.L.M. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol.

A C-18 matrix cartridge (Analtech) was prewashed with 10 ml of CH3CN, followed by 10 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. One ml of the affinity chromatography eluate was loaded on the cartridge, washed with 10 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 3 ml of 60% CH3CN. The desalted anchor peptides were dried under vacuum and suspended in 20 μl of CH3CN:water:formic acid (50:50:0.1). MALDI-MS spectra were obtained on a reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager RP) in the linear mode. Samples (0.5–1.0 μl) were co-spotted with 1.0 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2 mg/200 μl CH3CN:water:trifluoroacetic acid (70:30:0.1)) and mass measured using an external calibration. For further purification of anchor peptides, the affinity chromatography eluate was subjected to RP-HPLC on a C-18 column (2 × 250-mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific). The separation was carried out at 40 °C with a linear gradient from 99% H2O (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 99% CH3CN (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 90 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The elution of anchor peptides was monitored at 215 nm, and 1-min fractions were collected. Vacuum dried fractions were generally re-dissolved in 50 μl of water:CH3CN:formic acid (50:50:0.1). A Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was tuned and calibrated by flow injection (10 μl/min) of a mixture of PPG 425, 1000, and 2000 (3.3 × 10−5, 1 × 10−4, and 2 × 10−4m, respectively) in water:methanol (1:1) containing 2 mm ammonium formate and 0.1% CH3CN. Calibration across the m/z range 10–2400 was effected by multiple ion monitoring of eight PPG solution signals (typically the singly charged ions at m/z 58.99, 326.25, 906.67, 1254.92, 1545.13, 1863.34, and 2010.47 and the doubly charged ion atm/z 520.4). The ion spray voltage operated at 4.5 kV using hydrocarbon-depleted air for the spray nebulization (“zero” grade air, 40 p.s.i., 0.6 liter/min), and spectra were generated with a curtain gas produced from the vapors of liquid nitrogen. Samples (10 μl) were introduced into the ionization source by flow injection. ESI-MS spectra were obtained at instrument conditions sufficient to resolve the isotopes of the PPG/NH4+singly charged ion at m/z 906 with 40% valley, an orifice voltage of 60, and step size during data collection of 0.3 Da. Deconvolution of the series of multiply charged ions and calculation of peptide or protein molecular weight was achieved with the Hypermass™ computer program. Daughter ion spectra were obtained using degraded mass resolution to improve the sensitivity of detection, and a step size of 1 Da was used for data collection. Under these conditions, the isotopes of the PPG/NH4+singly charged ion at m/z 906 were not resolved from one another. E. coliBL1(DE3) pLysS, pHTT2 was grown overnight in LB medium containing chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The culture was diluted 1:50 into 500 ml of the same medium and incubated with 250 rpm shaking at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.2, T7 polymerase was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the culture was incubated for another 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min and suspended in 20 ml of F′ buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0). Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the suspension was sonicated on ice with 30 10-s pulses over 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to collect inclusion bodies harboring staphylococcal amidase. The pellets were extracted with 30 ml of a solution containing CH3CN:isopropanol:water (3:3:14) and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were suspended in 20 ml of buffer B, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Proteins soluble in the supernatant were filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size membrane prior to affinity chromatography. A 2.5-ml Ni-NTA-Sepharose column was pre-equilibrated with 15 ml of buffer B, loaded with the filtrate, washed first with 30 ml of buffer B, and then with 30 ml of buffer C. Amidase was eluted with 5 ml of buffer E (same as buffer B, but pH 4.5). The purity and molecular mass of staphylococcal amidase were determined by 12% SDS-PAGE analysis, which was in agreement with the predicted mass. As judged on Coomassie or silver-stained SDS-PAGE, the amidase preparation was 100% pure. The eluate was dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1m urea, 0.005% Tween 80, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 4 °C without stirring, followed by a second dialysis against the same buffer without urea for 16 h at 4 °C and slow stirring. An experimental scheme was developed that allowed for the selective purification of COOH-terminal peptides harboring the cell wall anchor structure of surface proteins (Fig. 1). Seb-MH6-Cws is a recombinant protein consisting of the NH2-terminal signal (leader) peptide and mature region of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (18Jones C.L. Khan S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 29-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a fused COOH-terminal cell wall sorting signal of protein A (5Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). At the fusion joint between these two sequences, a methionine (M) residue followed by six histidines (H6) was inserted. This engineered insertion serves as an affinity tag for the rapid purification of solubilized surface protein by chromatography on nickel-Sepharose. Purified proteins were cleaved with CnBr at their methionine residues, thereby separating the COOH-terminal anchor peptides from the remainder of the polypeptide chains. The anchor peptides were further purified by a second round of affinity chromatography on nickel-Sepharose and analyzed by MALDI-MS. Digestion of the staphylococcal cell wall with lysostaphin resulted in the solubilization of Seb-MH6-Cws, and most of these polypeptides migrated uniformly on SDS-PAGE with a mass of approximately 30,000 Da (Fig. 1). Some of the lysostaphin-released material appeared as distinct species with higher molecular mass, which is likely caused by an incomplete digestion of the peptidoglycan. After CnBr cleavage of Seb-MH6-Cws, three major anchor peptides were identified by MALDI-MS with m/z 1726, 3836, and 3867 in addition to ions with lesser intensity (m/z 1668, 1759, and 3777; Fig. 2 A). To purify individual anchor peptides, we subjected the affinity-purified sample to RP-HPLC on C-18 resin (Fig. 2 B). Two major absorption peaks eluted at 24–29% and at 34–37% CH3CN, respectively. The material that eluted at 24–29% CH3CN consisted of two different peptides with an observed average compound mass of 1665.42 and 1722.58, as measured by ESI-MS (Fig. 2 C). Amino acid analysis and Edman degradation confirmed the structure of these two peptides to be NH2-HHHHHHAQALPET-Gly-Gly-(Gly)-COOH (calculated mass 1665.76 and 1722.81), indicating that they differed by the addition of a COOH-terminal glycine residue (mass 57) (Table I). (To facilitate identification of residues within anchor peptides, all amino acids specified by the mRNA coding sequence are printed in the single-letter code, whereas linked cell wall residues are indicated in the three-letter code.) This result confirmed our previous observation that COOH-terminal anchor peptides can be liberated from the staphylococcal cell wall by the cleavage with lysostaphin between the second and the third glycyl residue of the pentaglycine cross-bridge (9Schneewind O.

Open table in a new tab Aliquots of HPLC-purified anchor peptides were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. The picomolar concentration of observed phenylthiohydantoin-coupled amino acid peaks per Edman sequencing cycle is reported. The anchor peptides that eluted from the RP-HPLC at 34–37% CH3CN were ESI-MS measured to be peptides with masses of 3777, 3830, and 3858 (data not shown). Edman degradation and amino acid analysis revealed that these compounds consisted of COOH-terminal anchor peptides with additional 16 upstream residues of Seb sequence (NH2-VDSKDVKIEVYLTTKKGTMHHHHHHAQALPET-Gly-Gly-(Gly)-COOH). The observed compound masses can thus be explained as anchor peptides with two and three glycyl residues linked to the threonyl of the LPXTG motif, similar to the peptides described above. This result indicated that the CnBr cleavage at the engineered methionine-histidine site occurred with reduced efficiency (50–60%) as compared with the cleavage at other methionyl residues (data not shown). Muralytic amidases cleave the bacterial wall peptides at their amide linkage between the amino of l-alanyl and the carboxyl ofN-acetylmuramic acid (19Ghuysen J.-M. Strominger J.L. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ghuysen J.-M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since no such enzyme was available to us, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified the amidase gene of staphylococcal phage φ11 (21Wang A. Wilkinson B.J. Jayaswal R.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 102: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in E. coli. 2N. Truong, H. Ton-That, and O. Schneewind, unpublished results. Amidase cleavage of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws as two distinct species, both of which migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE than the lysostaphin-released counterpart (Fig. 1). Edman degradation of amidase-solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws (without prior CnBr cleavage) revealed the expected NH2-terminal sequence (ESQPDP). In contrast to the sequencing data obtained for the lysostaphin-released species, we observed a half-molar amount of phenylthiohydantoin-coupled alanine in addition to the NH2-terminal glutamic acid after the first cleavage cycle (data not shown). This result indicated that some of the amidase-released species harbored two amino-terminal residues, glutamic acid and alanine, consistent with a branched peptide structure and with the cleavage of the amide bond between l-alanyl andN-acetylmuramic acid by the added amidase (22Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Ensign J.C. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 906-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After CnBr cleavage and affinity purification, the amidase-released anchor peptides were subjected to MALDI-MS (Fig. 3 A). Five major ions withm/z 2235, 2717, 2758, 4335, and 4857 were identified and these compounds were further purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3 B). An average ESI-MS mass of 2235.05 was observed for the anchor peptide eluting at 26% CH3CN (Fig. 3 C). When subjected to Edman degradation, this compound yielded the sequence NH2-A/HHHHHHAQALPET-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-COOH and two phenylthiohydantoin-coupled residues, histidine and alanine, were identified at equimolar concentrations during cycle 1 (Table I). This result is consistent with the structure of a branched peptide consisting of surface protein linked via the pentaglycine cross-bridge to the ε-amino of lysine in the wall peptide and a calculated average mass of 2235.35 as shown in Fig. 4. An NH2-terminal alanyl of the wall peptide, liberated via amidase cleavage, is likely linked to d-isoglutamine and presumably no further amino acid was released from the wall peptide due to the nature of its iso-peptide bond (23Ghuysen J.-M. Tipper D.J. Birge C.H. Strominger J.L. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2245-2254Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4 for a structural model). The amino acid analysis was consistent with the presented structure (Table II).Figure 4Structure of the cell wall anchor of surface proteins in S. aureus.

To characterize the entire structure of the compound with mass 2235, we performed CID of the triply charged parent ion (m/z 746) in an MS/MS experiment. The resulting daughter ion spectrum was examined for the presence of breakdown products (15Martin S.A. Rosenthal R.S. Biemann K. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and compared with our structural model (Fig. 4). The structure of the branched peptide was revealed by the presence of the daughter ions at m/z201, 258, 342, 399, and 982. The ion at m/z 201 was interpreted to be Ala-γ-Gln. The observation that no glutamine was released by Edman degradation during cycle two suggests that the two amino acids are linked by the characteristic isopeptide bond. The ion at m/z 399 comprises the entire stem peptide (NH2-Ala-γ-Gln-Lys-Ala-COOH), whereas the ion atm/z 342 represented the loss of Ala from this structure (NH2-Ala-γ-Gln-Lys-COOH). Evidence for the bond between the fifth glycyl and the ε-amino of lysyl was provided by the fact that Edman degradation during cycles 19 and higher (i.e.after the fifth glycyl) did not release phenylthiohydantoin-coupled amino acids (Table I) and by the presence of the ions at m/z258 (NH2-Lys-(NH2-Gly)-Ala-COOH) and 982 (NH2-Lys(NH2-H6AQALPET-Gly5)-COOH), which comprise this bond.

The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Presently, five members of the NF-κB/Rel family have been identified in mammals including NF-κB1, NF-κB2, RelA, c-Rel, and RelB. These proteins share homology in their 300-amino acid N-terminal regions.

NF-κB was originally identified as a heterodimer of NF-κB1 and RelA (3Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Urban M.B. Schreck R.

NF-κB is present in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, associated to an inhibitor protein, IκB. Upon exposure of the cells to inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, or lipopolysaccharide, UV radiation, or viral infection, IκB becomes phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and subsequently degraded (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). As a result, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences and activates transcription. Transactivation functions have been located in the C-terminal regions of RelA (5Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), c-Rel (6Bull P.

RelA contains at least two strong transactivation domains (TADs) within its C terminus; activation domain TA1, consisting of the 30 C-terminal amino acids, and TA2, located within the 90 amino acids next to TA1 (5Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 10Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1666-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the N-terminal part of TA2, a mini-leucine zipper motif is present composed of three leucines arranged in a heptad repeat (5Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Both TADs contain a common sequence motif (11Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between transcription factors of distinct families is an important phenomenon in regulating gene transcription and has recently become the subject of intensive investigation. NF-κB, and particularly RelA, has been shown to interact functionally and physically with numerous other transcription factors, including members of the AP-1 family, resulting in enhanced biological activity of these transcription factors (12Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others have reported that steroid receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S.

Since RelA represses ligand-dependent activation of steroid receptor-regulated promoters, a mutually inactive complex formed either by a direct protein-protein interaction of the receptor and RelA or via a third partner has been proposed (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ray A.

Steroid receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, and their modular structure, consisting of a DNA binding domain (DBD) and a ligand binding domain (LBD), is highly conserved. Transactivation domains have been located N-terminally to the DBD, designated AF-1, and within the LBD, named AF-2. Whereas AF-1 is a hormone-independent activation domain, AF-2 functions hormone dependently (19Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Recently, several cofactors interacting with AF-2 have been described to inhibit (corepressors) or enhance (coactivators) transcription by nuclear receptors (20Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The domains involved in interaction between steroid receptors and NF-κB have not been mapped in much detail. For steroid receptors, analysis of deletion mutants has revealed that both the DBD and the LBD are necessary for repression of NF-κB activity (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6217-6224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). So far, the domain(s) of NF-κB involved in inhibition of steroid receptor activity have not been determined. Therefore, we investigated the importance of different regions in RelA in repressing GR activity. Our results show that both the RHD and the TADs of RelA are required for repression of hormone-dependent activation of GR, while only the RHD and not the TADs were found to directly interact with GRin vitro. Furthermore, cotransfection of the cofactor 13 S E1A resulted in a decrease in repressive activity of RelA in COS-1 cells. These data suggest that the mutual repression between GR and RelA is due to complex formation via the RHD of RelA, while the TADs of RelA, able to interact with cofactors, are required to repress the transcriptional activity of GR. Dexamethasone was obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain of RelA (SC-109) and against the C terminus of RelA (SC-372) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibody against IκBα was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monkey COS-1 cells and human 293 embryonal kidney cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), buffered with bicarbonate and supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum from Integro (Linz, Austria). For transient transfections, the cells were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transfected using calcium-phosphate coprecipitation with 2 μg of luciferase reporter, 3 μg of PDMlacZ, and the indicated amount of expression plasmids. pBluescript SK−plasmid was added to obtain a total amount of 10 μg of DNA/well. After 16 h, the medium was refreshed and hormone was added. Cells were harvested 24 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Packard). Values were corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity (21Pfahl M. Tzukerman M. Zhang X.-K. Lehmann J.M. Hermann T. Wills K.N. Graupner G.

The luciferase reporter plasmid containing three NF-κB sites from the ICAM-1 promoter and the reporter plasmid 2 × GREtkluc have been described elsewhere (22van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Stade B.G.

The CMV4 expression vectors containing human RelA and GR, the 12 S E1A, 13 S E1A, and RXRα expression plasmids, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NF-κB1 and -RARβ have been described previously (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kalkhoven E.

Proteins were synthesizedin vitro using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's description. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(plysS). Expression and purification with glutathione-coated beads (Pharmacia) was performed as described previously (17Kalkhoven E. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6217-6224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins loaded on Sepharose beads were subsequently incubated with in vitro synthesized proteins in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (NETN) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed four times with NETN, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 293 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected as described above with 20 μg of expression plasmid and 20 μg of both plasmids when combinations are used. Cells were harvested in Dignam C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and membranes were pelleted. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the κB site from the ICAM-1 promoter (5′-agcttctTGGAAATTCCggagc-3′) were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Whole cell extracts (5 μg) were incubated with 10,000 cpm of probe (0.1–0.5 ng) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature in a total reaction mixture of 20 μl containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1) gel, containing 0.25 × TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) as running buffer. COS-1 cells and 293 cells were transfected as described above. Subsequently cells were harvested directly in sample buffer. Samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). Blots were blocked with Blotto (phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% non-fat milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min. All subsequent steps were carried out in Blotto:phosphate-buffered saline (1:1). Blots were probed with the polyclonal antibody SC-109 or SC-372 against RelA. After washing, blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:10,000, Amersham Corp.). Blots were washed again, and immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). To determine the domain(s) in RelA involved in repression of GR activity, several deletion constructs, lacking (part of) the TADs or (part of) the RHD were used. Furthermore, a mutant was used containing a point mutation in the RHD (Fig. 1 A). Expression levels of these RelA constructs in 293 cells were similar, as detected on a Western blot (Fig. 1 B). To detect the RelA proteins inlanes 1–12, a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal region of RelA was used. A different antibody, directed against the C-terminal region of RelA, was used to detect RelA 1–551Δ22–248 protein (lane 13). This antibody shows an aspecific signal as indicated in Fig. 1 B. Similar levels of expression were observed in COS-1 cells (data not shown). To study the ability of the different proteins to activate transcription from an NF-κB reporter, the constructs encoding the different RelA mutants were cotransfected with this reporter into 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, full-length RelA (1–551) strongly activated the reporter (∼80-fold), while deletions in transactivation domains 1 and 2 (TA1 and TA2) drastically decreased the transactivation potential. As expected, no activity was observed when both activation domains were deleted (RelA 1–431 and RelA 1–305). Also the constructs containing either deletions or mutations in the RHD, which are therefore no longer able to bind DNA (see Fig. 4 B and data not shown), could not activate the NF-κB reporter (RelA 1–551Δ22–248, RelA 1–551Δ79–95, and RelAE39I). Similar results were obtained in COS-1 cells (data not shown). For all constructs that were able to transactivate the NF-κB reporter (Fig. 1 C), repression of their transcriptional activity could be observed upon cotransfection of expression vector encoding GR (1 μg) in the presence of dexamethasone (results not shown). This indicates that not a specific part of the transactivation domain of RelA is involved in the repression of RelA activity by GR. To examine whether the RelA mutants were able to repress GR activity, 293 cells and COS-1 cells were transfected with a reporter construct containing two glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in front of the thymidine kinase promoter coupled to the luciferase gene. Cotransfection with GR expression vector (100 ng) resulted in a hormone-dependent induction of luciferase activity, which could be clearly repressed by the presence of full-length RelA (1–551) (Fig. 2), as described previously (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of either TA1 (1–521), or the TA1-like domain in TA2(1–551Δ443–476) (11Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), hardly affected the repressive activity of RelA, while deletion of both the leucine zipper-like structure and part of the TA1-like domain in TA2 (RelA 1–551Δ431–470) did have a small effect. In 293 cells, further deletion of the TADs and combinations of deletions in TA1 and TA2 resulted in a decrease in repressive activity and RelA 1–431, lacking both TADs was no longer able to repress GR activity (Fig. 2 A). However, in COS-1 cells, these deletions in the TADs had only minor effects, and RelA 1–431 was still able to repress GR activity to around 35% (Fig. 2 B). RelA 1–305, containing only the RHD, no longer showed repressive activity in both cell lines. These results indicate that, in 293 cells and in COS-1 cells, the TADs of RelA are necessary for repression of GR activity. In addition, there is no strict correlation between the transactivation function and the transrepression function of the RelA mutants. When (part of) the RHD of RelA was deleted (RelA 1–551Δ22–248, RelA 1–551Δ79–95), the resulting mutants were no longer able to bind DNA. Cotransfection of these constructs did not result in repression of GR activity in 293 cells and hardly showed repressive activity in COS-1 cells, whereas point mutant E39I, also defective in DNA binding (25Toledano M.B. Ghosh D. Trinh F. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was able to repress GR activity in COS-1 cells but not in 293 cells. The DNA binding-defective mutants that still contained intact TADs, able to interact with transcription intermediary factors, were not able to repress GR activity. This indicates that negative cross-talk between GR and RelA is not only the result of competition for common coactivators, a process named squelching (26Gill G. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 334: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 27Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It is clear that, although there are cell-type specific differences in repressive activity of RelA, both the RHD and the TADs of RelA are required for repression of GR activity. To investigate the possible function of the RHD and the TADs of RelA in the interaction with GR, reciprocal binding assays were performed. First, the cDNAs of RelA 1–551, RelA 1–431, lacking the TADs, RelA 1–305, containing only the RHD, and RelA 1–551Δ22–248, lacking the RHD, were fused in-frame to the GST gene. GST-NF-κB1 and GST-RARβ were used as controls. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified with glutathione-coated agarose beads, and subsequently incubated with equivalent amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled GR or RXRα protein, synthesized by in vitrotranscription-translation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, GR could not be precipitated by GST alone and hardly precipitated by GST-NF-κB1 and GST-RARβ, whereas GST-RelA 1–551, GST-RelA 1–431, and GST-RelA 1–305 efficiently bound GR protein. However, GST-RelA 1–551Δ22–248, lacking the RHD, was not able to precipitate GR protein. Furthermore, the GST-RelA proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled RXRα, and it was found that only GST-RARβ was able to precipitate RXRα protein, clearly demonstrating the specificity of the interaction between the RelA proteins and GR. Next, in an alternative approach to determine the domain in RelA involved in interaction with GR, the cDNA encoding GRΔAB (amino acids 420–779) was fused to the GST gene and tested for its ability to bind in vitro synthesized, [35S]methionine-labeled mutant RelA proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the labeled RelA proteins could not be precipitated by GST alone, whereas GST-NFκB1, known to associate with RelA (4Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and GST-GRΔAB clearly precipitated RelA 1–551, RelA 1–431, and RelA 1–305. RelA 286–551 could not be precipitated by both GST-NF-κB1 and GST-GRΔAB, confirming our previous results shown in Fig. 3 A. In all cases, the additional presence of hormone had no effect (data not shown). These data indicate that, although negative cross-talk between GR and RelA in intact cells requires both the RHD and the TADs, physical association between GR and RelA involves the RHD only. RelA mutants in which the domain involved in repression is mutated, but which are still able to dimerize, can associate with wild type RelA protein. The potential effect of these complexes on the repressive activity of RelA was tested in transfection experiments. Several RelA mutants were analyzed by transfection of 293 cells with a GRE reporter construct and expression constructs encoding GR (100 ng) and RelA 1–551 (100 ng). RelA can readily repress GR activity to ∼55% when cotransfected in amounts as low as 100 ng (Fig. 4 A). Cotransfection of wild type RelA (1 μg) resulted in an increased repression of GR activity, whereas cotransfection of RelA 1–431, RelA 1–305, or RelAE39I (1 μg), showed a decrease in the repressive activity of RelA, and therefore these constructs could be considered to act as transdominant negative mutants. A deletion construct that was no longer able to dimerize with wild type RelA did not influence this repressive activity (RelA 1–551Δ22–248). To verify that the transdominant mutants indeed dimerized with RelA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. Therefore RelA and the transdominant mutants were overexpressed in 293 cells, and their ability to form heterodimers was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 B, heterodimer formation could be observed between RelA 1–551 and the mutants, resulting in either the formation of a complex with intermediate mobility in the case of RelA 1–431 (lane 4) and RelA 1–305 (lane 6), or resulting in a decrease in DNA binding of wild type RelA when RelAE39I was co-transfected (lane 8). Coexpression of RelA 1–551Δ22–248 had no effect on the DNA binding of wild type RelA protein (lane 10). These results indicate that RelA deletion mutants, which were not able to repress GR activity (but still able to dimerize), can act as transdominant negative inhibitors of repressive activity of the wild type RelA protein. As we showed (Fig. 2), there appeared to be cell type-specific differences in repressive activity of RelA in COS-1 cells and 293 cells, which were most pronounced in the case of RelA 1–521Δ443–476, RelA 1–431, and RelA 1–551E39I. However, the transactivation potential of these RelA mutants was identical in both cell types (Fig. 1 C). The difference in repressive activity between both cell types could be due to the presence of cell type-specific cofactors. Nuclear receptors have been described to inhibit or enhance transcription by recruiting specific coactivator or corepressor proteins to the transcription complex (20Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). These cofactors might also interfere with the cross-talk between GR and RelA. An important difference between COS-1 cells and 293 cells is that 293 cells contain E1A protein (28Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russel W.C. Nairu R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has previously been described that 13 S E1A was able to associate with the C-terminal part of RelA and to stimulate the transcriptional activity of RelA (29Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Städler H. Traenckner E.B.-M. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 4052-4063Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possible role of E1A in the transrepression potential of RelA. To study this, COS-1 cells and 293 cells were transiently transfected with a GRE reporter construct (2 μg), an expression construct for GR (100 ng) and expression vectors encoding RelA (500 ng) and 13 S E1A (1 μg) as indicated. Fig. 5 clearly demonstrates that cotransfection of 13 S E1A in COS-1 cells results in a decrease in repressive activity of RelA and RelA 1–521Δ443–476. This resembles the lower transrepression potential of RelA in 293 cells, in which cotransfection of 13 S E1A had no effect. Similar results were obtained when RelA 1–431 and RelA 1–551E39Iwere used (not shown). No effect was observed on the transcriptional activity of GR itself or on the repressive activity of RelA 1–305 (results not shown). Of the two known splice variants of E1A, only the 13 S form, and not 12 S E1A, was able to influence the transrepressive activity of RelA (data not shown). These results suggest that cofactors, such as 13 S E1A might be able to modify the negative cross-talk between GR and RelA. In this report, we demonstrate that both the RHD and the TADs of RelA are required for repression of GR activity in intact cells. Furthermore, a physical interaction between GR and RelA requires the presence of the RHD of RelA, which has already been shown to be sufficient for binding to estrogen receptor (16Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to AP-1 (12Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Since the DBD of GR is essential for repression of RelA activity (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this domain in GR may directly interact with the RHD of RelA. Both the DBD of GR and the RHD of RelA are essential for the mutual repression but not sufficient. In addition, the LBD of GR (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the TADs of RelA are required for the functional repression. Both AF-2 in the LBD of steroid receptors and the TADs of RelA are known to interact with cofactors, which inhibit or enhance their transcriptional activity (20Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 29Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Städler H. Traenckner E.B.-M. Baeuerle P.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Together with the fact that 13 S E1A is able to decrease the repressive activity of RelA, these findings suggest that cofactors might be involved in cross-talk between GR and RelA. Our data show a difference in the functional interaction between GR and RelA, requiring both the RHD and the TADs, and the physical interaction, requiring the RHD only. One possible explanation for this difference is that the RHD may bind to GR first and in this way facilitates subsequent binding of the TADs to GR. However, this explanation seems unlikely because our results suggest that not a specific part of the C terminus of RelA determines its ability to repress, but rather the length of the C terminus or the presence of a functional TAD. Therefore, an alternative model could be that the RHD accounts for the interaction with GR, whereas the C-terminal part of RelA interferes with transcriptional activation by GR. This could be attained by either masking the domain(s) in GR necessary for interaction with the basal transcription machinery and/or coactivators, or through binding of the TADs of RelA to these cofactors themselves. This latter model is in agreement with the findings of several groups that show that NF-κB1, lacking the C-terminal extension present in RelA, can interact in vitro with GR, estrogen receptor, and androgen receptor, but is, in contrast to RelA, not able to repress the transcriptional activity of these receptors (15Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24151-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We found that mutations in RelA leading to a loss of repressive activity, but still allowing protein dimerization, resulted in transdominant inhibition of the repressive activity of wild type RelA. These mutants dimerized with RelA in mobility shift assays, suggesting that interaction between the RelA mutants and wild type RelA results in a heterodimer, unable to repress GR activity. It remains unclear whether dimerization of RelA is required for the transrepression. The dominant negative effect of the RelA mutants could also be due to competition with wild type RelA for the interaction domain in GR, since both RelA 1–431 and RelA 1–305 were found to bind to GR in vitro. By using both 293 cells and COS-1 cells to study the repressive activity of RelA, it became clear that there were cell type-specific differences. Although the same pattern of repressive activity of the RelA mutants was observed in both cell types, generally the RelA constructs were more active in repression in COS-1 cells. Furthermore, some deletion constructs, which did not display any repressive activity in 293 cells, were still able to repress GR activity in COS-1 cells. This could be due to a differential regulation of IκBα in these cells. Besides complex formation between GR and RelA, resulting in the mutual repression, a second mechanism has been proposed in which glucocorticoids induce IκBα synthesis and thereby inhibit NF-κB activity (31Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 32Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of IκBα by dexamethasone in 293 cells could therefore result in an inhibition of RelA translocating to the nucleus and in this way decrease the ability of RelA to repress GR activity. However, Western blot analysis showed no up-regulation of IκBα protein after transfection with an expression vector for GR and treatment with dexamethasone in both COS-1 cells and 293 cells. 2S. Wissink, E. C. van Heerde, B. van der Burg, and P. T. van der Saag, unpublished data. Therefore, differential regulation of IκBα seems not to account for the differences observed between the two cell lines. Recently it has been reported that inhibition of AP-1 activity by GR in HeLa cells is mediated by competition for limiting amounts of CREB-binding protein or p300, which serve as coactivators for both GR and AP-1 transcriptional activity (33Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). The fact that the TADs are required for the repression function of RelA could also indicate a role for cell type-specific coactivators in the negative cross-talk between GR and RelA. However, we have been unable to observe an effect of cotransfection of CREB-binding protein or p300 on RelA transcriptional activity or on the cross-talk between GR and RelA in COS-1 cells and 293 cells.2 In addition, RelA has been shown to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery, such as TFIIB and TATA-binding protein, and some cofactors have been described to enhance the transcriptional activity of RelA, such as PC1 (30Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and E1A (29Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Städler H. Traenckner E.B.-M. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 4052-4063Crossref Google Scholar). E1A is expressed in 293 cells (28Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russel W.C. Nairu R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) and not in COS-1 cells, possibly explaining some of the differences in repressive activity of RelA in these cells. Our data show that cotransfection of 13 S E1A and not 12 S E1A in COS-1 cells results in a decrease in repressive activity of RelA, thus resembling the repression potential of RelA in 293 cells. Possibly, 13 S E1A interferes with the transrepressive activity of RelA via binding to RelA and thereby preventing interaction of RelA with GR or coactivators for GR. It has been described previously that 13 S E1A but not 12 S E1A activates NF-κB and interacts with RelA at the C terminus (29Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Städler H. Traenckner E.B.-M. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 4052-4063Crossref Google Scholar). In conclusion, it seems likely that some of the many coregulatory proteins, which function between transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery and among transcription factors of distinct families, may influence the effectiveness of the interaction between GR and NF-κB. However, the fact that this response occurs in many different cell types (13Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S.

Between the T-Ag CKII and Cdc2 sites is a site (Ser120) for the double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase (dsDNA-PK), which we show here for the first time to play a role in regulating T-Ag nuclear import. We replaced Ser120 by aspartic acid or alanine using site-directed mutagenesis and assessed the effects on nuclear transport kinetics both in vivo (microinjected cells) and in vitro (mechanically perforated cells) in HTC rat hepatoma cells. Maximal nuclear accumulation of the Asp120 and Ala120 protein derivatives was approximately 40% and 70% reduced in vivo, respectively, compared with that of the wild type protein, and similarly reducedin vitro, although to a lesser extent. This implies that the dsDNA-PK site regulates the maximal level of nuclear accumulation, normally functioning to enhance T-Ag nuclear transport; the higher accumulation of the Asp120 protein compared with the Ala120 protein indicates that negative charge at the dsDNA-PK site is mechanistically important in regulating nuclear import. The Asp120 protein accumulated in the nucleus at a faster rate than the wild type protein, implying that phosphorylation at Ser120 may also regulate the nuclear import rate. CKII phosphorylation of the Asp120 protein in cytosol or by purified CKII was approximately 30% higher than that of the Ser120 and Ala120 proteins, while negative charge at the CKII site increased dsDNA-PK phosphorylation of Ser120 by approximately 80% compared with wild type, implying physical and functional interactions between the two phosphorylation sites. Quantitation of NLS recognition by the importin 58/97 subunits using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that while the Ala120 protein derivative had a binding affinity very similar to that of wild type, the Asp120derivative showed 40% higher affinity. In vitro CKII phosphorylation increased importin binding by about 30% in all cases. These results imply that negative charge at the dsDNA-PK site may enhance nuclear import through increasing both NLS recognition by importin subunits, and phosphorylation at the CKII site, which itself also facilitates NLS recognition by importin 58/97.

In this process, importin 58 specifically binds NLSs while importin 97 recognizes the importin 58 subunit, as well as having affinity for particular nuclear pore complex components (9Kraemer D.M.

The final step of nuclear import may involve some sort of feedback loop, which regulates the maximal level of nuclear accumulation (see Ref. 16Seydel U. Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein import is known to be precisely regulated, with phosphorylation as one of the major mechanisms by which this is brought about (17Jans D.A. Biochem.

While enormous progress has been made in the last 2–3 years in terms of characterizing both the steps and factors involved in nuclear import (see Refs. 17Jans D.A. Biochem.

We have shown previously that nuclear import of simian virus SV40 large tumor antigen (T-Ag) β-galactosidase fusion proteins is regulated by the CcN motif (19Jans D.A. Ackermann M. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J.

The mechanistic basis of the CKII-site enhancement of T-Ag fusion protein import appears to be through phosphorylation increasing the affinity of interaction of the T-Ag NLS with importin 58/97 (see Ref. 22Hübner S. Xiao C.-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), while indirect evidence suggests that Cdc2 site phosphorylation may increase T-Ag affinity for a cytoplasmic anchor or inhibitor protein (see Ref.19Jans D.A. Ackermann M. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is a phosphorylation site for the double-stranded DNA dependent protein kinase (dsDNA-PK) at Ser120 (23Chen Y.-R. Lees-Miller S.P. Tegtmeyer P. Anderson C.W. J.

To assess whether the dsDNA-PK site of T-Ag regulates its nuclear import, we set out to replace Ser120 by either aspartic acid or alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. Nuclear import measurements of the mutant derivatives both in vivo and in vitro indicate for the first time that Ser120 is important for maximal nuclear accumulation, as well as affecting the nuclear import rate. The basis of this appears to be due to Ser120 modulating T-Ag NLS recognition by the importin 58/97 dimer. Significantly, the CKII and dsDNA-PK phosphorylation sites appear to interact at the level of both phosphorylation and enhancement of T-Ag nuclear import, and we propose a model where the sites are in close proximity to one another and participate directly in binding to importin. Since many nuclear proteins contain dsDNA-PK sites in the vicinity of their NLSs, the dsDNA-PK may have a more general role in modulating nuclear protein import.

In the case of fusion proteins, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was quantitated, subsequent to SDS-gel electrophoresis, using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, whereby exposure values were converted to absolute values through identical analysis of in vitro phosphorylated samples of predetermined stoichiometry of phosphorylation (40Jans D.A.

Whereas CKII peptide phosphorylation was exclusively cytosolic (16.7 units/mg), a low but significant level of dsDNA-PK peptide phosphorylation activity was found in HTC cytosol (4.7 units/mg), about 14% of that found in nuclear extracts (34.3 units/mg). Cdc2 peptide (Pro-Lys-Thr-Pro-Lys-Lys-Ala-Lys-Lys-Leu; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) phosphorylating activity was exclusively nuclear (15.4 units/mg) in HTC extracts. An ELISA-based binding assay was used to examine the binding affinity between importin subunits (mouse importin 58/97-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, expressed as described; Refs. 5Imamoto N.

Xiao C.-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, T-Ag fusion proteins were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates, blocked with BSA, hybridized with various dilutions of precomplexed importin 58/97 (the latter as a GST fusion protein), and then successive incubations carried out with goat anti-GST primary (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and alkaline phosphatase-coupled rabbit anti-goat secondary (Sigma) antibodies. Quantitation was performed using the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), and the change of absorbance at 405 nm followed using a plate reader (Molecular Devices), with values corrected by subtracting both the absorbance at 0 min, and the absorbance in wells incubated without importin 58/97·GST complex. To correct for differences in coating, T-Ag fusion proteins were subjected to a parallel β-galactosidase ELISA assay (22Hübner S. Xiao C.-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) using a β-galactosidase specific monoclonal antibody (Promega) together with an anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody andp-nitrophenyl phosphate. As above, values were corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 0 min. Measurements for importin binding were ultimately corrected for any differences in coating efficiencies quantified in the β-galactosidase-based ELISA assay, to enable a true estimate of bound importin to be made. To assess the role of the dsDNA-PK phosphorylation site (Ser120) between the CcN motif CKII and cdk sites in nuclear protein import, site-directed mutagenesis of existing T-Ag fusion protein expression plasmid constructs was performed to substitute Ser120 by either alanine or aspartic acid (see “Materials and Methods” for construct details; see Fig. 1 for sequence details). Phosphorylation of the proteins was tested using purified dsDNA-PK from HeLa nuclear extracts. In contrast to the Ala120 and Asp120 fusion protein derivatives, those containing an intact Ser120 were phosphorylated to a marked extent, implying that phosphorylation by dsDNA-PK was specific to Ser120 (Fig. 2, and data not shown). Interestingly, the DcN-β-Gal (Ser120) protein, which contains aspartic acid in place of Ser112and hence possesses negative charge at the CKII site (see Fig. 1), exhibited about 75% increased phosphorylation by dsDNA-PK compared with the wild type protein CcN-β-Gal (Ser120) (Fig. 2). Increased dsDNA-PK phosphorylation was also exhibited by a protein containing aspartic acid at position 111 (data not shown), supporting the idea that negative charge at the CKII site enhanced phosphorylation of Ser120. Like both CcN-β-Gal (Ala120) and CcN-β-Gal (Asp120), T-Ag fusion protein CN-β-Gal (Ala120), which lacks Ser120 (as well as Ser123-Thr124 of the Cdc2 site; Ref. 21Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), was phosphorylated to a negligible extent by dsDNA-PK (data not shown). The kinetics of nuclear import of the Asp120 and Ala120 T-Ag CcN-β-Gal fusion protein derivatives were compared with those of the wild type CcN-β-Gal (Ser120) protein both in vivo and in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4; Table I). The maximal nuclear accumulation of the Asp120 and Ala120 proteins was about 60 and 30% that of wild type, respectively, in vivo, and was also reduced in vitro (by 30 and 40%, respectively, relative to wild type; see Fig. 4 and Table I). The transport rate of the Asp120 protein was between 2 and 2.5 times faster than that of the wild type CcN-β-Gal T-Ag fusion protein (Ser120) (see Table I). The dsDNA-PK site thus appeared to enhance T-Ag nuclear import, affecting both the maximal level and rate of nuclear accumulation.Table INuclear import kinetics and importin 58/97 binding affinities of SV40 T-Ag fusion proteins with mutations at the dsDNA-PK siteFusion protein1-aThe T-Ag β-galactosidase fusion protein sequences are shown in Fig. 1.Nuclear import parameter1-bRaw data (see Fig. 4, and data not shown) were fitted for the function Fn/c (t) = Fn/cmax × (1 − e −kt ) (19, 22, 42), where tis time in minutes.

Human RB possesses a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) consisting of two clusters of basic amino acids within amino acids 860–877, also present in mouse and Xenopushomologs, which resembles that of nucleoplasmin. The T-ag NLS represents a different type of NLS, consisting of only one stretch of basic amino acids. To compare the nuclear import kinetics conferred by the bipartite NLS of RB to those conferred by the T-ag NLS, we used β-galactosidase fusion proteins containing the NLSs of either RB or T-ag. The RB NLS was able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus both in vivo (in microinjected cells of the HTC rat hepatoma line) and in vitro (in mechanically perforated HTC cells). Mutational substitution of the proximal basic residues of the NLS abolished nuclear targeting activity, confirming its bipartite character. Nuclear accumulation of the RB fusion protein was half-maximal within about 8 min in vivo, maximal levels being between 3–4-fold those in the cytoplasm, which was less than 50% of the maximal levels attained by the T-ag fusion protein, while the initial rate of nuclear import of the RB protein was also less than half that of T-ag. Nuclear import conferred by both NLSs in vitro was dependent on cytosol and ATP and inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS. Using an ELISA-based binding assay, we determined that the RB bipartite NLS had severely reduced affinity, compared with the T-ag NLS, for the high affinity heterodimeric NLS-binding protein complex importin 58/97, this difference presumably representing the basis of the reduced maximal nuclear accumulation and import rate in vivo. The results support the hypothesis that the affinity of NLS recognition by NLS-binding proteins is critical in determining the kinetics of nuclear protein import.

We were interested in the nuclear import kinetics of tumor suppressor proteins, one of which is the retinoblastoma protein (p110Rb or RB). RB is frequently altered or deleted in a number of tumors and tumor cell lines, including those derived from retinoblastomas, osteosarcomas, breast cancers and prostate, bladder, and small lung carcinomas (20Goodrich D.W.

Human RB contains a bipartite NLS (amino acids 860–877), conserved in mammalian and amphibian RB proteins (Refs. 22Destree O.H.J. Lam K.T. Peterson-Maduro L.J. Eizema K. Diller L.

Open table in a new tab This study examines the nuclear import kinetics of fusion proteins carrying the RB NLS in vivo and in vitro at the single cell level and compares results to those for proteins carrying the T-ag NLS. We assess the dependence of nuclear import on cytosolic factors, ATP, and GTPase activity and use an ELISA-based binding assay to determine the binding affinity for the NLS-binding heterodimeric protein complex importin 58/97. We find that the bipartite NLS of RB is much less efficient than the T-ag NLS in terms of both the maximal level and rate of nuclear import, as well as exhibiting a much lower affinity for importin. The results are consistent with the tenet that the affinity of NLS binding by importin is critical in determining the kinetics of nuclear protein import.

Plasmids expressing the RB-Bip-β-galactosidase (RB-Bip-β-Gal) and RB-BipMut-β-galactosidase (RB-BipMut-β-Gal) fusion proteins were derived by oligonucleotide insertion into the SmaI restriction endonuclease site of the plasmid vector pPR2 (28Rihs H.-P.

The resultant fusion proteins express RB amino acids 860–877 fused NH2-terminal to the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase enzyme sequence (amino acids 9–1023), where RB-Bip-β-Gal retains the wild type sequence, and the NLS mutated derivative RB-BipMut-β-Gal possesses Thr-Thr in place of the wild type amino acids Lys-Arg861. The T-ag β-galactosidase fusion protein (T-ag-CcN-β-Gal) used in the comparative studies contains T-ag amino acids 111–135, including the CcN motif (comprising protein kinase CK2 and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites and the NLS) fused amino-terminal to β-galactosidase amino acids 9–1023 (31Jans D.A.

Nuclear accumulation was also examined in vitro in the presence of a 110 volume of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.0) containing 10% glycerol and 0.25% CHAPS, which results in permeabilization of the nuclear envelope; accumulation under these conditions only results from binding to nuclear components such as lamins, chromatin, etc. An ELISA-based binding assay was used to examine the binding affinity between importin subunits (mouse importin 58 and 97 glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins expressed as described (8Imamoto N.

Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with β-galactosidase fusion proteins, blocked with bovine serum albumin, hybridized with increasing concentrations of importin 58-GST or precomplexed importin 58/97-GST and then successive incubations carried out with goat anti-GST primary, and alkaline phosphatase-coupled rabbit anti-goat secondary, antibodies. After the addition of the substratep-nitrophenyl phosphate, A405 was measured at 5-min intervals for 90 min using a plate reader (Molecular Devices). Values were corrected by subtracting bothA405 at 0 min and A405 in wells incubated without importin 58/97-GST complex. To assess importin binding specifically to the NLSs, quantitation was performed in identical fashion for β-galactosidase itself and the values subtracted from those for the respective fusion proteins (30Hübner S. Xiao C.-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in coating, the RB and T-ag fusion proteins were subjected to a parallel β-galactosidase ELISA assay using a β-galactosidase-specific monoclonal antibody together with an anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody andp-nitrophenyl phosphate (30Hübner S. Xiao C.-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As above, values were corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 0 min. Measurements for importin binding were ultimately corrected for any differences in coating efficiencies quantified in the β-galactosidase ELISA, to enable a true estimate of bound importin to be made (30Hübner S. Xiao C.-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins denatured through preincubation for 10 min at 65 °C were found to exhibit greatly reduced reactivity in the β-galactosidase ELISA, as well as an over 100-fold increase in the value of theKD (apparent affinity constant). Human RB contains a consensus bipartite NLS that is conserved in X. laevis and mouse RB (see Table I and Refs. 22Destree O.H.J. Lam K.T. Peterson-Maduro L.J. Eizema K. Diller L.

To test whether this sequence in human RB is functional, β-galactosidase fusion proteins were derived containing either the wild type human RB NLS (amino acids 860–877, RB-Bip-β-Gal) or a mutated version (RB-BipMut-β-Gal) in which lysine 860 and arginine 861 were substituted by threonine residues. This mutation abolishes the bipartite character of the NLS; similar mutations abolish the nuclear targeting activity of bipartite NLSs such as those of nucleoplasmin (24Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), and the yeast transcription factor SWI5 (26Jans D.A. Moll T. Nasmyth K. Jans P. J. Biol.

The human RB NLS was capable of targeting the heterologous E. coli protein β-galactosidase (476 kDa) to the nucleus in both assay systems (Figs. 1 and2). RB-Bip-β-Gal accumulated in nuclei maximally to levels 3–4 fold those in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B and 2B; Table II). Results were similar to those for β-galactosidase fusion proteins containing the bipartite NLSs from SWI5 (26Jans D.A. Moll T. Nasmyth K. Jans P. J. Biol.

The initial nuclear import rate of the RB-Bip-β-Gal in vivo was also significantly less (p < 0.0005) than that of T-ag-CcN-β-Gal (rates of 0.49 and 1.12 Fn/c/min, respectively, (where Fn/c is defined as the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence after the subtraction of fluorescence due to autofluorescence; see Table II), supporting the idea that the T-ag NLS is more efficient than the bipartite NLS of RB. The RB-BipMut-β-Gal protein was completely excluded from the nucleus bothin vivo and in vitro(Fn/cmax of about 0.5; Figs. 1 and 2 B, left panel; Table II), even up to 12 h in vivo(not shown), where fusion protein localization was scored using a histochemical stain for β-galactosidase activity in situ(32Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).

We have utilized this system to characterize the interactions of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin and its substrate, ATP. In the presence of Gsα, adenylyl cyclase is activated in response to occupation of only one forskolin-binding site. A single binding site for forskolin was identified by equilibrium dialysis; itsKd (0.1 μm) corresponds to the EC50 for enzyme activation. The affinity of forskolin for adenylyl cyclase is greatly reduced in the absence of Gsα(∼40 μm). Binding of forskolin to the individual cytoplasmic domains of the enzyme was not detected. A single binding site for the ATP analog, α,β-methylene ATP (Ap(CH2)pp), was also detected by equilibrium dialysis. Such binding was not observed with the individual domains. Binding of Ap(CH2)pp was unaffected by P-site inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase. A modified P-loop sequence located near the carboxyl terminus of adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in ATP binding. Mutation of the conserved, non-glycine residues within this region caused no significant changes in the Km for ATP or the Ki for Ap(CH2)pp. It thus seems unlikely that this region is part of the active site. However, a mutation in the C1 domain (E518A) causes a 10-fold decrease in the binding affinity for Ap(CH2)pp. This residue and the active site of the enzyme may lie at the interface between the two cytosolic domains.

Mammalian adenylyl cyclases have a characteristic membrane-bound topology, consisting of a short, intracellular amino terminus, followed by a set of six transmembrane spans, a large (∼40 kDa) cytoplasmic domain (designated C1), a second set of six transmembrane spans, and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (C2), which is homologous to C1 (1Krupinski J.

However, very little direct structural information has been available until recently, and there is no knowledge of the number and nature of catalytic sites, as well as those for a plethora of activators and inhibitors. The elimination of several of the proteins' domains, including the amino terminus and the transmembrane spans, has permitted expression of a soluble version of mammalian adenylyl cyclase (3Tang W.-J.

All mammalian adenylyl cyclases are activated by forskolin, a naturally occurring diterpene (8Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Forskolin binds to several intrinsic membrane proteins, including adenylyl cyclases, glucose transporters, voltage-gated K+ channels, ligand-gated ion channels, and P glycoproteins (9Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). It was believed that this hydrophobic molecule bound in or near the membrane spans, as it appears to do with P glycoproteins and glucose transporters (10Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G.

However, construction and expression of the soluble mammalian adenylyl cyclase mentioned above permitted unequivocal demonstration that the capacity of this enzyme to be activated by forskolin resides within its cytoplasmic domains. Although there is no evidence that a forskolin-like molecule plays a physiological role in regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, investigation of its interactions with the enzyme will contribute to comprehension of mechanisms of stimulation and synergistic regulation of catalytic activity. To date, we know that forskolin increases the apparent affinity of the C1 and C2 domains of adenylyl cyclase for each other and promotes much more efficient catalysis as a result of this protein-protein interaction; the same can be said of Gsα (5Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol.

Devoid of any traditional P-loop or Walker motifs (1Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G.

EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar), the number and location of catalytic sites in the molecule are unknown, although its tandemly duplicated structure provides grounds for speculation. To date, we have demonstrated, not surprisingly, that only one molecule of ATP is consumed during the synthesis of one molecule of cyclic AMP and one molecule of pyrophosphate (4Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16967-16974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, all mammalian adenylyl cyclases are inhibited by adenosine and certain analogs thereof (13Londos C. Preston M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5957-5961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Johnson R.A. Saur W. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

The mechanism and location of this inhibitory site (the so-called P site) and its relationship to the substrate-binding site are also unknown. We are now able to characterize the interactions of both forskolin and a nonsubstrate analog of ATP (Ap(CH2)pp) with the cytosolic, catalytic domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclase in a reasonably rigorous and quantitative manner. The results of these studies are described below, as are analyses of mutants that provide insight into the location of the catalytic site. [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol), [12-3H]forskolin (31 Ci/mmol), and Ap(CH2)pp (20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All tritiated compounds were lyophilized regularly to remove [3H]H2O. Unlabeled Ap(CH2)pp was purchased from ICN. Recombinant Gsα, IIC2, and VC1(591)Flag were purified fromEscherichia coli as described (5Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant Gsα was activated by incubation with 50 mmNaHepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 400 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 30 min. Free GTPγS was removed by gel filtration. GTPγS-activated Gsα was utilized in all experiments, and the active protein concentration was determined by quantification of GTPγS binding. Preparations of Gsα utilized for titrations (Figs. 1 and 2) were 90% active. Gsα was present in excess for other experiments and was typically 75% active.Figure 2Titration of VC1 with Gsα and forskolin. A, VC1 (2 μm), IIC2 (3 μm), and 6-O-[3′-piperidino)propionyl]forskolin (100 μm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of activated Gsα. Assays were performed at 4 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, VC1 (2 μm), IIC2 (3 μm), and Gsα (3 μm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of forskolin.

VC1 was subcloned by digestion of pQE60-H6-VC1(364–591)Flag (7Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Mutations of IIC2 residues Tyr-1054, Arg-1059, and Lys-1065 to alanine were created using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCAGACGCTTGGCGCCACGTGTACATGTC, 5′-CACGTGTACATGTGCAGGTATCATCAATGTG, and 5′-GGTATCATCAATGTGGCGGGGAAAGGGGAC, respectively. Mutation of VC1 residue Glu-518 to alanine was accomplished with the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCCAACCATATGGCAGCTGGAGGCAAG. Amino acids are designated according to their position in the full-length, membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases. The mutations R1059A and Y1054A of IIC2 were returned to the expression plasmid pQE60-IIC2H6 using the restriction sitesBsrGI and HindIII. Mutant K1065A was cloned with the restriction enzymes BstXI and HindIII. The mutation E518A of VC1 was placed in its appropriate expression vector with the restriction enzymes NcoI andHindIII. Each mutant cDNA was sequenced and expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE3). Assays were performed as described (17Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 10–15 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl, unless stated otherwise. The final concentrations of free MgCl2 and MnCl2 were 10 and 1.8 mm, respectively. Activities are expressed per milligrams of the limiting adenylyl cyclase domain in the assay (VC1 or IIC2). For determination of kinetic constants, MgATP or MnATP was varied from 20 μm to 2.56 mm with a fixed excess of Mg2+ or Mn2+. Titrations of Gsα or forskolin were performed using a high but limiting concentration of one cyclase domain (1.5–2 μm) and an excess of the second (2.9–3 μm). These assays were carried out at 4 °C (to slow catalysis at high protein concentrations) in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions in which Gsα was titrated contained 100 μm soluble form of forskolin, 6-O-[3′-(piperidino)propionyl]forskolin (Calbiochem), and serial dilutions of Gsα from 31 nm to 6 μm (final concentration). Reactions in which forskolin was titrated contained 3 μm Gsα and serial dilutions of forskolin as indicated, yielding a final concentration of 0.4% ethanol in the assay. Proteins and forskolin were first incubated for 6 min on ice before initiation of the reaction with 10 mm [α-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated after 5 min with 850 μl of stop solution containing 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 mm ATP, and 0.175 mm cyclic AMP. [32P]cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography on Dowex-50 and Al2O3; [3H]cAMP was added to monitor recovery of [32P]cAMP during purification. Equilibrium dialysis chambers were purchased from Hoeffer. Chambers (60 μl) were separated by dialysis membrane with a cutoff of 14 kDa. To examine forskolin binding, each chamber contained 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the indicated amount of [3H]forskolin (0.05–5 μm). One chamber contained all three proteins required for binding: 2 μm VC1, 4 μm IIC2, and 6 μm Gsα-GTPγS; the opposite chamber contained either buffer alone or only 5 μmIIC2 (or 4 μm VC1) and 6 μm GTPγS-Gsα to minimize the effects of any nonspecific binding. Similar results were obtained with both methods. For measurements in the absence of GTPγS-Gsα, one chamber contained 30 μm VC1 and 120 μm IIC2, while the opposite chamber contained either buffer alone or 120 μm IIC2. Samples were removed after dialysis for 24 h at 4 °C with rotation; duplicate 15-μl aliquots from each chamber were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Equilibrium dialysis reactions with the ligand Ap(CH2)pp contained 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 0.65 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm ascorbate, and the indicated amount of [3H]Ap(CH2)pp (1–40 μm). One chamber included 30 μm each of VC1, IIC2, and GTPγS-Gsα. Samples were processed as just described. To determine the number of binding sites for forskolin and substrate in a complex of VC1 and IIC2, it is essential to know the fraction of protein in each of the two preparations that is active,i.e. capable of forming a catalytically productive complex with its partner. We know that Gsα, VC1, and IIC2 form a complex containing one molecule of each protein (7Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the fraction of purified Gsα that is native is readily measured by assessing radioactive guanine nucleotide binding. We thus titrated mixtures of VC1 and IIC2 with Gsα or forskolin, observing the increase in activity caused by small incremental additions of activator. To obtain precise information, these experiments must be performed at concentrations well above the Kd for the interaction of the two domains of the enzyme and for the interaction of the activator with the enzyme. Thus, high concentrations of forskolin were included for titrations with Gsα and vice versa. Experiments were performed with either a very high concentration of VC1 in excess of a high concentration of IIC2 (1.5 μm) (Fig. 1); or with a very high concentration of IIC2 in excess of a high concentration of VC1(2 μm) (Fig. 2). Titrations with Gsα (with either IIC2 (Fig. 1 A) or VC1 (Fig. 2 A) limiting) indicated that 80 and 75% of the protein in the preparations of IIC2 and VC1, respectively, was functional. Titrations with forskolin, performed with the same protein mixtures and at the same time, demonstrated that essentially identical amounts of forskolin and Gsα were required to achieve maximal activity, indicating that only one molecule of forskolin is necessary for maximal enzyme activation (Figs. 1 B and2 B). We have quantified forskolin binding by equilibrium dialysis. Binding of the diterpene to either VC1 (40 μm) or IIC2 (120 μm) alone is not observed over the range of concentrations that could be explored (in the presence or absence of Gsα). Successful experiments were performed at limiting concentrations of one of the cyclase domains and excess concentrations of the second to ensure maximal formation of VC1/IIC2 heterodimers (Fig. 3, A and B). The concentrations of the adenylyl cyclase domains required for association in the presence of Gsα are relatively low (∼2–4 μm). Regardless of which domain was limiting, it is clear that 1 molecule of forskolin binds to a C1/C2heterodimer. The Kd for forskolin binding, 0.09 ± 0.03 μm (n = 6), is very similar to the EC50 for activation of the enzyme (0.1 μm) (7Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We were not successful in attempts to detect a second binding site for forskolin using much higher protein concentrations than those used in Fig. 3. We estimate that we would have observed a second site if its Kdwas below 60 μm. Quantification of forskolin binding in the absence of Gsαis problematic. The EC50 for activation of the enzyme is much greater (∼15 μm), and, more importantly, the apparent Kd of C1 for C2 is 10 μm or greater in the absence of activators. The observed binding is shown in Fig. 4. The estimated Kd (40 μm ± 20 μm, n = 6) compares reasonably (but not precisely) with the EC50 for activation of VC1/IIC2 in the absence of Gsα, 15 μm. However, saturation was not achieved because of the insolubility of forskolin. In addition, one cyclase domain (C2) was present at very high concentrations (120 μm) to drive the interactions, and the proteins are less stable in the absence of additional activators. The ATP analog Ap(CH2)pp is a competitive inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase and is not utilized by the enzyme as a substrate. The IC50 for Ap(CH2)pp is dependent on the divalent cation utilized. In the presence of Gsα and Mg2+, the Ki for Ap(CH2)pp is equal to the Km for ATP (320 μm). However, in the presence of Mn2+, the Kifor Ap(CH2)pp is 15 μm, roughly 10-fold lower than the Kmfor ATP under these conditions (Fig. 5; Table I). Similar phenomena are observed when forskolin is the activator (Table I). These observations do not appear to be due to simple structural differences between ATP and Ap(CH2)pp, since the Ki for Ap(CH2)pp is the same as the Km for ATP in the presence of Mg2+.Table ICompetitive inhibition by the substrate analog Ap(CH2)ppActivatorMg2+Mn2+KmATPVmaxAp(CH2)ppKiKmVmaxAp(CH2)ppKiμmμmol/min·mgμmμmμmol/min·mgμm10300.68902206.811Gsα315633351408015Forskolin8601109607218510The Ki for Ap(CH2)pp was determined as shown in Fig. 5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The concentrations of proteins utilized in the absence of an activator were 13–73 nm VC1 and 5 μm IIC2. Open table in a new tab The Ki for Ap(CH2)pp was determined as shown in Fig. 5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The concentrations of proteins utilized in the absence of an activator were 13–73 nm VC1 and 5 μm IIC2. Analysis of binding of [3H]Ap(CH2)pp to adenylyl cyclase by equilibrium dialysis in the presence of Gsα and Mn2+ revealed a single binding site per C1/C2 heterodimer with a Kdof 7 ± 0.5 μm (n = 3), similar to the value of Ki under these conditions (15 μm) (Fig. 6). There is no detectable binding of [3H]Ap(CH2)pp to either VC1 or IIC2 alone (data not shown). Adenylyl cyclases are inhibited by direct interactions with adenosine analogs known as P (purine)-site inhibitors. This phenomenon is curious kinetically, since inhibition of VC1/IIC2 is uncompetitive with respect to MgATP and noncompetitive with respect to MnATP. A potent P-site inhibitor, 2′-deoxy-3′-AMP, was tested for its capacity to disrupt binding of Ap(CH2)pp. Although theKi for 2′-deoxy-3′-AMP is 7 μm in the presence of Gsα and Mn2+, binding of [3H]Ap(CH2)pp was unaffected by 400 μm 2′-deoxy-3′-AMP (Fig. 6). This prototypical P-site inhibitor clearly does not compete for binding of ATP to the free enzyme or disrupt ATP binding in any capacity. Droste et al.(18Droste M. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) identified a 25-amino acid peptide near the carboxyl terminus of type I adenylyl cyclase (residues 1027–1051) that interacted with the photoaffinity probe [γ-32P]8-N3ATP. We have mutated each of the conserved, non-glycine residues within this region of IIC2 to alanine and measured the resultant effects on the Km for ATP, Vmax, andKi for Ap(CH2)pp in the presence of VC1 (Table II). All of the mutant proteins displayed synergistic activation in the presence of Gsα and forskolin, suggesting that there was no gross disruption of structure. The yields for two of the mutant proteins, K1065A and Y1054A, were poor, and they displayed greatly reduced activity. However, changes in Km andKi values were modest in the presence of Mg2+, and these values were normal with Mn2+. The yield of mutant R1059A was normal, as was itsVmax. Interestingly, its Kmfor ATP and Ki for Ap(CH2)pp were elevated 10- and 3-fold, respectively, with Mg2+, but these values were identical to those for the wild type protein in the presence of Mn2+. Equilibrium dialysis studies with this protein demonstrate a normal Kd for Ap(CH2)pp binding in the presence of Gsα and Mn2+. The only other conserved residue in this sequence is Lys-1067, which was previously mutated to alanine in type I adenylyl cyclase (19Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); there was no effect on Vmax orKm for ATP. It thus seems unlikely that this region is a component of the substrate binding site.Table IIMutagenesis of putative ATP-binding sitesMutationGsα/Mg2+Gsα/Mn2+KmATPVmaxAp(CH2)ppKiKmVmaxAp(CH2)ppKiμmμmol/min·mgμmμmμmol/min·mgμmWild type320603401408015IIC2-Y1054A75042-aThe activities of these proteins have been adjusted to reflect the amount of active enzyme in the preparations, based on forskolin binding by equilibrium dialysis.720110282-aThe activities of these proteins have been adjusted to reflect the amount of active enzyme in the preparations, based on forskolin binding by equilibrium dialysis.6IIC2-R1059A200060100015016011IIC2-K1065A120012-aThe activities of these proteins have been adjusted to reflect the amount of active enzyme in the preparations, based on forskolin binding by equilibrium dialysis.49012062-aThe activities of these proteins have been adjusted to reflect the amount of active enzyme in the preparations, based on forskolin binding by equilibrium dialysis.11VC1-E518A32000.720001900200190The mutants Y1054A and K1065A were assayed in the presence of excess (1 μm) VC1, and activities are thus expressed per mg of IIC2.

Amino acid residue Glu-432 of type I adenylyl cyclase (analogous to Glu-518 of VC1) was described previously as aKm mutant (19Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and provided the opportunity to see if its affinity for substrate is altered. The yield of the VC1-E518A mutant protein was reasonable, but it had low activity in the presence of Mg2+(Vmax = 0.7 μmol/min·mg). ItsKm for ATP and Ki for Ap(CH2)pp were elevated approximately 10-fold when Mg2+ was present (Table II). In the presence of Mn2+, Vmax was elevated more than 200-fold (compared with Mg2+) to exceed wild type values, while the Km and Ki remained abnormally high. This mutant protein is activated synergistically by Gsα and forskolin, and its affinity for Gsαis altered by no more than 2-fold. The apparent affinity of this mutant C1 domain for IIC2 is also only slightly altered (Fig. 7). This is an important point, since the newly described crystal structure of a IIC2 homodimer suggests that this residue lies at the interface between the two domains (20Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The interaction of forskolin with soluble complexes of the cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase has been demonstrated by two independent methods. In the presence of Gsα, only one forskolin molecule is required to activate the enzyme (Figs. 1 and 2) and only one binding site can be detected (Fig. 3); theKd for this site corresponds to the EC50for activation. Lower affinity sites were not detected at high concentrations of enzyme. In the absence of Gsα, forskolin binds to a low affinity site with a Kd of approximately 40 μm, a value that is somewhat higher than the EC50 for enzyme activation under these conditions (15 μm). Although these latter experiments were technically difficult, this discrepancy might suggest that the binding curve (Fig. 4) reflects a mixture of contributions from nonidentical sites. If true, the hypothetical second (lowest affinity) site has no apparent effect on enzymatic activity. Others have suggested the possibility of two binding sites for forskolin. Using membrane-bound type I adenylyl cyclase, Sutkowskiet al. (21Sutkowski E.M. Robbins J.D. Tang W.-J. Seamon K.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar) identified two apparent binding sites for an isothiocyanate derivative of the diterpene. The high affinity (300 nm) site appeared to be silent, in that covalent binding of the derivative to this site inhibited forskolin binding at concentrations significantly lower than those required to activate the enzyme. Occupation of a low affinity (10 μm) site caused a concentration-dependent loss of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (although other activators were not tested). It is notable that type I adenylyl cyclase is activated independently, not synergistically, by Gsα and forskolin. Zhang et al. (20Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) have recently solved the crystal structure of a homodimer of IIC2. This assembly includes two forskolin molecules bound at the interface between the monomers. It seems likely that the overall structure of the C2 homodimer will resemble that of a C1/C2 heterodimer. To us, the most straightforward model to rationalize these observations (for enzymes displaying synergistic activation by Gsα and forskolin) is that there exists a single binding site for forskolin that is responsible for enzyme activation. This site has relatively high affinity for the diterpene in the presence of Gsαand relatively low affinity for forskolin in the absence of Gsα. This does not preclude the existence of another very low affinity site that is not coupled to changes in catalytic activity. Such sites might well be filled during protein crystallization, performed at very high concentrations of protein (20 mg/ml) and forskolin (1 mm) (20Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation (again for enzymes that display synergy between forskolin and Gsα) is that we have observed two distinct forskolin-binding sites: a high affinity site that is occupied only in the presence of Gsα and a separate, low affinity site that is occupied only in its absence; occupation of either site activates the enzyme. The high affinity site observed by Sutkowskiet al. (21Sutkowski E.M. Robbins J.D. Tang W.-J. Seamon K.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar), which is not linked to changes in enzymatic activity, might be characteristic of enzymes that do not display synergistic activation by forskolin. This site may be quite distinct from those that regulate catalysis and/or may reflect binding properties of the complete, membrane-bound enzyme. The low affinity site on type I adenylyl cyclase resembles that observed on the soluble VC1-IIC2 complex in the absence of Gsα. The homologous nature of the C1 and C2 domains suggests the possibility of two nucleotide-binding sites, as occur in P glycoproteins (22Georges E. Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (23Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a single ATP-binding site may be wholly contained within one domain or shared by the two domains at their interface. If there is a multiplicity of catalytic sites, the pure hyperbolic nature of plots of reaction velocity versus ATP concentration demands their near identity and a lack of interaction between them. Using equilibrium dialysis and a non-substrate ATP analog, Ap(CH2)pp, we have identified a single ATP-binding site. The affinity of nucleotide for this site is greatly influenced by the metal cofactor, as shown by the large difference in theKi for Ap(CH2)pp in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+. Gsα and forskolin do not have substantial effects on the Ki for Ap(CH2)pp, suggesting that these activators do not influence substrate binding significantly. In the case of MnATP, theKm for ATP is only partially determined by substrate binding, as indicated by the difference between theKd for MnAp(CH2)pp and theKm for ATP; this difference is inapparent when Mg2+ replaces Mn2+. All mammalian adenylyl cyclases are inhibited directly by adenosine analogs known as P-site inhibitors (24Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), which display several unique features. Stimulated forms of the enzyme are substantially more sensitive to P-site inhibition than are nonactivated forms (13Londos C. Preston M.S. J. Biol.

Inhibition is dependent on metal and is characteristically uncompetitive or noncompetitive with respect to metal-ATP, depending on the activator and the metal (26Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large excess of a potent P-site inhibitor had no effect on either the amount of Ap(CH2)pp bound or its affinity, as measured by equilibrium dialysis (Fig. 6). This result provides important clues to the mechanism of P-site inhibition, suggesting that the inhibitor must either bind at an intermediate point along the reaction coordinate or to an entirely separate site on the enzyme that does not mediate its inhibitory effects via alterations of substrate binding. Florio (27Florio, V. A. (1983) Inhibition of the Catalytic Unit of Mammalian Adenylate Cyclase by Adenosine and Adenosine Analogs. Ph.D. thesis, University of Virginia.Google Scholar) and Florio and Ross (25Florio V.A. Ross E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar) suggested the possibility of dead-end inhibition through the formation of an adenylyl cyclase-pyrophosphate-inhibitor complex that would include both pyrophosphate and a P-site inhibitor at the active site. Johnson and Shoshani (26Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed a distinct binding site for P-site inhibitors in which both substrate and inhibitor are bound simultaneously (26Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both models are supported by a great deal of kinetic data, and there is no current means to distinguish between the two. Adenylyl cyclase lacks the conventional motif GXXXXGKS, characteristic of nucleotide-binding sites, called the phosphate-binding or P-loop (12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). However, an alternative sequence, G(X0–7)KG(X0–4)L(X0–5)S/T, is conserved in mammalian, bacterial, and yeast adenylyl cyclases (28Peterkofsky A. Reizer A. Reizer J. Gollop N. Zhu P.-P. Amin N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 25-amino acid peptide, located near the carboxyl terminus of type I adenylyl cyclase and overlapping with the modified consensus site, was identified as the labeling site for the photoactivatable ATP analog, [γ-32P]8-N3ATP (18Droste M. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have mutated each of the conserved, non-glycine amino acid residues within the peptide region; none of these proteins exhibits any appreciable difference in its Km for ATP or its Ki for Ap(CH2)pp. Mutation of the key lysine residue in the P-loop of p21 ras or adenylate kinase leads to a reduction in substrate binding of 100- or 20-fold, respectively, along with variable decreases in kcat (29Reinstein J. Brune M. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4712-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Temeles G.L. Wolanski B.S. Socher S.H. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It thus seems unlikely that Lys-1065 (or Lys-1067, examined in Ref. 19Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) plays a role in substrate binding. Although no change in binding was observed, there was an appreciable change in Vmax for 2 of these mutants (Y1054A and K1065A). Levin and Reed (31Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) identified this region as necessary for regulation of activity by protein kinase C. Mutation of this regulatory region may thus change catalytic activity. Since neither isolated cytosolic domain of adenylyl cyclase can bind Ap(CH2)pp, the interface of these two molecules is a logical spot for the active site. However, identification of this site has been difficult, and few Km mutants of adenylyl cyclase have been identified. Of the 19 conserved residues that have been mutated to produce adenylyl cyclases that retain catalytic activity (Refs. 19Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 20Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, and this study), only 2 show any significant change in Km when assayed in the presence of Mn2+. One of these (E518A of type V) is located in the C1 domain and has a 10-fold reduction in itsKm for ATP. We have shown that this reduction inKm is reflected in a reduction of substrate binding. Assuming a similar fold for both C1 and C2, Glu-518 is located near the interface of the two domains (20Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The altered residue in the only other Km mutant of adenylyl cyclase that has been identified (K923A in type I) and several other residues that are essential for catalysis are located in the C2 domain but also at the interface between C1and C2 (19Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, the nucleotide-binding motif of adenylyl cyclase appears to differ greatly from the traditional motifs of G proteins, kinases, and other ATP-requiring enzymes. We presume that residues lining the interface between the two domains contribute to binding and catalysis. This arrangement may permit optimal linkage of small changes in conformation to large changes in catalytic activity. We thank Jeff Laidlaw for excellent technical assistance and Arnold E. Ruoho for providing information about the structure of the IIC2 homodimer prior to publication."
https://openalex.org/W1976068877,"In all forms of cutaneous wounds, collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)) is invariably expressed by basal keratinocytes migrating over the dermal matrix. We report that native type I collagen mediates induction of MMP-1 by primary human keratinocytes. Collagen-mediated induction of MMP-1 was rapid, being detected 2 h after plating, and was transcriptionally regulated. As demonstrated by in situ hybridization, only migrating keratinocytes expressed MMP-1, suggesting that contact with collagen is not sufficient to induce MMP-1 expression in keratinocytes; the cells must also be migrating. Upon denaturation, type I collagen lost its ability to induce MMP-1 expression but still supported cell adhesion. Other dermal or wound matrix proteins, such as type III collagen, fibrin, and fibronectin, and a mixture of basement membrane proteins did not induce MMP-1 production. In the presence of collagen, laminin-1 inhibited induction of MMP-1 but laminin-5 did not. Taken together, these observations suggest that as basal keratinocytes migrate from the basal lamina onto the dermal matrix contact with native type I collagen induces MMP-1 expression. In addition, our findings suggest that re-establishment of the basement membrane and, in particular, contact with laminin-1 provides a potent signal to down-regulate MMP-1 production as the epithelium is repaired.

In addition, our findings suggest that re-establishment of the basement membrane and, in particular, contact with laminin-1 provides a potent signal to down-regulate MMP-1 production as the epithelium is repaired. Normal cutaneous wound healing, as well as healing in essentially all tissues, involves an orderly progression of events to re-establish the integrity of the injured tissue. The initial injury starts a programmed series of interdependent yet functionally separate responses, such as re-epithelialization and epithelial proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, matrix accumulation, and eventually resolution. During each stage in this process, proteinases are needed to remove or remodel extracellular matrix components in both the epithelial and interstitial compartments to accommodate cell migration and tissue repair (1Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed.

In all, we have examined >100 different human skin specimens, representing a variety of chronic ulcers, blisters, and normally healing wounds, and in each sample with injury that breached the basement membrane, collagenase-1 was prominently and invariantly expressed by basal keratinocytes migrating over the dermal wound bed. The invariable expression of collagenase-1 in all forms of wounds and the confinement of its expression to periods of active re-epithelialization suggest that this enzyme plays a critical role in keratinocyte function during healing. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that keratinocyte migration on a native collagen matrix requires the catalytic activity of collagenase-1 (5Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the factors and events in a wound environment which control collagenase-1 expression will aid our understanding of fundamental processes of tissue repair.The precise, spatially confined expression of collagenase-1 by migrating keratinocytes in vivo suggests that altered cell:matrix interactions, which are established as cells migrate off the basement membrane, induce enzyme expression. Indeed, collagenase-1 is only expressed by keratinocytes that are not in contact with an intact basement membrane (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J.

Dermatol. 1996; 135: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of collagenase-1 is shut off once re-epithelialization is complete and the basement membrane is restored (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 6Inoue M. Kratz G. Haegerstrand A. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. J. Invest.

These in vivo findings suggest that altered cell:matrix interactions, which form as cells move from the basement membrane onto the dermal and provisional matrices and back onto the basement membrane at the completion of re-epithelialization, regulate the site-specific expression of collagenase-1 in keratinocytes.In this report, we show that native fibrillar type I collagen is a principal, if not the main, stimulus initiating collagenase-1 production. Many other molecules that migrating keratinocytes could encounter in a wound setting, such as fibrin, fibronectin, or type III collagen, did not affect collagenase-1 production. In addition, we show that laminin-1 effectively inhibits collagen-mediated collagenase-1 expression, suggesting that renewed contact with this basement membrane component provides a signal to cease collagenase-1 expression and halt keratinocyte migration. Our findings support the idea that distinct cell:matrix interactions regulate keratinocyte behavior at different stages of repair.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that contact with native type I collagen induces collagenase-1 expression in migrating keratinocytes. These findings suggest that altered cell:matrix interactions regulate the invariable and prominent expression of collagenase-1 by basal keratinocytes seen during active stages of re-epithelialization in all human wounds with a breached basement membrane. In addition, we show that matrix-mediated regulation of collagenase-1 is dependent on the native, triple helical conformation of type I collagen. Although collagen that had been denatured, solubilized, or enzymatically degraded supported cell attachment, these non-triple helical substrates did not induce or stimulate collagenase-1 expression in keratinocytes. In addition, type III collagen, which is structurally similar to type I collagen, did not induce collagenase-1 expression (Table I). Together these findings suggest that cell contact with type I collagen, the most abundant protein in the dermis, comprising greater than 70% of its dry weight (19Uitto J. Olsen D.R. Fazio M.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 61s-77sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), provides a critical and specific determinant regulating collagenase-1 production by keratinocytes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that re-establishment of the basement membrane and cell:cell contacts at the completion of wound closure mediates down-regulation of collagenase-1 expression. Thus, contact with specific components of different matrix compartments mediate functionally distinct cellular activities.Three key in vivo observations support the idea that altered cell:matrix interactions regulate the spatially precise pattern of collagenase-1 production in migrating keratinocytes during wound repair. One, as we (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin.

Two, collagenase-1 is not expressed by basal keratinocytes in nonulcerative pyogenic granuloma or in blisters, such as bullous pemphigoid, which separate above basement membrane, but this MMP is expressed by migrating keratinocytes in blisters that form below the basement membrane, such as in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O.

Res. 1996; 75: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), collagenase-1 expression ceases once re-epithelialization is completed and a basement membrane has re-formed. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that keratinocytes acquire a collagenolytic phenotype upon contact with the dermal matrix, and the data we provide here indicate that native type I collagen is the inductive molecule in the dermis that controls this response. Furthermore, this induction is specific for collagenase-1. Although keratinocytes also produce 92-kDa gelatinase, stromelysin-1, and stromelysin-2, we have not detected any changes in expression of these MMPs mediated solely by matrix (21Dunsmore S.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24576-24582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The type I collagen-binding receptor, α2β1, is constitutively expressed on keratinocytes (22Hertle M.K. Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1991; 112: 193-206PubMed Google Scholar, 23Symington B.E. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and as we reported recently, this integrin transduces collagen-mediated induction of collagenase-1 (5Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Similarly, collagen stimulates collagenase-1 expression in fibroblasts via ligand binding to α2β1 (24Riikonen T. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Broberg A. Kähäri V.-M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although basal keratinocytes also express α1β1 and α3β1, keratinocytes preferentially use α2β1 to bind to type I collagen (26Lange T.S. Bielinsky A.K. Kirchberg K. Bank I. Herrmann K. Krieg T. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The interaction of keratinocytes with the dermal matrix, and in particular with type I collagen, may provide an early and critical signal to initiate the epithelial response to wounding. Because the epidermis is not normally in contact with type I collagen, it is tempting to speculate that the basal production of α2β1 keeps keratinocytes primed and ready to respond to injury.Earlier studies by Woodley and associates showed that keratinocytes on nonviable dermis produce collagenolytic enzymes (27Woodley D.T. Kalebec T. Baines A.J. Link W. Prunieras M. Liotta L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 4: 418-423Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that contact with type I collagen enhances basal production of this activity (28Petersen M.J. Woodley D.T. Stricklin G.P. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 341-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although seemingly similar, there are notable differences between their and our experimental conditions that impact on our respective findings. Whereas we grew keratinocytes in high Ca2+ medium, which promotes differentiation and duplicates the subpopulations of keratinocytes seen in vivo (Fig. 1), Petersen et al. (29Petersen M.J. Woodley D.T. Stricklin G.P. O'Keefe E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used low Ca2+ medium which maintains the keratinocytes in a basal phenotype (30Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, this change in culture conditions may lead to changes in cell behavior and responsiveness. Indeed, Petersen et al. (31Petersen M.J. Woodley D.T. Stricklin G.P. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 156-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that keratinocytes grown in low Ca2+ medium constitutively expressed collagenase-1, whereas, as we show here, collagenase-1 is induced in keratinocytes in high Ca2+ medium only if plated on the appropriate substratum.In addition to native type I collagen, contact with vitronectin and type IV collagen also mediated induction of collagenase-1 in keratinocytes (Table I). The wound bed is rich in vitronectin (32Yamada K.M. Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 51-94Google Scholar), and contact with this serum glycoprotein may provide an additional matrix-derived signal that can regulate keratinocyte behavior during wound healing. However, the vitronectin receptor, αvβ5, is not present in intact skin but is expressed in migrating basal cells in response to injury (33Juhasz I. Murphey G.F. Yan H.-C. Herlyn M. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1458-1469PubMed Google Scholar) but is apparently activated in isolated keratinocytes (34Yamada K.M. Gailit J. Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 311-338Google Scholar). Thus, this matrix protein is likely not involved in rapid induction of collagenase-1 after wounding but may play a role in maintaining the collagenolytic phenotype of migrating keratinocytes. The wound environment is also rich in fibrin and fibronectin, but primary keratinocytes did not attach to these substrates (Table I). These findings were not surprising. Grinnell and co-workers demonstrated that keratinocytes freshly isolated from skin do not adhere to fibronectin (35Guo M. Kim L.T. Akiyama S.K. Gralnick H.R. Yamada K.M. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and keratinocytes in intact skin do not express α5β1 or the αv subunit (33Juhasz I. Murphey G.F. Yan H.-C. Herlyn M. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1458-1469PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cavani A. Zambruno G. Marconi A. Manca V. Marchetti M. Giannetti A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 600-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the integrins that bind fibronectin and fibrin, respectively (34Yamada K.M. Gailit J. Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 311-338Google Scholar). As for αvβ5, α5β1 is induced in response to wounding and is expressed on the basal surface of the same population of keratinocytes producing collagenase-1 (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The lack of α5β1 in intact skin supports the conclusion that binding to fibronectin does not induce collagenase-1 expression in keratinocytes. In contrast, fibronectin fragments binding α5β1 stimulate collagenase-1 expression in fibroblasts (37Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), indicating that fundamentally distinct mechanisms control MMP expression in different cell types.We believe that type IV collagen-mediated induction of collagenase-1 by keratinocytes, which has also been reported by others (28Petersen M.J. Woodley D.T. Stricklin G.P. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 341-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is anin vitro artifact. Because they constitutively express β1 integrins, keratinocytes in intact skin can interact with type IV collagen in the basement membrane. However, our in vivoobservations (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and our RT-PCR data (Fig. 4) demonstrate that keratinocytes in intact skin do not express collagenase-1. In addition, primary keratinocytes grown on Matrigel®, which contains type IV collagen, do not make collagenase-1 (Table I), presumably because laminin-1 overwhelms any potential inductive effect of type IV collagen. Because type IV collagen in the context of a basement membrane does not induce collagenase-1 expression in keratinocytes, the relevance of its ability to do so in a pure form is questionable. After all, other than that in anchoring plaques, keratinocytes in vivo would likely not interact with “pure” type IV collagen.The observation that cultured keratinocytes on basement membrane or cells in intact skin do not express collagenase-1 suggests that a basal lamina protein blocks enzyme production. We show here that laminin-1, but not laminin-5, effectively represses type I collagen-mediated induction of collagenase-1 (Fig. 6). Analogously, laminin-1 and type I collagen mediate opposite effects on breast epithelial cell differentiation (38Streuli C.H. Bailey N. Bissell M.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). During wound healing in vivo, laminin-5 and collagenase-1 are expressed by migrating keratinocytes (18Fini M.E. Parks W.C. Rinehart W.B. Matsubara M. Girard M. Cook J.R. Jeffrey J.J. Burgeson R.E. Raizman M. Kreuger R. Zieske J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1287-1302PubMed Google Scholar). Zhang and Kramer (40Zhang K. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that laminin-5 promotes keratinocyte migration, and we recently reported that keratinocyte migration on a collagen matrix requires the activity of collagenase-1 (5Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). (Incidentally, laminin-5, as well as laminin-1 and type IV collagen, are not substrates for collagenase-1.) Thus, this basement membrane glycoprotein and this MMP serve distinct yet required functions during re-epithelialization.Laminin-1 is deposited in the newly formed basement membrane just behind the migrating front of epidermis (33Juhasz I. Murphey G.F. Yan H.-C. Herlyn M. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1458-1469PubMed Google Scholar). As re-epithelialization progresses, the mass of laminin-1 deposited under the previously migrating keratinocytes would accumulate, providing a site-specific mechanism to down-regulate collagenase-1 expression. Consistent with this idea, our data (Fig. 6) demonstrate that relatively small concentrations of laminin-1 can block the inductive effect of native type I collagen. The molecular mass of a triple helical type I collagen monomer is about 300 kDa and is about 900 kDa for a fully processed laminin-1 heterotrimer. Thus, assuming one binding event per molecule, one laminin-1 molecule effectively blocked the induction of collagenase-1 mediated by about 3,000 collagen molecules. Because type I collagen is so abundant in the dermis, it is not surprising that the inhibitory effect of laminin-1 is so potent.In addition to cell:matrix interactions, our data suggest that cell:cell contacts influence the turn-off of collagenase-1 expression at the completion of re-epithelialization. Plating keratinocytes at a confluent density prevented induction of collagenase-1, even though the cells were in contact with type I collagen (Fig. 5). Because collagenase-1 expression was assessed soon after plating, inhibition of enzyme production was not due to accumulation of keratinocyte-derived basement membrane proteins. These data indicate that contact with type I collagen is not sufficient to induce collagenase-1 expression in keratinocytes; the cells must also have the ability to migrate. Conversely, keratinocyte migration in and of itself does not induce collagenase-1 expression. For example, collagenase-1 is not expressed by keratinocytes involved in re-epithelialization of lesions with an intact basement membrane, such as suction blisters or early bullous pemphigoid blisters (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O.

Parks W.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 982-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, collagenase-1 is not expressed by cultured keratinocytes on gelatin, even though these cells can migrate on this substrate (5Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, induction of collagenase-1 requires both contact of the keratinocytes with the appropriate matrix stimulus (native collagen) and the ability of the cells to migrate.In summary, our findings suggest that, as keratinocytes move from the basement membrane onto the dermal matrix, contact with native type I collagen mediates induction of collagenase-1. The invariable expression of collagenase-1 by migrating basal keratinocytes in all forms of wounds indicates that the activity of this MMP serves a critical and required function during re-epithelialization. In contrast, collagenase-1 is not expressed in squamous or basal cell carcinomas (41Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Sudbeck B.D. Eisen A.Z. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 497-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Parks W.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 995-1000PubMed Google Scholar), and cells derived from squamous cell carcinomas did not express collagenase-1 in response to collagen or other stimuli (Table II). These findings suggest that the proteolytic requirements of normal epithelial repair differ from those needed for invasion of carcinoma cells. Normal cutaneous wound healing, as well as healing in essentially all tissues, involves an orderly progression of events to re-establish the integrity of the injured tissue. The initial injury starts a programmed series of interdependent yet functionally separate responses, such as re-epithelialization and epithelial proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, matrix accumulation, and eventually resolution. During each stage in this process, proteinases are needed to remove or remodel extracellular matrix components in both the epithelial and interstitial compartments to accommodate cell migration and tissue repair (1Mignatti P.

In a thorough examination of normally healing wounds and of a variety of chronic ulcers, we found that collagenase-1, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay; PMA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay; PMA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.family with the ability to cleave fibrillar collagens type I, II, and III at a specific locus in their triple helical domain, is invariably expressed by basal keratinocytes at the edge of repairing tissue (2Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S.

In all, we have examined >100 different human skin specimens, representing a variety of chronic ulcers, blisters, and normally healing wounds, and in each sample with injury that breached the basement membrane, collagenase-1 was prominently and invariantly expressed by basal keratinocytes migrating over the dermal wound bed. The invariable expression of collagenase-1 in all forms of wounds and the confinement of its expression to periods of active re-epithelialization suggest that this enzyme plays a critical role in keratinocyte function during healing. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that keratinocyte migration on a native collagen matrix requires the catalytic activity of collagenase-1 (5Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the factors and events in a wound environment which control collagenase-1 expression will aid our understanding of fundamental processes of tissue repair. The precise, spatially confined expression of collagenase-1 by migrating keratinocytes in vivo suggests that altered cell:matrix interactions, which are established as cells migrate off the basement membrane, induce enzyme expression. Indeed, collagenase-1 is only expressed by keratinocytes that are not in contact with an intact basement membrane (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J.

The activators of RNase L, 2-5A, are produced from ATP by double-stranded RNA stimulation of the 2-5A-synthetases, a family of enzymes induced by interferon treatment of mammalian cells. Production of double-stranded RNA during some virus infections leads to 2-5A synthesis and activation of RNase L (3Williams B.R.G. Golgher R.R. Brown R.E. Gilbert C.S. Kerr I.M.

The proposed biological functions of RNase L includes involvement in the antiviral and antiproliferative mechanisms of interferon action and in the more general control of RNA decay (5Chebath J.

Activation of human RNase L requires 2-5A molecules containing at least three 2′,5′-adenylyl residues, such as pA(2′p5′A)2, and the binding of 2-5A to RNase L, KD = 40 pm, is highly specific (9Dong B.

Previously, we demonstrated that the 2-5A binding activity of RNase L is located in the N-terminal half of RNase L, a region containing nine ankyrin-like, macromolecular recognition domains (2Zhou A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Within the seventh and eighth ankyrin repeats are two P-loop motifs. In murine RNase L, substitutions of both of the conserved P-loop lysine residues with asparagines resulted in a defect in 2-5A binding activity, while deletion of 89 C-terminal amino acids caused a loss of ribonuclease activity (2Zhou A.

The truncated RNase L mutant, RNase LZB1, which binds 2-5A but lacks ribonuclease activity, functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild type RNase L (6Hassel B.A. Zhou A. Sotomayor C. Maran A. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To further study the structure and function of RNase L, we have performed both a systematic shortening of RNase L from either terminus and a biochemical analysis of each mutant protein. The results provide information about the location of the structural and functional domains in RNase L. Moreover, these studies provide insight into the mechanism of regulation of RNase L. An internal repressor of ribonuclease function was identified, deletion of which released the ribonuclease domain from its dependence on 2-5A. A full-length coding sequence DNA for human RNase L in plasmid pZC5 (2Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) was subcloned downstream (3′) of the coding sequence for glutathioneS-transferase (GST) in expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cloning strategy involved creating aBamHI site immediately upstream of the RNase L coding sequence. This was done using an oligonucleotide primer for PCR containing the BamHI site. The PCR product containing theBamHI site at the 5′ terminus and the naturalNcoI site at the 3′ terminus was subcloned intoBamHI/NcoI digested pZC5. The complete RNase L coding sequence was subcloned as a BamHI/XhoI fragment into BamHI/XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-3. The deletion mutants of RNase L were constructed with PCR by creating newBamHI restriction sites for the 5′-truncations and newXhoI sites for the 3′-truncations. To generate the N-terminal deletions of RNase L, the 5′-primers contained 4–6 nucleotides and GGATCC for creating BamHI sites followed by 18–20 nucleotides of the RNase L sequences. To generate the C-terminal truncations, 5′-GGCGGCCTCGAGTCA (underlined sequence is theXhoI site followed by a sequence complementary to a stop codon sequence), attached to the 16–24 nucleotides of different RNase L sequences was used as the 3′-primers for PCR.

The dried cleavage products were dissolved in 4 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. A 18-nucleotide primer complementary to PKR nucleotides 263–280 of the coding sequence of PKR cDNA (5′-GGCCTATGTAATTCCCCA-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and purified through Sephadex G-25 cartridges (Boehringer Mannheim). The32P-labeled primer was mixed with the RNA cleavage products at 70 °C for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were incubated with dNTPs and reverse transcriptase (superscript RNase H−, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 40 °C for 90 min. The cleavage sites were determined by comparing the migration in 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels of the primer extension products and the DNA sequencing products using the same primer on PKR cDNA with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical) and deoxyadenosine [5′-α-35S]thiotriphosphate (NEN Life Science Products). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B, 10 μl of a 20% (v/v) suspension, or poly(U)-Sepharose 4B, 10 μl of a 60% (w/v) suspension (∼0.5 mg of poly(U)/ml of gel; ∼100 uridyl residues/chain) (Pharmacia) were added to extracts of the GST fusion proteins, 50 μg/assay, in PBS-C buffer. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with shaking and gentle vortexing every 5 min. The protein-bead complexes were washed three times with 0.3 ml of PBS-C, and the proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and poly(U)-Sepharose 4B were eluted in gel loading buffer containing SDS at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The proteins were detected after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by probing with murine polyclonal antibody to human RNase L (sera of immunized mice used for making monoclonal antibody) (7Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the bound proteins were determined from Western blots by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) after capture of the images with a video camera. To map and study the functional domains in RNase L, complete or truncated RNase L coding sequence DNAs were expressed as GST fusion proteins from vector pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia) in E. coli (Fig. 1). Previously, it was shown that GST fusion proteins of RNase L are fully active in the presence of 2-5A (14Sobol R.W. Henderson E.E. Kon N. Shao J. Hitzges P. Mordechai E. Reichenbach N.L. Charubala R. Schirmeister H. Pfleiderer W. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5963-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because ankyrin repeats are structural as well as functional units (15Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), the approach taken for the design of the N-terminal truncations was to progressively delete the individual ankyrin repeats. The exception was the first mutant RNase LNΔ23, which lacks the 23 N-terminal amino acids proceeding the first ankyrin repeat. The other N-terminal truncations, mutants RNase LNΔ56, RNase LNΔ90, RNase LNΔ123, RNase LNΔ237, and RNase LNΔ335, lack 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 ankyrin repeats, respectively (Fig. 1). On the other hand, a functional approach was used in the design of the C-terminal truncations. In essence, progressive C-terminal mutations were made and the mutant proteins assayed for loss of various functions (Fig. 1). In addition, one mutant, RNase LNΔ23/CΔ504, was truncated from both termini. Assays were performed, which measured and compared the abilities of wild type and mutant forms of RNase L to bind with 2-5A, native RNase L, or RNA and to degrade RNA. The portion of RNase L that contains the 2-5A binding function was localized by measuring the abilities of the mutant proteins to bind to a radioactive 2-5A analog in a filter binding assay (11Knight M. Cayley P.J. Silverman R.H. Wreschner D.H. Gilbert C.S. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1980; 288: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Nolan-Sorden N.L. Lesiak K. Bayard B. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 2-5A binding activity of RNase LNΔ23, lacking 23 N-terminal amino acids, was 82% of that of GST-RNase Lwild type (Fig. 2). However, deletion of amino acid sequences including the first ankyrin repeat resulted in a complete loss of 2-5A binding activity (mutant RNase LNΔ56). Further truncations from the N terminus also produced mutant proteins that lacked 2-5A binding activity. In contrast, C-terminal truncations of RNase L, removing as much as 406 amino acid residues in RNase LCΔ406, had little or no effect of 2-5A binding activity. However, RNase LNΔ23/CΔ504, lacking 504 C-terminal amino acids and 23 N-terminal residues, did not bind 2-5A. These findings show that the 2-5A binding function of RNase L requires the ankyrin repeat region, but not other portions of the enzyme. To map the RNase L/RNase L interaction domains, the ability of the GST-RNase L mutants to bind native RNase L was determined in the presence and absence of 2-5A (Fig. 3). The 2-5A-dependent binding of the 83-kDa native RNase L (not a fusion protein) to GST-RNase Lwild type protein was observed after the complex was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 3 A, lane 3, see arrow). The proteins that were retained were analyzed in Western blots probed with a monoclonal antibody to human RNase L, thus distinguishing the 83.5-kDa native RNase L from the 110-kDa GST-RNase L. In the absence of 2-5A, there was little or no interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). The removal of the C-terminal 21-amino acid segment did not impair the 2-5A-dependent binding of the proteins (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). However, deletion of 80 or 399 C-terminal amino acid residues results in a loss of the ability to bind native RNase L, as observed by the absence of the 83-kDa RNase L (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7and 9). These results show that the C-terminal 22–80-amino acid portion is necessary for RNase L/RNase L binding activity. The monoclonal antibody used to detect RNase L recognizes an epitope in the C-terminal half of RNase L, between residues 342 and 661; therefore, RNase LCΔ399 could not be detected on the Western blot with this antibody. However, the RNase LCΔ399 was clearly visualized by staining the protein in the gel with Coomassie Blue dye (data not shown). Despite repeated attempts, we were unable to obtain clearly interpretable data on the RNase L binding activities of the C-terminal mutants lacking 31, 41, or 51 amino acid residues. This was due to the relatively low levels of expression of these mutant proteins compared with the amount of protein required for the assay. In addition, some of the GST fusion proteins were less stable than others. The N-terminal mutants were also assayed for the ability to bind native RNase L. Removal of the N-terminal 23-amino acid segment had no effect on the binding to native RNase L in response to 2-5A (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9 and 10). However, an N-terminal deletion including the first ankyrin repeat resulted in the loss of this function (see RNase LNΔ56 in Fig. 3 B, lane 7). Interestingly, RNase LNΔ56 is also defective for 2-5A binding (Fig. 2). Further N-terminal truncations in RNase L also resulted in proteins that lacked the ability to bind with native RNase L (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6). Therefore, amino acid residues near both termini of RNase L were required for the binding to native RNase L. To measure the endoribonuclease activity of the mutant proteins, a radiolabeled, short RNA consisting of 25 uridylate residues linked at the 3′ terminus to [32P]pCp, U25-[32P]pCp, was synthesized as substrate. In addition, shorter fragments of oligo(U)-[32P]pCp were present as a result of premature terminations during the chemical synthesis of the U25 (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Analysis of RNA cleavages after incubation with the wild type and mutant forms of RNase L was performed in the presence or absence of 2-5A (Fig. 4 A). Incubations with RNase Lwild type produced potent 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease activity (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). The cleavage products were ≤4 nucleotides in length. Deletion of the N-terminal 23 residues had no effect on 2-5A-dependent RNase activity (lanes 4 and 5). However, RNase LNΔ56, missing sequence including the first ankyrin repeat, lacked ribonuclease activity in the presence or absence of 2-5A (lanes 6 and 7). RNase LNΔ90, RNase LNΔ123, and RNase LNΔ237 (missing 2, 3, and 6 ankyrin repeats, respectively) also lacked the ability to degrade RNA (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8–11, and data not shown). Surprisingly, however, deletion of all nine ankyrin repeats, produced a mutant protein, RNase LNΔ335, with unregulated ribonuclease activity (Fig. 4 A, lanes 12 and13), i.e. ribonuclease activity was observed with RNase LNΔ335 even in the absence of the activator, 2-5A. To further localize the ribonuclease domain, the C-terminal mutant proteins were also analyzed. RNase LCΔ21, lacking 21 C-terminal residues, displayed wild type 2-5A-dependent RNase activity (Fig. 4 A, lanes 14 and15). However, mutant RNase LCΔ31, lacking an additional 10 residues was inactive (Fig. 4 A, lanes 16 and 17). All of the mutants containing further C-terminal truncations, beyond residue 710, were similarly inactive (Fig. 4 A, lanes 18–29). Quantitation of the intact RNA remaining after the incubations confirmed that 2-5A-dependent RNase activity required the N-terminal segment that included the first ankyrin repeat and the 10-amino acid segment located between residues 710 and 720 (Fig. 4 B). The unregulated mutant, RNase LNΔ335, caused a complete loss of intact RNA, but the appearance of some incomplete RNA digestion products show that its ribonuclease activity was diminished compared with wild type enzyme (Fig. 4 A, compare lane 3 to lanes 12and 13). To directly compare the relative activities of the two proteins, the effects of protein concentration on RNA cleavage was measured with U25-[32P]pCp as substrate. Reactions with RNase Lwild type were performed by preincubating with 2-5A prior to addition of substrate to avoid an initial lag that occurs when 2-5A and substrate are added at the same time (16Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The concentrations of protein required to obtain 50% loss of intact RNA in 30 min at 30 °C was 20 nm RNase Lwild type and 115 nm RNase LNΔ335 (Fig. 5). Therefore, RNase LNΔ335 was about 6-fold less active than RNase Lwild type. In the absence of 2-5A, no RNA cleavage was seen with 300 nm RNase Lwild type, whereas 300 nm RNase LNΔ335 caused an 87% decrease in the level of intact RNA (Fig. 5). To compare the RNA cleavage site preferences of RNase Lwild type and RNase LNΔ335, the proteins were incubated in the presence or absence of 2-5A with a fragment of PKR mRNA (13Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S.B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The cleavage sites were mapped by primer extension assays in comparison with the products of DNA sequencing reactions of PKR cDNA (Fig. 6). RNase Lwild type and RNase LNΔ335 cleaved the RNA at precisely the same sites. In both cases, the two nucleotides immediately 5′ to the cleavage sites were UA (products 1 and 3), AU (products 2 and 4), and UG (product 5) (Fig. 6). With PKR mRNA as substrate, RNase LNΔ335 appear to be somewhat less active compared with RNase Lwild type than with oligo(rU) as substrate. RNA cleavage by RNase Lwild type was dependent upon addition of 2-5A, whereas the ribonuclease activity of RNase LNΔ335was identical in the presence or absence of 2-5A. To map the RNA binding domain, the affinities of the various GST-mutant proteins for poly(U)-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose were compared (Fig. 7). The RNase L mutants truncated only from the N terminus showed similar affinities for poly(U)-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1–12). Analysis of the C-terminal truncated mutants showed that RNase LCΔ21 bound poly(U)-Sepharose but with reduced activity (Fig. 7 A, lane 14). However, further deletions from the C terminus, beginning with RNase LCΔ31, result in a loss in poly(U) binding activity (Fig. 7 A, lanes 15–28). These results were measured and expressed as percentage of the activities of the mutant proteins compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 7 B). The data show that the substrate binding activity and the RNase function both require the amino acid sequence between residues 710 and 720. Here we have studied the structure, function, and regulation of RNase L through a series of truncations from either terminus (Fig. 1). The 2-5A binding activity of the protein is localized in the N-terminal half of RNase L. For example, RNase LCΔ406, which lacks 406 of the 741 amino acid residues of RNase L, binds 2-5A nearly as well as the complete, wild type enzyme (Fig. 2). Previously, we showed that the 2-5A binding domain of the murine RNase L was expressed in a polypeptide consisting of residues 1–342 (2Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Furthermore, substitution of the P-loop motif lysines, at residues 240 and 274 in a truncated murine RNase L resulted in a defect in 2-5A binding activity. In this study, we show that the N-terminal 23 amino acid residues do not contribute to 2-5A binding activity. However, the first ankyrin repeat, residues 24–56, is required. Although RNase LCΔ399 contains the complete ankyrin repeat region, a presumptive protein-protein interaction domain with 2-5A binding activity, it fails to bind with native RNase L in the presence or absence of 2-5A (Figs. 1 and 3). Results show that both termini are necessary for RNase L binding activity. For instance, RNase LCΔ80 also lacks the ability to bind native RNase L. Therefore, while the ankyrin repeats may contribute to RNase L/RNase L binding, they are insufficient for this function. The C-terminal 31 residues of RNase L are critical for the catalytic function of the enzyme. RNase LCΔ31, lacking residues 711–741, has neither ribonuclease nor substrate binding activities. In contrast, RNase LCΔ21 has full activity in the presence of 2-5A. These findings clearly show that residues 711–720, EYRKHFPQTH, are essential for the RNA binding and ribonuclease activities of the enzyme. However, it is likely that portions of the catalytic domain are located further upstream (toward the N terminus) or that deletion of the C-terminal segment results in conformational alterations that impair function. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of the yeast Ire1p protein, a putative ribonuclease that functions in the splicing of the HAC1 mRNA during the unfolded protein response, has significant homology with the residues 587–706 of RNase L (17Bork P. Sanders C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,18Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The region of homology with Ire1p suggests that amino acid residues that are N-terminal to residue 706 are also important for the catalytic function of RNase L. Results of this study show that the ankyrin repeat region of RNase L functions as a potent repressor. Binding of 2-5A could cause a conformational change in the enzyme that releases the inhibitory effect of the ankyrin repeats leading to both an unmasking of the ribonuclease and interaction domains near the C terminus. Previous studies involving multiple biochemical and biophysical methods established that the binding of 2-5A to monomers of RNase L induces the formation of RNase L homodimers (7Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, additional studies will be required to determine if dimerization is actually required for ribonuclease activity. Dimer formation could be a mechanism for maintaining the enzyme in an active conformation by preventing the ankyrin clamp from reforming. The failure of RNase LNΔ56 to bind to either 2-5A or to native RNase L was consistent with the requirement of 2-5A for dimerization (7Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Cole J.L. Carroll S.S. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3979-3981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Presumably, the protein-protein interaction domain in RNase LNΔ56 cannot be unmasked because the protein lacks the capacity to bind with 2-5A. It is unknown if the ankyrin repeats directly interact with the catalytic domain. However, the failure of the complete ankyrin repeat region in RNase LCΔ80 and RNase LCΔ399 to bind with native RNase L in the presence of 2-5A argues against a direct interaction (Fig. 3). The repressor function requires only three, or possibly fewer, of the nine ankyrin repeats. RNase LNΔ335, lacking all nine ankyrin repeats was a constitutive ribonuclease whereas RNase LNΔ237, lacking ankyrin repeats 1–6, was in a repressed state. Therefore, ankyrin repeat domains 7–9 by themselves are capable of causing repression. RNase Lwild type and RNase LNΔ335 produced identical RNA cleavage sites, providing further evidence that the RNA binding and catalytic sites are localized in the C-terminal half of the enzyme (Fig. 6). Cleavages occurred 3′ of UA, UG, and AU dinucleotide sequences in the PKR mRNA fragment. The first two of these RNA cleavages site preferences have been previously reported for RNase L, while cleavages 3′ of AU have not been reported (16Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J.

Science. 1981; 212: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). 2-5A binding to a complete RNase L releases the inhibition by the ankyrin repeat regions of the protein. However, because mutants RNase LNΔ56, RNase LNΔ90, RNase LNΔ123, and RNase LNΔ237 lack the ability to bind 2-5A, addition of 2-5A fails to release of the repression (Fig. 1). To date, we have not observed a transinhibition of ribonuclease activity by mixing RNase LCΔ399 with RNase LNΔ335. 2B. Dong and R. H. Silverman, unpublished data.However, further studies are required to determine if the ankyrin repeats must be present in the same polypeptide chain as the catalytic domain to silence the ribonuclease activity. The results of this study show that the 2-5A binding and repression functions of RNase L map to different regions than the RNA binding and ribonuclease domains. Additional features in the C-terminal half are a high cysteine content segment and limited homology to protein kinases, both regions are of unknown function (1Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 516-552Google Scholar, 2Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H.

A binary model of RNase L emerges from these studies in which the regulatory functions map to the ankyrin repeat region in the N-terminal half, while the ribonuclease portion localizes to the C-terminal part of the enzyme (Fig. 1).

We examined the distribution of epitope-tagged versions of Upf proteins by sucrose density gradient fractionation of soluble lysates and found that all three proteins co-distributed with 80 S ribosomal particles and polyribosomes. Treatment of lysates with RNase A caused a coincident collapse of polyribosomes and each Upf protein into fractions containing 80 S ribosomal particles, as expected for proteins that are associated with polyribosomes. Mutations in the cysteine-rich (zinc finger) and RNA helicase domains of Upf1p caused loss of function, but the mutant proteins remained polyribosome-associated. Density gradient profiles for Upf1p were unchanged in the absence of Upf3p, and although similar, were modestly shifted to fractions lighter than those containing polyribosomes in the absence of Upf2p. Upf2p shifted toward heavier polyribosome fractions in the absence of Upf1p and into fractions containing 80 S particles and lighter fractions in the absence of Upf3p. Our results suggest that the association of Upf2p with polyribosomes typically found in a wild-type strain depends on the presence and opposing effects of Upf1p and Upf3p.

The notion of a global pathway for eukaryotic mRNA decay suggested by early work in animal cells has recently been greatly advanced by studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(1Green L.L.

Using an in vivo transcriptional pulse, the temporal fate of newly synthesized mRNA was established by monitoring poly(A) tail length, loss of the m7Gppp cap, disappearance of the mRNA, and the appearance of degradation intermediates. mRNAs with shorter half-lives were generally subject to faster rates of deadenylation and decapping. Once the poly(A) tails were reduced to a short oligo(A) length (10–12 nucleotides), the mRNAs were decapped and digested from the 5′ end. Decapping requires Dcp1p (5Beelman C.A. Stevens A. Caponigro G. LaGrandeur T.E. Hatfield L. Fortner D.M. Parker R. Nature. 1996; 382: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Processive degradation from the 5′ end requires the product of theXRN1 gene, which is known to encode a 5′ → 3′ exoribonuclease (6Larimer F.W. Hsu C.L. Maupin M.K. Stevens A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 120: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Deadenylation-dependent decapping followed by 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic decay is likely to be the global default pathway for the degradation of most eukaryotic mRNAs. Yeast mRNAs containing a premature stop codon decay more rapidly than their wild-type counterparts (7Leeds P. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Culbertson M.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This accelerated decay, called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), 1The abbreviations used are: NMD, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody. requires cis-acting elements in the mRNA in addition to a premature stop codon (8Peltz S.W. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 7: 1737-1754Google Scholar). Premature translational termination triggers decapping at the 5′ end of nonsense mRNAs with kinetics that are independent of deadenylation (9Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Following decapping, decay proceeds through the Xrn1p-mediated nucleolysis that is common to intrinsic decay. These results support the view that when translation is prematurely terminated, the decay of nonsense mRNA is accelerated in part through bypass of a major rate-determining step in the default pathway. This defines NMD as a deadenylation-independent decay pathway. Three genes, called UPF1, UPF2, andUPF3, encode protein products that are required for NMD inS. cerevisiae (10Leeds P. Wood J.M.

Cell. 1995; 6: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). UPF2 encodes a 126-kDa protein that has a putative nuclear localization sequence and has been implicated in the performance of at least one function in the cytoplasm (11Cui Y. Hagan K.W. Zhang S. Peltz S.W. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12He F. Jacobson A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 437-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).UPF3, which encodes a predominantly nuclear 45-kDa protein (10Leeds P. Wood J.M. Lee B.S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 13Lee B.S. Culbertson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10354-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), contains multiple sequence elements that have recently been shown to promote nuclear import and export across the nuclear envelope. 2L. R. Schenkman, M. J. Lelivelt, R. Shirley, A. Ford, J. N. Dahlseid, and M. R. Culbertson, manuscript in preparation. Mutations in Upf3p that are defective for nuclear export confer an Nmd−phenotype, suggesting that export is connected with the function of Upf3p in NMD. Physical interactions between the Upf proteins have been studied using the two-hybrid system of Fields and Song (16Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar). A two-hybrid interaction was first detected when UPF2 was recovered using DNA coding for Upf1p as bait (12He F. Jacobson A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 437-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). When all possible combinations of the threeUPF genes were tested for interaction, β-galactosidase activities indicative of strong interactions were detected with the combinations UPF1-UPF2 andUPF2-UPF3. However, much lower β-galactosidase activity indicative of a weak interaction was revealed whenUPF1 and UPF3 were combined in two-hybrid test plasmids (17He F. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence was provided suggesting that this weak interaction is indirect and is most likely mediated through Upf2p, which could serve as a bridge between the two proteins. In addition to these interactions, import and export of Upf3p across the nuclear envelope presumably requires docking to nucleoporin receptors that facilitate protein transport through nuclear pores.2 Taken together, these findings suggest that nuclear and cytoplasmic steps in NMD exist that are functionally linked through interactions between the Upf proteins and the nucleoporins that direct traffic across the nuclear envelope. In this paper, we have extended our knowledge of the relationships between the Upf proteins using genetic analysis, cell fractionation, and sucrose density gradient fractionation. Single, double, and triple disruptions of the three UPF genes confer nonadditive effects on nonsense mRNA accumulation, suggesting that the three proteins act in a common mRNA decay pathway. By analyzing soluble lysates using sucrose density gradient fractionation, we find that Upf1p, Upf2p, and Upf3p all associate with 80 S ribosomal particles and polyribosomes. Mutations in the zinc finger and RNA helicase domains of Upf1p were also analyzed and found to diminish the function of Upf1p in NMD without diminishing the ability of the mutant proteins to associate with polyribosomes. In addition, UPF gene disruptions were used to assess whether the typical distribution of Upf1p and Upf2p in sucrose gradients depends on the presence of the other proteins. Our results suggest that the normal association of Upf2p with polyribosomes depends on the presence and opposing effects of the other two proteins. Also, we report that quantitative measurements of the relative cellular protein concentrations of Upf1p and Upf3p indicate a lack of 1:1 stoichiometry. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the cellular distribution, physical interactions, and functional relationships between the three proteins. Strains of S. cerevisiae and plasmids are listed in Tables I and II, respectively. Yeast strains were constructed, grown, and maintained using standard techniques (18). Yeast transformations were performed using the LiAc method (19Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar) or by electroporation (20Grey M. Brendel M. Curr.

To test the effects of multiple UPF gene disruptions on nonsense mRNA accumulation, strain LRSY307 (Table I) was constructed. LRSY307 carries three marked disruption alleles,upf1::ura3−, upf2::HIS3, andupf3::TRP1. Wild-type UPF1,UPF2, or UPF3 genes were transformed into LRSY307 in all possible combinations on URA3 CEN6 or LEU2 CEN6 plasmids (Table II), resulting in an isogenic set of strains that collectively represent all possible single, double, and triple disruptions. To measure the effects of the upf1–3 andUPF1-D4 mutations on NMD, isogenic strains were constructed using strain PLY38 (Table I). PLY38 contains upf1–2, which confers complete loss of function (10Leeds P. Wood J.M. Lee B.S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying upf1–3 and UPF1-D4 were transformed into PLY38 on URA3 CEN6 plasmids (Table II). Yeast total RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction (7Leeds P. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Culbertson M.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, RNA samples were denatured either by treatment with glyoxal and Me2SO or formamide-formaldehyde before fractionation on 1.0% agarose gels (23) or 1.0% agarose, 16.2% formaldehyde gels (15Atkin A.L. Altamura N. Leeds P. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Gels were loaded with 10 μg of total RNA per lane. Fractionated RNAs were transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products). DNA probes were prepared from restriction fragments or polymerase chain reaction fragments as described by Atkin et al. (15Atkin A.L. Altamura N. Leeds P. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Hybridization of DNA probes to RNA blots was essentially as described by Klessig and Berry (24Klessig D.F. Berry J.O. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 12-18Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The UPF1–3EP allele encodes a functional, epitope-tagged version of Upf1p that contains three tandem copies of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein epitope immediately adjacent to the last amino acid of Upf1p as described previously (15Atkin A.L. Altamura N. Leeds P. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The HA epitopes are recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12CA5. In this paper, we refer to the modified gene and protein asUPF1–3HA and Upf1p-3HA, respectively. UPF2 was modified by placing a DNA sequence encoding three copies of a c-Myc epitope immediately upstream of the translation termination codon to create UPF2–3myc. A 1110-base pairEcoRI-HincII fragment from the 3′ end ofUPF2 was subcloned into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of pBKCMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequence 5′-CGT AGT TTC GAC TTG GGC CCA TGA-3′, which contains a unique Bsp120I site, was inserted at the Psp1406I site near theUPF2 stop codon, resulting in loss of thePsp1406I site. A NotI fragment coding for three copies of the c-Myc epitope was cloned into the Bsp120I site. An EcoRI-KpnI fragment containing the c-Myc epitopes was used to replace the same region of a wild-typeUPF2 gene carried on pRS316, resulting in plasmid pRS316UPF2–3myc (Table II). Using 9E10 mAbs, the tagged protein, Upf2p-3myc, was detected on Western blots as a 130-kDa protein whose appearance is unique to strains carrying the modified gene. UPF3 was modified by placing a DNA sequence encoding three tandem copies of the HA epitope between the fourth and fifth codons near the 5′ end to create UPF3–3HA. Annealed oligodeoxynucleotides (5′-TGC GGC CGC TCT AGA AGC GGC CTC TTG-3′ and 5′-AGC GGC CGC TTC TAG AGC GGC CGC ACA-3′), carrying NotI and XbaI sites were introduced into the BsrDI site near the 5′ end of UPF3. A NotI DNA fragment encoding three tandem copies of the HA epitope was inserted into theNotI site, resulting in plasmid pLS51 (Table II). Using 12CA5 mAbs, the tagged protein, Upf3p-3HA, was detected on Western blots as a 49-kDa protein whose appearance is unique to strains carrying the modified gene. The mutationupf1–3 is a substitution of serine for cysteine at position 122, which is located in the zinc finger region of UPF1(25Weng Y. Czaplinski K. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5491-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We constructed this allele using two polymerase chain reaction products amplified in separate reactions with primer pair UPF1wt352a (5′-TAT CCC CTA AGT CAG AAT CTG G-3′) and ALA1wt (5′-GAT TTC ATC AGG AAA GAA GGA AGG GCA G-3′) and primer pair UPF1MUT1s (5′-CCG TTT TGG AAT CTT ATA ACT GTG-3′) and mutagen B (5′-GTG TTG GAG GTG GCG TTT TAC T-3′). Polymerase chain reaction products were blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated, and digested with BstXI andSphI. Fragments of the correct size were gel-purified, subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and analyzed by DNA sequence analysis. BstXI/EcoRV fragments carrying the Ser122 mutation were used to replace aBstXI/EcoRV DNA fragment in the wild-typeUPF1 gene and the UPF1–3HA gene to produceupf1–3 and upf1–3-3HA. These genes are carried on the plasmids pRS316upf1–3 and pRS314upf1–3-3HA, respectively (Table II). The mutation UPF1-D4, described previously (10Leeds P. Wood J.M. Lee B.S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), causes a substitution of arginine for cysteine at position 779, which is located at a conserved position in the RNA helicase domain. The mutant allele is carried on plasmid pRS316UPF1-D4 (Table II). A modified gene was constructed that codes for the protein Upf1-D4p-3HA, which contains theD4 mutation plus a triple HA tag at the C terminus. This was accomplished by replacing a NruI-BamHI fragment at the 3′ end of UPF1-D4 with aNruI-BamHI fragment from UPF1–3HA, resulting in the plasmid pRS314UPF1-D4–3HA (Table II). Epitope-tagged proteins were assayed for function by growth tests in strains lacking the corresponding wild-type gene using a previously described allosuppression assay (10Leeds P. Wood J.M. Lee B.S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Strains carrying wild-type UPF genes, the frameshift mutationhis4–38, and the tRNA frameshift suppressorSUF1–1 produce an unstable his4–38 mRNA, resulting in failure to grow at 37 °C on medium lacking histidine. Impaired function of any one of the three Upf proteins stabilizes the mRNA, resulting in growth on medium lacking histidine at 37 °C. Centromeric plasmids carrying UPF2–3myc orUPF3–3HA were transformed into strains lacking the corresponding wild-type UPF gene and carryinghis4–38 and SUF1–1. Using the allosuppression assay, we showed previously that the strain carrying UPF1-HA(formerly UPF1–3EP) grew poorly on medium lacking histidine at 37 °C (15Atkin A.L. Altamura N. Leeds P. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that function was retained. Quantitative measurement of his4–38 mRNA levels by Northern blotting showed that Upf1p-3HA retained 80–90% of function compared with the wild-type protein. Growth tests using strains carryingUPF2–3myc and UPF3–3HA gave similar results, indicating the all three of the tagged proteins retain function at a level comparable with wild type. The stabilities of the tagged proteins are therefore presumed to be similar to the corresponding wild-type proteins. The relative abundance and solubility of epitope-tagged proteins was determined by fractionation of total proteins from cell lysates. Yeast cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.4–0.6. Half of the culture was extracted with a total protein lysis buffer (5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), while the other half was extracted with polyribosome lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 33 mm MgCl2, 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate, 50 mm cycloheximide, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). Soluble extracts were quantified using a BCA protein concentration kit (Pierce). A concentrated 4 × Laemmli buffer was added to both soluble extracts to a 1 × final concentration. The insoluble material remaining after the lysis buffer extractions was further extracted with 1 × Laemmli buffer. The presence of the reducing agents in 1 × Laemmli buffer, which are necessary for efficient solubilization, interfered with accurate protein quantification. To circumvent this, the volume of 1 × Laemmli buffer used in the second extraction was equal to the final adjusted volume of the respective soluble extract. We reasoned that using equal volumes from both the first and second extractions would provide equivalent representative samples from each extraction. Using these equivalent representative samples allows for a direct comparison of the relative amount of a given protein present in each extraction. For a given lysis buffer, a known amount of protein from the first extraction and an equal volume, and therefore an equivalent representative sample, from the second extraction were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-NC membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and examined by quantitative Western blotting. Upf1p-3HA and Upf3p-3HA were detected with 12CA5 mAbs (Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, CA), and Upf2p-3myc was detected with 9E10 mAbs (Hybridoma Facility, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI).35S-Labeled secondary antibodies specific for mouse Ig (Amersham Life Sciences) were used at a concentration of 0.1 μCi/ml. For sucrose density gradient fractionation, proteins were extracted in polyribosome lysis buffer and fractionated on 7–47% sucrose gradients prepared as described previously (15Atkin A.L. Altamura N. Leeds P. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Upf1p-3HA, Upf2p-3myc, and Upf3p-3HA were detected in sucrose gradient fractions by Western blotting using ECL and Hyperfilm (Amersham Life Sciences) as described previously (14Czaplinski K. Weng Y. Hagan K.W. Peltz S.W. RNA. 1995; 1: 610-623PubMed Google Scholar). Films of the Western blots were analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA). CYH2 pre-mRNA accumulation has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of whether the NMD pathway is functional (26He F. Peltz S.W. Donahue J.L. Rosbash M. Jacobson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90(15): 7034-7038Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CYH2, which encodes the ribosomal protein L29, contains an intron that is inefficiently spliced. An in-frame premature termination codon located within the intron targets the CYH2 pre-mRNA for accelerated decay (27Kaufer N.F. Fried H.M. Schwindinger W.F. Jasin M. Warner J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3123-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of multiple upf mutations on NMD, we determined the degree to which CYH2 pre-mRNA accumulates relative to the mature CYH2 mRNA by Northern blotting of total RNA from isogenic derivatives of strain LRSY307 (Table I). Collectively, these strains represent all possible combinations of triple, double, and single null alleles of UPF1, UPF2, andUPF3 (see “Experimental Procedures”; Table I). Northern blots were probed with a labeled DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 15–780 of the CYH2 ORF and intron (27Kaufer N.F. Fried H.M. Schwindinger W.F. Jasin M. Warner J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3123-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The CYH2 pre-mRNA/mRNA accumulation ratios were determined and used to calculate the relative accumulation of CYH2 pre-mRNA (Table III). For strains carrying the single, double, or triple disruptions, the relative accumulation of CYH2 pre-mRNA ranged from 3.2 to 3.8 (average 3.4). These results indicate that the effects of double and triple disruptions on CYH2 pre-mRNA accumulation are nonadditive compared with the effects of single gene disruptions, suggesting that all three UPF genes function in a common mRNA decay pathway.Table IIIAccumulation of CYH2 pre-mRNA in strains carrying upf null allelesPlasmids in strain LRSY307GenotypeAccumulation ratioRelative accumulationpUZ178, pLS74upf1−1.9 (0.26)3.2pRS316UPF1, pLS74upf2−2.1 (0.04)3.5pLS80, pRS315upf3−2.0 (0.01)3.3pRS316, pLS74upf1−, upf2−2.0 (0.19)3.3pRS316UPF1, pRS315upf2−, upf3−2.1 (0.00)3.5pUZ178, pRS315upf1−, upf3−2.3 (0.46)3.8pRS316, pRS315upf1−, upf2−, upf3−2.0 (0.10)3.3pLS80, pLS74UPF1, UPF2, UPF30.6 (0.00)1.0CYH2 pre-mRNA/CYH2-mRNA accumulation ratios were determined by quantitative Northern blotting.

S.D. values are shown in parentheses (n = 2). Strain LRSY307 is described in Table I, and the plasmids are described in Table II. To evaluate the results of the sucrose gradients presented below, we determined the solubility and relative abundance of epitope-tagged Upf proteins by quantitative Western blotting. Cell extracts were prepared from strains PLY102[pRS314UPF1–3HA], JDY8[pRS316UPF2–3myc], and LRSY203[pLS51 (UPF3–3HA)] (Tables I and II). The plasmids in these strains contain the genes coding for Upf1p-3HA, Upf2p-3myc, and Upf3p-3HA. Cell lysates were prepared using two different lysis buffers, one containing 100 mm NaCl (polyribosome lysis buffer) and the other containing 250 mmNaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 detergent (total protein lysis buffer) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The relative amounts of each of the three proteins extracted were quantified using 35S-labeled secondary antibodies on Western blots by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis (Fig. 1). To compare the relative efficiencies of extraction for each lysis buffer, we calculated the percentage of Upf protein extracted with each lysis buffer (Fig. 1, lane 1or 3) relative to the sum of total protein extracted (Fig. 1, either lanes 1 plus 2 or lanes 3plus 4). We found that 64, 58, and 40% of total Upf1p-3HA, Upf2p-3myc, and Upf3p-3HA, respectively, were soluble in the total protein lysis buffer (Fig. 1, Table IV). In polyribosome lysis buffer, 44, 24, and 15% of total Upf1p-3HA, Upf2p-3myc, and Upf3p-3HA, respectively, were soluble (Fig. 1, Table IV). These results indicate that a significant portion of each of the three proteins is soluble in the polyribosome lysis buffer. However, since polyribosome lysis buffer did not completely solubilize the Upf proteins, the sucrose gradients represent an analysis of the distribution of only the soluble fraction for each protein.Table IVDifferential solubility of epitope-tagged Upf proteinsProteinTotal protein lysis bufferPolyribosome lysis bufferBufferPelletBufferPelletUpf1p-3HA64 ± 0%36 ± 0%44 ± 4%56 ± 4%Upf2p-3myc58 ± 5%42 ± 5%24 ± 5%76 ± 5%Up"
https://openalex.org/W1557936052,"We show here that interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), an ELR lacking CXC chemokine, and the C chemokine lymphotactin (Ltn) induce the chemotaxis and calcium mobilization in IL-2-activated NK (IANK) and CC chemokine-activated NK (CHAK) cells. Cross-desensitization experiments show that IP-10 or Ltn use receptors not shared by other C, CC, or CXC chemokines. The chemotaxis induced by either IP-10 or Ltn for both cell types is inhibited upon pretreatment of these cells with pertussis toxin (PT). Also, Ltn-induced [Ca2+]i in IANK but not in CHAK cells is inhibited upon pretreatment with PT, whereas IP-10-induced [Ca2+]i in IANK and CHAK cells is inhibited upon pretreatment with this toxin. These results suggest important roles for PT-sensitive and -insensitive G-proteins in IP-10-induced and Ltn-induced chemotaxis and calcium fluxes in activated NK cells. This was further implicated after streptolysin O permeabilization of CHAK and IANK cells and after introduction of inhibitory antibodies to the PT-sensitive Gi and Go or the PT-insensitive Gq. Our results suggest that IP-10 and Ltn receptors are coupled to Gi, Go, and Gq in IANK cells and to Gi and Gq in CHAK cells, with a possible low coupling of IP-10, but not of Ltn, receptors to Go in these cells. Together, these results show that IP-10 and Ltn-dependent chemotaxis and calcium mobilization may differentiate at the level of receptor coupling to the heterotrimeric G-proteins.—Maghazachi, A. A., Skålhegg, B. S., Rolstad, B., Al-Aoukaty, A.

https://openalex.org/W1980000777,"Crk is an adaptor protein that consists almost entirely of SH2 and SH3 domains. We have previously demonstrated, by using in vivo and in vitro systems, that C3G, which was identified as a Crk SH3 domain-binding guanine nucleotide exchange factor, specifically activates Rap1. C3G also binds to other adaptor proteins, including CrkL and Grb2. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of Crk, CrkL, and Grb2 on the C3G-Rap1 pathway. Expression of Crk, CrkL, and Grb2 with C3G in Cos1 cells significantly increased the ratio of GTP/GDP bound to Rap1. Both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Crk were required for this activity. However, Crk did not stimulate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G for Rap1in vitro, suggesting that Crk does not activate C3G by an allosteric mechanism. The requirement of the SH2 domain of Crk for the enhancement of guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rap1 could be compensated for by the addition of a farnesylation signal to Crk, indicating that Crk enhanced the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G by membrane recruitment of C3G. These results demonstrate that Crk, CrkL, and Grb2 positively modulate the C3G-Rap1 pathway primarily by recruiting C3G to the cell membrane. Crk is an adaptor protein that consists almost entirely of SH2 and SH3 domains. We have previously demonstrated, by using in vivo and in vitro systems, that C3G, which was identified as a Crk SH3 domain-binding guanine nucleotide exchange factor, specifically activates Rap1. C3G also binds to other adaptor proteins, including CrkL and Grb2. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of Crk, CrkL, and Grb2 on the C3G-Rap1 pathway. Expression of Crk, CrkL, and Grb2 with C3G in Cos1 cells significantly increased the ratio of GTP/GDP bound to Rap1. Both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Crk were required for this activity. However, Crk did not stimulate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G for Rap1in vitro, suggesting that Crk does not activate C3G by an allosteric mechanism. The requirement of the SH2 domain of Crk for the enhancement of guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rap1 could be compensated for by the addition of a farnesylation signal to Crk, indicating that Crk enhanced the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G by membrane recruitment of C3G. These results demonstrate that Crk, CrkL, and Grb2 positively modulate the C3G-Rap1 pathway primarily by recruiting C3G to the cell membrane. It is now widely accepted that several domains consisting of short consensus motifs play crucial roles in signal transduction. SH2 and SH3 are good examples of such domains (1Pawson T.

A group of proteins, including Grb2, Crk, CrkL, and Nck, consist mostly of the SH2 and SH3 domains and are now known as adaptor proteins (7Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A.

Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the human crk gene generates two Crk proteins, designated as 28-kDa CrkI and 40/42-kDa CrkII (10Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). CrkII is composed of one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, whereas CrkI lacks the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. The SH2 domain of Crk binds epidermal growth factor receptor and Shc, which are phosphorylated by EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. stimulation (5Matsuda M.

Integrin stimulation also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas and paxillin, resulting in binding to Crk (12Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K.

Cellular targets of the SH3 domain of Crk include C3G, Sos, DOCK180, c-Abl, and EPS15 (17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell.

C3G was isolated by screening of expression libraries with the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Crk as a probe. The carboxyl-terminal region of C3G has homology to the catalytic domain of CDC25Mm, which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. Using both in vivo and in vitro systems, we demonstrated that the target GTPase of C3G is Rap1 (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Rap1, also known as smg p21 or Krev-1, was originally identified as an anti-oncogenic protein which efficiently reverses the morphologic transformation of the v-Ki-ras-expressing NIH 3T3 cell line, DT (23Noda M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18965-18971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on chimeras of Rap1 and H-Ras have suggested that Rap1 antagonizes Ras through the competition of the effector proteins of Ras (27Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is also supported by the observation that the activation of the c-fos promoter/enhancer from Ras, but not from the activated Raf-1, which is an immediate downstream effector of Ras, is inhibited by Rap1 (28Sakoda T. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K. Kishida S. Doi K. Hoshino M. Hattori S Takai Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1705-1711PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutively activated Rap1 efficiently inhibits Ras-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by lysophosphatidate or EGF (29Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Rap1 is regulated mostly by two groups of proteins. The first one is the GTPase-activating protein, which stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rap1. Two proteins have been shown to possess GTPase-activating protein activity for Rap1 (30Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P.

Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25542-25546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, C3G specifically stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of Rap1 among various Ras-family G proteins (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Our aim in this study was to analyze the effect of adaptor proteins that bind to C3G on the C3G-Rap1 pathway. We found that Crk enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of C3G, and that the enhancement occurs mostly by promoting of the translocation of C3G to the membrane. cDNAs of CrkI, CrkII, CrkI-R38V, and CrkI-W169L (34Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pCAGGS eukaryotic expression vector, generating pCAGGS-CrkI, pCAGGS-CrkII, pCAGGS-CrkI-R38V, and pCAGGS-CrkI-W169L, respectively (Fig. 1). Similarly, pCAGGS-Grb2 and pCAGGS-CrkL were constructed by ligating cDNA fragments of Grb2 and CrkL. pCAGGS-C3G, encoding the authentic C3G, was described previously (35Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment corresponding to the catalytic domain of C3G (amino acids 619–1077) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pCAGGS after the addition of the Myc-tag sequence to its 5′ end. The resulting vector was designated as pCAGGS-Myc-C3G-CD. pEBG-Rap1 encodes Rap1 fused to GST (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For the expression of farnesylated CrkI protein, the cDNA fragment corresponding to the CAAX box of Ki-Ras was fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of CrkI cDNA, as described previously (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The fused CrkI-CAAX box cDNA was subcloned into pCAGGS, generating pCAGGS-CrkI-F. Cos1 cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cos1 cells were transfected by DEAE-dextran method as described previously (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate method. Anti-Crk antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Production of the anti-C3G antibodies was described previously (35Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Anti-C3G 1A/1B and anti-C3G-C sera were raised against the central region (amino acids 285–676) and the carboxyl terminus region (amino acids 1065–1077) of C3G, respectively. The epitope of anti-C3G monoclonal antibody SN21 was in the region between amino acids 393–676. Anti-GST rabbit antibody was prepared in our laboratory. Guanine nucleotides bound to Rap1 were analyzed essentially as described previously (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 Cos1 cells plated on 35-mm dishes were transfected with 0.2 μg of expression plasmids by the DEAE-dextran method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 2 h with 0.05 mCi of32Pi in 0.5 ml of phosphate-free medium. GST-fused Rap1 was collected by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Guanine nucleotides bound to Rap1 were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated with a PhosphorImager analyzer, BAS2000 (Fuji Film). For the analysis of protein expression, cells were similarly processed without isotopic labeling. The cleared lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane, probed with various antibodies, and detected by ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G for Rap1 was measured as described previously (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of recombinant Rap1, C3G, and CrkI were described previously (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 34Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). C3G preincubated with GST or GST-CrkI was combined with [3H]GDP-loaded Rap1 and an excess of cold GTP. The radioactivity of [3H]GDP remaining on Rap1 was measured after a 20-min incubation at 30 °C. Cell fractionation was performed as described previously (36Hashimoto Y. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 869-875PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 Cos1 cells transfected with expression plasmids were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, disrupted by freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen, suspended with 150 μl of detergent-free W buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2). The soluble and the insoluble fraction were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. Proteins in the insoluble fraction were solubilized with 37.5 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used as a particulate fraction. 2 μl of soluble and 4 μl of particulate fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-C3G 1A/1B sera. 293T cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells in a 35-mm diameter dish and transfected with expression plasmids. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were starved for 14 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF (Takara Biochemicals, Kyoto) at 37 °C for 3 min. Cells were washed twice with TBS-V buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmNa3VO4) and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF receptor polyclonal antibody (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). The immune complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) or anti-C3G 1A/1B sera. Cos1 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding GST-tagged Rap1, C3G, and/or adaptor proteins. After 48 h, guanine nucleotides bound to GST-Rap1 were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 2, A andB). As reported previously (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), expression of C3G increased the ratio of GTP/(GDP + GTP) on Rap1. Expression of CrkI or CrkII remarkably enhanced the C3G-dependent increase of GTP-bound Rap1, whereas CrkI or CrkII alone did not affect the ratio of GTP/(GDP + GTP) on Rap1. Neither CrkI mutant with nonfunctional SH2, CrkI-R38V, nor that with nonfunctional SH3, CrkI-W169L, enhanced this C3G-dependent Rap1 activation. We confirmed that similar amounts of C3G and the wild-type and mutant Crk proteins were expressed in Cos1 cells (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrated that both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Crk were required for the enhancement of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G. We observed a similar enhancement of C3G activity by the other Crk-like protein, CrkL (Fig. 3,A and B). Another adaptor protein, Grb2, also increased the ratio of GTP to GDP on Rap1. However, the increase in GTP-bound Rap1 was less than that by CrkI, CrkII, or CrkL. In these experiments, coexpression of the adaptor proteins did not alter the level of C3G expression (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3CrkL and Grb2 also enhance the guanine-nucleotide exchange activity of C3G. A, Cos1 cells transfected with the expression plasmids encoding the proteins indicated on the bottom were labeled with 32Pias described in the legend to Fig. 2. B, the radioactivity of each spot was measured by PhosphorImager for calculation of the ratio of GTP to GTP + GDP. Mean values obtained from three samples are shown with standard deviations. C, in parallel experiments, cells without 32Pi labeling were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-C3G 1A/1B sera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the mechanism by which Crk enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G, we constructed a plasmid, C3G-CD, that encoded only the catalytic domain of C3G. To our surprise, C3G-CD activated Rap1 more efficiently than did the authentic C3G (Fig. 4,A and B). We examined the expression of C3G-CD and the wild-type C3G by an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal region of C3G. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the amount of C3G-CD was comparable to that of the wild-type C3G (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, the amino-terminal region of C3G appears to regulate negatively the guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rap1. Moreover, the catalytic activity of this C3G-CD mutant was enhanced no further by the co-expression of CrkI. This result strongly suggests that direct binding of Crk to the amino-terminal region of C3G is required for the up-regulation of C3G. To examine whether Crk activates C3G through an allosteric mechanism, we measured the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G in vitro in the presence or absence of CrkI. As shown in Fig. 5 A, addition of GST-fused CrkI did not enhance the catalytic activity of C3G for Rap1. The binding of the recombinant CrkI to C3G in vitrowas confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5 B). We concluded that binding of Crk to C3G is not sufficient to enhance the catalytic activity of C3G in vitro. The SH2 domain of Crk binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as EGF receptor (5Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 11Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), Shc (17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell.

These proteins are localized to the plasma membrane either constitutively or transiently after various stimulations. It is also known that overexpression of v-Crk or CrkI induces tyrosine phosphorylation of these Crk SH2-binding proteins either by the activation of tyrosine kinases or by the competitive inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (9Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 10Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been postulated that at least one of the functions of the SH2 domain of Crk is to recruit the SH3-binding proteins to the plasma membrane. To test this possibility, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of C3G in the presence or absence of CrkI. As shown in Fig. 6, co-expression of CrkI increased the amount of C3G in the particulate fraction. To examine whether membrane translocation of C3G can account for the activation of C3G by Crk, we constructed plasmids encoding CrkI-F and CrkI-R38V-F that have the Ki-Ras-derived CAAX box at the carboxyl termini of CrkI and CrkI-R38V, respectively. The CAAX box was shown to be farnesylated and required for the membrane-targeting of Ki-Ras protein. As shown in Fig. 7, Aand B, CrkI-R38V-F enhanced the activation of Rap1 by C3G to a level similar to that by CrkI-F. The expression level of C3G was not influenced by the expression of the wild-type and mutant CrkI proteins. This result clearly demonstrated that the SH2 domain of CrkI was not required when CrkI was localized to the plasma membrane by the farnesylation. Enhancement of the activation of C3G by CrkI-F was always less efficient than that by the wild-type CrkI, although CrkI-F was expressed more abundantly than the wild-type CrkI (Fig. 7 C). Expression of these wild-type and mutant CrkI did not alter the amount of C3G expressed in Cos1 cells (Fig. 7 C). We also confirmed that the addition of the farnesylation signal did not alter the amount of Crk bound to C3G in immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). It has been reported that Crk binds to EGF receptor upon EGF stimulation (11Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the EGF stimulation also recruits C3G to the EGF receptor in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 8, C3G bound to EGF receptor upon EGF stimulation in a manner dependent on the expression of CrkI. This result strongly suggests that Crk recruits C3G to the plasma membrane upon physiological stimulation. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the expression of Crk enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G to Rap1in vivo. Crk did not enhance the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G in vitro, arguing against the allosteric activation of C3G by Crk. Analysis by use of SH2 and SH3 mutants of Crk demonstrated that both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Crk are required for the enhancement. In contrast to CrkI-R38V, a CrkI mutant with a non-functional SH2 domain, the mutant that has a membrane localization signal on its carboxyl terminus, CrkI-R38V-F, enhanced the catalytic activity of C3G to a level similar to that of CrkI-F, the wild-type CrkI with a membrane localization signal. The result indicates that the function of the SH2 domain is essentially to recruit Crk to the plasma membrane. However, we should point out the difference between the membrane recruitment of C3G by CrkI and that by the farnesylation. The enhancement of C3G activity by CrkI-F was less efficient than that by the wild-type CrkI (Fig. 7). Thus, CrkI-F may not recruit C3G to the place where the optimum activation of C3G occurs. In the cells overexpressing v-Crk or CrkI, we and others observed the increase of several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins including paxillin and p130 cas, to which v-Crk and CrkI bind (9Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 10Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). C3G may be activated most efficiently in the close vicinity of these Crk-binding proteins, which is known to localize at the focal adhesions (8Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is unknown why membrane recruitment of C3G by CrkI enhances guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G. It is possible that the membrane targeting of C3G simply facilitates its interaction with the substrate, Rap1. Alternatively, C3G may be modified at the membrane and activated enzymatically. To address this question, we have to measure the specific activity of C3G from the cells with or without the expression of CrkI. We previously reported that farnesylated C3G activated Rap1 in Cos1 cells less efficiently than did the wild-type C3G (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This observation appears to argue against our proposal that CrkI enhances guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G by membrane recruitment. We have found that the amount of the farnesylated C3G expressed in Cos1 cells is significantly less than that of the wild-type; therefore, we cannot conclude that the farnesylated C3G was not as active as the wild-type C3G. Moreover, only the farnesylated C3G but not the wild-type C3G could revert the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells expressing Ki-Ras (22Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This finding supports our proposal that membrane-targeted C3G is more active than the wild-type C3G. The significance of the translocation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor to the membrane has been suggested for Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein of Ras (38Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 39Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Engelberg D. Li N.X. Alalawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this case, another adaptor protein, Grb2, recruits Sos to the membrane upon various stimulations, as we have observed for CrkI and C3G. It has also been reported that the binding of Grb2 to Sos does not activate Sos in vitro (42Nakanishi H. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Miura K. Miki H. Takenawa T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rap1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A at Ser169, located at the carboxyl-terminal basic region that is critical for the interaction with smg GDS (43Kawata M. Kikuchi A. Hoshijima M. Yamamoto K. Hashimoto E. Yamamura H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation stimulates the guanine nucleotide dissociation of Rap1 bysmg GDS (44Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we could not observe any difference in the phosphorylation level of Rap1 in the presence or absence of CrkI (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that Crk enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of C3G through the phosphorylation of Rap1. Crk and CrkL enhance the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G more efficiently than does Grb2. It is possible that Grb2 cannot alter C3G localization efficiently because Grb2 does not bind to C3G as strongly as do Crk and CrkL (45Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, because the SH2 domains of Crk and CrkL bind similar sets of proteins (45Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar, 46ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar), both may recruit C3G to a position closer to Rap1 than does Grb2. Experiments on SH2/SH3 chimeras of Crk/CrkL and Grb2 would be useful. C3G-CD, which lacks the amino-terminal region of C3G, catalyzed the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction for Rap1 more efficiently than did the authentic C3G. Although the in vitro study neglected the allosteric activation of C3G by Crk, it is still possible that expression of Crk can counteract the negative regulation of C3G by the amino-terminal region in vivo. A similar phenomenon is known for Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The deletion of the carboxyl-terminal Grb2-binding region sites enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange activity and the transforming activity of the farnesylated Sos protein (41Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N.X. Alalawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of the amino-terminal region of C3G has yet to be elucidated, it is possible that it is involved in the down-regulation of the C3G-Rap1 signaling pathway. We thank Y. Hashimoto and E. Kiyokawa for critical reading of this manuscript, and B. J. Mayer and T. Gotoh for materials and technical advice."

The codons specifying these amino acids in the cDNA encoding the V-PPase from Arabidopsis thalianawere singly mutated to examine their involvement in pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis and PPi-dependent H+ translocation and the functional significance of the similarities between the sequences encompassing Glu229(227–245) of the V-PPase and theN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-binding transmembrane α-helix of the c-subunits of F-ATPases (Nyren, P., Sakai-Nore, Y., and Strid, A. (1993) Plant Cell Physiol. 34, 375–378). Three functional classes were identified after heterologous expression of mutated enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Class I (E119Q, E229Q, D573N, E667Q, and E751Q) mutants exhibited PPi hydrolytic and H+ translocation activities and DCCD sensitivities similar to wild type. The one class II mutant obtained (E427Q) was preferentially impaired for H+translocation over PPi hydrolysis but retained sensitivity to DCCD. Class III (E305Q and D504N) mutants exhibited a near complete abolition of both PPi hydrolysis and H+translocation and residual activities with decreased DCCD sensitivity. In none of the mutants was diminished insertion of the V-PPase into the membrane or an increase in the background conductance of the membrane to H+ evident. The decoupled character of E427Q mutants and the enhancement of H+ pumping in E427D mutants by comparison with wild type, in conjunction with the retention of DCCD inhibitability in both E427Q and E427D mutants, implicate a role for Glu427 in DCCD-insensitive H+ translocation by the V-PPase. The proportionate diminution of PPi hydrolytic and H+ translocation activity and conservation of wild type DCCD sensitivity in E229Q mutants refute the notion that Glu229 is the residue whose covalent modification by DCCD is responsible for the abolition of PPi-dependent H+ translocation. Instead, the diminished sensitivity of the residual activities of E305Q and D504N mutants, but not E305D or D504E mutants, to inhibition by DCCD is consistent with the involvement of acidic residues at these positions in inhibitory DCCD binding.

The membranes constituting the vacuolysosomal complex of plant cells are unusual in possessing an H+ translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase 1The abbreviations used are: V-PPase, vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase; DCCD,N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; V-, F-, and P-ATPases, vacuolar-, mitochondrial-, and plasma membrane-type ATPases, respectively.1The abbreviations used are: V-PPase, vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase; DCCD,N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; V-, F-, and P-ATPases, vacuolar-, mitochondrial-, and plasma membrane-type ATPases, respectively.; EC 3.6.1.1) (2Rea P.A.

The V-PPase bears no systematic resemblance to soluble PPases at the sequence level (3Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 262-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Rea P.A. Kim Y. Sarafian V. Poole R.J. Davies J.M. Sanders D. Trends Biochem.

Kim Y. Sarafian V. Poole R.J. Davies J.M. Sanders D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike the V-ATPase, which is ubiquitous in the membranes bounding the acidic intracellular compartments of all eukaryotic cells, the V-PPase appears to be restricted to plants and a few species of phototrophic bacteria (2Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 157-180Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5Baltscheffsky M. Baltscheffsky H. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 331-348Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the intrinsic evolutionary interest of this phenomenon, it poses a problem: the lack of sequence-divergent homologs from phylogenically remote organisms. Because all published V-PPase sequences are from the same group of organisms, vascular plants, and exhibit greater than 85% sequence identity at the amino acid level (6Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. Adv. Bot. Res. 1997; 25: 297-337Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), most attempts to identify conserved amino acid residues of potential mechanistic significance by sequence alignment procedures have been unproductive. Crucial, therefore, has been the development of methods for the expression of functional pump in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2630-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When constructs of the yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pYES2, containing the entire open reading frame of the cDNA (AVP; Ref. 9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since the heterologously expressed pump is indistinguishable from the native plant enzyme, thereby establishing the sufficiency of AVP for the elaboration of active V-PPase inS. cerevisiae, approaches based on site-directed mutagenesis, epitope tagging, and expression of fusion proteins are now applicable to investigations of the membrane organization and catalytic mechanism of the V-PPase. By the parallel application of mutational and protein chemical methods, we have demonstrated a specific requirement for a cytosolically oriented Cys residue at position 634 for inhibition of the V-PPase by maleimides and the dispensability of all conserved Cys residues, including Cys634, for catalysis (8Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2630-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23342-23350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current studies of the V-PPase are directed at elucidating the involvement of acidic (Asp, Glu) residues located near or within hydrophobic spans in substrate turnover and/or H+ translocation. Two factors prompted investigation of these acidic residues. The first was the need to gain insight into the identity and location of acidic residues with the potential for undergoing cycles of protonation and deprotonation within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. On the basis of analyses of other H+ pumps and H+-coupled transporters, acidic residues associated with transmembrane spans might be expected to directly participate in H+ uptake, translocation, and release by the V-PPase. The second factor was the observations of Nyren et al. (1Nyren P. Sakainore Y. Strid A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 375-378PubMed Google Scholar), who noted that the sequences encompassed by positions 227–245 of the V-PPase fromArabidopsis bear a resemblance to the C-terminal regions of the c-subunits of F-ATPases. The C-terminal sequence flanking Glu229 in AVP is 71, 65, and 67% similar (35, 47, and 39% identical) to Rhodospirillum rubrum c-subunit (positions 58–74), Pisum sativum chloroplast subunit III (positions 61–77), and P. sativum mitochondrial subunit 9 (positions 55–72) (Fig. 1). Since the c-peptide, the most highly conserved subunit of the H+-conductive Fo sector of F-ATPases, binds the hydrophobic carboxyl reagent, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) at an acidic residue located in the middle of the second of the two transmembrane α helices of this polypeptide, to abolish H+translocation, Nyren et al. (1Nyren P. Sakainore Y. Strid A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 375-378PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that the sequence flanking Glu229 of the V-PPase may assume an analogous function. Specifically, in view of the sensitivity of the V-PPase to inhibition by DCCD (11Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that Glu229 is the residue whose covalent modification by this carbodiimide is responsible for the inhibition of PPi-dependent H+ translocation. Here we present (i) a revised topological model of the V-PPase, which, unlike those reported previously (9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Tanaka Y. Chiba K. Maeda M. Maeshima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 962-967Google Scholar), is derived from the concerted application of multiple computer-based structural criteria to the deduced sequences of the polypeptides specified by the cDNAs from several independent sources; and (ii) the single substitution of most of the conserved Asp and Glu residues inferred to be located near or within transmembrane spans on the basis of this topological model. The results of modeling are consistent with a structure for the V-PPase incorporating 15 transmembrane spans, while the results of mutagenesis demonstrate that Glu229 is unlikely to play a role in H+ translocation or inhibition of the V-PPase by DCCD. Instead, the characteristics of the mutants, combined with the inferred topology of the V-PPase, are better accommodated by a scheme in which membrane-embedded residues Glu305 and Asp504contribute to DCCD binding, whereas Glu427, which is located at the interface between a transmembrane span and its adjoining cytosolic loop, is required for coupling PPi hydrolysis with H+ translocation. The cDNA encoding the V-PPase from A. thaliana(AVP; Ref. 9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E. coli DH5α and CJ236 (dut − ung −) were employed for the amplification of pYES2-AVP and the generation of single-stranded, uracilated template for site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. Mutagenesis was performed directly on pYES2-AVP vector (8Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2630-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In all cases the mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to singly substitute each conserved Asp or Glu codon with an Asn or Gln codon on the basis of the cDNA sequence of AVP (9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The sequences of the eight oligonucleotides (positions of conserved Asp or Glu codons shown in bold type and positions of degeneracy shown in brackets) were: Glu119 → Gln, CGGCTCTGTT[C]AGGGATTCAGCAC; Glu229→ Gln, TCTTTTT[C]AGGCTATTACTGG; Glu305 → Gln, GGATCATATGCT[C]AAGCATCATGCGC; Glu427 → Gln, GTTTCGTCA-CT[C]AGTACTACACTAG; Asp504 → Asn, GGCAATT[A]ATGCTTATGGTCCC; Asp573→ Asn, CCACACCGTA[A]ATGTTTTGACC; Glu667 → Gln, CTTTGGAGTT[C]AGACCCTC-TCTGG; Glu751→ Gln, CATGGCTGTT[C]AGTCTCTTGTC. At four positions (Glu229, Glu305, Glu427, and Asp504), mutants in which the Asp codons were replaced by Glu codons or vice versa were also generated. The sequences of the four oligonucleotides used for this purpose were: Glu229 → Asp, TCTTTTTGA[C]GCTATTACTGG; Glu305 → Asp, GGATCATATGC-TGA[T/C]GCATCATGCGC; Glu427 → Asp, GTTTCGTCACTGA[C]TACTACACTAG; Asp504→ Glu, GGCAATTGA[G]GCTTATGGTCCC. Uracilated single-stranded template DNA was isolated from pYES2-AVP-transformed E. coli CJ236, and site-directed mutations were introduced by second strand synthesis from the template using mutant oligonucleotides (14Kunkel T.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). In all cases, mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing the target region before yeast transformation. In selected cases, when a pronounced alteration of V-PPase function was observed, the sequence of the target region of the AVPinsert of pYES2-AVP was determined after extraction of the vector from the yeast transformants. Yeast vacuolar membrane-enriched vesicles were prepared as described (8Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2630-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The standard mixture for reaction with DCCD contained 30 mmTris-Mes buffer (pH 8.0), the indicated concentrations of ligands (Mg2+ as MgSO4, K+ as KCl, PPi as Tris-PPi) and membrane protein (9.7–10.7 μg/ml). Reaction was initiated by the addition of DCCD (0–500 μm dissolved in ethanol), and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. After terminating the reaction by the addition of Mg2+ (1.3 mm), the samples were cooled on ice before assaying aliquots for V-PPase activity. Control samples were treated in an identical manner after the addition of equal volumes of ethanol. All stock DCCD solutions were prepared fresh daily. PPihydrolytic activity was measured as the rate of liberation of Pi from PPi at 37 °C in reaction media containing 0.3 mm Tris-PPi, 1.3 mmMgSO4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm NaF, 5 μm gramicidin-D, 1 mm Tris-EGTA, and 30 mm Tris-Mes (pH 8.0) (8Kim E.J.

Since yeast-soluble PPase, unlike the V-PPase, is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by fluoride ( Kiapp (soluble PPase) = 20 μm; Kiapp (V-PPase) = 3.4 mm) (16Baykov A.A. Dubnova E.B. Bakuleva N.P.

PPi- and ATP-dependent H+translocation was assayed fluorimetrically using acridine orange (2.5 μm) as transmembrane pH difference indicator in assay media containing vacuolar membrane-enriched vesicles (200 μg), 100 mm KCl, 0.4 m glycerol, 1 mmTris-EGTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Reaction was initiated by the addition of Tris-PPi (1.0 mm) to media containing MgSO4 (1.3 mm) in the case of V-PPase-mediated H+ translocation or by the addition of MgSO4 (3 mm) to media containing Tris-ATP (3 mm) in the case of V-ATPase-mediated H+translocation. The decrease in fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 540 nm, respectively (8Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2630-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The initial rate of H+ translocation and steady state pH gradient were estimated as ΔF%/mg/min (at time zero) and ΔF%/mg (after 5–10 min), where ΔF% = percentage decrease in fluorescence as described (17Rea P.A. Turner J.C. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 385-405Crossref Google Scholar). Coupling ratio (the ratio of the rate of H+ pumping to the rate of PPi hydrolysis) was estimated as (ΔF%/min)/(μmol of PPi hydrolyzed/min). Protein was estimated by a modification of the method of Peterson (18Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar). For Western analyses of the heterologously expressed V-PPase, membrane samples were delipidated by extraction with acetone:ethanol (1:1; −20 °C) (19Parry R.V. Turner J.C. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20025-20032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dissolved in denaturation buffer, and subjected to one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 11% (w/v) slab gels in a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus (7Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed samples were electrotransferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters in standard Towbin buffer (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar), containing 10% (v/v) methanol for 30 min at a current density of 2.5 mA/cm2 in a Millipore semi-dry blotting apparatus. After reversible staining of the transferred protein bands with Ponceau-S, the filters were processed for reaction with antibody (PABHK1) raised against synthetic peptide with the sequence HKAAVIGDTIGDPLK, corresponding to positions 720–734 of AVP (9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by successive incubations of the membrane filters with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and buffer containing 0.03% (w/v) H2O2, 0.5 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, and 0.03% (w/v) NiCl2 (21Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Data were fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis (22Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) using the Ultrafit nonlinear curve-fitting package from BioSoft (Ferguson, MO). Two programs were employed to model the overall topology of the V-PPase: TopPred II and MEMSAT (membrane structureand topology). The TopPred II program, developed by Manuel G. Claros and Gunnar von Heijne (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) for Macintosh computers is a public domain software package for predicting the topology of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins by the concerted application of hydropathy analyses, the “positive-inside” rule and “charge-difference” rule (23Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The MEMSAT program, developed by Jones et al. (24Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) for IBM PCs, is based on expectation maximization. From the distributions of amino acids compiled from membrane proteins, or portions thereof, of defined topology, the log-likelihood ratios (si) for domain classes are calculated for each of the 20 amino acids according to the expressionsi = ln (qi/pi) wherepi is the relative frequency of occurrence of amino acid i in all the sequences in the data set andqi is the relative frequency of occurrence of the same amino acid in a particular domain. These sivalues or propensities are then used to equate a given sequence with a given topology. The deduced amino acid sequences of the V-PPases encoded by the cDNAs isolated from A. thaliana (AVP, GenBank™ accession no. M81892) (9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Commun. 1993; 190: 962-967Google Scholar) were processed in parallel using both programs. A revised topological model of the V-PPase was derived from the deduced sequences of the polypeptides encoded by four cDNAs: AVP from A. thaliana(9Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), BVP1 and BVP2 from B. vulgaris(25Kim Y. Kim E.J. Rea P.A.

Commun. 1993; 190: 962-967Google Scholar). The model shown in Fig. 2 was the only one of the three predicted by the TopPred II and MEMSAT programs of Claros and von Heijne and Jones et al. (24Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) capable of accommodating a cytosolic orientation for both the C terminus and the hydrophilic loop containing the N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-reactive cysteine, Cys634, inferred from the characteristics of apoaequorin fusions (26Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and the results of peptide mapping and Cys mutagenesis, respectively (8Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23342-23350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the structure of the Mr 66,000 subunit of the V-PPase by TopPred II consisted of three main stages. (i) The first stage was the construction of hydrophobicity profiles using a trapezoid sliding window (27von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). Depending on the height and width of the hydrophobicity maxima and the preset “upper cutoff” and “lower cutoff” values for the computed hydrophobicity indices, spans were categorized as either “certain” or “putative.” (ii) The second stage was enumeration of the difference in representation of positively charged amino acid residues between the two sides of the membrane and tests of the adherence of any given model to the positive-inside rule, with the bias in favor of Arg and Lys residues in hydrophilic loops with a cytosolic disposition in most polytopic membrane proteins (28von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The third stage was application of the charge-difference rule (29Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 5786-5790Crossref Scopus (485) Google Scholar), wherein the net charge difference between the 15 N-terminal and the 15 C-terminal residues flanking the most N-terminal transmembrane span is computed. Transmembrane orientation is correlated with the disposition of charged residues in the immediate vicinity of the first membrane span. The segment C-terminal to the first span is generally positively charged with respect to the N-terminal flanking regions in membrane proteins possessing a luminally oriented N terminus (29Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 5786-5790Crossref Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Deployment of the MEMSAT program entailed analysis of segments of the sequence of the V-PPase in terms of their likelihood of being located within a particular topological element. Based on statistical analysis of the distribution of amino acids in membrane proteins, the MEMSAT program ranks amino acids according to their propensities for being associated with each of five types of topological element: two classes of hydrophilic loop, designated cytoplasmic (inside) loop (Li) and luminal (outside) loop (Lo), and three classes of transmembrane helix domain, designated helix inside (Hi), helix middle (Hm), and helix outside (Ho) (24Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The consensus structure consistent with the predictions from both programs, the disposition of Cys634, and the C-terminal apoaequorin fusion data was a 15-span model containing a luminally localized N terminus and cytoplasmically localized C terminus (Fig. 2). While MEMSAT ranked a 16-span model highest, with the additional span encompassing residues 743–761, two models containing 14 and 15 spans ranked just below this model. In the 14-span model, the two lowest scoring transmembrane spans in the 16-span model (V and VI) were excluded, thus preserving the orientation of the N and C termini and the remaining C-terminal spans. In the 15-span model, the last transmembrane span in the 16-span model (XVI) was excluded, thus transferring the C terminus from the luminal to the cytosolic face of the membrane while preserving the orientation of a"

Sequence variability between the N-terminal domains of the family members may contribute to the specific cellular function of each annexin. To identify proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain of synexin (annexin VII), a fusion protein was constructed composed of glutathioneS-transferase fused to amino acids 1–145 of human synexin. Affinity chromatography using this construct identified sorcin as a Ca2+-dependent synexin-binding protein. Overlay assays confirmed the interaction. The glutathioneS-transferase construct associates with recombinant sorcin over the range of pCa2+ = 4.7–3.1 with no binding observed at pCa2+ = 5.4. Overlay assays using deletion constructs of the synexin N-terminal domain mapped the sorcin binding site to the N-terminal 31 amino acids of the synexin protein. Additionally, synexin forms a complex with sorcin and recruits this protein to chromaffin granule membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Sorcin is able to inhibit synexin-mediated chromaffin granule aggregation in a manner saturable with increasing sorcin concentrations, but does not influence the Ca2+ sensitivity of synexin-mediated granule aggregation. Therefore, the interaction between sorcin and synexin may serve to regulate the functions of these proteins on membrane surfaces in a Ca2+-dependent manner.

The annexins are a family of homologous proteins that are characterized by their ability to bind phospholipid membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (1Burgoyne R.D. Geisow M.J. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Synexin (annexin VII) was the first to be isolated (2Creutz C.E. Pazoles C.J. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2858-2866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Creutz C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) on the basis of its ability to cause adrenal medullary chromaffin granule aggregation in vitro. Structurally, the annexins are composed of a conserved C-terminal core region containing four or eight repeats of a 70-amino acid sequence that is 40–60% conserved, and a unique N-terminal domain. The conserved core region is thought to be responsible for the annexin Ca2+ and lipid binding properties (4Glenney J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7247-7252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the N-terminal domains of this family are highly variable, leading to the hypothesis that the differences in the N-terminal domains may contribute to the specific cellular function of each annexin (9Naka M.

Although members of the annexin family have been implicated in playing diverse roles in cellular processes that include the anti-inflammatory response (5Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 94: 987-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), ion channel formation (6Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Haigler H.T. Parra C. Burns A.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), the physiological function has not been definitively determined for any annexin. However, it has been proposed that the annexins may perform their in vivo roles by interacting with other proteins. In fact, several members of the annexin family have been shown to bind members of the S100 subfamily of EF-hand proteins. Annexin I binds S100C (9Naka M. Qing Z. Sasaki T. Kise H. Tawara I.

J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), annexin II binds p11 (11Glenney Jr., J.R. Boudreau M. Galyean R. Hunter T. Tack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10485-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and annexin XI binds calcyclin (12Watanabe M. Ando Y. Tokumitsu H. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with each interaction characterized by the S100 protein binding to the N-terminal domain of the respective annexin. The annexin I-S100C and annexin XI-calcyclin interactions are Ca2+-dependent, while the annexin II-p11 interaction is Ca2+-independent. Most annexins have short N-terminal domains of less than 50 residues. However, synexin (annexin VII) has an N terminus composed of 167 amino acids. This domain is largely uncharged and is rich in proline, glycine, tyrosine, and glutamine residues (13Burns A.L. Magendzo K. Shirvan A. Srivasta M. Rojas E. Alijani M.R. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3798-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The function of this domain is particularly enigmatic, although annexin XI also has an N-terminal domain of similar size and amino acid composition (41Fernandez M.P. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Morgan R.O. Genomics. 1996; 37: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and this domain has been shown to interact with calcyclin (12Watanabe M. Ando Y. Tokumitsu H. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to function as a nuclear localization signal in a cell type-specific manner (38Mizutani A. Watanabe N. Kitao T. Tokumitsu H. Hidaka H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The expression of mammalian annexins in yeast secretory mutants has yielded results that suggest that there may be a synexin binding protein that interacts with the N-terminal domain of the annexin. When human synexin is expressed in the late sec mutantssec2, sec4, and sec15, their growth is inhibited and their content of secretory vesicles is increased (14Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of the N-terminal domain with full-length synexin inhibits this synthetic lethality. 1C. E. Creutz, unpublished data. It is possible that the effect of the N-terminal domain is due to competition with an interacting protein at a specific binding site. Since annexins, in general, must be extracted in EGTA-containing buffers to remove them from membranes, it is possible that proteins that interact with annexins in a Ca2+-dependent manner are lost during isolation of the annexins. Therefore, we have focused our attention on identifying proteins that bind annexins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To identify intracellular mammalian proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain of synexin, a fusion protein consisting of glutathioneS-transferase and the N-terminal domain of synexin was constructed. Utilizing this fusion protein in affinity chromatography and overlay techniques, we have identified sorcin, an intracellular EF-hand, Ca2+-binding protein, as a synexin-binding protein. The following reagents were obtained from commercial sources: pGEX-KG expression vector (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) (15Guan K. Dixon J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), glutathione and anti-glutathione S-transferase (anti-GST) 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. polyclonal antiserum (Sigma), glutathione-Sepharose and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), and Super Signal CL-HRP Substrate System (Pierce). Recombinant human annexin I and the synexin used in the sorcin overlays of full-length untagged synexin were expressed in yeast and purified as described previously (14Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar). The synexin N-terminal domain from residues 1–145 was amplified by PCR from human synexin cDNA that had been previously subcloned into a yeast expression vector (14Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream primer incorporated aNcoI site at the initiation codon and consequently changed the second amino acid, following the initiating methionine, from a serine to an alanine. The downstream primer incorporated aHindIII site and a termination codon adjacent to the codon for amino acid residue 145. The PCR product was ligated into the yeast expression vector YEpC21 (14Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar), from which it was subsequently excised with NcoI and HindIII and then ligated into the complementary sites of pGEX-KG. The resulting construct (pGEX-KG-syntail) creates a fusion protein between GST and amino acids 1–145 of human synexin where amino acid 2 of synexin has been changed from serine to alanine to facilitate subcloning into theNcoI site. The identity of the construct was verified by sequencing using the Sanger method (16Sanger F. Coulsen A.R. Barreli B.G. Smith A.J. Roe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer. Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells were transformed with pGEX-KG-syntail, and an ampicillin-resistant colony was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB medium having a concentration of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This preculture was grown to stationary phase overnight at 37 °C. One liter of LB-ampicillin was inoculated the following morning with the preculture and was grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm and incubation at 37 °C was continued for 5 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3), and lysed by sonication in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10000 × g, 10 min), and the fusion protein in the resulting supernatant was isolated by binding to GSH-Sepharose. Following several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the GST fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein was then stored frozen at −20 °C until use. SDS-PAGE of the dialyzed protein followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel revealed one major protein band at 41 kDa. Postmicrosomal supernatants were prepared from adrenal medullary tissue as described previously (17Creutz C.E. Dowling L.G. Sando J.J. Villar-Pilasi C. Whipple J.H. Zaks W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14664-14674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity matrix was prepared as follows; 1.5 mg of the GST-synexin N-terminal domain construct or unfused GST protein prepared as described above was suspended in 20 ml of coupling buffer (500 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaHCO3) with 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol added and mixed with a slurry of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B prepared from 5 g of freeze-dried powder according to the manufacturer's (Pharmacia) recommendations. Coupling was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C on a rocking table. The gel was then washed once with coupling buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 250 ml of 1 methanolamine chloride, pH 8.0. Affinity chromatography was performed using an adaptation of the method that was described previously (17Creutz C.E. Dowling L.G. Sando J.J. Villar-Pilasi C. Whipple J.H. Zaks W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14664-14674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the coupled Sepharose was washed with 50 ml of column buffer (240 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, and 25 mm HEPES-NaOH adjusted to pH 7.3 at 37 °C) and packed into a water-jacketed column (1.6 cm × 7.5 cm), giving a bed volume of approximately 15 ml. The column temperature was maintained at 37 °C during chromatography. All column buffers were pumped with an LKB Microperpex peristaltic pump operated at maximum speed (2 ml/min). The packed column was washed with 50 ml of column buffer, to which 4 mm CaCl2 had been added such that the final free Ca2+ concentration equaled 2 mm. Solutions of NaCl, HEPES, MgCl2, EGTA, and CaCl2 were added to 40 ml of the postmicrosomal supernatant so that the final concentrations equaled those of the Ca2+-containing buffer. The postmicrosomal supernatant, containing 200–300 mg of protein, was then applied to the column, and the column was subsequently washed with 50 ml of column buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 2 mm free Ca2+. Ca2+-dependent binding proteins were eluted from the column with 50 ml of column buffer (containing 2 mm EGTA) to which no CaCl2 had been added. p22 was separated from the other proteins found in the peak fractions of the GST-synexin N-terminal domain fusion protein column by SDS-PAGE. The 22-kDa protein band was first excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then the protein was electroeluted from the polyacrylamide slice. The electroeluted protein was precipitated with chloroform and methanol to remove SDS and Coomassie Blue. Fifty microliters of 8 m urea was added to the precipitated protein and was then diluted to 200 μl to give 2m urea and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Three hundred nanograms of lysyl peptidase purified from Achromobacter lyticus (Waco Bioproducts, Richmond, VA) was added, and the sample was incubated for 15 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were separated using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; Buffer B, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The amino acid sequences of two peptides were determined by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas phase sequencer with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Four micrograms of the proteins found in the peak fractions of the GST-synexin N-terminal domain fusion protein column that contained sorcin were separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and the nitrocellulose filter was blocked overnight in blocking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2H PO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.3), 2 mm CaCl2, and 5% nonfat dry milk) at 4 °C. Individual strips were then incubated for 1 h in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5% bovine serum albumin) with either 5 μg/ml unfused GST protein or 5 μg/ml GST-synexin N-terminal domain construct. All wash steps consisted of three 10-min incubations with blocking buffer. The strips were washed and then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against GST (1:1500 dilution). Following another wash step, the strips were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer with a goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (1:1500 dilution). Following a final wash, binding was detected using a chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). Sorcin cDNA was amplified by PCR from human heart cDNA (CLONTECH) using primers that incorporatedNcoI and SacI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA, respectively. The amplified product was subcloned into pGEX-KG and used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue. The identity of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial growth, protein induction, and isolation of the fusion protein were performed as described above. However, following the final wash with phosphate-buffered saline, the GSH-Sepharose beads were washed twice with cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). To cleave sorcin from the fusion protein, thrombin (Boehringer Mannheim, 0.5 unit/0.5 ml of slurry) was added to the bead slurry and incubated for 40 min at room temperature on a rotator. Released protein was recovered by washing 5–6 times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA). Recombinant protein was dialyzed overnight in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 with 2 mm EGTA and was further purified by application to an FPLC Poros Q anion exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and elution with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris. Sorcin eluted between 0.2 and 0.25 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE of the column fractions followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel revealed one protein band at approximately 23 kDa. Polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against recombinant sorcin according to methods described previously (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.12.1-11.12.9Google Scholar). Eight micrograms of the synexin-(1–145) GST fusion protein bound to GSH-Sepharose were incubated on ice for 20 min with 4 μg of recombinant sorcin in binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 240 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100) to which Ca2+-EGTA buffer was added to give a final concentration of 2.5 mm EGTA and the desired Ca2+ concentration. The final Ca2+concentration of each buffer was verified with a calcium-selective electrode (Radiometer). After binding, the beads were rapidly washed with 1 ml of the appropriate Ca2+ binding buffer and were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Full-length human synexin cDNA was amplified by PCR off of the vector Cao3, which is a derivative of YEpDB60-synexin (14Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar) in which the leu2 gene is disrupted. PCR was performed with primers that incorporated XbaI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA, respectively. The amplified product was subcloned into pGEX-KG, which was used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue. The identity of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial growth, protein induction, isolation of the protein, and cleavage with thrombin were performed as described for recombinant sorcin. However, the synexin wash buffer consisted of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA. Recombinant synexin was dialyzed overnight in 25 mm MES, pH 6.0 with 1 mm EGTA. The protein was further purified by application to an FPLC Poros S cation exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated with 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 500 μm Ca2+at 4 °C and elution with a linear gradient of 0–1 m KCl in 25 mm MES. To promote binding of synexin to the Poros S resin, the Ca2+ concentration of the protein solution was brought to 2 mm before loading onto the column. Recombinant synexin eluted between 0.25 to 0.3 m KCl. SDS-PAGE of the column fractions followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel revealed one protein band at approximately 48 kDa. Polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against recombinant synexin according to methods described previously (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.12.1-11.12.9Google Scholar). The human cDNAs for the synexin N-terminal region deletions were amplified by PCR off of the vector pGEX-KG-synexin. PCR was performed with primers that incorporated XbaI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA, respectively. The amplified products were subcloned into pGEX-KG and were transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue. The identities of all of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Three constructs were made that deleted C-terminal portions of the first 145 amino acids that comprise the synexin N-terminal domain. These include NT-(1–118), NT-(1–83), and NT-(1–31), where the numbering system indicates the amino acid residues of synexin that are included in the fusion protein. Five additional constructs were made that deleted N-terminal portions of this domain, and include NT-(9–145), NT-(14–145), NT-(21–145), NT-(31–145), and NT-(80–145). Bacterial growth, protein induction, and isolation of these fusion proteins were performed as described above. GSH-Sepharose beads with 4 μg of fusion protein bound were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The protein was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was then transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose filter was blocked overnight in overlay assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5% nonfat dry milk) at 4 °C. The immobilized proteins were then incubated for 1 h in overlay assay buffer with 2 μg/ml recombinant human sorcin. All wash steps consisted of three 10-min incubations with overlay assay buffer. The nitrocellulose filters were washed and then incubated for 1 h in overlay assay buffer with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against sorcin (1:10,000 dilution). Following another wash step, the immobilized proteins were incubated for 1 h in overlay assay buffer with a goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (1:10,000 dilution). Following a final wash, sorcin binding was detected using a chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). A control was performed as described above, but using only the sorcin antiserum with no protein overlay to determine background antiserum binding levels. Fusion proteins were visualized by performing Western blots with GST antiserum (Sigma). Recombinant human synexin was expressed in yeast without a fusion tag and was purified by binding bovine brain lipid vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ as described previously (14Creutz C.E. Kambouris N.G. Snyder S.L. Hamman H.C. Nelson M.R. Liu W. Rock P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1177-1192PubMed Google Scholar). Postmicrosomal supernatants were prepared from adrenal medullary tissue as described previously (17Creutz C.E. Dowling L.G. Sando J.J. Villar-Pilasi C. Whipple J.H. Zaks W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14664-14674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five micrograms of purified synexin or 65 μg of postmicrosomal supernatant were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were transferred to nitrocellulose. Sorcin overlay assays were performed exactly as described above for the sorcin overlays of the deletion constructs. Controls were performed using the sorcin antiserum with no protein overlay to determine background antiserum binding levels. A cDNA encoding human annexin XI was obtained as an I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone (ID26147, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) (40Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the first 121 N-terminal amino acids of annexin XI was amplified by PCR using primers that incorporatedXbaI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA, respectively. The amplified product was subcloned into pGEX-KG and was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The identity of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial growth, protein induction, and isolation of the fusion protein were performed as described for the GST-syntail construct. The GST-annexin XI construct was further purified by application to an FPLC Poros Q anion exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and elution with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris. GST-annexin XI N-terminal domain fusion protein eluted between 0.15 and 0.2 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE of the column fractions followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel revealed a major protein band at approximately 40 kDa and several minor, lower molecular weight degradation bands. Binding assays of recombinant sorcin to the annexin XI construct were performed as described above for measuring the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction between sorcin and the synexin N-terminal domain. Chromaffin granules were purified from bovine adrenal medullary tissue by differential centrifugation in 300 mmsucrose as described previously (18Pazoles C.J. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3962-3969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromaffin granule aggregation was assayed by measuring the change in turbidity (absorbance at 540 nm) of 1-ml granule suspensions in aggregation buffer (40 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 240 mm sucrose) at room temperature (2Creutz C.E. Pazoles C.J. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2858-2866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbance measurements were made using a Beckman DU70 microprocessor-controlled spectrophotometer, which allowed for absorbance data collection as a function of time for four assays simultaneously. Ca2+-EGTA buffer was added to give a final concentration of 2.5 mm EGTA, and the desired Ca2+ concentration was verified with a Ca2+electrode (Radiometer). The initial absorbance was measured for 1 min, and then aggregation was induced by the addition of protein. Absorbance was monitored for an additional 10 min. Recombinant protein binding to granules was analyzed by pelleting the granules by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The supernatants were desalted by gel filtration, lyophilized, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and also run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Binding was quantitated by densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels using the Collage Image Information Program (Image Dynamics Corp.). Total protein values were calculated as the sum of the densitometric values of the protein bands on the pellet and supernatant gels. For phase microscopy, chromaffin granule suspensions were mixed with both protein and Ca2+ (800 μm) and were allowed to aggregate at room temperature for 30 min before samples were imaged with a Nikon Optiphot microscope. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 10% gels. The following standards were used for molecular mass determination: phosphorylase b, 97 kDa; serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 31 kDa; trypsinogen, 21 kDa; ribonuclease, 14 kDa. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Western immunoblots were performed as described by Burnette (21Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar), using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and a chemiluminescent substrate system for detection (Pierce). To determine whether cytosolic proteins of the bovine adrenal medulla were able to bind to the synexin N-terminal domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner, affinity chromatography with the GST-synexin N-terminal domain fusion protein bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was performed. The postmicrosomal supernatant from bovine adrenal medullary tissue with an added 2 mm CaCl2 was applied to the GST-synexin N-terminal domain fusion protein column. A distinct protein peak eluted from the column when Ca2+-dependent binding proteins were released with buffer containing 2 mm EGTA (Fig. 1 A). The protein found in the peak frac"

https://openalex.org/W2043105753,"Because the polypeptide core of α-dystroglycan is encoded by a single gene, the difference in apparent molecular mass between α-dystroglycans expressed in various tissues is presumably due to differential glycosylation. However, little is presently known about the tissue-specific differences in α-dystroglycan glycosylation and whether these modifications may confer functional variability to α-dystroglycan. We recently observed that laminin-1 binding to skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan was dramatically inhibited by heparin, whereas the binding of commercial merosin to skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan was only marginally inhibited (Pall, E. A., Bolton, K. M., and Ervasti, J. M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 3817–3821). In contrast to 156-kDa skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan, both laminin-1 and merosin binding to 120-kDa brain α-dystroglycan were sensitive to heparin. We have now examined the laminin binding properties of 140-kDa α-dystroglycan purified from cardiac muscle and observed that like skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan, heparin inhibited cardiac α-dystroglycan binding to laminin-1, but not to merosin. On the other hand, cardiac and brain α-dystroglycans could be distinguished from skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan by their reactivity with the terminal GalNAc-specific lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin. Interestingly, skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan became reactive with V. villosa agglutinin upon digestion with sialidase from Clostridium perfringens,Arthrobacter neurofaciens, or Streptococcus, but not Vibrio cholerae or Newcastle disease virus sialidase. While none of the sialidase treatments affected the laminin binding properties of α-dystroglycan, the sum of our results suggests that skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan contains a novel sialic acid residue linked α2–6 to GalNAc. These properties are also consistent with the cellular characteristics of a GalNAc-terminated glycoconjugate recently implicated in neuromuscular synaptogenesis. Thus, variations in α-dystroglycan sialoglycosylation may prove as useful markers to further elucidate the role of α-dystroglycan glycoforms in different tissues and perhaps within a single cell type.

Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) originally identified as a subunit of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (2Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) that is missing or abnormal in a number of muscular dystrophies (3Campbell K.P.

In skeletal muscle, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is distributed throughout the sarcolemmal membrane (5Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J.

For example, a highly similar complex of proteins (including α-dystroglycan) is associated with utrophin (15Matsumura K. Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P.

Loechel F. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1483-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and explain why laminin-1 up-regulation fails to compensate for merosin deficiency in some forms of muscular dystrophy (45Xu H.

Neurology. 1995; 45: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings with different laminins, alternatively spliced forms of agrin also bind α-dystroglycan in either a heparin-sensitive or -insensitive manner, dependent on the presence of a four-amino acid sequence at the A/Y splice site (27Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 47O'Toole J.J. Deyst K.A.

In contrast to our findings with 156-kDa skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan, we further observed that both laminin-1 and merosin binding to 120-kDa brain α-dystroglycan were sensitive to heparin (43Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3817-3821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that tissue-specific differences in α-dystroglycan post-translational modification may influence its interactions with extracellular ligands. Cardiac muscle α-dystroglycan exhibits an electrophoretic mobility intermediate (140 kDa) to that of skeletal and brain α-dystroglycans (7Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 8Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J.

Res. 1993; 72: 349-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it could exhibit laminin binding properties more similar to skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan, brain α-dystroglycan, or somewhere in between. Therefore, we have now examined the effect of heparin on the binding of purified cardiac muscle α-dystroglycan to laminin-1 and merosin. Our results suggest that cardiac and skeletal muscle α-dystroglycans are functionally related but distinct from nervous tissue α-dystroglycans with regard to merosin binding in the presence of heparin. However, we further demonstrate that cardiac muscle and brain α-dystroglycans appear to be similarly modified with terminal GalNAc residues, which are also present on skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan, but masked by a novel sialic acid modification. While sialic acid modification does not appear to be important for the laminin binding properties of α-dystroglycan, we discuss situations in which differences in sialoglycosylation may reflect α-dystroglycan glycoforms with unique or varied function, even in the same cell. α-Dystroglycan was solubilized from rabbit skeletal muscle membranes (49Yoshida M.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards were purchased from Sigma. α-Dystroglycan was identified on nitrocellulose membranes with 1 μg/ml specific polyclonal antibodies affinity-purified (1Ervasti J.M.

Primary antibody labeling of α-dystroglycan was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-chicken secondary antibody (Calbiochem) by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal CL-HRP (Pierce) as substrate. To evaluate lectin binding to α-dystroglycan, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 42 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20. Blocked membranes were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated Vicia villosa agglutinin isolectin B4 (VVA-B4), Psophocarpus tetragonolobus agglutinin (PTA), Dolichos biflorusagglutinin (DBA), WGA, peanut agglutinin (PNA) (all from Sigma), or lima bean agglutinin (LBA) (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). After two 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline, lectin staining was detected by chemiluminescence. To assess laminin and merosin binding to α-dystroglycan, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were rinsed briefly with TBS (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 μg/ml native laminin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or merosin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the absence or presence of 1 mg/ml porcine mucosal heparin (Sigma). Laminin/merosin-binding proteins were detected with affinity-purified polyclonal laminin antibodies (Sigma) by chemiluminescence (43Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, Immulon 1 removable microtiter wells (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with laminin or merosin in TBS; aspirated; and blocked with TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2. Triplicate wells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1 nm125I-labeled cardiac α-dystroglycan in 0.1 ml of TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2 in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration of heparin. After two brief washes with TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, the wells were counted in a Packard 5650 γ-counter. Purified α-dystroglycans in 1% SDS were incubated at 100 °C for 5 min; diluted 10-fold into 0.5m acetate, pH 5.5, and 1% Triton X-100; and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of sialidase (10 milliunits/μg α-dystroglycan) from Vibrio cholerae,Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter neurofaciens (all from Boehringer Mannheim), Newcastle disease virus (Oxford GlycoSystems Inc., Rosedale, NY), or nonpathogenicStreptococcus strain 6646K (Seikagaku America Inc., Ijamsville, MD). Purified brain α-dystroglycan was digested with jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, chicken liver α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, or Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (all from Sigma) as described previously (40Scott L.J.C. Bacou F. Sanes J.R. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 932-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control and enzyme-digested samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the blotting assays described above. The laminin-1 and merosin binding properties of cardiac muscle α-dystroglycan were first qualitatively compared in the blot overlay assay (Fig. 1 A).

Previous studies have shown that Fas exists in monomeric form in resting cells and aggregates upon cross-linking to form a complex that serves to recruit additional signaling molecules to the cell membrane. To study the molecular fate of the Fas antigen following receptor activation, a monoclonal antibody specific for the cell death domain of Fas has been generated. This monoclonal antibody (3D5) could be used in Western blot analysis using total cell lysates to identify different forms of Fas antigens without immunoprecipitation. High molecular mass (>200 kDa), SDS- and β-mercaptoethanol-resistant Fas aggregates were formed immediately following receptor cross-linking, and a 97-kDa band (p97) was detected about 2 h later. p97 could be detected by antibodies against either the death domain or the C terminus. However, p97 could not be precipitated by antiextracellular domain antibodies. Thus, p97 most likely represents a processed form of the high molecular weight Fas aggregates. Although p97 generation followed a similar time course as CPP32 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, it could not be inhibited by cysteine protease, calpain, or proteasome inhibitors.

In resting cells, the Fas antigen exists as monomers that aggregate to form a high molecular weight complex upon receptor ligation (2Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M.

This cytoplasmic domain, also found in TNFR1, is called the death domain because of its role in cell death induction (4Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N.

Thus, in principle, Fas signaling could be accomplished by sequential recruitment of FADD/MORT1 and FLICE/MACH to the receptor complex, which may lead to FLICE/MACH activation and triggering of the subsequent protease cascade (10Fraser A.

To examine the biochemistry of Fas signaling in more detail, a monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of Fas was prepared. This monoclonal antibody (3D5) can be used in Western blot analysis using total cell lysates, allowing for examination of different forms of Fas antigens without immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, 3D5 allows for detection of Fas fragments that lack the extracellular domain. Here, we show that a 97-kDa band (p97) was detected about 2 h after formation of high molecular weight Fas aggregates. p97 cannot be precipitated by anti-extracellular domain antibody but can be detected with anti-C terminus antibody. It most likely represents a processed form of Fas that lacks the extracellular domain. Although p97 generation parallels CPP32 activation and PARP cleavage (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y.

Furthermore, p97 generation cannot be inhibited by calpain and proteasome inhibitors. Burkitt's lymphoma Raji, T cell leukemia Jurkat, promyelocytic leukemia HL60, chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, and mouse myeloma Sp2/0-Ag14 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Burkitt's lymphoma BJAB was a generous gift from Dr. Fred Wang (Harvard). All of the cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone. DX2, a mouse mAb (IgG1) specific for an epitope on the extracellular domain of human Fas was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). CH11, a mouse mAb (IgM) specific for an epitope on the extracellular domain of human Fas, was purchased from PanVera (Madison, WI). Goat anti-mouse IgM used for immunoprecipitation was obtained from Cappel (Durham, NC). Fas/C-20 (rabbit antiserum recognizing the carboxyl terminus of Fas (amino acids 300–319)), Fas/N-18 (rabbit antiserum recognizing the amino terminus of Fas (amino acids 5–22)), and PARP/N-20 (goat antiserum recognizing the N terminus of PARP (amino acids 1–20)) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CPP32 and anti-FADD were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). cDNA encoding human Fas was a generous gift of Dr. Nagata (Osaka University, Japan). cDNA of the cytoplasmic domain (Fas-CD) was amplified by PCR using the following primer set: wt-f (5′-CGCGGATCCAAGAGAAAGGAAGT-3′) and wt-r (5′-CGATGAATTCAGTATTTACAGCCAGC-3′). The conditions for PCR were 30 s at 93 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles. The PCR product for Fas-CD was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pGEX-2TK bacterial expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate plasmid pGEX-2TK/WT. Deletion mutants ΔN-1 and ΔN-2 were constructed by amplifying pGEX-2TK/WT using reverse primer wt-r and forward primers Δn-1-f (5′-CGCGGATCCGATGTTGACTTGAGTAAATAT-3′) and Δn-2-f (5′-CGCGGATCCATCACCACTATTGCTGGAGTC-3′). Deletion mutants ΔC-1 and ΔC-2 were constructed with forward primer wt-f and reverse primers Δc-1-r (5′-CGATGAATTCAAGTCTGAATTTTCTCTGC-3′ and Δc-2-r (5′-CGATGAATTCAACTAGTAATGTCCTTGAGG-3′). LPR point mutant was constructed by PCR as described previously (3Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX-2TK/WT was used as template, and primers wt-f, wt-r, lpr-f (5′-TTCGAAAGAATGGTAACAATGAAGCCAAA-3′), and lpr-r (5′-TTTGGCTTCATTGTTACCATTCTTTCGAA-3′) complementary to lpr-f were used. The PCR products for Fas mutants ΔN-1, ΔN-2, ΔC-1, ΔC-2, and LPR were digested with BamHI andEcoRI and subcloned into pGEX-2TK to generate the plasmids pGEX-2TK/ΔN-1, pGEX-2TK/ΔN-2, pGEX-2TK/ΔC-1, pGEX-2TK/ΔC-2, and pGEX-2TK/LPR. Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as described (14Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL 21 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) transformed with the pGEX-2TK recombinants was grown logarithmically (500 ml, A600 = 0.8) and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 2.5 h. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 100 μg/ml egg white lysozyme (Sigma). Bacteria pellet was lysed on ice by mild sonication and centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Bacterial supernatants were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 750 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) that had been previously washed three times and resuspended (final concentration, 1:1 (v/v)) in NETN. Coated glutathione-Sepharose beads were then washed three times with NETN. For analysis of bound fusion proteins, beads were incubated in a sample buffer containing 2% SDS at 45 °C for 1 h and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Female BALB/c mice were immunized with the cytoplasmic domain of human Fas (Fas-CD). Splenic cells were fused with mouse myeloma Sp2/0-Ag14 cells, and hybrids were selected in culture medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine. Supernatants of hybrid cultures were screened by slot blotting using GST-Fas-CD immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). 620 supernatants were screened, and 15 positive clones were identified. Positive hybrids were subcloned twice by limiting dilution without feeder cells. During limiting dilution, only one subclone (3D5) that stably secreted mAb was obtained. 3D5 (IgG1 κ) was isotyped by Immuno Pure mAb Isotyping Kit I (Pierce). Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed as described (15Thomas L.J. Urakaze M. DeGasperi R. Kamitani T. Sugiyama E. Chang H.M. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 1.25 μg/ml of DX2 for 30 min on ice followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). After fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde, cells were analyzed with a Coulter Cytometry Profile 1 (Coulter, Hiaeleah, FL). Immunoabsorption was performed by using glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with GST fusion proteins to remove antibodies reacting with the fusion proteins. 1 μl of diluted anti-Fas antibody (1:1500) or nondiluted 3D5 culture supernatant was incubated overnight with GST-, GST-Fas-IC-, or GST-FADD-coated beads. Then the bead suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for Western blotting as a postimmunoabsorbed antibody. For resting samples, 3 × 106 cells were used after washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline. For activated samples, 3 × 106 cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml CH11 at 37 °C, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged. To prevent protein degradation, cell pellets were snap frozen. Frozen pellets were treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 300 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. DNAs in the samples were sheared with a 25-gauge needle. For SDS-PAGE, 3 μl of the solubilized sample (equivalent to 3 × 104 cells) was loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) with an electroblotting system (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 h at a constant voltage of 100 V. The membrane was blocked at room temperature for 1 h with TBS-T (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk (Carnation, Glendale, CA), incubated with a primary antibody in TBS-T containing 1% dry milk for 1 h, and washed for 5 min with TBS-T three times. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h. Specific bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). The immunoprecipitation method described by Kischkel et al. (2Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P. Peter M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. For cross-linked samples, 5 × 107 cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml CH11 at 37 °C and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were transferred to liquid nitrogen and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol for 15 min on ice. Postnuclear supernatants were added to 10 μg of anti-Fas or anti-mouse IgM coupled to 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) and rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were treated with 30 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 μl of solubilized samples (equivalent to 1 × 107 cells) were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. N-Acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-methional (LLM; calpain inhibitor II) andN-acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL; calpain inhibitor I or proteasome inhibitor) were purchased from Sigma. z-DEVD-CH2F and z-VAD-CH2F were kindly provided by Dr. Larry Denner (Texas Biotechnology Corp., Houston, TX). 3 × 106 Jurkat cells were preincubated at 37° C in 1 ml of culture medium containing LLM (50 μm), LLnL (50 μm), z-DEVD (100 μm), or z-VAD (100 μm) for 1 h. 0.5 μg/ml of CH11 were added for an additional 4 h. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were snap frozen and lysed in 300 μl of the SDS treating solution. Total cell lysate was prepared as described above. 3 μl of lysate (equivalent to 3 × 104 cells) was used for Western blotting. Antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of Fas antigen have been used exclusively in the past to study the Fas molecule and its associated proteins. To gain more insight into the biochemical event following Fas activation, antisera and monoclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of human Fas were generated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western blot analysis was performed in a panel of human cell lines that expressed different amounts of Fas antigens on their cell surface. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Fas antigen could be detected in BJAB, Raji, and Jurkat, but not in K562 and HL60 by antiserum directed against the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. The amount of Fas antigen detected in the Western blot closely resembled the amount detected with an anti-extracellular domain mAb by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 A). An mAb against the cytoplasmic domain of Fas (clone 3D5) was also applied in Western blot analysis with identical result (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, there was significant heterogeneity in the molecular size of the Fas antigen in different cell lines. The protein backbone of the human Fas has an estimated molecular mass of 36 kDa (16Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). BJAB and Raji cells expressed two major bands (40 and 50 kDa) and a minor band (42 kDa), whereas Jurkat cells expressed a doublet of 45 and 46 kDa. The heterogeneity in molecular weight is most likely due to differential glycosylation of the twoN-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain of Fas (16Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). One of the anti-Fas cytoplasmic domain monoclonal antibodies, 3D5, was further characterized. A panel of GST fusion proteins linked to the mutated cytoplasmic domain of human Fas illustrated in Fig. 2 A were prepared. Purity of the fusion proteins was tested with SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2 B). The epitope recognized by 3D5 was identified by Western blot analysis using GST fusion proteins as targets (Fig. 2 C). As shown, 3D5 did not react with GST, but it reacted with all GST fusion proteins. The mapping results suggest that 3D5 recognizes an epitope in the death domain of Fas. Furthermore, 3D5 does not cross-react against several death domain containing proteins, such as FADD/MORT1, CD40, and TNFR1 (data not shown, and see below). The anti-cytoplasmic domain antibody (3D5) was used to investigate the fate of Fas antigen after stimulation with anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 3 A). Three Fas-expressing cell lines, BJAB, Raji, and Jurkat, were chosen for the time course study. To detect Fas by Western blotting, we used a secondary antibody specific for mouse IgG, but not mouse IgM, to avoid detecting the stimulating antibody, CH11 (mouse IgM). All three cell lines showed similar patterns of change following activation. Cross-linking of Fas on the cell surface by CH11 resulted in the formation of high molecular weight Fas aggregates, which were stable in 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3 A). These aggregates were more than 200 kDa in size and could be detected 10 min after incubation with CH11. The appearance of Fas aggregates peaked at 120 min in most cases, whereas Fas monomers disappeared with time. In Jurkat cells, the monomers became undetectable by 120 min. In addition to Fas aggregates and monomers, a 97-kDa band (p97) was also detected (Fig. 3 A). p97 was detected at 120 min and increased in intensity by 240 min. To compare the molecular mass of p97 in BJAB, Raji, and Jurkat, Western blot analysis was performed on samples derived from these cell lines following CH11 stimulation for 240 min (Fig. 3 B). As shown, the 97-kDa bands derived from three cell lines migrated identically. To confirm the specificity of these protein bands, an immunoabsorption study was performed. As shown in Fig. 3 C, anti-Fas antiserum after absorption with GST- (lanes 1 and2) or GST-FADD- (lanes 5 and 6) coated beads could detect Fas monomers, the aggregates, and p97, whereas antiserum absorbed with GST-Fas-CD could not (lanes 3 and4). Similar results were obtained with the monoclonal antibody 3D5 (data not shown). Formation of the high molecular weight Fas aggregates requires ligation of the Fas antigen (Fig. 3 A). Kischkelet al. and Muzio et al. have demonstrated that the appearance of the Fas aggregate coincides with the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (2Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P. Peter M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 9Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). However, they did not show that association of FADD/MORT1 with Fas requires Fas aggregation. To provide more evidence for the physiologic relevance of the Fas aggregates, Jurkat cells were activated with CH11 as described for Fig. 3 A. At the designated time after activation, Jurkat cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-FADD monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed in a Western blot analysis with a rabbit antiserum against the C terminus of Fas. As shown in Fig. 3 D, the high molecular weight Fas aggregates could only be co-precipitated with FADD/MORT1 after Fas ligation. This experiment provides direct evidence that the association of FADD with Fas requires Fas aggregation. The time course of p97 generation was compared with other known proteolytic events following Fas activation. For this purpose, CPP32 activation and PARP cleavage were analyzed in the same samples used for Western blotting shown in Fig. 3 A. The 28-kDa PARP fragment was observed in BJAB, Raji, and Jurkat cells after cross-linking of Fas with CH11 (Fig. 4 A). In BJAB, the 28-kDa band was markedly increased 4 h after incubation with CH11. In Raji and Jurkat, the 28-kDa band was markedly increased 120 min after activation. CPP32 activation was also examined using the same samples described above. The p20 subunit of CPP32 could be detected 240 min after activation in BJAB, and at 120 min after activation in Raji (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the time course of p97 generation parallels CPP32 activation and PARP cleavage. A rabbit antiserum against the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of Fas (Fas/C-20) was used to further characterize p97. Monomeric Fas molecules could be detected in Raji and Jurkat cells (Fig. 5,A and B). However, Fas/C-20 also reacted with several nonspecific bands that overlapped with the true monomeric bands (see Figs. 1 B and3 A). However, both p97 and Fas aggregates (>200 kDa) could still be detected (Fig. 5). These results indicate that p97 contains the carboxyl terminus of the Fas molecule. A collection of commercially available antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of human Fas were used to characterize p97 in Western blot analysis as described by previous reports (16Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar, 17Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). However, none of these antibodies could detect Fas-specific bands in total cell lysates. The difficulty with using anti-extracellular domain antibodies in Western blot analysis remains to be investigated. To circumvent the difficulty in Western blot analysis with the anti-extracellular domain antibody, Fas antigen was immunoprecipitated with anti-extracellular domain antibody (Fas/N-18), which was then detected with anti-Fas cytoplasmic domain antibody (3D5) (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4–6). As shown in Fig. 6 A, Fas monomers could be clearly seen (lanes 4–6), but p97 cannot be seen (lane 6). The high molecular weight Fas aggregates (>200 kDa) were weakly detected in the immunoprecipitated samples (lanes 5 and6), and their intensities were much lower than those in total cell lysate (lanes 2 and 3). In the immunoprecipitates, however, a broad band of 110–150 kDa was detected (lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that the high molecular weight Fas aggregates might be degraded to smaller proteins (110–150 kDa) during the procedure of immunoprecipitation. In addition to immunoprecipitation with an antiserum directed against the N-terminal 18 amino acids of Fas (Fas/N-18), Fas molecules were also immunoprecipitated with anti-mouse IgM linked to Protein A-Sepharose beads after incubation with CH11 (mouse IgM) for 4 h (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). As shown, only the Fas monomers, aggregates (>200 kDa), and the 110–150-kDa bands were detected (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). These results indicate that p97 does not possess the original extracellular epitopes required for immunorecognition. As shown in Fig. 4, p97 generation occurs at a similar time course as CPP32 activation and PARP cleavage. Thus, cysteine protease inhibitors were used to block p97 generation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, z-DEVD-CH2F (inhibitor of CPP32-like activity;lanes 10 and 13) and z-VAD-CH2F (inhibitor of ICE-like activity; lanes 11 and 14) did not affect p97 generation. In separate experiments using the same samples, it was determined that these cysteine protease inhibitors could effectively block PARP cleavage (Fig. 7 B, lanes 6 and 7). The effects of calpain and proteasome inhibitors were also tested. As shown in Fig. 7 A, LLM (calpain inhibitor II; lanes 3 and 7) and LLnL (calpain inhibitor I or proteasome inhibitor; lanes 4 and8) did not inhibit the p97 generation in Jurkat cells. The inhibitors were effective because pretreatment with LLM and LLnL enhanced PARP cleavage (Fig. 7 B, lanes 3 and4). Cleaved PARP (28-kDa band) could be strongly detected, especially in the LLnL-pretreated sample (lane 4), suggesting that proteasome inhibitor enhanced CPP32-like activity in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells. This result is consistent with a recent report showing that proteasomes protect cells from apoptosis by degrading CPP32-like proteases (18Fujita E. Mukasa T. Tsukahara T. Arahata K. Omura S. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that p97 is neither generated by ICE-like, CPP32-like cysteine proteases nor by calpain- and proteasome-mediated degradation. After cross-linking of Fas with agonistic antibody, high molecular mass Fas aggregates (>200 kDa) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the extracellular domain and detected in Western blotting under reducing conditions with antibodies against the death domain or the carboxyl terminus. These results imply that Fas aggregates are composed of a complex of intact Fas monomers. SDS-stable forms of aggregated Fas have been reported by Kischkel et al. (2Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P. Peter M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Their Fas aggregate has a molecular mass of ∼110 kDa. The difference in size of the Fas aggregates in these studies is most likely due to difference in sample preparation. We used Western blot analysis to detect the aggregate, whereas Kischkel et al. used immunoprecipitation. Thus, the 110-kDa band detected by Kischkel et al. probably resulted from protein degradation during the long incubation period of immunoprecipitation (2Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P. Peter M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our immunoprecipitation results, which demonstrated the presence of both the large (>200-kDa) and small (∼110-kDa) Fas aggregates (Fig. 6,A and B). Following formation of Fas aggregates (>200 kDa), a novel band, p97, was observed. In previous studies, p97 could not be detected because only anti-extracellular domain antibodies were used. p97 was detected by Western blotting with two different anti-Fas antibodies, 3D5 and Fas/C-20, indicating that p97 contained the cell death domain of Fas and the carboxyl terminus. Based on the kinetics of the appearance of different forms of Fas, p97 most likely originated from the Fas aggregates (>200 kDa). Considering the heterogeneity in molecular weight of Fas monomers in different cell lines, it is surprising that p97 has a constant molecular weight in all cell lines examined so far. The best explanation is that p97 is generated by the removal of extracellular domain of Fas aggregates. By removing the differentially glycosylated extracellular domain, the processed Fas aggregates from different cell lines will have uniform molecular mass. Cleavage of the extracellular domains of Fas is suggested by the observation that p97 cannot be precipitated by anti-N terminus antibodies. On the other hand, Fas monomers and Fas aggregates could be readily precipitated. At this moment, we do not know the exact cleavage site of the Fas aggregate in p97 generation. Soluble Fas molecules have been described previously and have been used as indicators of inflammation (19Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Up to five different splice variants of Fas that result in truncated and soluble Fas proteins have been reported (20Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar). p97 is unlikely to be the translation product of Fas splice variants because p97 contains the cytoplasmic domain. It has been previously reported that calpain and ICE family members were activated during Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 22Estaquier J. Tanaka M. Suda T. Nagata S. Golstein P. Amerisen J.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 4959-4966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also had evidence that CPP32 and PARP, a known CPP32 substrate, were cleaved in Jurkat cells after cross-linking of Fas. Based on kinetic study, CPP32 activation, PARP cleavage, and p97 generation occur at a similar time. Therefore, Fas aggregates may be cleaved by activated proteases such as proteasome, calpains, lysosomal cysteine proteases, or ICE family members to generate p97. To investigate the involvement of proteases in the p97 generation, protease inhibitors were used to inhibit p97 generation. LLM and LLnL were used as the inhibitors of calpains, lysosomal cysteine proteases, or proteasome (23Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). The z-VAD-CH2F and z-DEVD-CH2F were also used as the inhibitors of ICE family members (25Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Na S. Chuang T.H. Cunningham A. Ture T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These protease inhibitors had no inhibitory effect on the p97 generation, suggesting that p97 is generated by protease(s) with other specificity following Fas receptor activation. The significance of p97 generation is not known. It could be a byproduct of the proteolytic milieu generated by the activation of ICE/CED3 family of cysteine proteases during apoptosis induction. However, p97 generation could not be blocked by cysteine protease inhibitors. Alternatively, p97 is generated by a novel protease that is activated upon Fas receptor ligation. Shedding of membrane proteins, such as interleukin-6 receptor, L-selectin, and TNFRs, has been reported (27Chen A. Engel P. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Mullberg J. Oberthur W. Lottspeich F. Mehl E. Dittrich E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 5198-5205PubMed Google Scholar). These cleavages appeared to be mediated by novel endopeptidases. It is currently not known whether p97 is generated by similar proteolytic cleavage. The biological role of p97 also warrants further investigation. The current concept of Fas-induced apoptosis invokes the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex that includes the Fas aggregates, FADD/MORT1, and FLICE/MACH. p97 could participate in apoptosis signaling. Alternatively, p97 generation could down-modulate cell death signals. Further experiments are required to elucidate the significance of p97 generation. In summary, a newly generated mAb recognizing the death domain was used to detect a novel form of processed Fas. This antibody could also be used in future studies to identify the biology and cellular fate of the cytoplasmic domain of Fas during apoptosis signaling."

In the case of polypeptide growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), the steps leading to activation of MAPK require the function of the adaptor protein Grb2 (growth factor receptor binding protein 2), which can bind either directly or indirectly via its Src homology 2 domain to activated receptor tyrosine kinases. A cell-permeable mimetic of the EGF receptor Grb2 binding site has been investigated for its ability to inhibit biological responses stimulated by a variety of growth factors. Pretreatment of cells with this peptide results in the accumulation of the peptide in cells and its association with Grb2. This is associated with a complete inhibition of the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF and PDGF. In contrast, the peptide has no effect on the mitogenic response stimulated by fibroblast growth factor. The peptide could also inhibit the phosphorylation of MAPK stimulated with EGF and PDGF in the absence of an effect on the fibroblast growth factor response. These data demonstrate that cell-permeable mimetics of Src homology 2 binding sites can selectively inhibit growth factor-stimulated mitogenesis, and also directly demonstrate specificity in the coupling of activated receptor tyrosine kinases to the MAPK cascade.

PDGF, and FGF stimulate cell proliferation by binding to and activating membrane-spanning receptors that have cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, and this is associated with autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues both within and outside the catalytic domain in the receptor dimer (e.g. see Refs. 3Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar and4Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whereas the former are required for catalytic activity, the latter can serve as high affinity binding sites for effector molecules or adaptor molecules that recruit effectors to the receptor. Grb2 is a key adaptor molecule that couples some receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and this is central to the mitogenic response stimulated by many growth factors (5Downward J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Grb2 binds to defined motifs, containing phosphorylated tyrosine (designated Y in the single-letter amino acid code), via its SH2 domain, and these motifs are found in a wide range of molecules including the EGF and PDGF receptors and the Shc (Src homology and collagen protein) adaptor (6Songyang Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, when phosphorylated, Tyr1068 in the EGF receptor acts as a docking site for the SH2 domain of Grb2 and synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to this site inhibit Grb2 binding to the activated EGF receptor in vitro (8Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolknik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides can also inhibit Grb2 function in intact cells, e.g. a 9-amino acid phosphopeptide corresponding to this site can inhibit the ability of EGF to activate Ras in permeabilized cells (9Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Moreover, when made in tandem with a peptide that allows for translocation across the cell membrane, this phosphopeptide retains its ability to bind to Grb2 and can inhibit Grb2 binding to the activated EGF receptor in live cells (10Rojas M. Yao S. Lin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27456-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This was associated with a competitive inhibition of EGF stimulation of the MAPK cascade, with the peptide being able to partially (∼60%) inhibit the effects of EGF at 10 ng/ml but being ineffective against EGF at 50 ng/ml. In both systems phosphorylation of Tyr1068 was required for inhibitory activity. We have recently shown that a cell-permeable peptide mimetic of the PLCγ binding site on the FGF receptor (the FGFR766Y-P peptide) can inhibit phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis stimulated by FGF in intact cells in the absence of any effect on the same response stimulated by PDGF or neurotrophin-3 (11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This level of specificity was unexpected and might be related to lower levels of FGF receptors as compared with the other receptors and/or differences in the affinity of PLCγ binding to the various receptors. Moreover, we were able to show that this peptide could inhibit the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by FGF, but had no effect on neurite outgrowth stimulated by agents that act downstream from PLCγ activation in the FGF receptor signal transduction cascade, or other growth factors such as nerve growth factor (11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Saffell J.L. Williams E.J. Mason I.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1997; 18: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Again, phosphorylation of Tyr766was required for inhibitory activity. Thus, cell-permeable phosphopeptides that mimic receptor binding sites for specific SH2 domain-containing proteins have the potential to be developed as tools that will help us understand how growth factor receptors couple to signaling cascades and biological responses. In the present study we report on the effects of cell-permeable mimetics of the EGF receptor Grb2 binding site and FGF receptor PLCγ binding site for their ability to inhibit mitogenic responses stimulated by EGF, PDGF, and FGF. All three responses were inhibited by PD 098059, which inhibits MAPK kinase (13Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with activation of the MAPK cascade being required for these responses. We find that the EGF receptor Grb2 binding site mimetic was able to bind to Grb2 in cells and inhibit the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF and PDGF, but had no effect on the response stimulated by FGF. This peptide could also inhibit the phosphorylation of MAPK stimulated by EGF and PDGF, but not FGF. In contrast, the distinct phosphopeptide corresponding to the FGF receptor PLCγ binding site had no effect on the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF, PDGF, or FGF. These data demonstrate for the first time that cell-permeable peptide mimetics of SH2 domain binding sites can selectivity inhibit activation of the MAPK cascade and mitogenic responses stimulated by polypeptide growth factors. Peptides were synthesized on a 431A Applied Biosystem peptide synthesizer usingp-hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl polystyrene resin and standard Fmoc chemistry. The EGFR Grb2-binding peptide sequence was as follows, Biot-Ahx-Arg-Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg-Trp-Trp-Arg-Arg-Trp-Trp-Arg-Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg-Pro-Val-Pro-GluTyr(P)-Ile-Asn-Gln-Ser, where the underlined sequence corresponds to the 9-amino acid sequence containing phosphotyrosine 1068 of the EGF receptor that has been established to bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (the full peptide is called the EGFR1068Y-P peptide throughout the study). A phosphorylated Fmoc tyrosine (Novabiochem) was used in this sequence. The rest of the peptide sequence corresponds to a functional analogue of a sequence derived from the third helix of the Antennapedia protein, which has been established to act as a vector that can carry other peptides across the cell membrane into the cytosol (for full details of internalization properties of Antennapedia-based peptides, see Refs. 11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholarand 14Prochiantz A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This peptide also contained an aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) spacer (Novabiochem) and a biotin at the N terminus. Synthesis of the cell-permeable Antennapedia-FGFR PLCγ-binding peptide (called the FGFR766Y-P peptide throughout the study) was as described previously with the exception that this peptide also contained an N-terminal biotin (11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After synthesis and deprotection, the peptides were desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column and lyophilized. The peptides were analyzed for purity by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography, and in each case a single peak was observed. Peptides were made as stock solutions at 25 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at −20 °C before use. All surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out using a BIAcore X™ biosensor (Pharmacia Ltd., Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden), the principle of which has been described elsewhere (15Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Roos H. Ronnberg J. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 520-527PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel flow cells of CM 5 sensor chips were derivatized, using the amine coupling method, with streptavidin (200 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 2100–2600 resonance units of ligand were immobilized, corresponding to a concentration of 2.1–2.6 ng/mm2. Biotinylated peptides were coupled via streptavidin to one flow cell only (the other remaining as a control) by injection at 1 μg/ml in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and at 25 °C. Five short (4 μl) pulses of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were carried out to remove any nonspecifically bound peptide and also to test regeneration conditions. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were subsequently injected simultaneously over both flow cells at 100 nm in running buffer at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. After a period of free buffer flow, any analyte remaining bound to the surface was removed with a pulse of 0.1% SDS bringing the signal back to baseline. Specific binding of the GST fusion proteins to each peptide was determined automatically by the system by subtraction of test from control flow cell responses, measured in arbitrary units called resonance units. The GST fusion proteins used in the present study included the full sequence and SH2 domain of Grb2, the SH2 domain of PLCγ, and the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (these were a kind gift of Dr. Pam Ganju, Sandoz Institute, UCL, London). Newt A1 myoblast cells were grown in gelatin-coated plastic flasks in medium composed of 60% minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (ICN), 27% distilled water (AMEM), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented with insulin, glutamine, and antibiotics as described previously (16Ferretti P. Brockes J.P. J. Exp. Zool. 1988; 247: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 25 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 2% CO2. Mammalian C2 myoblast cells (17Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% FCS and glutamine at 37 °C in 8% CO2. Mitogenic assays were set up by seeding either 2000 A1 cells/well of 48-well plates (Nunc), previously coated with 0.75% gelatin, or 4000 C2 cells/well of 48-well plates. Cells were initially serum-starved by culture in serum-free medium for 3 days. Serum-free medium was then replaced with medium containing 0.5% FCS alone or further supplemented with basic FGF (bFGF, 5 ng/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), or PDGF (10 ng/ml), (all from Collaborative), in the presence or absence of the EGFR1068Y-P peptide (10 μg/ml) or the MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 098059 (100 μm; Calbiochem). In some experiments cultures were treated with the EGFR1068Y-P peptide for 2 h before being washed three times and the medium replaced with growth factors in the absence of additional peptide (see “Results and Discussion”). After 24 h, cultures were labeled for another 24 h with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine/5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) using the Amersham proliferation kit according to instructions. Cells were fixed for 5 min with ice cold methanol and stained for BrdUrd as described previously (18Barres B.A. Raff M.C. Gaese F. Bartke I. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Briefly, following fixation cells were treated for 10 min with 1 m HCl followed by 5 min with 100 mmTris (pH 7.8), then blocked for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% goat serum (GS); the primary and secondary antibodies were mouse anti-BrdUrd and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), respectively (diluted in PBS/10% GS). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 1 mg/ml Hoechst dye and visualized with UV epifluorescent optics. A1 cells were grown to confluence on gelatin-coated 6-cm plates (Nunc) and then serum-starved for 2 days. Medium was then replaced with 0.5% FCS/AMEM alone or supplemented with either the PD 098059 compound or the EGFR1068Y-P peptide and individual growth factors (see text for treatment schedules and concentrations). The cultures were then washed with ice-cold PBS before being lysed and collected in 200 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), again at the indicated time points. Samples were boiled for 5 min and sonicated for 30 s before being resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), and then incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-active MAPK antibody (1:20,000 from Promega) in PBS (containing 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were then washed three times with blocking buffer, incubated with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000 in blocking buffer; Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature, and finally washed three times with blocking buffer before probing with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham). Cultures of A1 cells were established overnight on gelatin-coated wells of an eight-chamber tissue culture slide. The cultures were washed and media replaced with AMEM containing 10 μg/ml biotinylated EGFR1068Y-P peptide. After 2 h the cultures were washed three times with AMEM and then fixed and permeabilized with ethanol:acetic acid (9:1 by volume) for 5 min at −20 °C. Nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked for 30 min with 10% GS in PBS. The cultures were then incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1:500; Amersham). The cultures were washed another three times with PBS before being mounted for viewing by confocal microscopy. C2 myoblast cells were grown to 70% confluence on collagen-coated plates, serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), and sodium selenite (10 nm) for 4 h and then treated with or without peptide (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell monolayers were washed extensively with ice cold PBS (three times), 2m NaCl at pH 7.4 (three times), and 2 m NaCl/20 mm sodium acetate at pH 4 (two times) to remove extracellular peptide before being lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and complete protease inhibitors from Boehringer Mannheim (according to manufacturer's instructions). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the biotinylated peptides precipitated from the supernatant with streptavidin-agarose following gentle mixing at 4 °C for 2 h. Precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2. Sample buffer (see above) was added to both the precipitates, and depleted lysates and samples were boiled for 5 min, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (4% nonfat dried milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and then incubated for 1 h with anti-Grb2 antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer (Transduction Laboratories). Membranes were washed three times in wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) before being incubated with HRP-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector) diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer for 1 h, prior to another five washes in wash buffer. Membranes were then probed with ECL (Amersham). We have synthesized a biotinylated peptide consisting of a functional analogue of the 16-amino acid sequence derived from the third helix of the Antennapedia protein that acts as an internalization vector for other peptide sequences (see Ref. 14Prochiantz A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar for a detailed description of the internalization properties of Antennapedia-related peptides and Ref. 11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar for an example) in tandem with the well characterized Grb2 docking site on the activated EGF receptor (EGFR1068Y-P peptide; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 1 shows characterization of the binding properties of this peptide using BIAcore technology. The peptide readily bound a GST fusion protein containing the full Grb2 molecule and also one containing only the single SH2 domain. The peptide did not bind a control GST fusion protein or a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal p85 SH2 domain, and very poorly bound a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, a peptide mimetic of the FGF receptor PLCγ binding site (the FGFR766Y-P peptide) specifically bound PLCγ, and showed only background binding of Grb2 and p85 (Fig. 1 B). In addition, a range of control phosphopeptides that do not share the consensus sequence for PLCγ or Grb2 binding bound neither molecule (data not shown). Thus the peptides show the predicted specificity in terms of SH2 domain interactions (see Ref. 6Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar for details) despite the presence of the internalization sequence. The uptake of the biotinylated EGFR1068Y-P peptide into cells was monitored by confocal microscopy. Cells were treated with the biotinylated peptide at 10 μg/ml for 60 min before being washed, fixed, and permeabilized (see “Experimental Procedures”). Optical sections through the cell confirmed the presence of the peptide within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, left panel). Similar results were obtained with the other phosphopeptides (e.g. see Ref. 11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine if the EGFR1068Y-P peptide could complex with Grb2 inside cells, cultures of C2 myoblasts were treated with the peptide at 50 μg/ml for 60 min before being extensively washed to remove noninternalized peptide. The cells were then lysed and the biotinylated peptide precipitated with streptavidin-agarose. Grb2 co-precipitated with the EGFR1068Y-P peptide and the peptide essentially depleted all of the Grb2 from the cell lysate (Fig. 2, right panel). Other phosphopeptides, including the FGFR766Y-P peptide, failed to precipitate Grb2 or deplete it from the cell lysates (Fig. 2,right panel, and data not shown). EGF, PDGF, and FGF all stimulate proliferation of newt A1 myoblasts as indexed by BrdUrd incorporation. It was established that a maximal response was elicited by 10, 10, and 5 ng/ml EGF, PDGF, and FGF, respectively, and that these responses could be fully inhibited by the MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 098059 (Fig. 3). At the lower concentrations of growth factors (1 ng/ml), the peak activation of MAPK was seen at 30 min, and this was inhibited by treatment with PD 098059 (Fig. 4,top). However, at the higher concentrations of growth factors (5–10 ng/ml) activation of the MAPK cascade was apparent even after 4 h of treatment with the growth factors (shown for EGF and FGF in Fig. 4 (bottom), and EGF in Fig. 6 (top)). Addition of PD 098059 2 h after the addition of the growth factors brought the MAPK activity down to control levels (Fig. 4,bottom) and also fully inhibited the mitogenic response (data not shown), suggesting that this sustained activation of the MAPK cascade is required for the full mitogenic response.Figure 4The MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 098059 inhibits MAPK phosphorylation stimulated by EGF, PDGF, and FGF. In the experiment shown in the top panel, A1 cells were serum-starved and then cultured in control medium (lanes 1,3, 5, and 7) or medium supplemented with PD 098059 (100 μm; lanes 2, 4,6, and 8). One hour later the cultures were exposed to EGF, PDGF, or FGF (all at 1 ng/ml as indicated) for 30 min before being processed for MAPK activation, as determined by Western blotting with an anti-active MAPK antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated (active) form of the enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In the experiment shown in the bottom panel, A1 cells were serum-starved and then cultured in control medium (lanes 1 and 2) or medium containing 5 ng/ml FGF (lanes 3 and 4) or 10 ng/ml EGF (lanes 5 and 6). After 2 h PD 098059 (100 μg/ml) was added to the cultures as indicated (lanes 2,4, and 6). After another 2 h, the cultures were extracted and blotted for the active form of MAPK. Control experiments with an antibody that recognizes the unphosphorylated MAPK confirmed that the none of the treatments altered the level of MAPK protein (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6The EGFR1068Y-P peptide substantially inhibits the phosphorylation of MAPK stimulated by EGF and PDGF but not by FGF. In the experiment shown in the top panel, A1 cells were serum-starved and then treated with either control medium (lanes 1 and 2) or medium containing EGF at 10 ng/ml for 30 min (lanes 3 and4), 60 min (lanes 5 and 6), 120 min (lanes 7 and 8), or 240 min (lanes 9and 10). This was done in both in the presence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) and absence (lanes 1, 3, 5,7, and 9) of the EGFR1068Y-P peptide at 10 μg/ml. The cultures were then extracted and processed for active-MAPK immunoblot analysis. In the experiment shown in thebottom panel, A1 cells were serum-starved and then placed in control medium (lanes 1, 3, 5, and7) or medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of the EGFR1068Y-P peptide (lanes 2, 4,6, and 8). One hour later cells were challenged with 1 ng/ml FGF (lanes 3 and 4), EGF (lanes 5 and 6), or PDGF (lanes 7 and8). After an additional 30 min, the cultures were extracted and processed for active-MAPK (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of the EGFR1068Y-P peptide on the mitogenic activity of EGF, PDGF, and FGF on A1 cells was also determined. Results pooled from three independent experiments showed that the continued presence of 10 μg/ml peptide over the 2-day assay period completely inhibited the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF and PDGF, but had no effect on the response to FGF (Fig. 5 A). The peptide also had no obvious effect on the viability or morphology of control cells (data not shown), suggesting that its effects on mitogenesis are the result of a specific rather than toxic action, and this is in accord with the failure of the peptide to affect the FGF response. The uptake studies show that the peptide will accumulate in cells following a 60-min treatment period (Fig. 2) and in this respect we find that a 2-h pretreatment of cells with the peptide is sufficient to fully inhibit the mitogenic responses stimulated by EGF and PDGF (Fig. 5 B). Pretreatment of C2 myoblasts with 50 μg/ml peptide was also associated with a full inhibition of the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF and PDGF in the absence of any effect on the response stimulated by FGF (data not shown). This result also suggests that the peptide has a relatively long effective half-life in cells, and this might reflect the slow dissociation of the peptide from Grb2, which would be expected to protect it from dephosphorylation and degradation; it also confirms that the peptide is effective in both mammalian and newt cells. The Grb2-binding peptide was initially tested for its ability to inhibit the activation of MAPK stimulated by EGF. At the maximally active concentration of EGF (10 ng/ml) 10 μg/ml peptide substantially inhibited the activation of the MAPK cascade, and this was seen at all time points tested (Fig. 6,top). The competitive nature of the inhibition was demonstrated by showing that 100 μg/ml peptide could fully inhibit the activation of MAPK stimulated by 1 ng/ml EGF (measured at 30 min; see Fig. 6, bottom). Under the same conditions the peptide also fully inhibited the activation of MAPK by PDGF, but had no effect of the response stimulated by FGF (Fig. 6, bottom). The specificity of action of the EGFR1068Y-P peptide was confirmed by showing that the FGFR766Y-P peptide, which inhibits FGF-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation and axonal growth responses (11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), had no effect on the FGF, EGF, or PDGF mitogenic response (Table I). In addition, we have tested three other cell-permeable phosphopeptides that do not bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 as measured by BIAcore, and found that they also have no effect on the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF and PDGF (data not shown). Thus the inhibitory activity of the EGFR1068Y-P is very specific and can most probably be accounted for by its ability to bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 and inhibit activation of the MAPK cascade. This is best explained by the known ability of peptide mimetics of the Grb2 binding site on the EGF receptor to compete out binding of Grb2 to the activated receptorin vitro (8Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolknik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in live cells (10Rojas M. Yao S. Lin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27456-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although we have demonstrated that our peptide will bind to Grb2 in intact cells, and that it does not interact with PLCγ, p85 (this study), or Shc (data not shown), we cannot exclude the possibility that the peptide interacts with other targets. However, it is clear from the results that its effects are highly specific and that they are best explained by the peptide's ability to bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2.Table IThe FGFR766Y-P peptide does not inhibit mitogenic responses induced by EGF, PDGF, or FGFControlEGFPDGFFGFControl media10.2 ± 1.829.1 ± 230 ± 141.7 ± 6.7FGFR766Y-P peptide9.9 ± 1.429.9 ± 231.8 ± 137.7 ± 4.5A1 cells were serum-starved before culture in control media or media supplemented with EGF (10 ng/ml), PDGF (10 ng/ml), or FGF (5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml FGFR766Y-P peptide.

The results show the percentage of cells in S-phase (mean ± S.E.) pooled from three independent experiments. The fact that the EGF1068Y-P peptide can inhibit both EGF and PDGF responses is perhaps not surprising, as the SH2 domain of Grb2 is required for both the direct and indirect interactions of this adaptor with the EGF receptor (see Introduction) and an indirect association via Syp with the activated PDGF receptor (19Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The possibility that the failure of the peptide to inhibit the FGF response reflects the use of a completely different mitogenic pathway is unlikely for a number of reasons. For example, FGF activated the MAPK cascade, and both this and the FGF-stimulated mitogenic response were inhibited by the PD 098059 MAPK kinase inhibitor. The alternative possibility, that the selectivity of the Grb2-binding peptide reflects differences in the coupling of the EGF/PDGF receptors and the FGF receptor to the MAPK cascade, is a more probable and interesting explanation. An emerging view is that a novel ∼90-kDa protein might couple the FGF receptor to the Ras-MAPK pathway via Grb2 (21Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan H.T. Guy G.R. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and in this context a new lipid anchored FGF receptor substrate, called FRS2, has recently been cloned; following tyrosine phosphorylation, FRS2 can bind Grb2 and link the FGF receptor to MAPK activation (25Kouhara H. Hadari R.Y. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Shc can also act as an adaptor molecule that can link Grb2 to the activated FGF receptor (21Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Kouhara H. Hadari R.Y. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of the EGFR1068Y-P peptide to inhibit the FGF response might be accounted for by its inability to inhibit Grb2 binding to FRS2 and/or Shc. In fact, it has been reported previously that the EGFR1068Y-P peptide is relatively ineffective at inhibiting the association of Grb2 with Shc (10Rojas M. Yao S. Lin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27456-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A number of control peptides that do not bind to the Grb2 SH2 domain had no effect on the mitogenic response stimulated by EGF and PDGF. The most conspicuous of these is a cell-permeable peptide mimetic of the PLCγ binding site on the FGF receptor that inhibits phospholipid hydrolysis and axonal growth responses stimulated by FGF (11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is interesting that this peptide had no effect on the mitogenic response stimulated by FGF, and this is in accord with a large body of work that has reported that whereas mutation of Tyr766 can prevent the FGF receptor from activating PLCγ, it has no effect on the mitogenic response stimulated by this factor (4Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that cell-permeable peptides that have unique binding profiles for SH2 domain-containing molecules can be used to inhibit the mitogenic activity of polypeptide growth factors. This confirms our prediction (11Hall H. Williams E.J. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Prochiantz A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 580-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that the ability of cell-permeable phosphopeptides to interact with high affinity and relative specificity to the SH2 domains of adaptors and effectors can be readily exploited to design novel tools for the dissection of signaling pathways in living cells. The functional analogue of the internalization sequence derived from the third helix of the Antennapedia protein was developed by Drs. Alain Prochiantz and Gerard Chassaing and their colleagues, and we thank them for sharing this sequence with us."
https://openalex.org/W2052692510,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented a plan to eradicate poliovirus that is widely viewed as having made enormous progress. If all goes as planned, polio will be eradicated on this planet by the year 2003. However, there is a debate, as highlighted in a pair of Policy Forums in this issue, over when vaccination against polio can be stopped. Dove and Racaniello believe that the reliance of the WHO on the live Sabin oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) means that there will be a continuing threat of release of potentially pathogenic virus into the environment. They are also concerned that the planned destruction of all wild-type polio stocks will not be possible. They therefore recommend a switch to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). In response, Hull and Aylward explain why a switch from OPV is not necessary and describe the studies being sponsored by the WHO to determine how and when immunization can safely be ended."

Eukaryotic messenger RNA synthesis is a complex biochemical process governed by the concerted action of a diverse collection of general transcription factors that control the activity of RNA polymerase II at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription (1Conaway R.C.

While the precise roles of MLL-fusion proteins in the development of leukemia are not clear, substantial evidence suggests that the MLL translocation partners make a critical contribution to the disease process. First, different leukemic phenotypes correlate with specific translocations and thus with specific fusion partners; for example, a t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocation, which generates an MLL-AF4fusion, is found in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and preB cell ALL (preB-ALL) (20Gu Y.

Second, targeted disruption of the MLL gene in mice causes defects in hox gene expression and segmentation, but is not sufficient for development of the leukemic phenotype (27Yu B.D. Hess J.L.

Based on these observations, a thorough understanding of the functional properties of ELL and the other MLL fusion partners is likely to be important for understanding the roles of MLL-containing chimeras in leukemogenesis. As part of our effort to understand how ELL regulates the activity of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex, we sought to identify and characterize ELL sequences important for its function. These studies led to the discovery that, in addition to its elongation activation domain, ELL contains a novel functional domain that is capable of negatively regulating RNA polymerase II activity in promoter-specific transcription initiation in vitro and that can be disrupted without affecting ELL elongation activity. Remarkably, the MLL-ELL translocation results in deletion of a portion of this domain, and ELL mutants lacking sequences deleted by the translocation bind RNA polymerase II and are fully active in elongation, but do not inhibit promoter-specific initiation. Here we present these findings, which bring to light new features of the ELL protein and its ability to control the activity of RNA polymerase II.

After one cycle of freeze-thaw, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by resuspension in 5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Histidine-tagged ELL or ELL mutant proteins were purified from the supernatant by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography using ProbondTM metal-binding resin (Invitrogen). Ni2+ chromatography was performed at 4 °C. 5 ml of supernatant was applied to a 1-ml packed bed volume of Ni2+-agarose pre-equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6 mguanidine hydrochloride). The Ni2+ column was washed with buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), and ELL protein was eluted with buffer A containing 300 mmimidazole (pH 7.9). To prepare ELL protein for transcription assays, fractions containing guanidine-solubilized ELL were dialyzed for 2 h against 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 100 mmKCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The final concentrations of the solubilized and renatured ELL and ELL mutants were estimated by comparison to silver-stained protein standards. RNA polymerase II (32Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), except that the 56-kDa subunit was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-pLysS. Recombinant TFIIF was purified as described (37Tan S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 824-828PubMed Google Scholar) from E. coli strain JM109(DE3) co-infected with M13mpET-RAP30 and M13mpET-RAP74. All reaction mixtures were 60 μl. Except as indicated in the figure legends, preinitiation complexes were assembled by preincubation of ∼20 ng of template DNA (EcoRI to NdeI fragment from pDN-AdML), ∼10 ng of recombinant TFIIB, ∼10 ng of recombinant TFIIF, ∼7 ng of recombinant TFIIE, ∼40 ng of TFIIH, ∼20 ng of recombinant TBP, ∼0.01 unit of RNA polymerase II, and 8 units of RNasin in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, and 3% (v/v) glycerol for 30 min at 28 °C. Transcription was initiated by addition of MgCl2 and ribonucleoside triphosphates as indicated in the figure legends and carried out for the times indicated. After incubation of reaction mixtures at 28 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends, runoff transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea and 1 × TBE (20 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). For some experiments, transcription was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Pulse-chase assays were carried out essentially as described (12Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). ∼0.01 unit of RNA polymerase II and ∼100 ng of oligo(dC)-tailed pCpGR220S/P/X were incubated at 28 °C in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 65 mm KCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 3 units of RNasin, 7 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 50 μm GTP, 1.8 μm CTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP for the times indicated in the figure legends. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and 1 × TBE. Monoclonal antibody 8WG16 (38Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from ascites fluid by adsorption to Affi-Gel protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 8WG16 hybridoma was a generous gift from N. Thompson and R. Burgess (University of Wisconsin-Madison). We previously demonstrated that ELL is capable of activating the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in vitro during both promoter-dependent and promoter-independent transcription (12Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In experiments further investigating the effect of ELL on transcription by RNA polymerase II, we made the surprising discovery that ELL is also capable of potently inhibiting initiation. As described below, further analysis revealed that ELL inhibits initiation at least in part by binding to RNA polymerase II and blocking its interaction with the TATA factor and TFIIB at the promoter. The effect of ELL on transcription by RNA polymerase II was investigated using the AdML promoter and a transcription system reconstituted, in the presence and absence of ELL, with recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and purified RNA polymerase II and TFIIH from rat liver. In the pulse-chase experiment of Fig. 1, preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter by preincubation of linearized pDN-AdML DNA (29Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II. Transcription was initiated by addition of ATP, GTP, UTP, and a low concentration of [α-32P]CTP, which is sufficient for synthesis of short, highly radioactive transcripts. After 5 min, short transcripts were chased for varying times following addition of a 50-fold excess of nonradioactive CTP. Consistent with our previous results (12Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), addition of ELL to transcription reactions after initiation, during the chase phase of the reaction, led to a significant increase in the rate of accumulation of full-length runoff transcripts and, thus, to an increase in the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–5 and lanes 11–15). In contrast, addition of ELL to transcription reactions before assembly of the preinitiation complex led to a significant reduction in the yield of full-length runoff transcripts (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–5 and lanes 6–10). Furthermore, even though the yield of full-length runoff transcripts was reduced when ELL was added to transcription reactions before initiation, the kinetics of appearance of those full-length runoff transcripts that were synthesized under these conditions was similar to the kinetics of appearance of full-length runoff transcripts synthesized when ELL was added to transcription reactions after initiation. Taken together, these results suggested that ELL might inhibit transcription by reducing the total number of initiation events, rather than by inhibiting elongation. To address this possibility directly, an abortive initiation assay was used to determine whether ELL is capable of inhibiting synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of transcripts initiated at the AdML promoter. RNA polymerase II will utilize dinucleotides to prime synthesis of promoter-specific transcripts (39Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14990-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and dinucleotide-primed initiation at the AdML promoter can occur over an approximately 9-base pair region surrounding the AdML transcriptional start site (43Samuels M. Fire A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If only a dinucleotide primer and the next nucleotide encoded by the AdML promoter are provided as substrates for transcription, RNA polymerase II will reiteratively synthesize abortively initiated, trinucleotide transcripts. The dinucleotide-primed abortive initiation assay has been widely used in studies investigating the requirements for synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (39Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14990-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown previously, and as predicted from the sequence of the AdML promoter (Fig. 2 A), RNA polymerase II and the general initiation factors will synthesize the trinucleotide CpApC at the AdML promoter when provided with CpA and [α-32P]CTP (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). Addition of ELL to transcription reactions before assembly of the preinitiation complex resulted in a substantial reduction in the yield of CpApC (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–10), indicating that ELL is capable of inhibiting synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts. In contrast, addition of ELL to transcription reactions after assembly of the preinitiation complex resulted in significant CpApC synthesis (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11–15). Taken together, these results suggested that ELL inhibits initiation by preventing formation of the functional RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. We note that CpApC synthesis is slightly reduced even when ELL is added to transcription reactions after formation of the preinitiation complex. This modest inhibition of reiterative CpApC synthesis could result from ELL-mediated inhibition of formation of new preinitiation complexes during the course of the reaction. Previous biochemical studies have shown that assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex can be subdivided into at least four stages (outlined in Fig. 3 A) (2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In the first stage, the TATA factor (either TFIID or its TATA box binding subunit TBP) binds sequence-specifically to the core promoter to form the nucleoprotein recognition site for RNA polymerase II at the promoter. RNA polymerase II, assisted by TFIIB, then binds selectively to the TATA factor at the promoter. Entry of TFIIF into the preinitiation complex stabilizes binding of polymerase and TFIIB at the promoter. Finally, binding of TFIIE and TFIIH completes assembly of the preinitiation complex. To determine which step or steps is inhibited by ELL during assembly of the preinitiation complex, order of addition experiments were performed using a heparin challenge protocol (29Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zheng X.M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 50: 361-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Elongation of nascent transcripts longer than ∼4–9 nucleotides is resistant to heparin, whereas assembly of the preinitiation complex and transcription initiation are not. Thus, if heparin is added to promoter-specific transcription reactions shortly after addition of ribonucleoside triphosphates, full-length runoff transcripts will be synthesized only from those promoters at which initiation has already occurred. Furthermore, heparin inhibits ELL activation of elongation by RNA polymerase II (data not shown); consequently, the heparin challenge assay should detect the effect of ELL on assembly of the preinitiation complex or synthesis of the first few phosphodiester bonds of promoter-specific transcripts, but not on further elongation of transcripts. In the experiments of Fig. 3, various combinations of RNA polymerase II and initiation factors were first preincubated with the AdML promoter for 20 min. ELL and the remaining transcription proteins were then added to reactions. After 20 min, transcription was initiated by addition of ATP, UTP, and CTP to allow synthesis of heparin-resistant elongation complexes containing transcripts of not more than 16 nucleotides. After 3 min, heparin was added to transcription reactions to prevent further initiations, and GTP was added to allow synthesis of full-length runoff transcripts. Consistent with the results of abortive initiation assays, addition of ELL to transcription reactions after assembly of the preinitiation complex resulted in substantial synthesis of full-length runoff transcripts initiated at the AdML promoter (Fig. 3, lanes 6, 8, and 11), whereas addition of ELL to heparin challenge transcription reactions before assembly of the preinitiation complex strongly inhibited synthesis of full-lengt"

A covalent antithrombin-heparin complex has been produced with high anticoagulant activity and a long half-life relative to heparin. The product had high anti-factor Xa and antithrombin activities compared with noncovalent mixtures of antithrombin and heparin (861 and 753 units/mg versus 209 and 198 units/mg, respectively). Reaction with thrombin was rapid with bimolecular and second order rate constants of 1.3 × 109m−1 s−1 and 3.1 × 109m−1s−1, respectively. The intravenous half-life of the complex in rabbits was 2.6 h as compared with 0.32 h for similar loads of heparin. Subcutaneous injection of antithrombin-heparin resulted in plasma levels (peaking at 24–30 h) that were still detectable 96 h post-injection. Given the increased lifetime in these vascular and intravascular spaces, use of the covalent complex in the lung was investigated. Activity of antithrombin-heparin instilled into rabbit lungs remained for 48 h with no detection of any complex systemically. Thus, this highly active agent has features required for pulmonary sequestration as a possible treatment for thrombotic diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome.

Thus, this highly active agent has features required for pulmonary sequestration as a possible treatment for thrombotic diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome. Fibrin deposition in the intravascular system causes significant morbidity in the form of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Heparin is an anticoagulant that, when administered systemically, is effective for both the prevention and treatment of intravascular thromboembolic events (1Bergqvist P. J. Int. Med. 1996; 240: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fibrin deposition also occurs outside the intravascular system in a variety of organs and contributes to the morbidity of several diseases (2Conover P.T. Abramowsky C. Beyer-Patterson P. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 3Bergstein J.M. Riley M. Bang N.U. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One example is neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 1The abbreviations used are: RDS, respiratory distress syndrome; BPD, bronchopulmonary dysplasis; AT, antithrombin; H, heparin; ATH, antithrombin-heparin; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; FPR-, phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; HASH, high affinity standard heparin.1The abbreviations used are: RDS, respiratory distress syndrome; BPD, bronchopulmonary dysplasis; AT, antithrombin; H, heparin; ATH, antithrombin-heparin; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; FPR-, phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; HASH, high affinity standard heparin. which is characterized by fibrin deposition in the extravascular, interstitial, and intra-alveolar spaces (4Bachofen M. Weibel E. Clin. Chest Med. 1982; 3: 35-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gitlin D. Craig J. Pediatrics. 1956; 17: 64-71PubMed Google Scholar). Neonatal RDS is a complex disease that probably has multiple pathologic mechanisms contributing to its severity, and the subsequent development of the chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasis (BPD) (6Fukuda Y. Ishizaki M. Masuda Y. Kimura G. Kawanami O. Masugi Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 126: 171-182PubMed Google Scholar, 7Seeger W. Stohr G. Wolf H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1985; 58: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Saldeen T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 384: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The potential importance of fibrin to the severity of neonatal RDS and BPD is supported by the pathologic presence of fibrin in the lung in neonatal RDS, fibrin monomer inhibition of surfactant function (7Seeger W. Stohr G. Wolf H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1985; 58: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and fibrin promotion of fibroblast proliferation (6Fukuda Y. Ishizaki M. Masuda Y. Kimura G. Kawanami O. Masugi Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 126: 171-182PubMed Google Scholar). The potential role of anticoagulants such as heparin for the prevention of extravascular fibrin deposition in neonatal RDS has not been assessed previously. A significant limitation for the potential benefit of anticoagulants in most disease states characterized by extravascular fibrin deposition is that anticoagulants cannot be administered locally. One exception is the lung, where anticoagulants can be administered directly into the airways. Heparin has been administered to adult patients via the lung for the purposes of systemic anticoagulation for intravascular thrombosis (9Wright C.J. Mahadoo J. Jaques L.B. Can. J. Surg. 1981; 24: 130-132PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, heparin itself is not an ideal anticoagulant to administer into the lung in newborns with RDS because of heparin's rapid entry into the intravascular system and its dependence on antithrombin (AT) for activity, which would probably not be present in the intra-alveolar space in the early stages of neonatal RDS. Although purified AT is available, it is a relatively poor inhibitor of thrombin in the absence of heparin (10Hoylaerts M. Owen W.G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin covalently linked to AT would probably be retained in the lung because of its size. If its anticoagulant activities were retained, heparin complexed to AT could function locally as an anticoagulant. Heparin has previously been covalently linked to AT for the purposes of prolonging its half-life when administered intravascularly (11Bjork I. Larm O. Lindahl U. Nordling K. Riquelme M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Ceustermans R. Hoylaerts M. De Mol M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3401-3408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major difficulty encountered in earlier attempts to conjugate AT to heparin was that the introduction of reactive groups for linkage, on AT or heparin, led to complexes with reduced anticoagulant activities. Additionally, the presence of excess unblocked linkage groups in the products could have had unwanted interactions with other molecules or surfaces in vivo. Recently, we described the synthesis of a unique covalent complex (ATH), formed from AT and standard commercial heparin, which required no modification of either the protein or glycosaminoglycan (GAG) prior to conjugation. 2L. Berry, A. Chan, and M. Andrew, submitted for publication.2L. Berry, A. Chan, and M. Andrew, submitted for publication. Production of ATH was accomplished by taking advantage of the fact that a subpopulation of heparin molecules contain aldose termini and the concept that, during prolonged incubations, a Schiff base may form spontaneously between AT lysyl ε-amino and heparin aldose aldehyde groups. Amadori rearrangement could then occur, if there were a free hydroxyl group on C2 of the terminal sugar, or the Schiff base could be stabilized by mild reduction. In this report, we characterize the purification, physicochemical properties, in vitro activity, and in vivo pharmacokinetics of the ATH complex. Since it was likely that the high molecular size of ATH would allow for its sequestration in extravascular spaces, retention of the complex in the lung, as a possible treatment for neonatal RDS, was investigated. All chemicals were of analytical grade. AT was obtained from Bayer. Heparin was obtained from Leo Laboratories Canada Ltd. or Sigma (sodium salt, grade I-A, from porcine intestinal mucosa). High affinity heparin, purified from commercial (standard) heparin, was a kind gift from Dr. Edward Young (Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Centre, Hamilton, ON, Canada). Heparinase (heparin lyase, EC 4.2.2.7) was from ICN, Costa Mesa, CA. Factor Xa and thrombin(IIa) were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. Phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-thrombin (FPR-thrombin; active site-blocked thrombin) was generated from reaction of thrombin andd-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem). Production of ATH has been described previously.2 The relative quantities of AT and heparin to be used in the incubations were determined from an estimate of the fraction of heparin molecules containing both a pentasaccharide (13Oscarsson L.G. Pejler G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 296-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an aldose (14Hatton M.W.C. Berry L.R. Machovich R. Regoeczi E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at their termini (Table I). In brief, a covalent complex between AT and heparin was prepared by incubating 0.5–3 mg/ml AT with 50–70 mg/ml heparin in buffer (0.3 m phosphate, 1 mNaCl, pH 8.0; or 0.02 m phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3) for 3–14 days at 40 °C. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of 0.5m NaBH3CN in buffer/ml of reaction mixture was added at 37 °C and incubated for an additional 5 h, allowing reduction of any Schiff base not stabilized by Amadori rearrangement.Table ITheoretical calculation of commercial heparin molecules terminating in an antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide and an aldosePropertyEstimated fraction of commercial heparin%Contains a pentasaccharide33Contains an aldose10Pentasaccharide at C1 terminus4Pentasaccharide at aldose terminus0.4The fraction of commercial heparin molecules containing a pentasaccharide and the fraction containing an aldose were taken from data determined by Hatton et al.

The fraction of heparin molecules with a pentasaccharide at the C1 terminus was calculated assuming random distribution along the length of an average molecular weight chain (13Oscarsson L.G.

Subsequently the covalent ATH product was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) using 2 m NaCl for elution. A high molecular weight fraction containing covalent ATH complex was isolated and was essentially void of free AT. The ATH fraction was further purified by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.8, using nondenaturing conditions. The section of gel that contained only the ATH complex was cut out and the ATH eluted by incubation in buffer (3.0 g/liter Tris, 14.4 g/liter glycine, pH 8.8) at 23 °C. Purification of ATH was also accomplished on butyl-agarose in one step. Adjustment of the (NH4)2SO4 concentration from 2.5 m to 1.8 m allowed pure ATH to be eluted from the beads while AT remained bound. Large quantities of ATH were purified from the reaction mixture by a two-step procedure involving hydrophobic chromatography on butyl-agarose (Sigma) followed by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). In 2.5 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.02 mphosphate, pH 7.0, ATH and AT bound to butyl-agarose beads while heparin did not. The bound material was eluted with 0.02 mphosphate, pH 7.0, and dialyzed against 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0 buffer, then mixed with pre-equilibrated DEAE Sepharose beads. After washing the beads with 0.2 m NaCl in pH 8.0 buffer to remove bound AT, ATH was eluted with 2 m NaCl in pH 8.0 buffer. The purified ATH was concentrated at 4 °C by dialysis, with a Mr 12,000–14,000 cut-off, under nitrogen pressure (1 atmosphere). All further analyses were carried out using ATH purified by the two-step (butyl-agarose/DEAE) procedure. The ATH complex was subjected to heparin degradation by incubation at 37 °C with 0.01 unit/ml heparinase, 0.001 m CaCl2, 0.001 msodium acetate, 0.15 m NaCl. Protease digestion of the ATH complex involved reaction at 37 °C for 96 h in 0.5m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, with the general protease P-5147 (Sigma), which contained no heparin-degrading activity. 2 mg/ml P-5147 was added initially, followed by additions of another 2 mg/ml every 24 h. Following SDS-PAGE as per Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar), the GAG portion of ATH was stained sequentially with alcian blue and silver (16Krueger R.C.

To estimate the molar ratio of AT to H in ATH, SDS-PAGE gels of heparinase-treated ATH (with multiple AT standards), and protease-treated ATH (with multiple samples of known heparin mass), were prepared. They were stained for protein and GAG, respectively. The relative mass of the ATH components was determined by comparing laser densitometry readings against the similarly quantitated standards. The AT to heparin molar ratio was calculated using a molecular weight of 59,000 for AT and an average molecular weight of 15,000 for heparin. Western immunoblots of ATH employed standard techniques (17Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) with a sheep anti-human AT antibody (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Anti-factor Xa and antithrombin activities were determined on an ACL300 using kits (Stachrom anti-Xa, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France; IL test anti-IIa, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy). The method for measuring activity involved incubation of the sample with excess enzyme (factor Xa or thrombin) for 30 s in buffer (containing, in some cases, exogenous AT), followed by addition of a chromagenic peptide substrate to determine the residual activity. The amount of enzyme activity inhibited during the reaction was compared with a standard curve, constructed from reactions with plasma samples containing standard heparin (from Diagnostica Stago) of known concentrations (units/ml). The units/ml of the sample was divided by the mg/ml of heparin present to obtain specific activities for the compound. To check that antithrombin activity was due to covalent binding of thrombin, SDS-PAGE of ATH reacted with 125I-thrombin (labeled by chloramine T; Ref. 18Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5837) Google Scholar) was performed followed by autoradiography. Fluorescence intensity measurements of buffered (phosphate-buffered saline) solutions of ATH, AT + heparin, and ATH + exogenous heparin were made using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. AT protein concentrations in rabbit plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were measured using an antibody that did not cross-react with rabbit AT (Affinity Biologicals). The methods used to determine the bimolecular and second order rate constants were the same as those used by Hoylaerts et al. (10Hoylaerts M. Owen W.G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constants for the hypothetical kinetic mechanism shown below (Reaction 1) were determined.IIa+ATH⇄k−1k1IIa·ATH→k2IIa­ATH*noncovalentcomplex*covalentcomplexREACTION1Semilog plots of remaining thrombin(IIa) activityversus time were used to calculate apparent rate constants (kapp = ln 2/t½, wheret½ is the time required for disappearance of half of the starting thrombin activity). Double-reciprocal plots ofkapp versus [ATH] allowed determination of the bimolecular rate constant as the ratiok2/Ki (wherek2 = 1/ordinate intercept andKi = −1/abscissa intercept). Use of FPR-thrombin as a competitive inhibitor in the reaction of thrombin + ATH permitted calculation of the IC50 (k−1). The second order rate constant, k1, could then be calculated from the equation Ki = (k−1 +k2)/k1, whereKi is the equilibrium constant for disappearance of the thrombin·ATH intermediate complex. Rabbits were injected either intravenously or subcutaneously with different amounts of ATH, AT, H, or AT + H in 1–2 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 mphosphate, pH 7.3. At predetermined times, 0.5-ml samples of blood were taken into 3.8% sodium citrate (volume blood:citrate = 9:1), centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant plasma stored at −60 °C. Plasma samples were analyzed for anti-factor Xa activity and AT protein concentration as described previously. Half-lives of the various species were calculated by nonlinear least squares fitting to single- or double-exponential equations. The biodistribution of ATH, after introduction into the rabbit lung, was determined. Anesthetized rabbits were orally intubated (polypropylene endotracheal tubes). ATH in 0.15 m NaCl (0.5–1.5 ml/kg) was instilled sequentially into each lung through the tube by alternating lateral positioning of the rabbit. In a subsample of animals, immediate suction was applied to the tube to retrieve the instilled fluid. All rabbits were extubated and recovered from anesthesia. Blood was obtained over time for plasma samples as described above. After 48 h, the rabbits were again anesthetized and intubated, and BAL was performed with 2 ml of 0.15 mNaCl. Fig. 1 A shows the SDS-PAGE of fractions collected during gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 under high ionic strength conditions of the reaction mixture of AT plus H following incubation. Polydisperse high molecular mass ATH complexes separated in early fractions followed by a mixture of unseparated lower molecular mass ATH, unreacted AT (approximately 59 kDa), and free heparin, as identified by sequential staining for protein and GAG. Butyl-agarose chromatography of the ATH reaction mixture separated ATH complex from the beads at 2.0–1.75 m(NH4)2SO4 (Fig. 1 B). At (NH4)2SO4 concentrations of 1.6m or lower, significant amounts of unreacted AT were eluted along with the remaining ATH. Butyl-agarose followed by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography was able to separate all of the ATH complex (Fig. 2, lane 2). Laser densitometric analyses of SDS-PAGE gels, stained for either protein or GAG, showed that ATH purified using butyl-agarose and DEAE-Sepharose was >99% and >95% free of AT and heparin contamination, respectively. If the purified ATH was chromatographed on Sephadex G-200, followed by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels (stained for GAG) of the fractions, it was determined that <4% of the GAG was present as free heparin. The AT to H ratio in the ATH complex is 0.9 or approximately 1 to 1. The molecular mass of ATH complexes ranged from 69 to 100 kDa. An analysis of the purified product and its constituent components following enzyme degradation is shown in Fig. 2. Subsequent gel filtration of the heparin from protease degraded ATH complex showed it to have slightly larger average molecular mass (18 kDa) compared with the starting heparin (15 kDa). Heparinase-degraded ATH complex appears as one to three blurred bands, migrating at slightly higher molecular mass compared with starting AT (Fig. 2, lane 4) due to the one to three disaccharide units that remained linked to the AT despite heparinase. This was not seen with heparinase treatments of noncovalent mixtures of AT and heparin (Fig. 2, lane 6). Western immunoblots of ATH, and ATH pretreated with heparinase, shown in Fig. 3, provide further evidence that ATH contains AT, covalently linked to heparin, which is released only after heparin degradation. Incubation of125I-labeled thrombin with ATH complex, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, demonstrated ATH-thrombin complex formation (Fig. 4). Titration of ATH with purified factor Xa or thrombin showed that >98% of the molecules were active. Thus, 0.98–1 mol of either factor Xa or thrombin were inhibited for each mole of ATH used. Furthermore, anti-factor Xa assays of fractions from Sephadex G-200 chromatography of ATH demonstrated that a significant amount of the conjugate (≈10%) had high activity (>200 units/mg of heparin) and contained a low molecular mass heparin component (≈2000 to ≈4000 Da, determined by gel filtration of the heparin released by protease treatment). Relative fluorescence intensity measurements of 100 nm ATH showed it to be elevated compared with 100 nm AT. Addition of a ≥5-fold molar excess of heparin (saturating amounts) was required to obtain a similar fluorescence with AT, while addition of exogenous heparin to the ATH solution had no effect. Specific anti-factor Xa and antithrombin activities of ATH are shown in Table II. When exogenous AT was added, a more than 15-fold increase in capacity of ATH to inhibit either factor Xa or thrombin was observed. Thus the ATH compound had catalytic in addition to noncatalytic activities. Additionally, the activities of ATH, when exogenous AT was present, were approximately 4 times and 2 times greater than the corresponding values for standard heparin and high affinity standard heparin (HASH), respectively. This result indicated that, during ATH formation, AT had selected for heparin molecules enriched with AT binding sites (and thus anticoagulant activities) compared with heparin prepared by affinity chromatography (HASH).Table IIAnticoagulant activities of ATHCompoundExogenous AT addedNo exogenous AT addedAnti-factor XaAnti-IIaAnti-factor XaAnti-IIaunits/mgunits/mgunits/mgunits/mgAT0000AT + H20919838.412AT + HASH37440336.514ATH86175453.817Activities were assayed using commercially available kits, involving an end point analysis of the residual chromogenic activity remainingversus an international standard heparin.

The bimolecular rate constant and second order rate constants obtained for ATH inhibition of thrombin were 1.3 × 109 ± 2 × 108m−1 s−1 (n = 3) and 3.1 × 109 ± 4 × 108m−1 s−1 (n = 3k−1 determinations) respectively. In comparison, the bimolecular rate constant for noncovalent mixtures of AT + standard heparin was 1 × 108m−1 s−1. The addition of exogenous heparin at molar concentrations greater than 5 times the [ATH] inhibited the thrombin + ATH reaction (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of added heparin on the rate of inhibition of thrombin by ATH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The intravascular clearance of human AT, heparin, noncovalent mixtures of AT + heparin, and ATH from plasma after intravenous injection into rabbits are shown in Fig. 7. Heparin with or without coinjection of AT was rapidly cleared. The clearance of AT followed an exponential decay pattern. If the plasma curves of heparin, heparin coinjected with AT, AT, and ATH were all analyzed as single-exponential decays (simple two-compartment model) half-lives of 0.32, 0.41, 13, and 2.6 h, respectively, were obtained. Use of a double-exponential model for AT and ATH gives half-lives for the β phase of 69 and 13 h, respectively. The plasma clearance of ATH more closely resembled AT than heparin in the rabbit model. Subcutaneous injection into rabbits of ATH, AT, H, and AT + H showed ATH reached peak plasma concentration at 24–30 h post-injection, with significant amounts observed up to 96 h post-injection (Fig. 8). Heparin was rapidly absorbed, with peak activity by 1 h, and disappearance by 4 h. AT pharmacokinetics were similar to ATH; however, the maximum concentration of ATH in plasma after subcutaneous injection was only 3–5% of that for AT. Results from tracheal instillation of ATH are shown in Fig. 9. Approximately 50% of the anti-factor Xa activity of the starting fluid could be recovered in fluid extracted immediately after instillation (Fig. 9 A). A similar amount of ATH was detected by mass (Fig. 9 B). BAL taken 48 h after the introduction of ATH, still contained measurable anti-factor Xa activity (≈2% of instillation fluid) and human AT (≈3% of instillation fluid) in all animals, regardless of whether initial suction had been performed. Plasma samples taken throughout the lung experiments revealed that, in all animals, no detectable ATH (either by anti-factor Xa assay or AT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was present in the circulation. Fibrin deposition in the lung is a consistent feature of neonatal RDS (4Bachofen M. Weibel E. Clin. Chest Med. 1982; 3: 35-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gitlin D. Craig J. Pediatrics. 1956; 17: 64-71PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of observations suggest that fibrin may be contributing both to the severity of neonatal RDS and subsequent development of BPD (6Fukuda Y. Ishizaki M. Masuda Y. Kimura G. Kawanami O. Masugi Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 126: 171-182PubMed Google Scholar, 8Saldeen T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 384: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Coalson J. Winter V. Gerstmann D. Idell S. King R. Delemos R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis . 1992; 145: 872-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The local administration of an anticoagulant that could prevent fibrin formation in the lung, but not be absorbed systemically, could be beneficial. The properties of an anticoagulant that may be successful locally within the alveolar space include a large molecular weight, to prevent systemic absorption, and the capacity to inhibit thrombin in the absence of any other components of the coagulation system. To develop such an agent, we explored the possibility of conjugating heparin to the natural thrombin inhibitor, AT. Taking advantage of unique properties of AT and heparin, the complex ATH was formed. ATH was of large molecular weight, was retained within the lung when administered locally, and had potent antithrombin activity. Heparin is a highly sulfonated polymer containing repeating uronic acid-glucosamine disaccharides (20Casu B. Oreste P. Torri G. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Endogenously, heparin is produced and secreted by mast cells in a proteoglycan form containing long heparin GAG chains linked glycosidically to serine residues of a core protein (21Horner A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Commercially, heparin is prepared from intestinal mucosa or lung as a degradation product consisting of GAG molecules that have no polypeptide attached. Most of these heparin GAG fragments are still linked to a serine, but approximately 10% have a free aldose terminus (14Hatton M.W.C. Berry L.R. Machovich R. Regoeczi E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The free aldose aldehyde group was used to produce a novel covalent complex of AT and heparin with high anti-factor Xa/IIa activities and a prolonged half-life when administered intravenously or locally in the lung. Purification of the ATH conjugate was optimally achieved by a two-step procedure consisting of hydrophobic chromatography (butyl-agarose) followed by anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose). The final product contained AT and heparin linked together by either Amadori rearrangement or reduction of the Schiff base between an AT lysyl ε-amino group and a heparin aldose aldehyde group. In the ATH complex, the AT to heparin molar ratio was close to 1:1. Due to heparin's polydispersity, the molecular mass ranged from 69 to 100 kDa. ATH exhibited characteristics of a covalent conjugate, which showed no signs of dissociation on SDS-PAGE after heating at 100 °C in β-mercaptoethanol- and detergent-containing buffer (Fig. 2). The average molecular mass of the heparin component of ATH was slightly higher than the starting heparin (18 kDa compared to 15 kDa), indicating that AT had selected for larger heparin molecules during conjugation. Since complex formation could occur by simple incubation of unmodified AT and heparin, it was not surprising that a high activity compound was produced. Under these conditions, binding of heparin by AT would initially occur via non-covalent interactions with high affinity binding sites (pentasaccharide sequences; Ref. 22Mille B. Watton J. Barrowcliffe T.W. Mani J. Lane D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29435-29443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a heparin molecule was bound to AT via a pentasaccharide sequence that was in close proximity to an aldose terminus on the heparin molecule, covalent attachment occurred. Evidence for this mechanism is apparent by the fact that preparations contained highly active ATH molecules where the pentasaccharide sequence was close to the AT component due to the short heparin chain length (≈2000 to ≈4000 Da). AT in the conjugate had an elevated fluorescence characteristic of the active conformation (23Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably due to direct interaction with the heparin in the complex, since similar mixtures of AT + heparin had significantly reduced values. The specific anti-factor Xa and antithrombin activities of ATH were found to be significantly and unexpectedly increased, compared with either standard heparin or HASH, when exogenous AT was added (Table II). The anti-factor Xa activity of ATH is comparable to the value obtained by Rosenberg et al. (24Rosenberg R.D. Jordan R.E. Favreau L.V. Lam L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for a subfraction of commercial heparin, which contained two AT binding sites/molecule. If the heparin moiety in ATH contained, on the average, more than 1 AT binding pentasaccharide/molecule, this may explain how the conjugated heparin could catalyze inhibition by exogenous AT while still being linked to the AT at the aldose terminus. Selection for the very small percentage of multi-pentasaccharide, very high affinity, heparin present in standard heparin (≈1–3%; Ref. 24Rosenberg R.D. Jordan R.E. Favreau L.V. Lam L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was possible, given the long incubations with a high heparin:AT molar ratio (200:1). Kinetically, the velocity of reaction with thrombin was about 1 order of magnitude faster for ATH than for AT + standard heparin. The second order rate constant of 3.1 × 109m−1 s−1 is one of the highest ever reported and is probably diffusion rate-limited (25Evans D.Ll. McGrogan M. Scott R.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 266: 22307-22312Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). There are several potential reasons for the very high rate of reaction. Unlike noncovalent mixtures of AT and heparin, there is no initial binding of serpin and GAG required, which is the rate-determining step (26Pletcher C.H. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5342-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, AT may have selected for heparins with higher average anionic density, which would enhance the interactions of thrombin with ATH since its binding is a charge-dependent phenomenon (27Petersen L.C. Jorgensen M. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All of the heparin molecules in ATH contain the high affinity AT binding site, and, since the average heparin chain length in the conjugate was greater than the starting heparin, thrombin would have a shorter mean path distance for contacting the inhibitor complex. The geometry of heparin in the ATH complex was optimal, since addition of exogenous heparin inhibited the reaction with thrombin (Fig. 6). ATH has several important differences compared with previous covalent AT-heparin complexes. AT conjugated to nitrous acid-treated heparin via reduction of the Schiff base between a lysyl ε-amino and anhydromannose aldehyde had significantly lower anti-factor Xa activity (140 units/mg of heparin) and essentially no anti-thrombin activity (28Dawes J. James K. Lane D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Joining of AT to heparin by hexamethylenediamine spacer arms between AT lysyl ε-amino groups and heparin uronic acid carboxyl groups resulted in a heterogeneous product composed of molecules with variable numbers of AT joined to heparin chains, as well as significant amounts of unreacted linkage groups remaining on the complex (12Ceustermans R. Hoylaerts M. De Mol M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3401-3408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attachment of hexamethylenediamine linkage groups to high affinity heparin reduced the specific anti-factor Xa activity from 250 units/mg to 162 units/mg, and addition of exogenous heparin to the spacer arm bonded complex doubled the rate of inhibition of Xa (12Ceustermans R. Hoylaerts M. De Mol M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3401-3408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that significant amounts of the modified heparin had lost activity. In contrast, added heparin had no effect on the reaction of ATH with Xa (data not shown). The second order rate constant determined for reaction of the hexamethylenediamine-linked AT and heparin with thrombin was 6.7 × 108m−1s−1 (10Hoylaerts M. Owen W.G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is 4–5 times lower than that for ATH reported here using the same method of measurement. Covalent bonding of AT and heparin using other methods (29Bregman M.D. Levy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Hixon S.H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4251-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has given products with decreased activity. The clearance of ATH, when administered intravenously, was significantly decreased compared with free heparin. The intravenous half-life of ATH was at least 8 times longer than that for heparin, and its disappearance profile approached that of human AT in the rabbit (Fig. 7). Given the increased size of ATH compared with heparin, its elimination via glomerular filtration through the kidneys would be limited. It is possible that the covalently linked AT in ATH may have also have inhibited binding of the heparin component with cell surface receptors involved in clearance. Although subcutaneous administration resulted in prolonged in vivo activity, the bioavailability was greatly reduced (Fig. 8). The poor absorption of ATH into the blood stream, from a subcutaneous injection, suggested that it might be retained in the lung and, if so, may have a role as an anticoagulant for neonatal RDS. RDS is characterized by increased lung permeability, which leads to intra-alveolar coagulation and the formation of a hyaline membranes that contain fibrin (4Bachofen M. Weibel E. Clin. Chest Med. 1982; 3: 35-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gitlin D. Craig J. Pediatrics. 1956; 17: 64-71PubMed Google Scholar). The hyaline membrane inhibits gas exchange (8Saldeen T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 384: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), causes recruitment of fibroblasts resulting in fibrosis (6Fukuda Y. Ishizaki M. Masuda Y. Kimura G. Kawanami O. Masugi Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 126: 171-182PubMed Google Scholar), and assists in the evolution toward BPD (19Coalson J. Winter V. Gerstmann D. Idell S. King R. Delemos R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis . 1992; 145: 872-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As thrombin inhibitors are not likely to be present in consistently high levels in the air space, it would be highly useful to have a permanently activated AT molecule available to prevent thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition. Results from the introduction of ATH into the lungs of rabbits showed that significant activity, as well as AT concentration, could be recovered in BAL taken 48 h after the start of the experiment (Fig. 9). Heparin delivered intratracheally in dogs is readily lost from the lungs into the circulation, with plasma values peaking at 6 h (9Wright C.J. Mahadoo J. Jaques L.B. Can. J. Surg. 1981; 24: 130-132PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, ATH was retained in the lungs for over 48 h without detectable ATH in plasma by a highly sensitive AT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thus, ATH is retained with high antithrombin activity in the lung following local instillation. These properties are critically important to prevent fibrin deposition in the lung. The potential benefits of ATH in neonatal RDS warrant evaluation in an animal model and potentially in newborns.

https://openalex.org/W1861168133,"Aging leads to changes in the relative proportions of several functionally distinct T cell subsets, including increases in the proportions of memory cells in the CD4 and CD8 subsets and in the proportion of T cells expressing the multiple-drug resistance pump P-glycoprotein. To see whether individual differences in T cell subset levels predict life span, we measured the levels of five age-sensitive T cell subsets, at 8 and again at 18 months of age, in the peripheral blood of genetically heterogeneous mice bred as the progeny of CB6F1 females and C3D2F1 males. The strongest immunological predictor of life span in univariate regression analyses was the proportion of CD4 memory cells measured at 18 months of age (P=0.003). CD4 memory cell levels remained strongly correlated with life span (P<0.0003) in a multiple regression analysis after adjustment for sex. The proportion of CD4 cells expressing P-glycoprotein was also correlated with life span (P<0.01), but only in male mice. Weaker relationships were observed between life span and 8-month tests of CD8 memory and CD8 P-glycoprotein levels, for CD4 naive cells at 18 months, and for the change in CD4 naive cells between 8 and 18 months of age; these were, however, near the margin of statistical significance and could reflect chance relationships. The relationship between CD4 memory cell levels and life span was similarly strong regardless of the cause of death in mice whose death was attributable to lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, mammary carcinoma, and other forms of terminal pathology. Additional work is needed to discriminate between two hypotheses: 1) that high levels of CD4 memory cell themselves predispose to disease and early death, particularly from neoplasia; or 2) that accumulation of CD4 memory cells is a biomarker of some underlying process-perhaps accelerated aging-that itself leads to early mortality."

The hypothesis that 17beta-estradiol produces NO and activates K(Ca) channels during coronary hypoperfusion was investigated. In open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the left carotid artery. 17beta-Estradiol was infused into the bypass tube for 20 min after coronary blood flow was reduced by partial occlusion of the bypass tube. 17beta-Estradiol increased the difference in NO concentrations between the coronary venous and arterial blood as well as coronary blood flow. The lactate extraction ratio and pH of coronary venous blood were both also increased by 17beta-estradiol, indicating a reduction in myocardial anaerobic metabolism. Whereas the increase in the coronary arteriovenous difference in NO concentration was completely attenuated by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase), the increase in coronary blood flow induced by 17beta-estradiol was only partially attenuated by L-NAME. The combination of L-NAME and iberiotoxin (a blocker of high-conductance K(Ca) channels) completely abolished the coronary vasodilatory effect of 17beta-estradiol. The data indicate that during coronary hypoperfusion in canine hearts, 17beta-estradiol increases coronary blood flow and improves metabolic dysfunction by increasing NO release and opening K(Ca) channels."

The TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity appeared to be mediated via the activating transcription factor (ATF) site, because mutation of this site abolished down-regulation.

Because TGF-β arrests progression of the cell cycle in mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells when added both early and late in the G1 period (3Howe P.H. Draetta G. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of TGF-β could be mediated by more than one mechanism. The progress of the cell cycle is regulated by the sequential expression of cyclins, followed by the activation of their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the Cdks block cell cycle progression (5Peter M. Herskowitz I.

Cyclin A associates with Cdk2 in the S phase of the cell cycle and with Cdc2 in the G2/M phase, and it is required for DNA replication in the S phase (4Sherr C.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Cyclin A can also affect the G1/S transition, as overexpression of cyclin A but not cyclin D1 or E overcomes the G1/S block induced by loss of cell adhesion (19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The human and mouse cyclin A genes have been cloned recently and their promoters analyzed (20Zwicker J.

A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and the CDE/CHR consensus sequence has been implicated as a negative regulator of cyclin A promoter activity during the cell cycle (20Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 23Huet X. Rech J. Plet A. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the transcription factors that bind to the CDE/CHR site have not been cloned, these factors bind to the site only during the G0and the early G1 phases of the cell cycle. The CDE/CHR-binding proteins may then repress the activity of the cyclin A activating transcription factor (ATF) site. The cyclin A ATF site is bound by ATF-1 and the cyclic AMP-responsive binding protein (CREB), which function as positive regulators of the cyclin A promoter (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Tsai J.-C. Wang H.

Also, the activity of ATF-1 and CREB is regulated by their phosphorylation status (26Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar). Although negative regulation of the cyclin A promoter during progression of the cell cycle could be mediated by the CDE/CHR site, we have shown elsewhere that down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity during contact inhibition is mediated through the ATF site and that the abundance of ATF-1 protein and mRNA is reduced (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We describe in this report mechanisms by which TGF-β1 down-regulates cyclin A promoter activity in mink lung epithelial cells. A TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity was mediated through the ATF site. Twenty-four hours of TGF-β1 treatment decreased cyclin A mRNA and promoter activity but not the abundance of the ATF-binding proteins ATF-1 and CREB. Using antibodies specific for phosphorylated ATF-1 and CREB, we detected a significant reduction in phosphorylated ATF-1 and CREB only in TGF-β1-treated cells. The TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity was reversed by cotransfection with expression plasmids harboring cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or simian virus 40 small tumor antigen (Sm-t). Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu, CCL-64) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The activity of the cyclin A promoter was very sensitive to confluence in Mv1Lu cells, as it is in vascular endothelial cells (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of about 30,000 cells/cm2 on a 10-cm dish (surface area, 55 cm2) for 72 h. To keep them from becoming confluent, the cells were trypsinized, transferred from the 10-cm dish to a 15-cm dish, treated with TGF-β1, and harvested at various times thereafter. Reporter constructs containing fragments of the human cyclin A 5′-flanking region were inserted into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cyclin A plasmids contained a 3500-bp SmaI-SmaI restriction fragment (∼bp −3200 to +245), a 761-bp SacI-SmaI fragment (bp −516 to +245), and fragments of 471 bp (−266/+205), 338 bp (−133/+205), and 132 bp (−133/−2). The ATF consensus sequence (TGACGTCA) in the plasmids −266/+205 and −133/+205 was mutated to TGCCCCCA by polymerase chain reaction to generate the plasmids mut 266/+205 and mut −133/+205, as described elsewhere (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mv1Lu cells were transfected with 15 μg of luciferase construct by the calcium phosphate method as described (28Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). To correct for variability in transfection efficiency, we cotransfected 2 μg of pCMV-βGAL (containing the potent cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter driving the β-galactosidase gene) in all experiments. The luciferase assay and β-galactosidase assay were performed as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity in each sample was used as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Each construct was transfected at least two times, and each transfection was done in quadruplicate. Data for each construct are presented as the mean ± S.E. For the cotransfection study, a catalytic β-subunit of PKA, obtained from Dr. R. A. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) (29Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). As a negative control, we cloned an inactivated form of the PKA catalytic β-subunit (mut-PKA) into the same vector. The expression plasmids pCEP4 Sm-t and pCB6-I-1, encoding full-length Sm-t and a constitutively active form of I-1, respectively, were provided by Drs. A. Alberts (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom) and S. Shenolikar (Duke University, Durham, NC). Total RNA was prepared from Mv1Lu cells by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar, 31Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human cyclin A cDNA fragment was amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The human ATF-1 plasmid (32Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and a human CREB plasmid (33Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar) were obtained from Drs. M. R. Green (University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA) and M. R. Montminy (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Total RNA was fractionated on 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized with a randomly primed, 32P-labeled cyclin A cDNA probe. The hybridized filters were washed in 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 40 °C and autoradiographed on x-ray film or stored on phosphor screens for 8–10 h (6Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in RNA loading, the filters were washed in a 50% formamide solution at 80 °C and rehybridized with a radiolabeled 18 S rRNA oligonucleotide probe (34Yoshizumi M. Kourembanas S. Temizer D.H. Cambria R.P. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9467-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were scanned, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear extracts from Mv1Lu cells were prepared as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in nuclear extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay system, which is based on the Bradford method (35Schneider M.D. Payne P.A. Ueno H. Perryman M.B. Roberts R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes synthesized according to the sequence of the human cyclin A ATF site (bp −84 to −63, 5′ TGAATGACGTCAAGGCCGCGAG 3′) were radiolabeled as described (34Yoshizumi M. Kourembanas S. Temizer D.H. Cambria R.P. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9467-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical binding reaction mixture contained DNA probe at 20,000 cpm, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 3 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed by 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA). To characterize specific DNA-binding proteins, we incubated nuclear extracts with various antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C before addition of the probe. The polyclonal antibodies were raised against human ATF-1 and ATF-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and CREB (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To examine the phosphorylation of CREB and AFT-1, we separated 30 μg of nuclear extract (prepared from Mv1Lu cells treated with or without TGF-β1 for 24 h) on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted the extract with phospho-CREB-specific (Ser-133) antibody according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (PhosphoPlus CREB (Ser-133) antibody kit, New England Biolabs). This antibody specifically recognizes the phosphorylated forms of CREB and ATF-1. The same blot was then incubated with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C and reblotted with anti-ATF-1 (C41–5.1) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), which does not cross-react with other members of the ATF/CREB family, and then with anti-CREB (C-21) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which is specific for CREB1. To identify sequences that mediate down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity by TGF-β1, we transfected a series of luciferase reporter gene plasmids containing various lengths of the human cyclin A 5′ flanking sequence into Mv1Lu cells treated with or without TGF-β1 for 48 h. The ratio of luciferase activity in TGF-β1-treated cells versusuntreated cells was calculated for each plasmid. Although TGF-β1 had no effect on the luciferase activity of pGL2-Control (driven by the potent SV40 enhancer and promoter), it decreased luciferase activity by 80% in all but two plasmids containing the cyclin A promoter (Fig. 1). In these two plasmids (mut −266/+205 and mut −133/+205), the ATF sequence had been mutated. These data indicate that the ATF site mediates down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity by TGF-β1 in Mv1Lu cells. We also determined the time course of the TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity. TGF-β1 decreased luciferase activity by 25% at 12 h and by 70% at 24 h (Fig. 2 A). Considering the half-life of the luciferase protein (∼6 h), inhibition of cyclin A promoter activity must have occurred before 12 h. This possibility was further supported by the finding that TGF-β1 markedly decreased cyclin A mRNA abundance at 12 h (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2TGF-β1 treatment for 24 h decreases cyclin A promoter activity and the abundance of cyclin A mRNA but not that of ATF-binding proteins. A, Mv1Lu cells were transfected with cyclin A promoter plasmid −266/+205 as described for Fig. 1 and then treated with or without TGF-β1 (50 pm) for the indicated times. Cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured as in Fig. 1. B, Mv1Lu cells were treated with or without TGF-β1 for the indicated times and then harvested for Northern analysis with cyclin A and 18 S probes (to correct for differences in loading) as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). C, gel mobility shift assays were performed with a double-stranded,32P-labeled, 22-bp oligonucleotide containing the ATF site of the cyclin A promoter. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Mv1Lu cells treated with or without TGF-β1 for the indicated times. Addition of nuclear extracts from Mv1Lu cells resulted in three retarded bands, X, Y, and Z. NS and Free indicate nonspecific band and free probe, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effect of TGF-β1 on ATF-binding proteins, we performed gel mobility shift analysis with a 22-bp probe encoding the ATF consensus sequence (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and nuclear extracts prepared from Mv1Lu cells treated with TGF-β1 for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Incubation of nuclear extract from untreated Mv1Lu cells with the 22-bp probe resulted in three specific DNA·protein complexes, X, Y, and Z (Fig. 2 C), as we have observed in nuclear extract from vascular endothelial cells (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The three complexes were competed away by an identical unlabeled oligonucleotide but not by an oligonucleotide containing a mutated ATF site (data not shown). To our surprise, we found that TGF-β1 treatment for up to 24 h had no effect on the abundance of complexes X, Y, and Z. This lack of effect is in sharp contrast to the significant reduction in cyclin A mRNA abundance and promoter activity observed 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 eventually decreased the abundance of all three complexes of ATF-binding proteins after 36 and 48 h (Fig. 2 C). This reduction in ATF-binding proteins may have played an important role in the complete down-regulation of cyclin A gene transcription at 36 and 48 h (Fig. 2 A). To identify proteins that bind to the ATF-site, we performed gel mobility shift analysis with antibodies. Before addition of the probe, Mv1Lu cell extracts were incubated with or without antibody to ATF-1, CREB, or ATF-2 (Fig. 3). The faint X complex visible in Fig. 2 C disappeared in Fig. 3, even in nuclear extracts preincubated without an antibody. Preincubation of nuclear extracts with antibody specific to ATF-1 or CREB, but not ATF-2, markedly decreased the density of the DNA·protein complexes (Fig. 3). In addition, the anti-CREB antibody produced a supershifted DNA·protein·antibody complex (indicated by anasterisk). These data identify ATF-1 and CREB as the major binding proteins for the cyclin A ATF site in Mv1Lu cells, as we have observed previously in vascular endothelial cells (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At 24 h, TGF-β1 decreased cyclin A mRNA levels and promoter activity (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, it had no effect on the abundance of ATF-binding proteins that regulate cyclin A promoter activity. To investigate this paradox, we examined CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation, because it has been shown that only the phosphorylated forms of CREB and ATF-1 are active (26Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar, 36Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). We performed Western analysis with 30 μg of nuclear extract from Mv1Lu cells treated with or without TGF-β1 for 24 h and antibodies that recognized phosphorylated CREB, total CREB, phosphorylated ATF-1, and total ATF-1. Although TGF-β1 had little effect on the total amount of CREB and ATF-1, it decreased the phosphorylated forms of CREB and ATF-1 by 90 and 78%, respectively (Fig. 4), as measured on a PhosphorImager. If TGF-β1 inhibits cyclin A promoter activity by decreasing phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB, agents that increase the phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB should counteract this inhibitory effect. To test this hypothesis we cotransfected into Mv1Lu cells 15 μg of cyclin A reporter plasmid −266/+205 and various amounts of a PKA catalytic subunit expression plasmid. This form of PKA has been shown to phosphorylate and activate ATF-1 and CREB (24Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wanf J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of the PKA expression plasmid reversed TGF-β1-induced inhibition of cyclin A promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Twenty micrograms of PKA expression plasmid completely suppressed down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity by TGF-β1. As a negative control, we also cotransfected a mutant PKA expression plasmid that does not phosphorylate CREB. The mutant PKA expression plasmid did not prevent TGF-β1-induced inhibition of cyclin A promoter activity (data not shown). In contrast with PKA, protein Ser/Thr phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylate CREB (39Alberts A.S. Montminy M. Shenolikar S. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell.

We first examined the effect of okadaic acid (42MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, on TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity. Although low doses of okadaic acid had no effect, 20 nm okadaic acid almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on cyclin A promoter activity (Fig. 6 A). To determine whether 20 nm okadaic acid affected TGF-β1-induced decreases in ATF-1 and CREB phosphorylation, we treated Mv1Lu cells with or without 20 nm okadaic acid for 30 min before adding TGF-β1. Okadaic acid prevented the down-regulation of ATF-1 and CREB induced by TGF-β1 (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that the phosphorylation status of ATF-1 and CREB may be responsible for TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of cyclin A transcription. To test further whether inhibition of PP1 or PP2A prevented TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity, we cotransfected 7.5 μg of cyclin A reporter plasmid −266/+205 with 15 μg of expression plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of I-1 or full-length Sm-t, which inhibit PP1 and PP2A, respectively (39Alberts A.S.

Cotransfection with the Sm-t, but not the I-1, expression plasmid abolished the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, the Sm-t expression plasmid reversed the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B). As little as 3.5 μg of Sm-t expression plasmid almost completely abolished inhibition by TGF-β1.Figure 7Sm-t reverses the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on the cyclin A promoter. A, Mv1Lu cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of cyclin A reporter plasmid −266/+205 and 15 μg of pcDNA vector, Sm-t expression plasmid, or I-1 expression plasmid. After transfection, the cells were treated with 50 pm TGF-β1 for 24 h, and the extracts were harvested.B, Mv1Lu cells were transfected with 7 μg of cyclin A reporter plasmid −266/+205 and 0–7 μg of Sm-t expression plasmid DNA. The quantity of total DNA was kept constant (14 μg) by the addition of vector DNA. After transfection, the cells were treated with 50 pm TGF-β1 for an additional 24 h, and extract was harvested for luciferase assays as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although it has been shown that a functional TGF-β receptor complex (including both types I and II) is required for TGF-β-induced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity (45Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the downstream inhibitory pathway has not been completely elucidated. In this report we show that the ATF site mediates inhibition of the cyclin A promoter by TGF-β1 in mink lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1). Treatment with TGF-β1 for 24 h markedly decreased cyclin A mRNA levels but had no effect on the abundance of ATF-binding proteins (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB is crucial to their ability totrans-activate target genes (26Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 is required for it to bind to CBP (CREB-binding protein) and activate transcription of its target genes (46Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T.

Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). PKA and Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate ATF-1 and CREB (36Liu F.

Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Recently RSK-2 (a member of the pp90 rsk family and a downstream kinase of the p21 ras signaling pathways) has also been shown to function as a CREB kinase (50Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). It appears that multiple signal pathways converge at the point of CREB/ATF-1 phosphorylation to regulate the activity of these transcription factors. Also, the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1 and PP2A have been shown to dephosphorylate CREB and decrease its activity (39Alberts A.S. Montminy M. Shenolikar S. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, the total activity of ATF-1 and CREB depends on their phosphorylation state, which in turn reflects a balance between the kinases and phosphatases (26Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar). Although we did not examine the effect of TGF-β1 on individual kinases and phosphatases, TGF-β1 treatment for 24 h resulted in a marked reduction in phosphorylated ATF-1 and CREB but had little effect on total ATF-1 and CREB (Fig. 4). Thus, TGF-β1 may suppress cyclin A activity by reducing ATF-1 and CREB phosphorylation. This conclusion is further supported by our observation that okadaic acid and the PKA catalytic subunit, which increases phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB, overcame the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on cyclin A promoter activity (Figs. 5 and 6). The suppression of the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on cyclin A promoter activity by okadaic acid in Mv1Lu cells implies the presence of an okadaic acid-sensitive CREB/ATF-1 phosphatase in this cell type. PP1 is the principal CREB phosphatase in fibroblasts and thyroid follicular cells (39Alberts A.S. Montminy M. Shenolikar S. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), whereas PP2A is the principal CREB phosphatase in hepatocytes (41Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to differences in protein expression among cell types or to differences in protein phosphatase preparations (41Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of these phosphatases in Mv1Lu cells has not been estimated. Our finding that cotransfection of Sm-t, but not I-1 (Fig. 7), abolished TGF-β1's inhibitory effect indicates that PP2A may play a role in TGF-β1-induced dephosphorylation of CREB/ATF-1 in Mv1Lu cells, but certainly does not exclude a role for PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of CREB/ATF-1 in this cell type. Our data indicate that TGF-β1 may inhibit cyclin A promoter activity by decreasing the phosphorylation and activity of CREB and ATF-1 but not their abundance. These data illustrate one of the biochemical pathways by which TGF-β inhibits cyclin A transcription and progression of cell cycle. We extend our gratitude to Edgar Haber for his continued enthusiasm and support of our work.

https://openalex.org/W1568690086,"Apoptosis is a fundamental mechanism implicated in normal development. One of the most spectacular developmental events involving apoptosis is tail regression during amphibian metamorphosis. We analyzed how thyroid hormone (3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine, T3), the orchestrator of metamorphosis, affects expression and function of the proapoptotic gene Bax in the tail muscle of free-living Xenopus tadpoles. During natural metamorphosis Bax mRNA was expressed in tail muscles and was spatially correlated with apoptosis. Precocious treatment of tadpoles with T3 induced Bax expression and apoptosis. To verify that Bax expression was causally related to apoptosis we used a naked DNA gene transfer method to express Bax in the dorsal tail muscle. This induced apoptosis, and the process was exacerbated by T3 treatment. To determine whether T3 effects on Bax expression involved transcriptional regulation, we injected a Bax promoter sequence into dorsal and caudal tail muscles. In the dorsal muscle, T3 treatment did not affect transcription from the Bax promoter. However, in the caudal muscle, T3 treatment significantly increased Bax transcription. We conclude that T3-induced apoptosis in Xenopus tadpole tail muscles involves Bax-activating and Bax-synergistic mechanisms. These programs are induced in spatially and temporally distinct manners.—Sachs, L. M., Abdallah, B., Hassan, A., Levi, G., de Luze, A., Reed, J. C., Demeneix, B. A.

https://openalex.org/W1987701332,"By transient expression of both truncated forms of p52 SHCA and those with point mutations in 293T cells, it has been shown that, in addition to Tyr-317, Tyr-239/240 is a major site of phosphorylation that serves as a docking site for Grb2·Sos1 complexes. In addition, analysis of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in 293T cells showed that the overexpression Shc SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains of ShcA alone has a more potent negative effect than the overexpression of the forms of ShcA lacking Tyr-317 or Tyr 239/240 or both. In transiently transfected PC12 cells, the ShcA PTB domain and tyrosine phosphorylation in the CH1 domain, especially on Tyr-239/240, are crucial for mediating nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that the EGF and NGF (TrkA) receptor can utilize Shc in different ways to promote their activity. For EGF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in 293T cells, both Shc PTB and SH2 domains are essential for optimal activation, indicating that a mechanism independent of Grb2 engagement with Shc may exist. For NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, Shc PTB plays an essential role, and phosphorylation on Tyr-239/240, but not on Tyr-317, is required.

Grb2 is a 23-kDa adaptor protein composed of an SH2-type phosphotyrosine recognition domain, flanked by two SH3 domains that recognize proline-rich sequences (reviewed in Ref. 4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Sos1 is a 170-kDa protein with a guanine nucleotide exchanging domain that can catalyze the conversion of inactive Ras, with bound GDP, into its active form, with bound GTP (reviewed in Ref. 5McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Beside its catalytic domain, Sos1 contains a proline-rich region enabling it to couple with Grb2 (6Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar S.D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras can be achieved when cytosolic Sos translocates to the plasma membrane, where cellular Ras normally resides (7Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This translocation is mediated by the recruitment of Grb2 onto the intracellular domain of an activated receptor tyrosine kinase, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (8Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Grb2 can dock through its SH2 domain with specific phosphotyrosine residues of the activated EGFR which subsequently allows relocalization of Sos1 to the plasma membrane level (reviewed in Ref. 9Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Activated Ras allows a cascade of events starting with the activation of the serine kinase Raf that phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase (also denoted MEK), which in turn activates MAP kinase by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues (reviewed in Ref. 1Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the EGFR can utilize Grb2 directly to mediate MAP kinase activation, it can also recruit Grb2 and Sos1 indirectly, which involves the Shc family of adaptor proteins (10Basu T. Warne P.H.

The first member identified and the prototype of this family of molecules, ShcA, is composed of a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain at its N terminus and one C-terminal SH2 domain. These domains are separated by a collagen homologue (CH1) domain (12Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

ShcA is present in two major forms of 46 and 52 kDa and a less abundant one of 66 kDa. p46 shc and p52 SHCA derive from alternative transcription initiation (12Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F.

It has been shown that a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of the Shc binding site on TrkA dramatically decreased MAP kinase activation and suppresses NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (26Obermeier A.

Interestingly, the sequence alignment of the Shc proteins revealed the conservation of tyrosines in positions 239 and 240 in the CH1 domain (of ShcA). This suggests that these residues could have an important function in the recruitment of SH2 containing molecules and the starting point of a new signaling pathway.

Mutated and truncated sequence were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pCMV-1 expression vector (35Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and mutations of the constructs used are summarized in Fig. 1. Thirty percent confluent 293T cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The precipitate was incubated for 12 h, and cells were allowed to grow in fresh complete medium overnight. Cells were then starved in serum-free medium for the next 24 h and stimulated with 50 ng of EGF per ml for the indicated period. PC12 cells were grown at low density on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 2.5 μg of DNA using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommendations. After a 5-h incubation, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in complete medium and then treated with 100 ng of NGF per ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum for 48 h. Following transfection and stimulation with EGF, 293T cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and lysed in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, and containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Pharmacia) preequilibrated in lysis buffer. The beads were then washed 4 times in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, boiled in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated on a 7.5–15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Western blots were probed with anti-GST polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mSos1 polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.). 293T cells plated in 100-mm dishes transfected and treated as above were stimulated for 5 min with 50 ng of EGF per ml. Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted at 800 × g, and lysed for 20 min in 1 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined, and 1.5 mg of protein (1-ml final volume) was incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 3 h with 10 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-Erk1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Agarose beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as substrate, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were performed for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and bands were excised from the gel, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Following 48 h of NGF stimulation, PC12 cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After 2 washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/Triton X-100/bovine serum albumin) and incubated with anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS/Triton X-100/bovine serum albumin, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS/Triton X-100/bovine serum albumin and once in PBS alone, coverslips were mounted in ProLong™ anti-fading medium (Molecular Probes) and observed with an epifluorescence-equipped microscope. Immunolabeled PC12 cells were scored and cellular extensions having at least twice the length of the cell body were counted as neurites. As shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 2 b, GST-SHC (see Fig. 1for description of SHC constructs) expressed in 293T cells stimulated with EGF became robustly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and was able to complex with Grb2 (Fig. 2 c) and Sos1 (Fig. 2 d) as early as 1 min following EGF stimulation. A major tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 180 kDa was also found associated with GST-SHC and was identified immunologically as being the EGFR receptor (solid triangle in Fig. 2 b) (data not shown), demonstrating that the construct binds the EGFR upon ligand stimulation. When EGF stimulation was prolonged for 10 and 30 min, the GST-SHC tyrosine phosphorylation level began to decrease. The amount of Grb2 found in the GST-SHC precipitates also decreased (Fig. 2 c), and an even more significant decrease in the amount of Sos1 was observed (Fig. 2 d). GST-SHCY317F (in which Tyr-317 has been substituted by a phenylalanine) was also clearly phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) following EGF stimulation and bound the activated EGF receptor, as shown in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot (Fig. 2 b). As with GST-SHC, Grb2 was found associated with GST-SHCY317F in a growth factor stimulation-dependent manner (Fig. 2 c). The level of Grb2 associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-SHCY317F did not vary for the different time points of EGF stimulation. More importantly, although present in a lower amount than when GST-SHC was expressed, Sos1 was also detected in GST-SHCY317F precipitates (Fig. 2 d), and the level of Sos1 present with GST-SHCY317F was significantly decreased after 10 and 30 min EGF treatment. When GST-SHC protein, in which Tyr-239 and -240 had been changed to phenylalanine residues (GST-SHCY239/240F), was expressed, the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot, depicted in Fig. 2 b, showed that it was only weakly phosphorylated on tyrosine following EGF stimulation and bound to the activated EGFR. Furthermore, Grb2 was also detected in the GST-SHCY239/240F precipitate in lower amounts (Fig. 2 c), and the presence of Sos1 protein was detectable only after long exposures of the immunoblot with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (data not shown). When the triple mutant, SHCY239/240/317F was expressed, neither tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion protein and Grb2 (Fig. 2 c) nor Sos1 association (Fig. 2 d) could be detected. This construct, however, normally associates with the activated EGFR (Fig. 2 b). GST-SH2 and GST-N constructs were also expressed in 293T cells. In contrast to the Shc full-length constructs, GST-SH2 association to the activated EGF receptor was never superior to the background level observed for GST alone. On the other hand, GST-N clearly bound strongly following EGF stimulation. It was also phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 2 b). Beside their ability to form complexes with Grb2·Sos1 and to bind to the activated EGF receptor, the GST-SHC constructs, when expressed in 293T cells, also associated with other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Unidentified 65- and 120-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were complexed with GST-SH2 in a growth factor-independent manner, since both proteins were found in resting cells as well as in EGF-stimulated cells (open triangles in Fig. 2 b). A phosphotyrosine-containing protein co-migrating with p65 was also found associated with all the GST-SHC constructs in a growth factor-independent manner. The 120-kDa phosphotyrosine protein was not bound to the Shc and SHCY317F constructs, but it was found with SHCY239/240F and SHCY239/240/317F in resting cells; it disappeared in EGF-stimulated cells. GST-N was also bound to a 140-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein in resting cells (upper solid diamond in Fig. 2 b). Similarly, a phosphotyrosine-containing protein, co-migrating with the 140-kDa protein, was also found with all full-length Shc constructs that bound in a growth factor-independent manner. A few other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were found specifically associated with the full-length GST-SHC constructs, suggesting that their interaction with Shc takes place on the CH1 domain. This appears to be the case for a 60-kDa protein detectable in GST-SHC and GST-SHCY317F precipitates from resting cells (lower open diamond in Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, upon EGF stimulation, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p60 was dramatically decreased both in GST-SHC and in GST-SHCY317F constructs. However, the level of the phosphotyrosine-containing 60-kDa protein was not altered upon EGF stimulation in GST-SHC precipitates when Tyr-239 and -240 or when Tyr-239, -240, and -317 were substituted by phenylalanine. To determine which domain and tyrosine residue of p52 SHCA was essential for the transduction of MAP kinase activation upon EGF stimulation, 293T cells transiently expressing the Shc constructs (Fig. 1) were stimulated with EGF; MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated, and their kinase activity was assayed on MBP. Three independent transfections and sets of kinase assays were performed; the results are shown in Fig. 3. Overexpression of GST-SHC in EGF-treated 293T cells was without significant enhancing effect compared with GST alone. When the SHC SH2 and N-terminal domains were expressed alone, a negative effect on EGF-induced MAP kinase activation that could reach, depending on the experiment, 50% of the control “fold activation” was observed. On the other hand, the overexpression of the mutated forms of SHC, SHCY317F, and SHCY239/240F, were only able to slightly down-regulate EGF-induced MAP kinase activation in the three different experiments. In each case, overexpression of GST-SHCY239/240/317F did not alter EGF-induced MAP kinase activation. To determine which tyrosine residues and domains of Shc are important for TrkA signaling, PC12 cells transiently expressing the various GST-SHC constructs and stimulated for 48 h with NGF to induce differentiation were examined. The effects of the expression of GST-SHC proteins on NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation were assayed by immunocytochemistry and neurite scoring. As shown in Fig. 4, approximately 50% of the PC12 cells expressing GST alone and treated with NGF for 48 h grew neurites (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 a). This value was significantly increased to 80% when PC12 cells expressed the full-length and wild type GST-SHCA (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 b). In contrast GST-N, which lacks the CH1 and SH2 domains, allowed only 20% of the cells that expressed the construct to respond to NGF (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 c). GST-SH2 expression was apparently without effect on the number of PC12 cells responsive to NGF in comparison to GST alone; however, a negative effect on neurite branching in cells expressing SH2 domain alone was noticeable (Fig. 5 d). GST-SHCY317F expressed in PC12 cells had a significant enhancing effect (70%) on PC12 cell differentiation, and branched neurites were well developed (Fig. 5 e). On the other hand, GST-SHCY239/240F expression had no apparent enhancing effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Transient expression of GST-SHCY239/240/317F in NGF-treated PC12 cells had a significant negative effect allowing only 12% of the cells to grow neurites (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 f).Figure 5Immunofluorescent labeling of PC12 cells transiently expressing GST alone (a), GST-SHC (b), GST-N (c), GST-SH2 (d), GST-SHCY317F (e), GST-SHCY239/240F (f), and GST-SHCY239/240/317F (g). Bar indicates 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overexpression of Shc has been shown to induce neoplastic transformation in fibroblasts and cause differentiation on PC12 cells, and these two phenomena depend on the coupling of Grb2 to Shc Tyr-317 and Ras activation, respectively (18Rozakis A.M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T.

Early studies on Shc have also indicated that Tyr-317 was the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation responsible for Grb2 association (18Rozakis A.M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 19Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar). From the data presented herein, it is clear that Shc can also undergo growth factor-induced phosphorylation on other tyrosine residues. Indeed, mutation of this residue (Tyr-317) still allows Shc to retain its capability to be phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue(s) and to form a complex with Grb2 in 293T cells following EGF stimulation, and comparable substitutions demonstrate that Tyr-239/240 can be phosphorylated in vivo and can act as a Grb2 binding site. Although SHCY239/240/317F contains additional tyrosine residues in conserved positions in other Shc isoforms, especially in the N-terminal portion (29O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C.J. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), no residual tyrosine phosphorylation or associated Grb2 was detected in the triple mutant following EGF stimulation. This observation suggests that Tyr-239/240 and Tyr-317 likely account for all SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and Grb2 binding sites in vivo. However, it is interesting to note that the truncated SHC construct GST-N (see Fig. 1) undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. This is likely an artifact arising from the elimination of steric constraints and enables tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate tyrosine residue(s) otherwise unavailable, probably in the most C-terminal part of GST-N. Importantly, tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-N does not form a complex with Grb2, which supports the view that this N-terminal phosphorylation is not physiologically important. Grb2 SH2 domain interactions have been shown to be specified by asparagine in the position +2 to the phosphorylated tyrosine (37Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tyr-239 appears to be an good candidate for an alternate specific Grb2 SH2 domain binding site, since it occurs in a Tyr(P)-Xaa-Asn-Xaa sequence, a context similar to Tyr-317. As a consequence, phosphorylation on Tyr-240 is less likely to be involved in Grb2 SH2 recognition. A more detailed point-mutation analysis will be required to determine whether Tyr-240 can be phosphorylated. If so, it would probably be in a sequence recognized by SH2 domain-containing molecules other than Grb2. It is possible, of course, that a steric competition could occur between Grb2 and one or another SH2 domain-containing molecules, which remain to be identified. Recently, two other studies have reported similar results concerning the identification of Tyr-239/240 as a major phosphorylation site on Shc (38Gotoh N. Tojo A. Shibuya M.

Among the non-cognate interactions Im2 shows the strongest binding toward the E9 DNase domain with aKd of 10−8m, 6 orders of magnitude weaker than that of the cognate immunity protein Im9. Based on a NMR structure of Im9 that shows it to be a 4-helix protein, we have conducted a mutagenic scan in which elements of Im9 secondary structure were substituted into Im2 to precisely delineate regions that define specificity. Eleven chimeras were constructed, and their biological cross-reactivity toward colicins E2 and E9 was evaluated. From this set of mutants seven proteins were purified, and theKd for their interaction with the E9 DNase domain was measured by a combination of stopped-flow fluorescence and subunit exchange kinetics. Our results show that immunity specificity is dominated by residues on helix II, accounting for 5 orders of magnitude binding specificity relative to Im2, and that packing interactions of helix II with its neighbor helix I and the loop connecting helix III with helix IV play minor roles. The conformational stability of these chimeric proteins was also determined. Proteins displaying an Im9 phenotype were all more stable than the parent Im2 protein, and surprisingly some chimeras were significantly more stable than either Im2 or Im9.

Understanding specificity in protein-protein recognition is fundamental to our knowledge of complex biological processes such as transcription, signal transduction, and immune recognition, yet little is known about how specificity is determined in protein-protein interactions. In this paper we describe the use of homologue-scanning mutagenesis to determine the main structural elements that define the specificity of the immunity protein Im9 in its interaction with the DNase derived from the bacterial toxin colicin E9 (ColE9). 1The abbreviations used are: ColE9, colicin E9; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; E9 DNase, the isolated 15-kDa endonuclease domain of ColE9; Im2, immunity protein specific for ColE2; Im9, immunity protein specific for ColE9; Im2-(x–y)Im9, mutant construct in which Im9 sequences from x to y have been inserted into Im2; k1, association rate constant; koff, the overall dissociation rate constant; Kd, equilibrium dissociation constant; [GdnHCl]50%, concentration of guanidine hydrochloride required to induce 50% protein denaturation.1The abbreviations used are: ColE9, colicin E9; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; E9 DNase, the isolated 15-kDa endonuclease domain of ColE9; Im2, immunity protein specific for ColE2; Im9, immunity protein specific for ColE9; Im2-(x–y)Im9, mutant construct in which Im9 sequences from x to y have been inserted into Im2; k1, association rate constant; koff, the overall dissociation rate constant; Kd, equilibrium dissociation constant; [GdnHCl]50%, concentration of guanidine hydrochloride required to induce 50% protein denaturation.Colicins are plasmid-borne toxins produced by theEnterobacteriacae that have lethal action against other related strains and are classified into groups on the basis of the cell surface receptor to which they bind (reviewed by James et al. (1James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)). The focus of our work has been the E group colicins, which bind to the product of the chromosomal btuB gene, an essential component of the high-affinity transport system for vitamin B12 in Escherichia coli (2Di Masi D.R. White D.C. Schnaitman C.A. Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following receptor binding, the toxin translocates into the cell and initiates cell death. Each E colicin plasmid codes for the production of a ∼61-kDa colicin toxin, a 9.5-kDa inhibitor (immunity) protein that protects the producing cell against the cytotoxic activity of the toxin, and a small lipoprotein (the lysis protein) that releases the resulting 71-kDa heterodimeric colicin complex from the bacterium.Colicin-producing cells are naturally resistant to the action of their own toxin but sensitive to the action of other bacteriocins from the same family. This forms the basis for the so-called immunity test by which cells producing different colicins can be identified. Using this biological test the E group has been subdivided into 9 types (ColE1–ColE9), and these fall into three cytotoxic classes (3Cooper P.C. James R. J. Gen.

The four colicins are almost identical in sequence in the N-terminal regions of the protein that are involved in translocation and receptor binding, but share only ∼80% sequence identity in the C-terminal DNase domains. Hence, the specific immunity proteins Im2, Im7, Im8, and Im9 have evolved to counteract the toxicity of each DNase colicin, and these share ∼50% sequence identity (9Lau C.K. Parsons M. Uchimura T. James R. Lazdunski C. Pattus F. Bacteriocins, Microcins and Lantibiotics. 1992: 353-378Crossref Google Scholar). Im9 binds to either ColE9 or the isolated 15-kDa E9 DNase domain with a dissociation constant of 10−16m in the absence of salt (pH 7.0 and 25 °C) rising to 10−14m in 200 mm salt (14Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Association between the two proteins is diffusion controlled, wherein the proteins are electrostatically steered toward one another to produce an encounter complex, which then undergoes a conformational change to produce the final stable complex (14Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The other immunity proteins of this family can also bind the E9 DNase, but with much weaker affinities; the equilibrium Kd values for these complexes are 10−4m for Im7, 10−6m for Im8, and 10−8m for Im2. In each case, binding results in inhibition of enzymatic activity, and the binding affinity is governed by the rate of complex dissociation (15Wallis R. Leung K.-Y. Pommer A.J. Videler H. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13751-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Our knowledge of the regions of an immunity protein that determine its specificity is limited to the results of homologous recombination experiments between Im9 and Im8 (16Wallis R.

This early work focused on the biological activity of chimeric immunity proteins and showed that the primary determinants for specificity were located in the N-terminal half of the protein. Moreover, substituting Val-34 in Im9 with aspartic acid, the amino acid at this position in Im8 provided the resulting mutant Im9 with some ColE8 cross-reactivity in in vivoassays. Subsequent structural work has shown that Im9 is a 4-helix protein in which position 34 is part of helix II (17Osborne M.J. Lian L.-Y. Wallis R. Reilly A. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R.

In large part their model is based on the observation that these are the most variable sequences in the immunity protein family (Fig. 2). However, this is at variance with recent isotope-edited NMR experiments in which the amide resonances of 15N-labeled Im9 bound to unlabeled E9 DNase (forming a 25-kDa complex) were assigned. These data show that the major regions of perturbation on binding the DNase are helices II and III, the latter being conserved in the immunity protein family (20Osborne M.J. Wallis R. Leung K.-Y.

With Im2 as our template, we have substituted structural elements from Im9 into Im2 and characterized the resulting chimeras using both in vivobiological toxicity tests and in vitro binding assays. We find that specificity in this system is multifactorial but dominated by residues from a single helix.DISCUSSIONThe specificity of E group colicin immunity proteins for their target endonuclease toxins has yet to be explained, and so we chose to use homologue-scanning mutagenesis combined with biological andin vitro binding assays to determine the regions of the protein that govern its specificity. Homologue scanning was first used by Wells and co-workers (24Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to identify the regions of human growth hormone that are required for specific binding to its receptor. Since then it has been used in a number of systems to localize functionally important regions in families of homologous proteins (25Bettler B. Texido G. Raggini S. Ruegg D. Hofstetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lee C.W. Luck M.D. Juppner H. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basic premise of the technique is the substitution of sections of sequence from one protein with analogous sections from a related protein and then testing the resulting chimeras by a functional assay that discriminates between the two wild type starting proteins. Clearly for the strategy to succeed the two proteins must be sufficiently similar in three-dimensional structure to allow accommodation of the novel sequences and so yield chimeras that are stable and can be purified and characterized.In the present work, we have used this technique to localize the elements of secondary structures of the immunity proteins Im2 and Im9, which define their colicin specificity. The solution structure for Im9 has been determined by NMR (18Osborne M.J. Breexe A.L. Lian L.-Y. Reilly A. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9505-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and this structure was used as the basis for the scan (Fig. 1). Im2 and Im9 are identical in length (86 amino acids) and share 68.6% sequence identity (Fig. 2) and so it is likely that the structure of Im2 will be similar to that of Im9. Indeed, the structures for the other endonuclease specific immunity proteins Im7 and Im8, which show even less sequence identity to Im9 than Im2, have very similar 4-helix structures (19Chak K.-F. Safo M.K. Ku W.-Y Hsieh S.-Y. Yuan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6437-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 2H. Videler, unpublished observations. A further point, which suggests that the Im2 and Im9 structures will be comparable, stems from the results of this work since a total of eleven chimeras were generated, and in each case a stable protein was made suggesting that there was no gross distortion of the protein fold.Helix II, Loop 2, and Packing InteractionsOur data show that of the four helices in an immunity protein, helix II is the major determinant of colicin specificity that in the context of the binding of Im2 relative to Im9 contributes over 6 kcal/mol E9 DNase binding energy from a total of 8 kcal/mol. However, other sequences have to be added for full E9 DNase binding (Table I). The most important of these appears to be the C-terminal end of helix I (compare the binding energy data for Im2-(25–44)Im9 with Im2-(19–44)Im9). Interestingly, these sequences in isolation (in the form of the Im2-(1–29)Im9 construct) do not affect E9 DNase binding. In other words, the effect of helix I is not additive to that of helix II but is felt only in the presence of helix II. We conclude from these observations that it is the buried residues of helix I that elicit this effect, probably by changing the orientation of helix II. Since helix I and II pack against each other in the Im9 structure, and since both helices are largely variable in sequence between immunity proteins, it seems reasonable that packing interactions between them may play a role in specificity. Tight binding protein complexes are characterized by highly complementary and well packed binding interfaces (27Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so it is quite conceivable that such intramolecular packing interactions could affect intermolecular specificity. It is also noteworthy that packing interactions between these two helices affect the stability of the protein; adding residues 19–30 from Im9 to the Im2-(30–44)Im9 mutant increases [GdnHCl]50%by >0.2 m (Table I).Although neither of the variable loops play important roles in specificity, the results for chimeras containing loop 2 do show some relatively minor effects that require comment. Coincident with the loss of residual ColE2 cross-reactivity of Im9-like chimeras, the inclusion of loop 2 from Im9 also seems to reduce E9 DNase binding in these proteins (Table I). This affect can be seen in two cases. First, it is seen in chimeras that seem to bind slightly more tightly to the E9 DNase than Im9 itself (Im2-(19–44)Im9 and Im2-(1–44)Im9). This affinity is reduced to wild type Im9 levels when loop 2 from Im9 is added (Im2-(1–64)Im9). Second, this region also reduces the binding of the mutant protein that contains helix II alone (compare Im2-(30–44)Im9 with Im2-(30–64)Im9). Taken together these results suggest a rather paradoxical situation in which loop 2 in Im2 imparts some specificity for its cognate E2 DNase (hence the residual biological cross-reactivity) as well as providing some binding energy for the non-cognate E9 DNase. Substituting this loop in Im2 with that from Im9 removes both effects. Loop 2 also seems to affect the thermodynamic stability of the immunity proteins since the [GdnHCl]50%of chimeras containing this loop is increased by 0.2–0.3 m(see “Results” and Table I).The observations on specificity concerning loop 2 could be the result of direct effects where loop 2 is involved in DNase binding or indirect effects where loop 2 alters the conformation of binding residues. Two pieces of evidence suggest that the latter is the most likely. First, few amide resonances from this loop in Im9 are perturbed on binding the E9 DNase in 15N edited NMR experiments (20Osborne M.J. Wallis R. Leung K.-Y. William G. Lian L.-Y. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Second, the solution structure of Im8 shows that the conformation of Tyr-55, a conserved residue in helix III, is markedly different from that of Im9, and the reason for this seems to be the nature of the adjoining residues in loop 2.2 The importance of this observation stems from the fact that recent mutagenesis data have shown this residue to be critical for DNase binding. 3R. Wallis and K.-Y. Leung, unpublished observations.In conclusion, the specificity of an immunity protein for an E colicin DNase domain is complex. Although dominated by residues from a single helix, interactions with other parts of the immunity protein scaffold also play an indirect role. Protein-protein interactions are characterized by relatively large surface areas of each binding partner (typically >600 Å2) becoming buried in the complex (27Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar), and given the very tight binding for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex this is likely to be true for a colicin complex. Since it is clear that other parts of Im9 are also involved in binding the DNase (20Osborne M.J. Wallis R. Leung K.-Y. William G. Lian L.-Y. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is interesting that specificity can be controlled almost exclusively by residues from a single helix, a situation reminiscent of some DNA-protein interactions (29Luisi B. Lilley D.M.J. DNA-Protein: Structural Interactions. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, UK1995: 1-48Google Scholar). Understanding specificity in protein-protein recognition is fundamental to our knowledge of complex biological processes such as transcription, signal transduction, and immune recognition, yet little is known about how specificity is determined in protein-protein interactions. In this paper we describe the use of homologue-scanning mutagenesis to determine the main structural elements that define the specificity of the immunity protein Im9 in its interaction with the DNase derived from the bacterial toxin colicin E9 (ColE9). 1The abbreviations used are: ColE9, colicin E9; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; E9 DNase, the isolated 15-kDa endonuclease domain of ColE9; Im2, immunity protein specific for ColE2; Im9, immunity protein specific for ColE9; Im2-(x–y)Im9, mutant construct in which Im9 sequences from x to y have been inserted into Im2; k1, association rate constant; koff, the overall dissociation rate constant; Kd, equilibrium dissociation constant; [GdnHCl]50%, concentration of guanidine hydrochloride required to induce 50% protein denaturation.1The abbreviations used are: ColE9, colicin E9; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; E9 DNase, the isolated 15-kDa endonuclease domain of ColE9; Im2, immunity protein specific for ColE2; Im9, immunity protein specific for ColE9; Im2-(x–y)Im9, mutant construct in which Im9 sequences from x to y have been inserted into Im2; k1, association rate constant; koff, the overall dissociation rate constant; Kd, equilibrium dissociation constant; [GdnHCl]50%, concentration of guanidine hydrochloride required to induce 50% protein denaturation. Colicins are plasmid-borne toxins produced by theEnterobacteriacae that have lethal action against other related strains and are classified into groups on the basis of the cell surface receptor to which they bind (reviewed by James et al. (1James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)). The focus of our work has been the E group colicins, which bind to the product of the chromosomal btuB gene, an essential component of the high-affinity transport system for vitamin B12 in Escherichia coli (2Di Masi D.R. White D.C. Schnaitman C.A. Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following receptor binding, the toxin translocates into the cell and initiates cell death. Each E colicin plasmid codes for the production of a ∼61-kDa colicin toxin, a 9.5-kDa inhibitor (immunity) protein that protects the producing cell against the cytotoxic activity of the toxin, and a small lipoprotein (the lysis protein) that releases the resulting 71-kDa heterodimeric colicin complex from the bacterium. Colicin-producing cells are naturally resistant to the action of their own toxin but sensitive to the action of other bacteriocins from the same family. This forms the basis for the so-called immunity test by which cells producing different colicins can be identified. Using this biological test the E group has been subdivided into 9 types (ColE1–ColE9), and these fall into three cytotoxic classes (3Cooper P.C. James R. J. Gen.

We have been studying the DNase colicins and their interaction with immunity proteins as a model system for investigating specificity in protein-protein recognition. The four colicins are almost identical in sequence in the N-terminal regions of the protein that are involved in translocation and receptor binding, but share only ∼80% sequence identity in the C-terminal DNase domains. Hence, the specific immunity proteins Im2, Im7, Im8, and Im9 have evolved to counteract the toxicity of each DNase colicin, and these share ∼50% sequence identity (9Lau C.K. Parsons M. Uchimura T. James R. Lazdunski C. Pattus F. Bacteriocins, Microcins and Lantibiotics. 1992: 353-378Crossref Google Scholar). Im9 binds to either ColE9 or the isolated 15-kDa E9 DNase domain with a dissociation constant of 10−16m in the absence of salt (pH 7.0 and 25 °C) rising to 10−14m in 200 mm salt (14Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Association between the two proteins is diffusion controlled, wherein the proteins are electrostatically steered toward one another to produce an encounter complex, which then undergoes a conformational change to produce the final stable complex (14Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The other immunity proteins of this family can also bind the E9 DNase, but with much weaker affinities; the equilibrium Kd values for these complexes are 10−4m for Im7, 10−6m for Im8, and 10−8m for Im2. In each case, binding results in inhibition of enzymatic activity, and the binding affinity is governed by the rate of complex dissociation (15Wallis R. Leung K.-Y. Pommer A.J. Videler H. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13751-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of the regions of an immunity protein that determine its specificity is limited to the results of homologous recombination experiments between Im9 and Im8 (16Wallis R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This early work focused on the biological activity of chimeric immunity proteins and showed that the primary determinants for specificity were located in the N-terminal half of the protein. Moreover, substituting Val-34 in Im9 with aspartic acid, the amino acid at this position in Im8 provided the resulting mutant Im9 with some ColE8 cross-reactivity in in vivoassays. Subsequent structural work has shown that Im9 is a 4-helix protein in which position 34 is part of helix II (17Osborne M.J. Lian L.-Y. Wallis R. Reilly A. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R.

A. 1996; 93: 6437-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have recently proposed, based on the crystal structure of the Im7 protein, that helices I and II are both involved in determining specificity as well as loop 2 and possibly loop 1 (Fig. 1). In large part their model is based on the observation that these are the most variable sequences in the immunity protein family (Fig. 2). However, this is at variance with recent isotope-edited NMR experiments in which the amide resonances of 15N-labeled Im9 bound to unlabeled E9 DNase (forming a 25-kDa complex) were assigned. These data show that the major regions of perturbation on binding the DNase are helices II and III, the latter being conserved in the immunity protein family (20Osborne M.J. Wallis R. Leung K.-Y. William G. Lian L.-Y. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present work set out to use homologue-scanning mutagenesis to identify unambiguously the elements of immunity protein secondary structure that determine colicin specificity. With Im2 as our template, we have substituted structural elements from Im9 into Im2 and characterized the resulting chimeras using both in vivobiological toxicity tests"

Previous work demonstrated that Sxl monomers interact cooperatively upon binding to target RNAs and that the cooperativity depends on the glycine-rich N terminus. Here we use band shift experiments to show that RNA binding patterns are altered when Sxl is combined with other proteins having similar glycine-rich domains, including mammalian heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNP L and Drosophila Hrb87F (an hnRNP A/B homolog). Direct involvement of the Sxl glycine-rich region in protein interactions was verified by Far-Western analysis. Two interaction domains, the Sxl N terminus and the Sxl first RNA binding domain, were suggested by the yeast two-hybrid assay. In a systematic examination of the RNA binding properties of Sxl domains, it was found that the Sxl termini as well as the RBDs influence RNA binding specificity. Finally, selection of the Sxl optimal binding site (SELEX) confirms the importance of U-runs in the Sxl binding site and suggests a second type of non-U-run target that may be associated with RNA secondary structure.

How specific and general splicing factors find their target pre-mRNA sequences and determine the correct splicing pattern remains a major question in understanding alternative splicing. One emerging picture is that individual factors, identified by either biochemical or genetic methods, work in larger complexes by interacting with other factors. Understanding how the splicing factors function in these systems relies on studying their interactions with target RNAs and with other splicing proteins. Various structural studies on a number of known RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors have identified several functional domains responsible for RNA or protein interactions. One highly conserved domain (RBD, 1The abbreviations used are: RBD, RNA binding domain; Sxl, sex-lethal; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; aa, amino acids; bp, base pairs; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hn, hetorogeneous nuclear; sn, small nuclear. RRM, or RNP-CS) has been intensively studied as an independent functional motif for specific RNA binding (1Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 2Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Zuo P. Manley J.L.

Another conserved domain, the RS domain, has also been intensively studied as a mediator of multiple interactions with other splicing proteins (5Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.G. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 6Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the overall protein structure in RNA binding and protein interactions has been relatively neglected. Also, potential interaction or effector domains besides the well known RS domain have not been clarified. We have been using the sex determination pathway inDrosophila to study splicing regulation by specific factors. In this system, we are provided with a well defined hierarchy of genes regulated by alternative splicing. The Sex-lethal (Sxl) protein is a sex-specific RNA-binding protein that regulates the alternative splicing of a number of pre-mRNAs of downstream genes, as well as its own pre-mRNA (7Bell L.R. Maine E.M. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Bell L.R. Horabin J.I. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 229-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Sxl interacts directly with multiplecis-elements on its target pre-mRNAs (9Inoue K. Hoshijima K. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Nature. 1990; 344: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Valcárcel J. Singh R. Zamore P.D. Green M.R.

Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have previously studied how Sxl binds to Sxl pre-mRNA and found that Sxl monomers cooperate through their N termini when binding to pre-mRNA regions containing two adjacent binding sites, each consisting of a short U-run (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because Sxl binds RNA at some distance from the Sxl splice sites it regulates, we postulated that in addition to the interactions between Sxl molecules, Sxl might also interact with other specific or general splicing factors (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This seems especially likely during autoregulation, which involves a number of additional components identified by genetic studies (14Flickinger T.W. Salz H.K.

The Sxl N terminus, which we had demonstrated to be required for cooperative RNA binding (12Wang J. Bell L.R.

Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glycine-rich regions in all these proteins might function as common protein interaction domains. In this report, we show that the glycine-rich Sxl N terminus influences interactions with hnRNP proteins containing RNA binding and glycine-rich domains. When we systematically analyzed the putative domains of Sxl for direct interaction in other assays, we confirmed the importance of the N terminus. Moreover, the first RBD may be sufficient to mediate interactions in vivo. We also show that the N and C termini, lying outside the RBDs, play a role in targeting Sxl to different RNAs. Finally, selection of the Sxl optimal binding site (SELEX) confirms the importance of U-runs in Sxl binding and suggests a second type of non-U-run target. Production of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins from bacteria, 32P-labeled RNAs by in vitro transcription, and conditions for in vitro RNA binding using band shift or filter binding methods were described in detail previously (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As described by Wang and Bell (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for Sxl and variant proteins, binding conditions were performed using a high protein/RNA ratio, and protein concentrations were on the order of 1 μm. UV cross-linking was performed by exposing an RNA binding assay in a microtiter plate to UV light in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) for 15 min. The plate was kept on ice during the exposure. The plasmids for making GSTL, GSTPTB/hnRNP I, and GSTU2AF65 were gifts from the laboratories of G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania), M. Garcia-Blanco (Duke University Medical Center), and M. Green (University of Massachusetts Medical Center), respectively. Additional GST fusion plasmids were created by cloning BamHI-EcoRI fragments into pGEX-2T as follows. The cDNA clone of Hrb87F (a gift from S. Haynes) (National Institutes of Health) was PCR- amplified with primers that added BamHI immediately upstream of the ATG(CGGGATCCATG) and an EcoRI site downstream of the open reading frame. The snf cDNA, pBC-D25 (provided by J. Romac and J. Keene, Duke University Medical Center), was transferred into pGEX-2T using the flanking BamHI and EcoRI sites in the original PET3a vector (31Harper D.S. Fresco L.D. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3645-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cDNA of thesnf 1621 mutant was isolated fromsnf 1621 homozygous flies by reverse transcriptase-PCR that placed a BamHI site immediately upstream of the ATG and an EcoRI site after the open reading frame. To make the GSTSxl/snf construct, snf cDNA was reamplified by PCR with primers 5′ATCTCATGATGGAGATGCTACCCAAC3′ (upstream) and 5′GGACAGCGGCTGCTTCTTGGCGAACGTTAT3′ (downstream) to addBspMII and AlwNI sites then ligated into the same sites of GST-2T-SxlcF1 (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to replace the two Sxl RBDs with those of snf. The Sxl early cDNA fusion was created by PCR amplification that added a BamHI site immediately before the ATG and continued to a unique BspMII site. The PCR product was used to replace the BamHI to BspMII region of the plasmid pGEX-2T-SxlcF1. For the shorter version of the alternativeSxl exon 5 splicing, the BspMII toSfiI region of Sxl cDNA MS11 (32Samuels M.E. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3584-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used to replace the equivalent region of Sxl cDNA cF1 (7Bell L.R. Maine E.M. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The SxlcF1 deletion recombinant mutants used unique sitesBspMII, BspHI, AflII, andAlwNI. SxlNI deletes 38 amino acids. The N terminus is 117 amino acids, RBD-1 is 80 aa, RBD-2 is 86 aa, and the C terminus is 71 aa. The 3′ end of all the C-terminal deletion cDNAs has a 14 bpXbaI linker, CTAGTCTAGACTAG (all linkers from New England Biolabs), that contains a TAG stop codon in all three reading frames. To maintain the correct reading frame of mutants N1, N3, and B2, an 8 bp XhoI linker, CCTCGAGG, was inserted between the blunt-ended BamHI site and the appropriate site on SxlcF1. A 10-bp XhoI linker, CCCTCGAAAA, was similarly used for making N4. All constructs without a linker were made by ligation of the blunt-ended sites. Klenow was used to blunt-end all sites except forAlwN1, whose overhanging 5′ end was digested with T4 DNA polymerase. The Drosophila U1 snRNA cDNA clone was a gift from Dr. S. Mount (University of Maryland). It was PCR-amplified with primers 5′GGAATTCATACTTACCTGGCGTAGAG3′ upstream with an EcoRI site, and 5′GGGTACCTCGGGACGGCGCGAACGCC3′ downstream with a KpnI site. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM4 vector to be transcribed from the SP6 promoter. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Sxl protein to be used as probe was expressed as a GST fusion from vector GEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein was labeled as follows. Ten μl of fusion protein at about 1 mg/ml was added to 5 μl of 10 × HMK buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 120 mmMgCl2), 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP and 50 units HMK (Sigma). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To the reaction, 20 μl of glutathione beads (1:1 in MTPBS (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3)) was added and rotated for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were washed with 100 μl of MTPBS three times, and the bound proteins were then released with 30 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 5 mm reduced glutathione three times. All the fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C. To make in vitro translated Sxl probe for Far-Western, the cDNA portion of pGEX-2TK-SxlcF1 from BamHI toEcoRI was blunt-ended and ligated to EcoRV of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). [35S]Met-labeled Sxl protein was produced in the TNT reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer protocol. The 38-kDa Sxl band was present after translation and absent from the control of pcDNA alone (data not shown). For Far-Western blotting, various proteins separated by 12% SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose. Incubation and washing followed the procedures of Kaelin et al. (33Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslated protein at 105 to 106 cpm/ml was added. To check for similar protein levels, the filter was also incubated with anti-GST antibody recognizing all the fusion proteins (Pharmacia). After exposure to x-ray film to visualize the labeled Sxl binding, a Western blot was developed (data not shown). The yeast two-hybrid system of Gyuris et al. (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was used. The “bait” vector containing the LexA DNA binding domain and “prey” vector containing an activation domain were modified as follows. For the bait, theEcoRI-SalI polylinker region of pEG202 was replaced by a double-stranded linker created from two oligonucleotides, containing BamHI, XbaI, and EcoRI sites, with 4-base single-stranded ends noted by parentheses: 5′(AATT)AGGATCCTCTAGAGAATTCG(AGCT)3′. For the prey, the pJG4–5BamHI site was destroyed by end-filling and ligation, then the EcoRI-XhoI region of the polylinker was replaced by a linker, containing BamHI, BglII, and EcoRI sites, with 4-base single-stranded ends: 5′(AATT)AGGATCCGAGATCTCCCGAATTCC(AGCT)3′. The cDNA clones ofSxl and Sxl deletions were removed from the GSTSxl clones as BamHI-EcoRI fragments and ligated in frame to the modified bait and prey vectors. Yeast strain EGY48 (ura3 his3 trp1 3LexA binding sites-LEU2) and yeast LexA binding sites-lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18–34 were used. Interacting bait and prey will activate the LexA binding site-LEU2reporter to give a Leu+ phenotype and will also activate the LexA binding site-lacZ reporter. TheLEU2 assay is more sensitive than the lacZ assay due to the nature of the LexA binding sites present in each. Liquid cultures were grown in selective media in the presence of galactose. Yeast β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (35Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). One unit equals 1000 ×A420/A600 of assayed culture × volume assayed (ml) × time (min). The 79- base template oligonucleotide includes PCR priming regions, the T7 RNA polymerase recognition site, and random sequences for selection of 26 bp: ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCGCTTAACCCATGGTTN26GCCTAGGTGATCAAGATC. The degeneracy of a totally randomized 26 base sequence would be 4.5 × 1015, which would be equivalent to roughly 0.2 mg of RNA. Primers matching the two flanking regions, 35 and 18 bases, respectively, were used for PCR amplification. Gel purified 79-mer (∼0.4 mg) and 35-mer (∼0.18 mg) were annealed and used as the templates for in vitro transcription. Five mg of RNA was synthesized, producing roughly 10 copies of RNA molecules/template, then phenol extracted, precipitated, and redissolved in binding buffer (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This was then passed through a 1-ml column composed of agarose beads coupled with reduced glutathione (Sigma) saturated with GSTSxl protein. The RNAs were allowed to bind for 10 min at room temperature with mild orbital shaking. The column was then washed two times with 1.5 ml of binding buffer, followed by four times with 1.5 ml of wash buffer (binding buffer without the tRNA). The sample was eluted with MTPBS plus 0.1 m NaCl, collected as 10, 0.5-ml fractions, and then with MTPBS plus 1 m NaCl, also as 10 0.5-ml fractions. One-third of each RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified by 20 cycles of 94, 58, and 72 °C for 45 s. Only fractions 4, 5, and 6 of 1 m NaCl had large amounts of PCR products, so they were pooled as templates for the next round of selection. Approximately 5 mg of RNA was used for binding during each of three rounds of column selection. We then switched the selection to the bandshift assay, using previously described conditions (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Sxl protein used for selection was also switched from GST fusion to non-fusion. The area of shifted RNAs was cut out, electroeluted, and PCR-amplified as before. After two rounds of selection, the final PCR products were digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned into pGEM4 (Promega) for sequencing and in vitrotranscription. The RNA made after cutting the cloned fragments atHindIII has flanking sequences different from that of the PCR products to avoid possible effects on Sxl binding. Previous work using band shift analyses demonstrated several properties of Sxl binding (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). First, Sxl binds a U-run site; second, Sxl binds cooperatively to RNA containing two adjacent U-run sites but is monomeric in solution; third, when 38 amino acids of the glycine-rich N terminus is removed, cooperativity is lost although binding affinity to a single U-run site is unchanged. To test the hypothesis that the glycine-rich region may be a general protein interaction domain, we examined interactions between Sxl and human hnRNP L, which contains a glycine-rich region very similar to Sxl. We performed band-shift assays with Sxl and GST L fusion protein using RNAs identical to those used previously (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These include RNA S7B, a 52 nucleotide region of the Sxl pre-mRNA containing the sequence U9AU8 and modifications in which the U-runs have been systematically disrupted to (UC)-runs. Consistent with previous results, the RNAs containing zero, one, or two U-runs are bound by Sxl either not at all, as a monomer, or as a dimer, respectively (Fig. 1 A,lanes 1, 4, and 7; Ref. 12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein L (in the form of a GST-L fusion) could bind, probably as a dimer judging by its slow mobility, to all three of these RNAs (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3, 6, and 9). When Sxl and L were both added to the two-U-run RNA, a strong, broad band was observed, intermediate in size, between the Sxl and L bands (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). The predominance of the intermediate complex suggests that the binding of Sxl and L influence one another, possibly by a protein interaction of the same type previously observed between Sxl and GSTSxl, which together produced a similar intermediate band (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like the observation on two-U-run RNA, with Sxl and L together on one-U-run RNA, an intermediate band was again observed, but it was of lower mass due to a single Sxl binding site (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 5 and 8). Strikingly, even when there was no U-run on the RNA, and so no Sxl binding site, a weak but distinct intermediate band was still observed (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The presence of an intermediate band in the absence of a Sxl binding site suggests two possibilities. A Sxl-L protein interaction might occur without any binding of Sxl to RNA; alternatively, an interaction with L may allow Sxl to bind RNA that lacks the normal U-run site of Sxl. To show that the interaction between Sxl and L is due to the Sxl N terminus, we performed the same binding assay with SxlN1 (lacking the first 38 N-terminal amino acids) and SxlN2 (lacking the entire N terminus of 116 amino acids). It has been shown previously that SxlN1 no longer demonstrates cooperativity when binding RNA; thus, at an appropriate protein concentration, SxlN1 forms two discrete bands on two-U-run RNA in which one or two binding sites are filled (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, each N-terminal deletion protein forms two bands on the two-U-run RNA although the bands are not well separated on this particular gel (Fig. 1 A, lanes 10 and 13). On the same two-U-run RNA, protein L produced less of the intermediate band with SxlN1 than with Sxl (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 8 and11). Most clearly, with SxlN2, there was no intermediate band, and instead, there were discrete L and SxlN2 bands (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 8 and 14). The loss of the intermediate band, especially with SxlN2, strongly suggests that the Sxl N terminus is important for the Sxl-L interaction, just as previously demonstrated for the Sxl-Sxl interactions (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed several times at various protein concentrations (data not shown). In a reciprocal experiment, portions of protein L were removed to create a C-terminal deletion (GST LΔC) lacking 267 amino acids, and an N-terminal deletion (GST LΔN) lacking 36 amino acids of the glycine-rich domain. The C-terminal deletion LΔC binds RNA less well than the entire protein but forms a strong intermediate band with Sxl (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, LΔC behaves similarly to the entire L protein. In contrast, LΔN forms a band with an unexpectedly fast migration rate (Fig. 1 B,lane 8). Although LΔN contains a deletion of only 27 amino acids, it migrates much faster than the entire L protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) and even migrates faster than the much smaller protein LΔC, which lacks 267 amino acids (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). This faster migration rate suggests that the N-terminal deletion protein may bind as a monomer (or small multimer) while the normal protein binds as a dimer (or larger multimer). This might be analogous to the loss of cooperativity in RNA binding that was previously observed for SxlN1 (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sxl appears to enhance the binding of LΔN; however, unlike the other situations examined, two complexes are observed that might be Sxl-Sxl and Sxl-LΔN (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). One interpretation is that LΔN protein no longer interacts with itself, but still has enough of the glycine-rich region left for interaction with Sxl. Finally, replacement of the missing glycine-rich sequences in LΔN with the N-terminal 21 amino acids of Sxl (GST L/S) leads to restoration of the intermediate complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 9). In summary, Sxl and hnRNP L show different patterns of RNA binding when they are in combination compared with when each is separate, suggesting the likelihood of a protein interaction. Deletions analysis suggests that this interaction is likely to be mediated by the glycine-rich domains of the two proteins. There are two natural variants of the Sxl N terminus. The N-terminal 26 amino acids of Sxl (isoform cF1, called Sxl herein (7Bell L.R. Maine E.M. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar)), which is the product of the late Sxl transcripts, are replaced by a different sequence of 24 amino acids in the early Sxl protein (SxlcE1, from cDNA clone cE1 (36Keyes L.N. Cline T.W. Schedl P. Cell. 1992; 68: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)). In addition, alternative splicing of the late transcripts generates another isoform, SxlcF1S, in which the N terminus is missing eight amino acids just after the SxlN1 deletion (32Samuels M.E. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3584-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Given that SxlcE1 is known to have functions similar to Sxl (36Keyes L.N. Cline T.W. Schedl P. Cell. 1992; 68: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we predicted that all isoforms would interact with Sxl. As shown in Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4, that appears to be the case. Intermediate bands are evident between Sxl and GSTSxlcE1 or GSTSxlcF1S. Since two-U-run RNA was used as the substrate, both proteins are assumed to interact as they bind RNA. These interactions are virtually identical to those between Sxl and GSTSxl, which we studied in detail previously (12Wang J. Bell L.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2072-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it appears that GSTSxlcE1 interacts with Sxl less well compared with the other two proteins (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). To see whether known hnRNP proteins in addition to protein L could interact with Sxl, we performed assays with DrosophilaHrb87F (hrp36), which is an hnRNP A/B type protein with a glycine-rich domain at its C terminus (21Haynes S.R. Raychaudhuri G. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Haynes S.R. Johnson D. Raychaudhuri G. Beyer A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Matunis E.L. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although GSTHrb87F alone binds at a very low level to two-U-run RNA, in combination with Sxl it shows a strong shifted band above the band with Sxl alone (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). A UV cross-linking experiment shows that GSTHrb87F alone is capable of a low level of binding to the two-U-run RNA; a protein concentration at least 100-fold higher than Sxl is required for equivalent levels of binding (Fig. 2 B). Apparently Sxl interacts with Hrb87F to stabilize or strengthen its binding to a weak RNA site. For comparison, two proteins lacking a glycine-rich domain were tested in this assay. Splicing factor U2AF65 and polypyrimidine track binding protein, PTB/hnRNP I, both bind polypyrimidine tracks (5Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.G.

Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). PTB/hnRNP I has noticeable structural similarity to L protein but lacks the glycine-rich region (37Gil A. Sharp P.A.

https://openalex.org/W1556131518,"Data concerning the hormone sensitivity of the release and role of the aspartyl protease cathepsin D in tumor proliferative and invasive processes have been contradictory. To clarify the mechanisms of its release and role we first studied the contribution of estradiol and stripped serum to the time course and kinetics of cathepsin D release, proliferation, and invasion in parallel in the MCF-7 in vitro breast cancer cell culture model. Both estradiol and stripped serum independently stimulated both proliferation and cathepsin D release. However, the dose-response of estradiol and stripped serum-dependent stimulated release were similar to those for invasion and differed from those for proliferation: cathepsin D release and invasion were first stimulated at a stripped serum concentration more than 10-fold lower than that which initiated proliferation and had half stimulation constants almost 10-fold lower than those for proliferation. These results demonstrate that cathepsin D release is not related in any direct way to proliferation. The effect of the reduction of cathepsin D activity or release on in vitro invasion was also measured: both the inhibition of secreted cathepsin D activity by a specific inhibitor, diazoacetyl-DL-Nle-OMe, and the reduction of cathepsin D release by antisense oligonucleotides against its translation start site reduced cellular in vitro invasion without affecting proliferation. Cathepsin D release and activity are concluded to be directly involved in the process of invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2082524728,"Comparative transfection analysis of murine interferon A4 and interferon A11 promoter constructs transiently transfected in mouse L929 and human HeLa S3 cells infected with Newcastle disease virus showed that the second positive regulatory domain I-like domain (D motif), located between nucleotides −57 and −46 upstream of the transcription start site, contributes to the activation of virus-induced transcription of the interferon (IFN)-A4 gene promoter by cooperating with the positive regulatory domain I-like and TG-like domains previously described. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay performed with the virus-inducible fragments containing these motifs indicated that the binding activity that we have denoted as virus-induced factor (Génin, P., Bragança, J., Darracq, N., Doly, J., and Civas, A.

It binds to the D motif but not to the virus-unresponsive form of the D motif disrupted by a G−57 → C substitution. We show that the low levels of IFN-A11 gene expression are caused essentially by the lack of two inducible enhancer domains disrupted by the A−78 → G and the G−57 → C substitutions.

IFN-B gene expression is regulated by multiple factors that interact with positive regulatory domains (PRDs) located within virus-responsive element B (VRE-B): interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which binds to both the PRDI and PRDIII domains, also known as IRF elements (15Du W.

Binding of both the NF-κB and ATF-2/c-Jun complexes is facilitated by HMGI(Y), members of the high mobility group of proteins that bend the DNA and allow VRE-B-binding factors to assemble in a higher order nucleoprotein complex called an “enhanceosome,” thus promoting the virus-induced transcription of the IFN-B gene (23Falvo J.V.

Postinductional repression and maintenance of a poised state of repression seem to be mediated by IRF-2 (and its truncated form), which recognize the IRF elements and prevent the binding of IRF-1. Other factors have been implicated in the repression of transcription by their interaction with the IRF elements or the negative regulatory domains surrounding VRE-B (18Harada H. Willison K.

Factors specifically involved in regulation of the IFN-A genes are less well defined. The virus-responsive element of the human IFN-A1 gene (VRE-A1) and the inducible element of the murine IFN-A4 gene have been shown to contain a PRDI-like site, thus involving IRF-1 in the induced expression of the IFN-A genes (30MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Büeler H. Chaturvedi M. De la Fuente J. Ruffner H. Meyer F. Weissmann C.

A comparative study of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A6 gene promoters displaying virus inducibility has led to the detection, by EMSA, of a binding activity, AF1. It has been proposed that AF1-forming proteins cooperate with IRF-1 in the virus-induced transcription of IFN-A genes (4Pitha P.M. Au W.E. Semin. Virology. 1995; 6: 151-159Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Au W.C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Au W.-C. Su Y. Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another factor possibly involved in the specific regulation of IFN-A gene regulation is the TG protein, which binds to the hexameric GAAATG repeats that confer virus inducibility by an IRF-1-independent pathway. The so-called “TG sequence” is adjacent to the PRDI-like motif in the human VRE-A1 and is conserved in most human or murine IFN-A (30MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the AF1-related and TG-binding proteins have yet to be characterized. Interestingly, the deletion of the gene coding for IRF-1 did not affect virus-inducible expression of the type I IFN genes, thus calling into question its role (36Matsuyama T. Kimura T. Kitagawa M. Pfeffer K. Kawakami T. Watanabe N. Kündig T.M. Amakawa R. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Potter J. Furlonger C.L. Narendran A. Suzuki H. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Taniguchi T. Mak T.W.

Another member of the IRF family, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3γ (ISGF3γ) has been suggested to participate in the regulation of the IFN-B gene promoter both alone and as a heteromeric complex (ISGF3) formed with Stat1α and Stat2 (from the signal transducer and activator of transcription family) (38Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 39Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ISGF3 has been shown to be induced secondarily by the virus and involved in the amplification of type I IFN gene expression triggered initially by virus infection of cells. However, the primary transcription factor, directly activated by the virus and mediating the PRDI-dependent initiation of transcription of the type I IFN genes, remains to be identified. We have previously shown that the differential expression of IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 genes, in NDV-induced L929 cells, was due in part to the negative effect of the A−78 → G substitution that distinguishes the inducible element of IFN-A4 (IE-A4) from the equivalent region of the IFN-A11 gene promoter and also to the presence of negatively acting sequences located upstream of the inducible element of the IFN-A11 promoter (42Civas A. Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4497-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By comparative analysis of the −109 to −64 fragments of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 gene promoters, which include their inducible elements, we identified a virus-induced binding activity that is stimulated within 1 h of virion contact with cells (1Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This virus-induced factor (VIF) recognizes specifically the PRDI-like domain shared by both the inducible elements and the TG-like domain of IE-A4. In the present study, we report that VIF also binds a second PRDI-like motif located between the IE-A4 and the TATA box of the IFN-A4 promoter. We show that this motif contributes to the high level of NDV-induced transcription of the IFN-A4 gene by cooperating with the IE-A4 subdomains and that the low levels of IFN-A11 gene expression are caused essentially by the absence of both the TG-like and second PRDI-like domain in this promoter. Our data lead us to propose a model for the differential regulation of the IFN-A gene family members and to delineate the involvement of VIF in this regulation. The Bi series of plasmids pIF4 and pIF11 carrying, respectively, the −211 to +19 and the −198 to +19 promoter regions of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 genes and the J series deleted up to position −119 were derived from the plasmids pIF4T and pIF11T previously described (42Civas A. Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4497-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by the subcloning of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments. The 3′-primers were p17 for pIF4Bi or pIF4J and p18 for pIF11Bi or pIF11J, with p3 and p4 as the 5′-primers for the Bi and J constructs, respectively. These fragments, digested byPstI and BamHI, were subcloned into the plasmid pBLCAT3 (44Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The constructs carrying a point mutation at position −78, pIF11[V4]Bi and pIF4[V11]Bi, were obtained similarly from the corresponding T series (42Civas A. Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4497-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The IFN-A11/A4 hybrid plasmid pIFH3Bi was derived from subcloning of the fragment amplified with the primers p3 and p18 with the plasmid pIFH66T (42Civas A. Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4497-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The pIFH1Bi and pIFH2Bi constructs were obtained in two steps by a procedure previously described (43Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar); the fragments amplified in the first round using, respectively, pIF11T (or pIFH66T) as the template and p3 and p10 (or p3 and p9) as primers, were used as the 5′-primer in a second polymerase chain reaction using either p17 and the hybrid plasmid pIFH66T or p18 and the plasmid pIF11T as the 3′-primer and template, respectively. The construct pIFH4Bi was obtained similarly from pIF11T, using primers p3 and p5 in the first step, and the amplified fragment was used with primer p18 and plasmid pIF11T in the second polymerase chain reaction. To construct the plasmids pIF4T-3S and pIF4T-1S or plasmids pIF4T-4S and pIF4T-2S, either plasmid pIF4T or plasmid pIF4[V11]T was used as a template in each round. p17 was the primer for the second step, whereas either p6 or p7, respectively, was used as a 3′-mutagenic primer with p1 as the 5′-primer in the first round. Similarly, to construct pIF11T-3S and pIF11T-1S, pIF11T was used as template in both steps with p18 in the second and p5 or p8 as the mutagenic primer used with p2, whereas pIF11[V4]T was used as template to obtain the plasmids pIF11T-4S and pIF11T-2S. In each case, the final products were purified, digested by PstI and BamHI, and inserted between these sites in the pBLCAT3 polylinker. The promoter constructs carrying internal deletions were obtained by the ligation of two separately amplified fragments, one digested by PstI, the other by BamHI, toPstI-BamHI-digested pBLCAT3. Thus, pIF4ΔBi and pIF11ΔBi were constructed by ligation of two fragments amplified with p3/p21 and p19/p17 or with p3/p21 and p20/p18, respectively, in the presence of pIF4Bi or pIF11Bi as template. The pV4, p[B]2and p[C4]2 constructs were previously described (1Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The constructions depicted in Fig. 6 A were obtained by insertion of synthetic fragments of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 promoters at theHindIII and BamHI sites upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused to the CAT gene (pBLCAT2 modified by G. Schütz). The correct sequences of the constructions presented were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The sequence information for polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis is available upon request. Mouse L929 cells (ATCC CCL 1) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum. HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2) were maintained as monolayers in the same medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (45Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA cloning: A practical approach. II. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) and induced with NDV (La Jolla strain, New Jersey) or mock-induced as described previously (1Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Measurements of CAT activity were performed on cytoplasmic extracts obtained 24 h after induction (46Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie G250 procedure as described previously (1Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results are derived from the average CAT values obtained in at least three independent transfection experiments, each performed in triplicate with two or three different clones. L929 cells and HeLa cells were grown in suspension, respectively, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and suspension-modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. Virus induction for 4 h was performed by keeping the cells in contact with NDV for 1 h in serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide and by maintaining the cells for a further 3 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and 2% fetal calf serum. IFN induction was carried out with recombinant mouse IFN-α11 (103 units/ml) for 2 h. After washing and centrifugation, the cells were harvested immediately, and the nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides BC4 and BC11 correspond to the −98 to −74 region of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 promoters, respectively. In the dC4 and dC11 oligomers, the module B is replaced by C4 in BC4 or by C11 in BC11. The B2oligonucleotide corresponds to the dimer of the −98 to −87 GAAAGTGAAAAG sequence of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 promoters. The C42 and D42 represent, respectively, two copies of the −85 to −74 GAATTGGAAAGC and −57 to −46 GAAAGGAGAAAC sequences of IFN-A4, whereas C112 and D112refer, respectively, to the dimers of their mutated forms GAATTGGGAAGC and CAAAGGAGAAAC present in the IFN-A11 promoter (the substituted residues are underlined). ISRE-ISG15 (gatcCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC) and GIRE-FcγR (ctagATTTCCCAGAAAAGGAACATGATGAATctag) are, respectively, the binding sites for ISGF3 and Stat1 dimers (48Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Fu X.-Y. Levy D.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,49Perez C. Wietzerbin J. Benech P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2182-2192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of the probe was performed using single-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham, UK; 3000 Ci/mmol) and annealed to a slight excess of the unlabeled complementary strand. ISRE was labeled by using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Binding reactions and electrophoresis were performed as described previously (1Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For competition assays, the molar excess of unlabeled competitor was mixed with the probe prior to the addition of the nuclear extract, and the bound DNA was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics; 445-SI). For experiments with antibodies, the binding reaction was preincubated for 1 h on ice with the appropriate antisera before the addition of the labeled probe. Anti-ISGF3γ (sc-496 X) and anti-Stat1α/β (sc-464 X) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibodies were from Euromedex, France. We have shown that the difference in NDV inducibility of two members of the IFN-A gene family, namely IFN-A4 and IFN-A11, is in part due to a A−78 → G substitution and to the presence of negatively acting sequences located between −244 and −199 in the IFN-A11 gene promoter (42Civas A. Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4497-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 50Roffet P. Lopez S. Navarro S. Bandu M.-T. Coulombel C. Vignal M. Doly J. Vodjdani G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments were therefore carried out to identify the additional regulatory element(s) involved in the differential NDV-induced response conferred by these two promoters. A comparison of the results obtained with constructions carrying different 5′-deleted fragments of these promoters showed that the region between −198 and −119 did not affect the NDV inducibility of the IFN-A11 promoter, whereas, as described previously by Raj et al. (31Raj N.B.K. Israeli R. Kellum M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11149-11157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion of the corresponding region exerted a slight positive effect on the virus-induced transcription of IFN-A4 (Fig. 1). However, the virus inducibility of IFN-A4 remained consistently higher than IFN-A11, even when the promoters were devoid of any modulatory region upstream of their inducible element (the Bi or J series of constructions). The creation of a TG-like domain in IFN-A11 by the G−78 → A mutation increased its inducibility, but not to the expression levels conferred by IFN-A4 (Fig. 2 A). The disruption of the TG-like domain in IFN-A4 decreased the induced transcription levels without reducing them to those of IFN-A11. Thus, the G−78 → A substitution alone is not sufficient to explain the difference between the virus inducibility of these promoters. Transfection of the IFN-A11/A4 hybrid promoters showed that the substitution of the nucleotides (TAC)A11, located from −59 to −57, by (CCG)A4 significantly increased the virus inducibility (pIFH4Bi compared with pIF11Bi), suggesting the presence of an additional virus-responsive sequence located between the inducible element and the TATA box in the IFN-A4 promoter. Alternatively, a negatively acting sequence could be present in the corresponding region of IFN-A11. To investigate these hypotheses, the residues −59 to −57 were deleted in the Bi series of constructs or interchanged between the two promoters extending up to nucleotides −470 to −457. The (CCG)A4 deletion significantly decreased the virus inducibility of IFN-A4, whereas a (TAC)A11 deletion in IFN-A11 did not have any effect (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the CCG deletion disrupts a virus-inducible element in the IFN-A4 promoter. Furthermore, the substitution of (CCG)A4 by (TAC)A11 decreased the virus inducibility of the native IFN-A4 promoter fragment 3-fold, whereas the reciprocal substitution increased the IFN-A11 inducibility more than 6-fold (Fig. 3). These data confirmed the presence of a virus-inducible enhancer in the IFN-A4 promoter. The more pronounced effect of (TAC)A11 conversion in IFN-A11 in the T series compared with the Bi series may be due to the deletion of the negatively acting sequences located between nucleotides −244 and −199 in this promoter because the inducibility of pIF11Bi is already the 2–3-fold higher.Figure 2Identification of an additional virus-responsive domain in the IFN-A4 proximal promoter. A, the symbols are as described in Fig. 1. pIF4[V11]Bi differs from pIF4Bi by a A−78 → G substitution indicated by a filled circle, whereas pIF[11V4]Bi contains the reciprocal G−78 → A mutation in the IFN-A11 promoter. The hybrid promoter constructs pIFH1Bi, pIFH2Bi, and pIFH3Bi carry, respectively, the −24 to +19, −44 to −24, or −44 to +19 regions of IFN-A4 in the IFN-A11 promoter. The TAC residues (−59 to −57) are substituted by CCG in pIFH4Bi. Putative regulatory elements in the −64 to −55 regions are indicated. Relative transcription is expressed as the percentage of NDV-induced CAT activity obtained with pIF4Bi, and the inducibility is expressed by the induction ratio of the NDV-induced to mock-induced CAT activities. B, deletion of the nucleotide −59 to −57 residues in pIF4ΔBi and pIF11ΔBi is represented by a space between the inducible element and the TATA box.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Cooperativity between the proximal PRDI-like domain (−57 to −46) and the inducible element IE-A4.

Construction of plasmids and their transfection into L929 and HeLa S3 cells are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since we were able to show the −78 A/G substitution had an effect on virus inducibility, we measured the cumulative effect of the −78 and −59 to −57 substitutions in both promoters. The substitution of (CCG)A4 by (TAC)A11 together with the A−78 → G mutation caused a dramatic decrease in the IFN-A4 inducibility, reducing the transcription rate to the level conferred by the IFN-A11 promoter (Fig. 3). The values obtained, compared with those conferred by the IFN-A4 constructs carrying only the A−78 → G or the (TAC)A11 substitutions, clearly indicated a synergistic effect between the newly identified virus-responsive enhancer and the inducible element IE-A4. Consistently, reciprocal substitutions in the IFN-A11 promoter augment the virus-induced transcription. In this case, the cooperative effect of the enhancer with the inducible element was hindered, probably due again to the 2–3-fold inhibitory effect of the negatively acting sequences located in the −244 to −199] region of the IFN-A11 promoter. Sequence analysis of the IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 promoters revealed that in the −70 to −40 region, the −59 to −57 substitutions may affect potential binding sites for the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, NFκB, and IRF family of transcription factors. Although CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β has been involved in the regulation of several cytokine genes in response to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (51Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O.

The purified enzyme exhibited a Kmof 49 μm and a Vmax of 0.36 μmol of p-nitrophenylhexaoside hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein. Amylase activity was optimal at pH 8 and was dependent on divalent cations such as Ca2+. MalS exhibited altered migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Analytical ultracentrifugation and electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that MalS is monomeric. The four cysteine residues are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds. To map disulfide bonds, MalS was proteolytically digested. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis indicated the presence of two disulfide bonds,i.e. Cys40–58 and Cys104–520. The disulfide bond at Cys40–58 is located in an N-terminal extension of about 160 amino acids which has no homology to other amylases but to the proposed peptide binding domain of GroEL, the Hsp60 of E. coli. The N-terminal extension is linked to the C-terminal amylase domain via disulfide bond Cys104–520. Reduction of disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol treatment led to aggregation suggesting that the N terminus of MalS may represent an internal chaperone domain. Periplasmic α-amylase of Escherichia coli, the malS gene product, hydrolyzes linear maltodextrins. The purified enzyme exhibited a Kmof 49 μm and a Vmax of 0.36 μmol of p-nitrophenylhexaoside hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein. Amylase activity was optimal at pH 8 and was dependent on divalent cations such as Ca2+. MalS exhibited altered migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Analytical ultracentrifugation and electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that MalS is monomeric. The four cysteine residues are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds. To map disulfide bonds, MalS was proteolytically digested. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis indicated the presence of two disulfide bonds,i.e. Cys40–58 and Cys104–520. The disulfide bond at Cys40–58 is located in an N-terminal extension of about 160 amino acids which has no homology to other amylases but to the proposed peptide binding domain of GroEL, the Hsp60 of E. coli. The N-terminal extension is linked to the C-terminal amylase domain via disulfide bond Cys104–520. Reduction of disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol treatment led to aggregation suggesting that the N terminus of MalS may represent an internal chaperone domain. In Escherichia coli, maltodextrins enter the periplasm preferentially via the outer membrane porin LamB (1Freundlieb S. Ehmann U. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 314-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the periplasm, maltodextrins are either cleaved by a periplasmic amylase, MalS, or are transported to the cytoplasm via the binding protein-dependent transport complex MalEFGK2(2Boos W. Lucht J. Neidhart F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). This transport system can only transport maltodextrins up to maltoheptaose. Longer dextrins have to be cleaved prior to transport. In the cytoplasm, linear maltodextrins are processed by maltodextrin phosphorylase, amylomaltase, or maltodextrin glucosidase (3Schwartz M. Hofnung M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Wiesmeyer H. Cohn M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 39: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Tapio S. Yeh F. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19450-19458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The malS gene, located at 80.54 min on the E. coli chromosome, is part of the complex maltose regulon (6Schwartz M. Neidhart F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1482-1502Google Scholar), which is involved in the uptake and degradation of maltodextrins. Thus, malS is controlled by MalT, the positive regulator of the system (7Freundlieb S. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MalS hydrolyzes α-(1,4) glycosidic linkages in long maltodextrins but not in maltose. MalS is an enzyme of 659 amino acids with a molecular mass of 74 kDa (8Schneider E. Freundlieb S. Tapio S. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5148-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It belongs to the α-amylase family that shares a characteristic (β/α)8-barrel domain containing the active site (9Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The four best conserved regions that are present in the active site of the α-amylase family are located toward the C terminus of MalS, i.e. between amino acids 304 and 566 (9Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). From amino acid sequence alignments it can be concluded that MalS has an N-terminal extension of about 160 amino acids of unknown function (8Schneider E. Freundlieb S. Tapio S. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5148-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Four Cys residues are found at positions 40, 58, 104, and 520 of the mature MalS protein, three of which are located in the N-terminal extension of MalS, which is not homologous to other amylases. In this study we describe an improved purification procedure, biochemical characterization and mass spectrometric identification of the disulfide bond structure of native MalS.

Proper formation of disulfide bonds is crucial for attaining the correct three-dimensional structure of proteins (10Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Milley B. Cowgill C. Deinzer M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mass spectrometric methods have successfully been employed for the study of disulfide bridges of peptides and proteins (14Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Deinzer M.L. J. Am. Soc.

In our studies we used proteolytic cleavage techniques, followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and MALDI-MS for the rapid identification of the disulfide bridges.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5148-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pCS7 is a pBAD18s derivative and expresses malS with a deletion of its signal sequence under control of the arabinose promoter (23Prinz W.A. Spiess C. Ehrmann M. Schierle C. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). pBAD18s is a pBR322-derived high copy number plasmid that has the arabinose promoter followed by a linker containing multiple restriction sites (24Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). pAID135 encodes alkaline phosphatase with a signal sequence deletion (Δ2–22) (25Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Strain CS66 expressing malSfrom pUMA103 was grown in minimal medium 9 (M9) (26Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids as carbon source. Cells from a 2.5-liter overnight culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 5000 rpm, 21 °C, GS-3 rotor) and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, prior to preparation of cold osmotic shock fractions. The cold osmotic shock procedure was carried out according to Neu and Heppel (27Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception of using CaCl2 instead of MgCl2. Remaining cells were removed by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C, SS34 rotor). Subsequently, the periplasmic extract was lyophilized, and proteins were solubilized in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. After dialysis overnight in buffer A, insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C, SS34 rotor). The resulting supernatant fraction was loaded on a MonoQ column (from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which had been equilibrated with buffer A. Non-interacting proteins were washed off with 10 ml of buffer A, and the remaining proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 200 mm NaCl in 40 ml of buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. MalS eluted at about 80 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). SDS gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (29Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). To detect MalS on Western blots, polyclonal antiserum against MalS was used. For mass spectrometric structure determination, MalS solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using microconcentrator devices (Amicon, microcon, cutoff 10 kDa). Retentates were washed with 500 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, and collected to result in a final protein concentration of 6.9 mg/ml. Aliquots were used for further investigations. Amylase activity was determined using p-nitrophenylhexaoside (PNP6) as a substrate. The release of p-nitrophenol from PNP6 by MalS was assayed at room temperature. Amylase assays of whole cells were performed as described with the exception that cells were grown overnight in M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids and 100 μg/ml ampicillin (23Prinz W.A. Spiess C. Ehrmann M. Schierle C. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Activity of purified MalS was determined in an assay buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2. Assays were carried out in a total volume of 125 μl at room temperature. MalS was added to a final concentration of 1.16 μg/ml (15.7 nm). The reaction was started by adding PNP6 to a final concentration of 1 mm. To determine the effect of various effectors, preincubation of MalS with the corresponding substance was performed for 5 min at room temperature prior to starting the reaction. After appearance of a pale yellow color the absorbance at 405 nm was determined with an Anthos HTII microplate reader. For determination of kinetic parameters, MalS was used at a concentration of 1.45 μg/ml, and PNP6 concentrations between 0.5 and 500 μm were assayed. All assays were performed at least in duplicate. Results varied by <10%. Alkaline phosphatase activity in whole cells was assayed by measuring the rate ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis by permeabilized cells as described (30Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase activity corresponds to 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis per min at room temperature. Specific activity is given as units per mg of cellular protein. 1.7 μm MalS was reduced by incubation for 15 min in 30 mm DTT (final concentration). Reoxidation was obtained by adding oxidized glutathione to 130 mm. After incubating 40 min at room temperature, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 150 mm, and after further incubation for 5 min at room temperature samples were precipitated with methanol/CHCl3 (31Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). The resultant pellet was dissolved in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein was diluted in 20 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.5, to concentrations from 12.5–50 μg/ml and was adsorbed on hydrophilized carbon films, briefly fixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed in water, and negatively stained by 2% uranyl acetate, pH 4.5, or 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.2. Reduced MalS was obtained by incubation with 30 mm DTT prior to adsorption on carbon films. In addition, specimens were prepared by the glycerol spray technique and shadow casted by platinum/carbon as described (32Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Specimens were examined in a EM10 C2 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) under 80 kV at primary magnification of 36,000 ×. Experiments were carried out in a Beckman Instruments Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. A solution ofA280 = 0.1–0.2 (corresponding to a concentration of 0.6–1.1 μm in terms of protein monomer concentration) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 75 mm NaCl was measured at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. For the determination of the molecular weight the data were fit to Equation 1.Λr=A0·expM·(1−ν·ρ)·ω2·(r2−r02)2·RT+EEquation 1 In Equation 1 Ar andA0 are the absorbance at a radial positionr and at the meniscus r0 (a reference position), respectively. The parameter M is the molecular weight of the macromolecule that is derived from the fit; ν is the partial specific volume that was calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein to be 0.720 ml g−1 (33Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 34Durschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Crossref Google Scholar); ρ is the density of the solvent that was measured to be 1.01 g ml−1; ω is the angular velocity; R is the universal gas constant; T is the absolute temperature, andE is the base line that was determined at 10,000 rpm after sedimentation of the protein sample at 48,000 rpm for 6 h. A MalS solution (50 μl; 2 mg/ml) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, was mixed with a solution (2.7 μl) of Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphin (TCEP) in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5 (35Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1749-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Final concentration of TCEP was 5.4 mm, resulting in a molar ratio of MalS to TCEP of 1:200 (4 Cys per MalS). The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A 100 mm iodoacetamide solution in H2O (0.7 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 30 min in the dark, pH 7.5. The molar ratio of MalS to iodoacetamide was 1:50. The reaction was terminated by ultrafiltration using a microconcentrator device (Amicon, microcon, cutoff 10 kDa). Retentates were washed three times with 200 μl of a solution consisting of 30% (v/v) methanol in 35 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. The final protein concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μl. Tryptic digestion was carried out with MalS and carboxamidomethylated MalS (1 mg/ml each) in 100 μl 35 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 30% (v/v) methanol, pH 8. A trypsin solution (10 μl; 1 mg/ml; 1 mmHCl) was added to yield a final pH of 7.5 (E:S = 1:10). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Aliquots (0.5 μl) were used for MALDI-MS analysis without further purification. For subsequent HPLC separation the peptide mixture (50 μg) was lyophilized and redissolved in 100 μl of HPLC solvent A. A Waters Millipore solvent delivery system, consisting of two HPLC pumps (Waters M510 and Waters M45), was used. Purification of MalS was done using a 250 × 8 mm Grom-Sil 200 Butyl-1 ST reversed phase C-4 column (300 Å, 11 μm) equipped with a Grom precolumn. Separations of the tryptic peptide mixture were carried out using a 250 × 4.6-mm Vydac reversed phase C-18 column (300 Å, 10 μm) equipped with a Vydac precolumn. In all cases, solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and solvent B was 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. For MalS purification the flow rate was adjusted to 2.4 ml/min, and after sample injection, the solvent mixture was kept constant at 10% B for 5 min and was raised to 90% B over a period of 55 min. MalS-containing samples were collected, lyophilized, and redissolved for ESI-MS analysis in 10% acetic acid/2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (7:3), pH 2, to a final concentration of 1–2 μm. For determination of the disulfide bond-containing peptides, 100 μl of the tryptic peptide-containing solution was injected. The flow rate was adjusted to 1 ml/min and the solvent mixture was kept constant at 10% B for 5 min and was raised to 55% B over a period of 45 min. The lyophilized HPLC fractions were dissolved in 5 μl of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2:1), pH 2, and were used for subsequent MALDI-MS analysis. For reduction of the disulfide bond-containing peptides in solution, 1 μl of each HPLC fraction was mixed with 5 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution, pH 8, and a solution of 1 μl of 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in H2O was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Aliquots (0.5 μl) were used for MALDI-MS analysis without further purification. For on-target reduction, a solution of 25 mm TCEP in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (1 μl; pH 7.5) and acetonitrile (1 μl) was added to the solid matrix/peptide mixture and mixed gently until all solid material was completely redissolved. The reaction mixture adopted pH 4. After 15 min (23 °C) the solvent was evaporated. The matrix/peptide mixture was washed once with 2 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2, and was recrystallized once from 1 μl of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2:1), pH 2, prior to MALDI-MS analysis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses were carried out using a Bruker Biflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Franzen, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a UV nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a dual microchannel plate detector. For the molecular weight determinations, acceleration voltage was set to 25 kV, and spectra were calibrated with recombinant human macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (49,030 Da) (37Glocker M.O. Kalkum M. Yamamoto R. Schreurs J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14625-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For peptide mapping experiments acceleration voltage was set to 20 kV and insulin was used for calibration. MalS- and tryptic peptide-containing solutions (0.5 μl) were mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (10 μg/μl 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid, HCCA) dissolved in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2:1), pH 2, directly on the target. Spectra were recorded after evaporation of the solvent and processed using the X-MASS data system. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed with a Vestec-201A quadrupole mass spectrometer (Vestec, Houston, TX). The ion-spray interface temperature was approximately 45–55 °C for all measurements. The mass analyzer with a nominal m/z range of 2000 was operated at 1/8 unit resolution. An electrospray voltage at the tip of the stainless steel capillary needle of 1.4–1.6 kV and a nozzle-repeller voltage of 20–40 V were employed, respectively. Mass calibration was performed with the 8+ to 12+ charged ions of hen egg white lysozyme (14306.5 Da) and with the 13+ to 17+ charged ions of bovine trypsinogen (23980.9 Da). Raw data were analyzed using a Tecnivent Vector-2 data system. MalS samples were delivered into the mass spectrometer by infusion through a 50-μm (inner diameter) fused silica capillary at a flow rate of 1 μl/min using a Harvard-44 infusion pump. MalS was purified using a simple procedure involving cold osmotic shock followed by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1 A). Purified MalS migrated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions according to its predicted molecular mass of 74 kDa, and the sample showed homogeneity (>95%) as no further protein bands were observed. To determine optimal conditions for assay of the amylase, several parameters were investigated. The pH optimum of MalS was found to be between pH 8.0 and 8.5 (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, we used Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, in all assays. The kinetic parameters of pure MalS were determined with PNP6 as substrate by varying substrate concentrations between 0.5 and 500 μm. TheKm value was 49 μm, and the maximum velocity (Vmax) was 0.36 μmol min−1 mg−1 protein. Since the activity of many amylases is dependent on Ca2+, we tested whether MalS activity was inhibited by EDTA and whether the inhibitory effect could be reversed by addition of divalent cations. The addition of 1 mm EDTA to the reaction buffer abolished MalS activity. After adding back Ca2+ and Ba2+, enzymatic activity was restored. We detected that Ba2+ even stimulated amylase activity slightly. Although Mg2+ and Mn2+ restored MalS activity to 77 and 74%, respectively, the addition of Zn2+ did not abolish the inhibition by EDTA (Table I).Table IActivation of Ca 2+-depleted MalS by various bivalent cationsCationMalS activitynmol/min × mg protein14Ca2+400Ba2+520Mg2+309Mn2+296Zn2+5Ca2+-depleted MalS was generated by preincubation with 1 mm EDTA for 5 min. Reactivation assays were carried out by adding chloride solutions of the respective cations at concentrations of 10 mm. After incubation for additional 5 min, the amylase assay was carried out. Prior to EDTA treatment, MalS activity was 403 units. Open table in a new tab Ca2+-depleted MalS was generated by preincubation with 1 mm EDTA for 5 min. Reactivation assays were carried out by adding chloride solutions of the respective cations at concentrations of 10 mm. After incubation for additional 5 min, the amylase assay was carried out. Prior to EDTA treatment, MalS activity was 403 units. We determined whether conditions of high or low concentrations of salt would affect MalS activity. MalS activity was highest (350 nmol min−1 mg−1) when no NaCl was added to the standard assay buffer and decreased with increasing concentrations of salt. It was about 2-fold lower in the presence of 1 mNaCl. MalS migrated at its predicted molecular mass under reducing conditions, i.e. 74 kDa. Under nonreducing conditions, MalS migrated near 90 kDa. Furthermore, the same shift from 74 to 90 kDa was detected after reoxidation of reduced MalS using oxidized glutathione, indicating the presence of disulfide bonds (Fig. 2 A). However, since proteins containing disulfide bonds normally migrate at lower apparent molecular weight than under reducing conditions, we investigated the possibility that the unusual behavior of MalS may be due to other explanations, e.g. other post-translational modifications. ESI-MS molecular weight analysis of nonreduced MalS showed a series of multiply charged molecular ions centering around the [M + 43H]43+ molecular ion (Fig. 2 B), indicating the homogeneity of the sample. The experimentally determined molecular mass of 73,978 Da (±20) was in excellent agreement with the calculated molecular mass (73961 Da) from the translated amino acid sequence; thus, the existence of a covalent multimeric form of MalS or other post-translational modifications besides possible disulfide bond formation could be ruled out. In addition, iodoacetamide alkylation of nonreduced MalS did not yield carbamidomethylated product, indicating the absence of free cysteine residues (data not shown). To further investigate the molecular structure of MalS, the reduced and iodoacetamide alkylated protein was cleaved proteolytically with trypsin, and the fragment mixture was subsequently analyzed by MALDI-MS (mass spectrometric peptide mapping). The results (Table II) confirmed the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3) as very good sequence coverage was obtained. Only in the cases of partial sequences with closely spaced lysine or arginine residues were we not able to identify the resulting short peptides directly from peptide mapping data due to superimposition with matrix ions. However, the correct N terminus (amino acids 1–27; fragment T1) was ascertained by an ion signal atm/z 2837, and the C-terminal tryptic peptide (amino acids 651–659) of the protein was identified as an ion signal at m/z 1000. Cysteine-containing peptide ions were observed, e.g. at m/z 2461 for carboxamidomethylated T2 and at m/z 2172 for carboxamidomethylated T3 (Table II).Table IIMALDI-MS peptide mapping analysis of tryptic peptides, thiol-alkylated peptides, and disulfide-linked peptides from MaISPeptidePartial sequence2-aNumbers denote amino acid positions as found in the sequence of the mature protein.[M + H]+(calc.)[M + H]+(obed.)T2–S-S–T3(28 –48)-S-S-(49–66)4515.14515T7–S-S–T42(103 –106)-S-S-(517–534)2543.92544T11 –272837.12837T22-bReduced and carboxamidomethylated peptide.28 –482460.72461T32-bReduced and carboxamidomethylated peptide.49 –662171.42172T4–T567 –801727.91729T570 –801311.41312T681 –1022256.62259T8107 –1272202.52002T9128 –1381328.51329T10139 –1582140.52141T11159 –1812657.82658T12182 –1951586.61586T13–T14196 –2121842.01841T15–T16213 –2473813.33814T16218 –2473299.73302T17248 –2773536.73537T18278 –2861027.11028T20290 –3233841.33842T23330 –3532902.12901T24354 –358606.6605T24–T25354 –3621164.31164T26363 –366588.8589T27367 –3912775.02777T28392 –4051501.71502T30–T33408 –4414086.64085T31414 –421893.0893T32422 –4331604.81605T33434 –441943.0942T33–T34434 –4461457.61457T35447 –4571349.61349T36458 –465818.9820T34–T38442 –4693235.83237T40475 –4992962.32962T41500 –5161986.11986T43535 –5501838.01835T43–T44535 –5532255.62255T45–T46554 –5944220.74220T46559 –5943733.23735T47595 –6051267.31268T48606 –6151085.21085T49616 –620650.8651T50–T51621 –630978.1978T51623 –630750.9752T52631 –637817.0817T53638 –644826.9827T54–T55645 –6591681.81682T55651 –6591000.210002-a Numbers denote amino acid positions as found in the sequence of the mature protein.2-b Reduced and carboxamidomethylated peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2090475458,"Emerging evidence suggests important differences among protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes in terms of their regulation and biological functions. PKC is regulated by multiple interdependent mechanisms, including enzymatic activation, translocation of the enzyme in response to activation, phosphorylation, and proteolysis. As part of our ongoing studies to define the factors contributing to the specificity of PKC isozymes, we prepared chimeras between the catalytic and regulatory domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε. These chimeras, which preserve the overall structure of the native PKC enzymes, were stably expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Their intracellular distribution was similar to that of the endogenous enzymes, and they responded with translocation upon treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). We found that the potency of PMA for translocation of the PKCα/x chimeras from the soluble fraction was influenced by the catalytic domain. The ED50 for translocation of PKCα/α was 26 nm, in marked contrast to the ED50 of 0.9 nm in the case of the PKCα/ε chimera. In addition to this increase in potency, the site of translocation was also changed; the PKCα/ε chimera translocated mainly into the cytoskeletal fraction. PKCx/ε chimeras displayed twin isoforms with different mobilities on Western blots. PMA treatment increased the proportion of the higher mobility isoform. The two PKCx/ε isoforms differed in their localization; moreover, their localization pattern depended on the regulatory domain. Our results emphasize the complex contributions of the regulatory and catalytic domains to the overall behavior of PKC.

Protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate.is a major family of serine/threonine kinases that plays a crucial role in cell signal transduction, regulating cell growth and differentiation (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests important differences among PKC isozymes both in their regulation and in their biological roles. Thus, in K-562 erythroleukemia cells, PKCα was implicated in mediating PMA-induced cytostasis, whereas PKCβII was involved in proliferation (2Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RBL-2H3 basophilic leukemia cells, the PKCα and -ε isoforms preferentially inhibited phospholipase C activity (3Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the PKCβ and -ε isoforms linked the mast cell high affinity receptor for IgE to the expression of c-fos and c-jun (4Razin E. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7722-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In PKCβ knockout mice, signaling through the antigen receptor-dependent signaling pathway was markedly impaired (5Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Not only may some PKC isoforms be active whereas others not for a given response, but the actions of different isoforms may even be antagonistic. In NIH 3T3 cells, for example, PKCδ arrested cell growth, whereas PKCε stimulated it (6Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.M. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar). As part of our ongoing studies to explore the basis of specificity of PKC isozymes, we have prepared chimeras between the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε and investigated their behavior in intact cells. Protein kinase C consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain acts as a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, and the regulatory domain is thought to inhibit this catalytic activity through a so-called pseudosubstrate region near its N terminus. Immediately C-terminal to this pseudosubstrate region is a pair of highly conserved zinc finger structures termed the C1 domains that are the sites of phorbol ester binding on the molecule and contribute to the association with anionic phospholipid (8Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the classic isozymes, α, βI, βII, and γ, a second domain in the regulatory region, the C2 domain, bestows Ca2+ dependence. The novel isozymes, δ, ε, η, and θ, lack this region and correspondingly lack Ca dependence, although they have a modified C2 homolog N-terminal to the C1 domain (10Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 207-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The individual C1 domains of PKC bind phorbol esters with similar affinity to the intact PKC. X-ray crystallography of the PKCδ C1b domain revealed that the phorbol ester inserts into a hydrophilic cleft in an otherwise hydrophobic surface, promoting interaction of the C1 domain with the membrane (11Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). It thus functions as a hydrophobic switch. In the intact unstimulated cell, PKC is largely cytosolic with some proportion depending on the isoform and the cell type present in the membrane and cytoskeletal fractions (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol ester addition leads to translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membranes, presumably reflecting enhanced membrane affinity of the C1-phorbol ester complex. This translocation provides one measure of the response of specific PKC isoforms in the context of the intact cell. Emerging understanding suggests that translocation should not only depend on the strength of the association between the C1 domain and the membrane but should also be coupled to other factors contributing to the membrane association and the energetics of conformational changes in the enzyme upon activation. Receptors for activated protein kinase C, the binding proteins for the regulatory domain of PKC, have been described (14Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), which stabilize the activated conformation of the enzyme (15Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Specific substrates likewise can drive association, as elegantly shown by Jaken and co-workers (16Chapline C. Mousseau B. Ramsay K. Duddy S. Li Y. Kiley S.C. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6417-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The state of phosphorylation of PKC is another important regulator that influences both activity and localization (17Newton A.C. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar,18Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the ability of the pseudosubstrate domain to interact with the catalytic domain is central to its function. We report here that the catalytic domain of PKC influences both the potency of phorbol ester for PKC translocation and the compartment to which PKC is translocated in response to phorbol ester. Protein kinase C chimeras were generated by swapping the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε. The regulatory domain of PKCε was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing high fidelity thermostable vent DNA polymerase using the following primers: 5′-CTCGAGATGGTAGTGTTCAATGGCCTTCTTA-3′ and 5′-GCTGCCTTTGACTAGTACCTTGAT-3′. To amplify the catalytic domain of PKCε, the primers we used were: 5′-GTACTAGTCAAAGGCAGCTTTGGCAA-3′ and 5′-GACGCGTTCAGGGCATCAGGTCTTCACCAAA-3′. The regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCδ were amplified by utilizing the primers below, respectively: 5′-GGGCTCGAGATGGCACCCTTCCTTCGCATTT-3′, 5′-GCTGCCTTTGACTAGTACTTTT-3′, 5′-GTACTAGTCAAAGGCAGCTTTGGCAA-3′, and 5′-CCACGCGTAATGTCCAGGAATTGCTCAAACTT-3′. To amplify the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα, we employed the following primers, respectively: 5′-CGCTCGAGATGGCTGACGTCTTCC-3′, 5′-GCTGCCTTTGACTAGTACCATGAGGAA-3′, 5′-GTACTAGTCAAAGGCAGCTTTGGCAA-3′, and 5′-CGACGCGTTACCGCGCTCTGCAGGATGG-3′. To reduce the chance of introducing mutations, we not only used high fidelity enzymes but we also kept the number of PCR cycles low (8 cycles). To facilitate subsequent cloning steps, into the inner PCR primers we introduced a unique restriction site (SpeI). After 8 cycles of polymerase chain reaction, we added an adenine overhang to the constructs withTaq polymerase at 72 °C after removing the primers, and we then ligated them into the pGEM-T vector. From this point on we employed only classical cloning techniques to further reduce the possibility of mutations in our constructs. Using the pGEM-T vector as a shuttle vector we amplified the different PKC domains separately by transforming them into bacteria; we then subcloned the catalytic domains into the vectors containing the regulatory domains usingSpeI and MluI restriction enzymes. An important advantage of this approach is that we could reconstruct the wild type PKCα, -δ, and -ε isoforms using the same inserts as for the chimeras, providing us with wild type controls constructed the same way as the chimeras. Next we performed site-directed mutagenesis to mutate the SpeI site back to the original sequence using the following mutagenesis primers: for chimeras with PKCα regulatory domain, 5′-TCCTCATGGTGCTGGGCAAAGGCAGC-3′; for chimeras with PKCδ regulatory domain, 5′-CCAAAAAGTACTTGGCAAAGGCAGC-3′; and for those with PKCε regulatory domain, 5′-CTTCATCAAGGTGTTAGGCAAAGGCAGC-3′. We used the SpeI site for the selection. The chimeras along with the wild type PKC isozymes were then subcloned into an epitope-tagging mammalian expression vector described in detail by Olah et al. (19Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The XhoI and MluI sites ensure unidirectionality, and the vector attaches a C-terminal 12-amino acid tag to the end of the proteins, originally derived from the C terminus sequence of PKCε. Finally, our constructs were sequenced by Paragon Biotech Inc. (Baltimore, MD) to assure that no mutations had been introduced. The chimeras were designated as PKCx/y, where x and y refer to the regulatory and the catalytic domains, respectively. Thus, PKCα/δ, for example, refers to the chimera between the α regulatory domain and the δ catalytic domain. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD) and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were transfected with either the empty vector or the different PKC expression vectors using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The transfected cells were subsequently grown in selection medium containing 750 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 12–18 days in selection medium, single colonies were picked and subsequently screened for the presence of different PKC chimeras by Western blot analysis. Where indicated, cells were treated with different concentrations (0.01 nm–10 μm) of PMA (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) for 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h at 37 °C; dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the control cells. Analyses were routinely carried out on pools of transfected cells, but all results were confirmed on individual clones. The cells were harvested into 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μmleupeptin and lysed by sonication. The cytosolic fraction represents the supernatant following centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The Triton X-100 soluble particulate fraction was prepared by a 2-h extraction of the pellet with the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and a subsequent centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The remaining pellet is the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein content of individual samples was determined (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by staining the Western blots with 0.1% Ponceau S solution in 5% acetic acid (Sigma). The protein staining was found to be linear up to 30 μg of protein/lane. The Ponceau S staining was removed by several washes with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4); the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently immunostained with polyclonal antibodies generated against a polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 726–737 of PKCε (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some cases the chimeras containing the α and the δ catalytic domains were detected with the corresponding anti-catalytic domain antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Research and Diagnostic Antibodies (Berkeley, CA), respectively. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection kit purchased from Amersham Corp. The densitometric analysis of the immunoblots and the normalization to the protein content of each individual lane were performed as described (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) into substrates (as described previously (21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar)) in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 μm PMA. Cell lysates were partially purified on a HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and 10 μl of the partially purified cell lysates were incubated in assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (all purchased from Sigma), 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm/assay myelin basic protein (from bovine brain) (Sigma) as substrate at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid at 10% final concentration. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15 000 ×g a 25-μl aliquot of the supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose disks (Life Technologies, Inc.). The disks were washed three times in 0.5% phosphoric acid and three times in distilled water. The bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The kinase assay was linear with time over this incubation period, and at 50 μm substrate was linear with the amount of protein over the range of cell lysates used in the assays. [3H]PDBu binding was measured by using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay (21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates (40–60 μg of protein/assay) were incubated with 20 nm [3H]PDBu in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 30 μm nonradioactive PDBu, was subtracted to give specific binding. Data presented represent triplicate determinations in each experiment. We have constructed protein kinase Cα, -δ, and -ε chimeras to study the relative contributions of the regulatory and the catalytic subunits of these isozymes to their behavior. We have determined that these PKC chimeras can be stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, bind [3H]PDBu, and exhibit cofactor-dependent kinase activity as do the wild type PKC isozymes (Table I, Fig. 1). Using a previously described tagging system (19Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) we could readily distinguish the endogenous and overexpressed isozymes of PKCα/x and PKCδ/x (sizes are determined by the regulatory domain). In the case of PKCε/α and PKCε/δ we confirmed our findings by using anti-PKCα and anti-PKCδ anti-catalytic antibodies. Because the levels of these overexpressed enzymes as well as the levels of the overexpressed PKCε/ε were much higher than the endogenous PKCε, interference by the endogenous PKCε was not a problem. The antibodies recognized the two previously described PKCε-specific bands at 90 and 93 Kd (7Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar) of the overexpressed PKCε. PKCδ/ε and PKCα/ε chimeras also showed double bands on Western blots, suggesting that the posttranslational phosphorylation of the PKCε catalytic domain was similar to that of the wild type. In contrast, the PKCε/α and PKCε/δ chimeras show a single band suggesting that the posttranslational modification of PKCε occurs only on the catalytic domain.Table I[ 3H]PDBu binding of PKC chimeras[3H]PDBu boundpmol/mg proteinControl1.12 ± 0.01PKCα/α6.34 ± 0.07PKCα/δ4.1 ± 0.1PKCα/ε7.75 ± 0.03PKCδ/α4.18 ± 0.07PKCδ/δ4.27 ± 0.09PKCδ/ε5.53 ± 0.05PKCε/α4.55 ± 0.08PKCε/δ4.17 ± 0.06PKCε/ε4.32 ± 0.05Specific [3H]PDBu binding of the different PKC chimeras was determined by the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data presented show the mean values ± S.E. with triplicate determinations of a single experiment.

To explore the role of the catalytic domains in phorbol ester response, we determined the translocation and subcellular localization patterns of the different chimeras after PMA treatment (Fig. 2). Based on the kinetics of translocation of the endogenous PKCα, -δ, and -ε isoforms in these cells (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table II), we examined the effects on the chimeras of treatment with varying doses of PMA for 1, 3, and 6 h. The translocation dose-response curves were stable after 1 h of exposure to PMA, and at this time point down-regulation was not yet detectable (data not shown). Fig. 2illustrates one representative dose-response experiment using pooled transfected cells (at least three experiments were performed at each time point). The tagged overexpressed wild type PKC isozymes (PKCα/α, PKCδ/δ, and PKCε/ε) translocated with time courses and dose-response curves similar to those of the endogenous enzymes reported earlier (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

The distribution of the overexpressed wild type enzymes was similar to that reported previously for the endogenous enzymes (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 10% of PKCδ/δ was found in the insoluble fraction. The control of distribution in the case of PKCα/x (PKCα regulatory domain) chimeras was dominated by the α regulatory domain. A role for the catalytic domain was evident in the case of PKCε/α chimera; moreover, the catalytic domain of PKCε seemed to have some effect in bringing PKCα/ε and PKCδ/ε into the insoluble fraction (PKC ε/ε was also higher there as expected). The PKCδ/α distribution differed from that of both parent isozymes with a much higher proportion in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. The cofactor-dependent stimulation of kinase activity was somewhat lower for PKCδ/α than that of the other chimeras (see Fig. 1); on the other hand, the PKCδ/α chimera showed good [3H]PDBu binding activity (see Table I). How these differences may be related to the higher portion in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction remains to be determined.Table IIISubcellular localization of various PKC chimeras in untreated cellsSoluble fractionParticulate fractionTriton X-100 insoluble fraction% of totalPKCα/α801010PKCα/δ801010PKCα/ε80515PKCδ/α3015–2050PKCδ/δ65–7515–2510PKCδ/ε50–5515–2030PKCε/α801010PKCε/δ50–5510–1530–35PKCε/ε50–5510–1530–35The distribution of the individual PKC isozymes among the fractions obtained by centrifugation was determined based on the protein levels measured in these fractions.

Similar results were obtained in a second set of independent experiments. In the case of the PKCα regulatory chimeras, the catalytic domain markedly influenced the apparent affinity of PMA for the enzyme. PMA was less potent in translocating the wild type PKCα/α than the PKCα/δ and α/ε chimeras. The dose-response curves for the decrease in PKC in the soluble fraction were quantitated and fitted to the Hill equation (Fig. 3) In the case of wild type PKCα/α, the ED50 for translocation was 26 ± 1 nm (n = five experiments) (similar to that reported earlier for the endogenous PKCα (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) (Table II). It decreased to 9.1 ± 0.3 nm in the case of the PKCα/δ chimera (n = five experiments) and was yet an order of magnitude more sensitive in the case of the PKCα/ε chimera (ED50, 0.91 ± 0.05 nm(n = five experiments)). For the chimeras involving the δ and ε regulatory domains the ED50 values for PMA-induced translocation were similar independent of the specific regulatory or catalytic domain (PKCδ/α, 9.3 ± 0.1 nm; PKCδ/δ, 12.4 ± 0.3 nm; PKCδ/ε, 8 ± 1 nm; PKCε/α, 12 ± 1 nm; PKCε/δ, 7.4 ± 0.2 nm; PKCε/ε, 7.0 ± 0.4 nm; n = three experiments for all values) (Fig. 4).Figure 4ED50 values of PMA-induced translocation of PKC chimeras in NIH 3T3 cells.

This shift in distribution was parallel to a changing proportion of the PKCα/ε chimera in the lower band as compared with the upper band (easiest to observe in the total PKC fraction). The lower band of PKCα/ε was present just in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction, whereas the upper band was predominantly in the cytosolic and particulate fractions (Fig. 2). The PKCδ/ε and PKCε/ε chimeras also revealed a PMA dependent shift in the proportions of the two bands with an increase in the lower band at higher PMA concentrations. The subcellular distribution of the two bands depended on the identity of the regulatory domain, whereas the presence of the two bands depended on the ε catalytic domain. Compared with PKCε/ε, PKCδ/ε and PKCα/ε showed a reduced proportion of the upper band present in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. Unlike PKCε/ε or PKCα/ε, PKCδ/ε maintained large amounts of the higher mobility isoform (lower band) in the cytosolic and membrane fractions. We determined the PMA dependence of the increase in the lower band for the PKCx/ε chimeras. The ED50 values were similar to those observed for the decrease in the soluble fraction (1.5versus 0.91 nm for PKCα/ε, 11.1versus 8 nm for PKCδ/ε, and 9.1versus 7.0 nm for PKCε/ε). We conclude that the two processes occur in parallel. A major objective is to dissect the factors regulating the flow of information through the families of PKC isoforms present in specific cell types. For therapeutic intervention, isoform selective ligands would greatly enhance specificity. Unfortunately it is becoming clear that current in vitro binding assays to recombinant PKC isozymes neglect major contributions to selectivity in the intact cells. Thus, phorbol esters have a 4-fold weaker affinity for PKCε compared with PKCα in vitro (21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PMA is 160-fold more potent for translocation of PKCε than of PKCα in mouse keratinocytes (13Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). Selectivity depends, moreover, on the specific cell type. In NIH 3T3 cells, the selectivity of PMA for PKCε compared with PKCα is only 3.5-fold versus the 160-fold in the keratinocytes (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). Our current results demonstrate that the factors controlling the phorbol ester interactions depend on the catalytic domain of PKC as well as on the phorbol ester binding C1 domains. Identification of the specific mechanisms by which the catalytic domain contributes to the translocation remains to be determined. One possible mechanism by which the catalytic domain could influence protein kinase C unfolding, and indirectly phorbol ester binding, would be through the strength of the interaction between the pseudosubstrate region and the catalytic site. Cantley and co-workers (22Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) have examined in depth the substrate selectivities of the PKC isozymes. The α pseudosubstrate peptide shows similar Km values for the α and δ catalytic activities (ε was not reported) (22Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Also, we had observed similar relative activities of the PKCα and PKCε pseudosubstrates for PKCε (21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Although the regulation of PKC isozymes by second messengers and membrane components has been extensively studied (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 23Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which PKCs can separately modulate signals from distinct receptor pathways remain under active investigation. In cells stimulated with hormones or phorbol esters, most of the cellular PKC translocates to new subcellular sites, including the plasma membrane (24Shoji M. Girard P.R. Mazzei G.J. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), cytoskeleton (15Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), nucleus (15Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 25Disatnik M.H. Winnier A.R. Mochly-Rosen D. Arteaga C.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 873-880PubMed Google Scholar), and elsewhere (15Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Furthermore, within the same cell various isozymes may each be localized to different subcellular sites after cell stimulation (25Disatnik M.H. Winnier A.R. Mochly-Rosen D. Arteaga C.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 873-880PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of protein kinases to new sites necessarily alters their access to substrates (15Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence implicates both the regulatory and the catalytic domains in modulating PKC translocation. It has been previously proposed that membrane binding of PKC in vivo reflects the binding of the activated enzyme to the anchored receptors for activated protein kinase C (27Smith B.L. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This occurs via the regulatory domain of PKC (14Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme (15Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Protein kinase Cε was also reported to bind to actin through a binding site located within the regulatory domain (28Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Conversely, there is strong evidence for the role of the catalytic domain in isozyme-specific localization. Although PKCβI and -βII differ only at the C terminus, they localize differently (29Kiley S.C. Jaken S. Whelan R. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), strongly arguing that unique C-terminal sequences may target these isoforms to different subcellular locations (30Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar). Also, using PKCα and -βII chimeras, a region within the catalytic domain of βII PKC was shown to be responsible for its isotype-specific translocation to the nucleus (31Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Targeting may also occur by binding to cellular proteins that function as substrates. Examples include myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, γ-adducin, and kinesin light chain (29Kiley S.C. Jaken S. Whelan R. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the constitutive membrane association of the truncated PKC regulatory domain, in contrast to the cytosolic localization of the holoenzyme, argues for a role of the catalytic domain (33Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Finally, immunohistochemical studies reveal a role for the catalytic domain in the pattern of localization and translocation of PKCδ and PKCε chimeras. 2Q. J. Wang, P. Acs, J. Goodnight, P. M. Blumberg, H. Mischak, J. F. Mushinski, submitted for publication. Complementing these other studies, the findings described here show that the catalytic domain can control the potency of PMA for driving translocation. Not surprisingly, phosphorylation has emerged as an important mechanism of PKC regulation (17Newton A.C. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation provides negative charges on the so-called activation loop of PKC that is necessary for enzymatic activity (34Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This transphosphorylation is followed by two autophosphorylation steps. Both occur on the C terminus of the enzyme, further stabilizing the catalytically active conformation and also making the enzyme soluble (18Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies support a role for phosphorylation in determining the localization of PKCε, with PMA changing the proportion of the higher mobility isoform of PKCx/ε chimeras in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. At the same time the localization patterns of these chimeras depend on the regulatory domain. The fact that the phosphorylation state of PKCs as well as PKC chimeras can change after PMA treatment emphasizes that protein phosphatases may play a cell-specific role in targeting different PKCs during translocation. PMA translocates chimeras that have the same regulatory domains but different catalytic domains with potencies that differ by an order of magnitude. Phorbol esters bind to the C1 domains of PKC providing a hydrophobic cap over a hydrophilic cleft (11Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). At the same time their side chains contribute to stabilizing the enzyme at the membrane. Our results suggest that binding of PMA reveals other site(s) that facilitate(s) translocation (shift in ED50) and that play(s) a role in targeting PKC to separate subcellular sites (translocation of PKCx/ε chimeras to the insoluble fraction)."
https://openalex.org/W1494647147,"Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to study conformation and aggregation of the synthetic β-amyloid peptide, residues 1–40 (βA4), as a function of concentration and sample aging. All mass spectra showed a major envelope of peaks corresponding to charge states of 7–3 of the monomeric form of βA4. In addition, weaker envelopes of peaks corresponding to charge states of dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric βA4 species were seen under gentle ionization conditions. The average charge state of the envelope associated with the monomeric form decreased by ca. 0.5 z as samples were aged, indicating that the relatively open form (likely random coil) of the peptide was modified into the more compact form (likely β-sheet) as a function of sample aging. The aggregate forms became weaker and ultimately were absent both in the more dilute solutions and in aged aliquots of the concentrated sample. These aggregates were interpreted as assemblies of the random coil form. We interpret our inability to see an ion envelope that can be associated with aggregates of the β-sheet form to be a consequence of the presumed very compact nature of this form. A model for the formation of βA4 fibrils is proposed and discussed.—Chen, X. G., Brining, S. K., Nguyen, V. Q., Yergey, A. L.

The versatile properties of the flavin prosthetic group located in the active site of flavoenzymes have been successfully used over the years to study enzymatic redox mechanisms, including flavin-mediated activation of molecular oxygen (1Massey V.

Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. Chapman and Hall, London1995: 37-83Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the spectral redox properties and the reactivity of the flavin can be greatly manipulated by its modification with various chemical groups, a feature that has been particularly useful for structure functional analysis of flavoproteins (3Ghisla S.

Flavoproteins also can be suitable models to study certain basic problems, such as protein stability, folding, and the effect of site-directed mutagenesis on protein conformation, since even the fine structural rearrangements within the protein active site can affect the flavin microenvironment and therefore be detected by perturbation of the binding mode and the spectral properties of the flavin. Recently, we employed this concept to demonstrate that glycerol, acting in vitro as a chemical chaperone, can assist in the proper refolding of the flavoprotein l-amino acid oxidase from its compact equilibrium intermediates and suggested the hydrophobic effect as a dominating force in this process (9Raibekas A.A. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7546-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to further investigate whether glycerol, in a similar manner, can induce proper adjustments of protein conformation perturbed by site-directed mutagenesis, using a His-307 → Leu (H307L) recombinant mutant of pig kidney d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) 1The abbreviations used are: DAAO,d-amino acid oxidase; H307L, His-307 → Leu; bis-ANS, bis-(5,5′)-8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPB, sodium pyrophosphate buffer.

His-307 is one of two residues (the other is Tyr-228) undergoing affinity labeling with thed-propargylglycine-suicide substrate of pig kidney DAAO (11Horiike K. Nishina Y. Miyake Y. Yamano T. J.

Curti B. Ghisla S. Yagi K. Yamano T. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1980: 511-515Google Scholar). Furthermore, the replacement of His-307 with Leu greatly reduces the protein affinity for FAD so that DAAO can be isolated only as an inactive apoprotein (14Watanabe F. Fukui K. Momoi K. Miyake Y. J.

Although this is an indication that the presence of His-307 is important for protein-flavin interactions, the role of this residue remains vague (15Miyano M. Fukui K. Watanabe F. Takahashi S. Tada M.

The recently determined crystal structure of pig kidney DAAO shows that although His-307 is located in the flavin binding domain it is not closely positioned toward FAD (16Mattevi A.

The purity of enzyme was estimated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature ( Lond. ). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Absorbance data were obtained using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. The concentration of the wild type DAAO was estimated based on its extinction coefficient of 11,300m−1 cm−1 per enzyme-bound flavin at 455 nm (21Ghisla S. Massey V. Lhoste J.M. Mayhew S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The concentration of the wild type apoprotein and H307L DAAO was estimated based on their absorbance at 278 nm (A1 cm0.1% = 1.95) (22Curti B. Ronchi S. Branzoli U. Ferri G. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The concentration of the 8-mercapto-FAD was estimated based on its extinction coefficient of 29,700 m−1cm−1 at 535 nm (23Massey V. Ghisla S. Moore E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9640-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 8-mercapto-FAD was prepared by reaction of 8-chloro-FAD with Na2S in 100 mmpotassium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, at room temperature (23Massey V. Ghisla S. Moore E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9640-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used immediately in reconstitution experiments. The concentration of bis-ANS was estimated based on its extinction coefficient of 16,790m−1 cm−1 at 385 nm (24Farris F.J. Weber G. Chiang C.C. Paul I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 4469-4474Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The specific oxidase activity of enzyme with d-phenylglycine as a substrate was measured spectrophotometrically at pH 8.5 and 25 °C (19Pollegioni L. Fukui K. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31666-31673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed using a ratio-recording spectrofluorimeter built at the University of Michigan by Gordon Ford and Dr. David P. Ballou. The DAAO (holoenzyme, apoprotein, and mutant) preparations were digested with trypsin, and the tryptic digests were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteolysis was conducted for 3 h at 25 °C using a protease to substrate ratio (w/w) of 1:10 as described previously (25Tarelli G.T. Vanoni M.A. Negri A. Curti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21242-21246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the 1-h tryptic digestion was conducted at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and with the protease to substrate ratio of 1:20. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/15 (v/v) of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in isopropanol. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Schagger and von Jagow (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). After the protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was complete, the targeted peptide band was excised and extracted from the gel in a manner similar to that described by Rosenfeld et al. (27Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) and then subjected to N-terminal sequence or mass analysis. In another set of experiments, the SDS-PAGE-separated peptides were electroblotted from the gel to Trans-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The bands of interest were excised from the membrane and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Peptide sequencing was performed by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477 gas-phase sequenator at the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis (MALDI) was performed with a Vestec-2000 mass spectrometer at the same facilities. H307L DAAO was purified from 40–50 g ofE. coli cell paste according to the standard procedure (15Miyano M. Fukui K. Watanabe F. Takahashi S. Tada M. Kanashiro M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and generally yielded 5–7 mg of pure 39-kDa polypeptide as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein contained no flavin prosthetic group as judged by its absorbance spectrum, which is in agreement with data reported earlier (15Miyano M. Fukui K. Watanabe F. Takahashi S. Tada M. Kanashiro M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the protein displayed no activity, up to 7% of its catalytic activity was recovered when a sample was preincubated with FAD at room temperature (Fig. 1 A). Subsequently, the protein was incubated with FAD and various concentrations of glycerol, followed by activity measurements (see Fig. 1 A legend for details). It should be noted that the final concentration of glycerol in the assay mixture was always less than 1%. Fig. 1 A illustrates a dramatic increase in the H307L DAAO activity with the corresponding increase in glycerol concentration (5–40%, v/v) resulting in a recovery of up to 50% activity as compared with that of the wild type enzyme. The 15-min preincubation with FAD at room temperature was found to be appropriate to yield a maximum DAAO activity for each concentration of glycerol used in the preincubation mixture (data not shown). These results suggested that glycerol could have a restorative effect on the conformation of the H307L DAAO flavin binding site, which had been perturbed by mutagenesis. In fact, the strength of the protein-flavin interactions was dramatically increased in the presence of glycerol. As a result, the dissociation constant was exponentially changed from 133 μm down to 8 μm in the 0–20% region of glycerol concentration (Fig. 1 B). The glycerol-dependent increase in the flavin binding to the protein in the presence of an excess of FAD resulted in an estimated 0.56 mol of bound FAD per mol of protein in 20% glycerol (data not shown). Therefore, the recovery in the H307L DAAO activity corresponded to the increased amount of protein-bound flavin at these experimental conditions, suggesting that while the conformation of the DAAO flavin binding site was perturbed by mutation, this perturbation tended to become negligible in the presence of glycerol and FAD. The glycerol-induced activation and flavin binding were fully reversible processes, i.e. when glycerol and the excess of FAD were removed from the sample solution by dialysis, the resulting protein contained no flavin and displayed no activity, but could be reactivated again in the presence of FAD and glycerol. To obtain more information about the structural characteristics of H307L DAAO in comparison with those of the wild type enzyme, we tested susceptibility toward proteolytic attack with trypsin followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. In fact, a clear difference was observed after 1 h of proteolysis at 37 °C in the absence of FAD, resulting in the appearance of an additional 5-kDa band in H307L DAAO digest but not in that of wild type apoprotein (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 8). When 15 min of incubation with FAD (no glycerol) was introduced prior to digestion, the resulting digest of the reconstituted apoprotein displayed a pattern characteristic of the holoenzyme (25Tarelli G.T. Vanoni M.A. Negri A. Curti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21242-21246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consisting of major 25- and 14-kDa fragments, and a minor 13-kDa peptide (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5 and 9), whereas the digested mutant displayed a mixed apo- and holoenzyme pattern, including the presence of the distinguishing 5-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). In contrast, tryptic digestion of the mutant enzyme in the presence of FAD and 20% glycerol showed the characteristic holoenzyme pattern with the 5-kDa peptide no longer present in the digest (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). In a separate experiment (Fig. 2 B), the digestion of H307L DAAO was conducted at 25 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of glycerol (0, 10, and 20%) with or without FAD, clearly demonstrating the glycerol-dependent transition of H307L DAAO from the perturbed binding site toward its native-like conformation. The N-terminal sequence of the 13- and 14-kDa fragments derived from the digestion of the enzyme in its native conformation was determined as GIYNSP (see details under “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that both peptides were generated as a result of the tryptic cut at Arg-221 similar to that reported earlier for wild type holoenzyme (25Tarelli G.T. Vanoni M.A. Negri A. Curti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21242-21246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the 5-kDa fragment generated solely during the H307L DAAO digestion was also produced as a result of the same cut at Arg-221 based on its N-terminal sequence analysis. Subsequently, the peptide molecular weight of 4908 daltons was determined by MALDI analysis. The fragment of this particular size (theoretically the calculated value is 4907.48) can be generated only if the second cleavage site is Arg-265 based on the known DAAO primary structure (28Ronchi S. Minchiotti L. Galliano M. Curti B. Swenson R.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8824-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data suggest that while H307L DAAO has a perturbed structure, which results in a weaker mode of protein-flavin interaction and an enhanced proteolytic susceptibility of the C-terminal protein half near Arg-265, adjustment toward the holoenzyme-like conformation can be achieved in the presence of FAD and glycerol. Although the tryptic digestion of H307L DAAO in the absence of FAD was somewhat dependent on the concentration of glycerol present in the incubation mixture in a way that the 5-kDa band became less prominent (Fig. 2 B), the difference in digestion patterns was not as pronounced as that affected by both glycerol and flavin. To further investigate the structural differences between mutant and wild type DAAO and the restorative effect of glycerol in the absence of FAD we performed a comparative study of the protein surface conformation using bis-ANS as a hydrophobic fluorescent probe (29Musci G. Metz G.D. Tsunematsu H. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2034-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bis-ANS has been shown to display a higher affinity toward proteins than its monomeric form, ANS (29Musci G. Metz G.D. Tsunematsu H. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2034-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ANS binding in the active site of pig kidney DAAO (1 mol of dye per mol of protein) has been previously demonstrated (30Naoi M. Kotaki A. Yagi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1973; 74: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The difference in the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to either H307L DAAO or wild type apoprotein is shown in Fig. 3. The titration of 1 μm bis-ANS with the protein in the absence of glycerol resulted in an increase of the bis-ANS fluorescence, which corresponds to the amount of the protein-bound probe under these experimental conditions. The titration curves reached near saturation at 3 μm protein concentration, indicating that most of the probe was bound to the protein (Fig. 3 A). The stoichiometric binding of probe (i.e. one accessible bis-ANS binding site) to either protein was estimated based on the intercept of two lines drawn from the initial and final close to linear segments of the saturation curve. The dissociation constant (Kd) values for bis-ANS binding estimated as 0.53 and 0.59 μmfor H307L DAAO and wild type apoDAAO, respectively, were quite similar. However, the fluorescence intensity of the probe bound to the mutant was about 40% lower than that found with the wild type apoprotein. Different results were obtained when the same experiment was conducted in the presence of 20% (v/v) glycerol (Fig. 3 B). Both titration curves failed to show saturation behavior, i.e.there was a weaker protein-to-probe affinity. The curve fit analysis resulted in Kdappvalues to be at least 4-fold higher for the samples containing 20% glycerol (data not shown). Furthermore, the difference in the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to either H307L DAAO or wild type apoprotein in 20% glycerol was about 50% less than that obtained without glycerol. It must be noted that the shape and the maxima of the fluorescence emission spectra were indistinguishable in the case of probe bound to either mutant or wild type apoprotein (data not shown). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate the differences in conformation between mutant and wild type apoprotein, indicating a greater polarity of the microenvironment around the mutant-bound probe (31Turner D.C. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3381-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). On the other hand, they also suggest two different events occurring after both proteins were placed in 20% glycerol. First, there was a reduction in the difference between the two protein conformations. Second, the bis-ANS binding site itself became less hydrophobic with either protein, indicating reduced accessibility of some site-contributed nonpolar amino acid residues. To determine whether bis-ANS was bound at/near the DAAO flavin binding site, we conducted a “competition” experiment in the presence of bis-ANS and 8-mercapto-FAD. The latter was chosen instead of FAD due to its ability to generate a longer wavelength absorbance spectrum (maximum at 595 nm) upon binding to the DAAO apoprotein (32Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DAAO apoprotein (3 μm) preincubated with various (0–100 μm) bis-ANS concentrations was mixed with 6 μm 8-mercapto-FAD, and the flavin binding process was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 650 nm during 30 min of incubation at 18 °C. As shown in the Fig. 4, bis-ANS effectively competed for the flavin binding site of DAAO, resulting in over 60% reduction in the amount of protein-bound flavin in the presence of 14 μmbis-ANS. No binding of 8-mercapto-FAD to the protein was observed when the bis-ANS concentration in the incubation mixture was increased up to 100 μm. The correlation between the glycerol-mediated reduction in the bis-ANS-accessible hydrophobic area of H307L DAAO and the increase in its flavin affinity prompted us to further investigate the possible relationship between the strength of the protein internal hydrophobic interactions and protein-flavin interactions. The H307L DAAO preincubated at 18 °C with an excess of 8-mercapto-FAD and 0–40% (v/v) glycerol was placed at 0 °C with subsequent re-incubation at 18 °C. Fig. 5 shows the effect of both glycerol and the temperature transition on the flavin binding. As anticipated, the amount of protein-bound flavin analogue at 18 °C was dependent upon glycerol concentration and reached about 0.8 mol per mol of protein in 40% glycerol, giving a higher value than that estimated in the case of FAD in 20% glycerol (see above). This is likely to be an effect of the higher glycerol concentration and/or due to the fact that 8-mercapto-FAD displays a higher affinity toward the DAAO apoprotein as compared with that of the native FAD (32Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A significant decrease in the protein-flavin interaction was observed when the temperature of the sample was lowered to ∼0 °C. The observed effect was a reversible process, resulting in complete recovery of initial flavin binding after the temperature was raised back to 18 °C. The low temperature-induced decrease in the flavin affinity was clearly dependent on the presence of glycerol in the sample solution and completely prevented in 40% glycerol. It is known that lower temperatures can have a destabilizing effect on protein conformation and in certain cases can lead to cold denaturation, which appears to be a result of a partial disruption of the protein internal hydrophobic network caused by the hydration of nonpolar groups (33Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been previously suggested that the stabilizing and chaperone-like effects of glycerol on protein conformation in vitro are due to its preferential exclusion from the protein-solvent interface that, in turn, would favor strengthening of protein internal nonpolar interactions (9Raibekas A.A. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7546-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 35Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4677-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 36Raibekas A.A. Massey V. Flavins and Flavoproteins.in: Stevenson K. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. University of Calgary Press, Canada1997Google Scholar). Hence, in the case of H307L DAAO it is reasonable that (i) the observed decrease in protein-flavin interactions was due to a conformational change resulting from the low temperature perturbation of the protein internal hydrophobic network, and (ii) this reversible process tended to become negligible with increased glycerol concentration as a result of the strengthening of protein internal hydrophobicity and was accompanied by glycerol-induced reduction in the solvent-accessible (external) protein hydrophobic area. Taken together, our data suggest the existence of a direct relationship between increase in the strength of protein internal hydrophobicity and flavin affinity and support the idea of hydrophobic force being a predominant factor in the glycerol-assisted process of rearrangement of the H307L DAAO molecule toward its holoenzyme-like conformation. Since the crystal structure of pig kidney DAAO has been solved recently at 2.6 Å resolution (16Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we were able to obtain additional information regarding His-307 and its vicinity as illustrated in Fig. 6. His-307 is located on the protein C-terminal β-strand (βF6), which is a part of the six-stranded β-sheet and the flavin binding domain (16Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although the minimal distance between this residue and FAD (the adenylate portion) is about 12 Å, close inspection reveals that the replacement of the polar His-307 with a nonpolar residue such as Leu could have a destabilizing effect on the proper configuration of the flavin binding domain. His-307 is surrounded by a polar Asn-180 (βF4), Arg-290 (loop) and Glu-294 (βF5) within van der Waals distance (2.9–3.3 Å). The polar nature of this particular site would imply its solvent accessibility, which is consistent with an ability of His-307 to be targeted and labeled by DAAO-reactive agents such as d-propargylglycine (13Ronchi S. Minchiotti L. Galliano M. Curti B. Ghisla S. Yagi K. Yamano T. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1980: 511-515Google Scholar) and 9-azidoacridine (37Nicholson B.H. Batra S.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Moreover, the above mentioned Asn-180, Arg-290, Glu-294, and His-307 itself are conserved residues based on the amino acid sequence comparison of d-amino acid oxidases from various sources such as yeast, fungus, and mammals (38Faotto L. Pollegioni L. Ceciliani F. Ronchi S. Pilone M.S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1995; 17: 193-198Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other side, there is a nonpolar cluster, 3.7–6.8 Å away from His-307 that is represented by Phe-167, Leu-296, and Val-305. Hence, the incorporation of Leu in place of His-307 may preclude proper establishment of the polar site hydrogen bonding network and at the same time create the possibility for Leu to be accommodated into the neighboring nonpolar region. Finally, the C-terminal His-307-containing β-strand (βF6) is followed by a loop, so there is a possibility that the mutation could indirectly cause a loop distortion. In fact, this loop contains two of the earlier proposed flavin-interacting (His-311) and active site (Gly-313) residues (16Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated the restorative effect of glycerol on the conformation of pig kidney d-amino acid oxidase perturbed by site-directed mutagenesis. The data reported here are consistent with recent findings, suggesting that (i) glycerol may act as a chemical chaperone in various protein model systems (9Raibekas A.A. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7546-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and (ii) the hydrophobic force is a key factor in the glycerol-assisted process of adjustment of the protein molecule toward its native conformation (9Raibekas A.A. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7546-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also have attributed the perturbation of the flavin binding site of H307L DAAO to the nonpolar nature of the mutation whose negative impact on the protein structure can be overcome by glycerol-induced strengthening of protein internal hydrophobic interactions."

The autoimmune anti-L7 response develops high titers and switches from the oligoclonal high affinity recognition of one major epitope to the polyclonal low affinity recognition of various minor epitopes (“epitope spreading”) during the active phase of systemic lupus erythematosus. This suggests that autoimmunogenic L7 is released during such phases and stimulates normally silent B-lymphocyte clones expressing low affinity antigen receptors (12Neu, E., Hemmerich, P., Peter, H. H., Krawinkel, U., and von Mikecz, A. (1997) Arthritis Rheum., in press.Google Scholar). In this context, we study the functions of protein L7 with the intention to elucidate potentially autoimmunogenic mechanisms (13Tan E.M. Adv.

To understand the biological function of protein L7 we employed yeast two-hybrid selection (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) to identify ribosomal protein S7 and the multi-zinc finger protein ZNF7 as proteins that specifically interact with L7. Complexes of L7 with S7 and, respectively, ZNF7 apparently exist in lymphoid cells, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These and previous findings (3Hemmerich P. von Mikecz A. Neumann F.

Manipulations ofEscherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nucleic acids, and proteins were performed as described (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study was kindly donated by E. A. Golemis (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) and has been described previously (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 17Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 20.1.1-20.1.28Google Scholar). We employed yeast strain S. cerevisiae EGY48, which contained for selection the reporter plasmid pJk103 (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) pEG202 (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) was used as an expression vector for constructing LexA-fused bait proteins. pLexA-L7 expresses LexA fused to the full-length coding sequence of human ribosomal protein L7. pLexA-L71–124 and pLexA-L7125–248 express the 124 N-terminal amino acids or, respectively, the 124 C-terminal amino acids of L7, fused to LexA. PCR was used to prepare DNA fragments that contained 5′ EcoRI and 3′ XhoI sites. These fragments were treated with EcoRI and XhoI and were ligated into pEG202. Recombinant plasmids were amplified inE. coli, and the integrity and orientation of their cDNA inserts were verified by nucleotide sequencing. 500 μg of total RNA were isolated from 1 × 108 Jurkat cells (RNeasy, QIAGEN, Hilden, FRG). 7 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were obtained from total RNA (Oligotex, QIAGEN), and cDNA was prepared (cDNA Synthesis kit, Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG) according to the instructions of the suppliers. The resulting cDNA was size-fractionated using a Sephacryl S-500 spin column. Fractions containing cDNA molecules larger than 700 base pairs were pooled, unidirectionally ligated into pJG4–5 (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), cut with EcoRI and XhoI, and used to transform E. coli XL2-blue MRF′ (Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were pooled, resulting in a cDNA library comprising 2 × 106 independent clones. Inserts ranged from 700 to 3500 base pairs with an average length of 1200 base pairs. S. cerevisiae EGY48, containing pJK103 and pLexL7, was transformed with the library. Approximately 2 × 107 transformants were plated on synthetic medium lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (17Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

These were tested in a filter assay (18Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) for activation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ). From colonies that activated both the leu2 reporter gene (required in the biosynthetic pathway for leucine) and the lacZ reporter gene, library plasmids were rescued (17Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 20.1.1-20.1.28Google Scholar). Inserts were amplified by PCR, followed by restriction mapping of the product with enzymesAluI and HaeIII, and assigned to classes according to their restriction map pattern. At least two cDNAs from each class were partially sequenced. Rescued library plasmids of S7 and ZNF791–687 were retransformed into EGY48/pJK103, containing as baits either pRFHM1 (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), which encodes the homeodomain of bicoid, or pLexA-myc (19Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which encodes the carboxyl-terminal 176 amino acids of human c-Myc. Transformants were assayed forleu2 and lacZ activity. DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method using [α-35S]dATP and Sequenase DNA polymerase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence analysis and homology searches were performed using the GCG program package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Secondary structure predictions of proteins were performed using the PSA algorithm (20Stultz C.M. White J.V. Smith T.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Predictions of probabilities for putative coiled coil regions were performed with the program Coils (21Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). The width of the chosen window was 14 amino acids. Full-length HisL7 was prepared as described (5Witte S. Neumann F. Krawinkel U. Przybylski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18171-18175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and further purified by HPLC on a C4 reversed-phase column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). To produce HisS7, the full-length human S7 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers designed to provide BamHI andXhoI sites for subcloning (5′-GCCTTGGATCCGCCATGTTCAGTTCGAGC-3′ for sense primer and 5′-GGCGGCTCGAGTTACAATTGAAACTCTGG-3′ for antisense primer). To produce HisZNF791–687, the human ZNF7 cDNA isolated in the screen was amplified by PCR using primers again providingBamHI and XhoI sites for subcloning (5′-AAGGATCCACCATGGAGCAGGCCTGTGAGGACA-3′ for sense primer and 5′-CGCCTCGAGCTATCCCATGTGAATTTTTTG-3′ for antisense primer). PCR products were digested with BamHI andXhoI and ligated into pRSETA (Invitrogen, Heidelberg, FRG). Recombinant plasmids pHisS7 and pHisZNF791–687 were amplified in E. coli, and the integrity and orientation of their cDNA inserts were verified by nucleotide sequencing. HisS7 and HisZNF791–687 were purified from bacterial lysates as described (5Witte S. Neumann F. Krawinkel U. Przybylski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18171-18175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HisS7 was further purified by HPLC on a C4 reversed-phase column. Protein concentrations were determined photometrically (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to determine their purity. The purity of the preparations of HisL7 and HisS7 was >95%, and in the case of HisZNF791–687 it was >80%. Apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of L7-ZNF7 and L7-S7 dimers were determined essentially as described previously (5Witte S. Neumann F. Krawinkel U. Przybylski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18171-18175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by measuring the binding of [35S]cysteine-labeled ZNF791–687 to immobilized HisL7 or by measuring the binding of [35S]methionine-labeled L7 to immobilized HisS7. 35S-Labeled proteins were produced using the TNT coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the instructions of the supplier. Plasmids used here were phumL7–14 (3Hemmerich P. von Mikecz A. Neumann F. Sözeri O. Wolff-Vorbeck G. Zoebelein R. Krawinkel U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), for radiolabeled L7, and pSK-ZNF7791–687. To produce pSK-ZNF7791–687, the BamHI and XhoI fragment from pHisZNF791–687 was subcloned into vector pSK II (Stratagene, Heidelberg). Antibodies against human proteins were generated using standard immunization protocols (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-HisL7 antibodies were raised in chickens, and the antibodies were purified from egg yolk (24Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Weiser T. Hübscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In immunoblot analyses, this antiserum recognized a protein band that displayed the electrophoretic mobility of L7. Antibodies against HisZNF791–687 and against the ovalbumin-coupled peptide sequence CGRIHTGEKPYKG (anti-ZNF7PEP) that represents the conserved spacer sequence between zinc finger domains in ZNF7 and many other human zinc finger proteins were raised in rabbits. Both antisera recognized on immunoblots of cell lysates a band with the predicted electrophoretic mobility of ZNF7 (78 kDa) and two additional bands of 55 and 57 kDa, respectively. Polyclonal rabbit anti-S7 serum (25Lutsch G. Stahl J. Kärgel H.-J. Noll F. Bielka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 140-150PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from J. Stahl (Max-Delbrück-Center, Berlin). Polyclonal rabbit anti-LexA antibodies were a gift from E. A. Golemis. Polyclonal mouse anti HisL7 antibodies were a gift from A. Hohlbaum (Universität Konstanz, Konstanz, FRG). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 107 Molt-4 T lymphoma cells were lysed in TSA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Debris was pelleted, and the lysate was precleared overnight with 50 μl of activated, quenched Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). The precleared extracts were then precipitated with 300 μl of anti-HisL7 serum, or with 300 μl of preimmune serum, both sera immobilized on Sepharose 4B. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed twice with TSA buffer, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and once with TSA buffer. The beads were eluted with nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the immunoblots were incubated with the various antibodies employing standard procedures. Super Signal chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) were used for the detection of signals. Ribosomes from 5 × 106 Jurkat T lymphoma cells were prepared, fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (membranes a kind gift from J. Horwath, Universität Konstanz, Konstanz, FRG), which were treated as described above. To identify proteins, which potentially interact with protein L7 in vivo, we performed interaction screening using the yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast reporter strain EGY48 containing thelacZ reporter plasmid pJK103 was transformed with the plasmid pLexA-L7, which encodes full-length protein L7 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain. Fig. 1 verifies the correct expression of fusion proteins containing the LexA DNA-binding domain fused to protein L7 and fragments thereof. Immunoblots of yeast homogenates transformed with the indicated plasmids and probed with anti-L7 and anti-LexA antibodies showed bands of the expected size (52 kDa for LexA-L7, 38 kDa for LexA-L71–124, and 37 kDa for LexA-L7125–248). None of the bait plasmids alone activated the leu2 or thelacZ reporter gene, respectively (data not shown). To confirm that the LexA-L7 fusion proteins were synthesized in yeast and that the LexA domains are fully functional to bind to LexA operator sequences, we performed a repression assay (17Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 20.1.1-20.1.28Google Scholar) (data not shown). To screen the Jurkat T lymphoma cDNA library, the EGY48/pJK103/pLexA-L7 cells were transformed with the library plasmids. Approximately 2 × 107 yeast transformants were screened. 173 colonies grew on leucine-free galactose plates and displayed β-galactosidase activity. Of these, 61 showed strong galactose-inducible activity of both reporter genes. Library plasmid DNA was prepared from these positive colonies. Their inserts were amplified by PCR followed by restriction mapping of the product with endonucleases AluI and HaeIII (not shown). Inserts isolated independently at least twice were assigned to seven groups according to the size of the insert and its restriction site pattern. The inserts of at least two cDNAs from each group were then partially sequenced. The two most abundant cDNAs could be matched to known sequences in the data base; 12 independently isolated cDNAs (restriction group 1) coded for the multi-zinc finger protein ZNF7 (26Lania L. Donti E. Pannuti A. Pacucci A. Pengue G. Feliciello I. La Mantia G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.-G. Genomics. 1990; 6: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with the longest cDNA encoding amino acids 91–687, comprising the C-terminal domain of 15 subsequent zinc finger domains. The full-length cDNA coding for ribosomal protein S7 (27Annilo T. Laan M. Stahl J. Metspalu A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 165: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was independently isolated seven times (restriction group 2). Restriction group 3 (six isolated cDNAs) turned out to be the cDNA for ribosomal protein S5 in a wrong reading frame. The remaining four restriction groups, consisting of 2–4 cDNAs, coded for as yet unidentified C2H2 zinc finger proteins, which could not be assigned to any sequence in the data base. This study focuses on the characterization of the abundant cDNAs of proteins S7 and ZNF7 as potential L7 interactors. To confirm the specificity of the interactions of S7 and ZNF7 with protein L7, we retransformed the isolated library plasmids into EGY/pJK103, containing bait plasmids that encoded LexA fused to protein L7, to the homeodomain of drosophila bicoid, to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the human c-Myc protein. We then assayed for the activation of both reporter genes. The interaction of S7 and ZNF791–687 with protein L7 turned out to be specific, in that only cotransformation of the L7 bait lead to the activation of both reporter genes (Table I).Table IInteraction of protein L7 with proteins S7 and ZNF7 using a yeast two-hybrid systempEG202 insert (“bait”)pJG4–5 insert (“prey”)Growth on leucine minus mediumColony color in filter assayGalactoseGlucoseGalactoseGlucoseL7S7+−BlueWhiteBicoidS7−−WhiteWhitec-MycS7−−WhiteWhiteL7ZNF791–687+−BlueWhiteBicoidZNF791–687−−WhiteWhitec-MycZNF791–687−−WhiteWhiteL71–124S7+−BlueWhiteL71–124ZNF791–687+−BlueWhiteL7125–248S7−−WhiteWhiteL7125–248ZNF791–687−−WhiteWhiteThe activation of the leu2 reporter gene was monitored by growth on leucine-deficient medium, and the activity of thelacZ reporter gene was monitored using a filter assay (blue colonies).

Open table in a new tab The activation of the leu2 reporter gene was monitored by growth on leucine-deficient medium, and the activity of thelacZ reporter gene was monitored using a filter assay (blue colonies). Expression of the prey protein was induced by adding galactose to the medium. To determine the region of L7 mediating the interaction of L7 with S7 or ZNF7, we transformed the library plasmids of the latter proteins into EGY/pJK103 containing bait plasmids coding for LexA fused to full-length protein L7 (pLexA-L7), the N-terminal half of protein L7 (comprising residues 1–124 (pLexA-L71–124)), or the C-terminal half of L7 (comprising residues 125–248 (pLexA-L7125–248)). As shown in Table I, the N-terminal region of protein L7 is fully sufficient to activate both the leu2 reporter gene and β-galactosidase activity. No activation of the reporter genes was observed with the pLexA-L7125–248 bait. The interface on protein L7 that interacts with S7 and ZNF7 thus resides between residues 1 and 124. The interaction of S7 and ZNF7 with L7 was further characterized by determination of the dissociation constants of the S7-L7 and the ZNF7-L7 complexes. Dissociation constants were determined utilizing a binding assay employing oligohistidine-tagged proteins immobilized on a Ni2+-chelate column at different concentrations. Immobilized HisL7 was incubated with 35S-labeled ZNF791–687 at a starting concentration of 3.5 × 10−5m. Immobilized HisS7 was incubated with35S-labeled L7 at the same starting concentration. For both immobilized proteins, we utilized radiolabeled luciferase as a control ligand. The columns were washed with a total of 15 batch volumes of binding buffer, and the fractions of column-bound and eluted ligand were determined for increasing dilutions of HisL7 and HisS7 (Fig. 2). For both proteins a lowest concentration of approximately 25 × Kd was found that provided nearly complete retention of liquid phase radiolabeled ligand; hence, Kd values of 2 nm for the L7-ZNF7 interaction (Fig. 2 B) and of 15 nm for the L7-S7 interaction (Fig. 2 A) were estimated. No retention of radiolabeled luciferase as an irrelevant protein was observed on the HisL7 or HisS7 column. Having demonstrated the interaction of ribosomal protein S7 and ZNF7 with ribosomal proteinin vitro as well as in the yeast two-hybrid system, we further examined the association of these proteins in a lymphoid cell line. We immunoprecipitated the total cell lysate of MOLT-4 cells with an immobilized polyclonal chicken anti-L7 antibody. The precipitate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using for detection mouse anti-L7 antibodies, rabbit anti-S7 antibodies, and rabbit anti-ZNF7 antibodies and an unrelated antibody as a control. As shown in Fig. 3 A, protein bands with the predicted electrophoretic mobility of proteins L7 (lane 1), S7 (lane 2), and ZNF7 (lanes 3 and 4) could be detected in the precipitate, thus indicating co-precipitation with ribosomal protein L7. No signal was found either with the unrelated control antibody (lane 5) or in a control precipitation with immobilized preimmune serum (lanes 6–10). The association of ZNF7 with ribosomes was examined by immunoblotting of Jurkat T lymphoma ribosomes and visualization of ribosome-bound ZNF7 by anti-ZNF7 antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Anti-L7 (lane 1) and anti-S7 antibodies (lane 2) served as a control for the preparation of ribosomal fractions. Lanes 3 and 4 show that a protein band with the predicted molecular mass of ZNF7 could be clearly detected by the two available anti-ZNF7 antibodies in preparations of ribosomes. The anti-ZNF7 antibody (lane 3), raised against recombinant ZNF7, detected an additional cross-reactive protein band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa, which was not detected by the anti-ZNFPEP antibody (lane 4). ZNF7 thus can exist in a ribosome-associated form. In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify from a Jurkat T lymphoma cDNA library ribosomal protein S7 and multi-zinc finger protein ZNF7 as proteins that interact with ribosomal protein L7. Co-immunoprecipitation of both proteins with an anti-L7 antibody from the lysate of the MOLT-4 cell-line and dissociation constants of 15 nm for the S7-L7 interaction and 2 nm for the ZNF7-L7 interaction confirmed the potential in vivo interaction of these proteins. Our results show that the N-terminal half of L7, comprising residues 1–124 is fully sufficient to mediate the interaction with both S7 and ZNF7, respectively. Protein S7 consists of 194 amino acids, has a predicted molecular mass of 22 kDa, and is, like protein L7, very basic (pI of S7: 10.6) (27Annilo T. Laan M. Stahl J. Metspalu A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 165: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,28Wool I.G. Chan Y. Glück A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Protein S7 has been shown to be located at the back lobe of the small 40 S subunit of eucaryotic ribosomes (24Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Weiser T. Hübscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Together with ribosomal proteins S3, S3a, S14, and S15, it plays an important role in the biogenesis of the 40 S small ribosomal subunit (29Mundus D.A. Bulygin K.N. Venyaminova A.G. Vladimirov S.N. Vratskikh L.V. Repkova M.N. Yamkovoi V.S. Karpova G.G. Mol. Biol. 1993; 27: 91-95Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein L7 is located at the surface of the large 60 S ribosomal subunit (30Kisilevsky R. Gore J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 910: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31Marion M.-J. Marion C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), to which it associates in the cytoplasm (32Hadjiolov A.A. The Nucleolus and Ribosome Biogenesis. Cell, 1985Crossref Google Scholar). The 50 C-terminal residues of protein L7 carry a RNA-binding domain that binds with high affinity to 28 S rRNA (4Hemmerich P. Bosbach S. von Mikecz A. Krawinkel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The N-terminal BZIP-like domain of L7 is thought to be exposed to the cytoplasm due to its ability to bind mRNAs with high affinity (3Hemmerich P. von Mikecz A. Neumann F. Sözeri O. Wolff-Vorbeck G. Zoebelein R. Krawinkel U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Hemmerich P. Bosbach S. von Mikecz A. Krawinkel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and because of cross-linking and labeling experiments (31Marion M.-J. Marion C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Lin A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This domain also carries the immunodominant autoepitope of protein L7 (12Neu, E., Hemmerich, P., Peter, H. H., Krawinkel, U., and von Mikecz, A. (1997) Arthritis Rheum., in press.Google Scholar). These findings and the data presented in this study suggest that the interaction of protein S7 with the N-terminal half of protein L7 is important for the interaction of the small 40 S and the large 60 S ribosomal subunit during the translation of mRNAs. This is supported by the finding that ribosomal protein L7 could be in situ chemically cross-linked to both the 28 S rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit and to the 18 S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit (34Nygard O. Nika H. EMBO. J. 1982; 1: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions performed on the amino acid sequence of protein S7 suggest that it has, like protein L7, mainly an α-helical conformation (Fig. 4 A). A prediction of putative coiled-coil regions in S7 shows a high probability (>90%) for such a domain between amino acids 29 and 50 of protein S7 (Fig. 4 B). This region shows also a high probability for an α-helical conformation, which is required for a coiled-coil structure. Within this predicted amphipathic helix are two leucine repeats in the D position of the helix (residues 36 and 43) and hydrophobic residues in the A position of the helix (residues 40 and 47). In a previous study, we have shown that a putative coiled-coil region, located in the first N-terminal α-helix of protein L7, is capable of forming leucine zipper-like homodimers (5Witte S. Neumann F. Krawinkel U. Przybylski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18171-18175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the interaction of proteins L7 and S7 is mediated by the BZIP-like domain of L7 and the putative leucine zipper domain of protein S7. ZNF7 is a transcription factor-like multi-zinc finger protein consisting of 687 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 78 kDa. It is widely expressed in various cell lines. The protein consists of 15 C2H2 zinc finger domains that comprise nearly 70% of the protein (26Lania L. Donti E. Pannuti A. Pacucci A. Pengue G. Feliciello I. La Mantia G. Lanfrancone L.

The finger domains share 70% sequence similarity and conform almost exactly to the consensus sequence of DNA- and RNA-binding zinc fingers (35Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition to the nucleic acid binding properties of zinc finger domains, zinc finger-mediated protein protein interactions have been reported (36Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), including the interaction of a zinc finger domain with a leucine zipper motif (37Diaz-Meco M. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, the interfaces responsible for the interaction of L7 and ZNF7 remain to be specified. The cellular localization of ZNF7 is unknown, although a nuclear localization has been suggested (26Lania L. Donti E. Pannuti A. Pacucci A. Pengue G. Feliciello I. La Mantia G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.-G. Genomics. 1990; 6: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, a localization in the cytoplasm has not been excluded, and we show in this study that ZNF7 co-purifies with eucaryotic ribosomes. This suggests a ribosomal localization of ZNF7, where it may act as translational regulator. In addition, ZNF7 has been recently shown to be a substrate of mitogen-activated protein kinase in vitro (38Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in signal transduction pathways. However, it is unknown whether mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of ZNF7 influences the binding of ZNF7 to L7 in vivo. In summary, we have shown in this and previous studies that protein L7 can interact with various components of the translational apparatus (i.e. mRNA, 28 S rRNA, ribosomal protein S7, and ZNF7). This hints at a complex role of L7 in translational regulation. It is clear, however, that the functional significance and the molecular details of these interactions remain to be analyzed.

We describe a functional mapping study that focuses on the 37-residue cytoplasmic region of ICAM-3. Carboxyl-terminal truncations delineated portions involved in T cell antigen receptor costimulation, homotypic aggregation, and cellular spreading. Truncation of the membrane distal 25 residues resulted in loss of T cell antigen receptor costimulation as determined by interleukin 2 secretion. Aggregation and cell spreading were sensitive to truncation of the membrane distal and proximal thirds of the cytoplasmic portion. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that ICAM-3 from activated cells contained phosphoserine and phosphopeptide mapping identified Ser489 as a site of phosphorylation in vivo. Mutation of Ser489 or Ser515 to alanine blocked interleukin 2 secretion, aggregation and cell spreading, while mutation of other serine residues affected only a subset of functions. Ser489 was a phosphorylation site in vitro for recombinant protein kinase Cθ. Finally, treatment of Jurkat cells with chelerythrine chloride, a protein kinase C inhibitor, prevented ICAM-3-triggered spreading. This study delineates separable regions and amino acid residues within the cytoplasmic portion of ICAM-3 that are important for T cell function.

(CD50) is a member of the Ig superfamily sharing sequence and functional attributes with ICAM-1, -2, -4 (Landsteiner-Weiner blood group glycoprotein), and -5 (telencephalin). ICAM-3 binds to LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and the newly described integrin αd/CD18 (1Van der Vieren M. Le Trong H. Wood C.L. Moore P.F. St. John T. Staunton D.E. Gallatin W.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is constitutively expressed at high levels by most hematopoietic cells, leading to the suggestion that it is involved in early activation steps of an inflammatory response (2Vilella R. Mila J.

Nature. 1992; 360: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). ICAM-3 has been functionally characterized with respect to the five Ig-like extracellular domains. The first amino-terminal domain binds LFA-1 via conserved residues also found in ICAM-1 (5Sadhu C. Lipsky B. Erickson H.P. Hayflick J. Dick K.O. Gallatin W.M. Staunton D.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These conserved sequences of ICAM-3 and -1 may bind to distinct sites of the I domain of LFA-1, suggesting that non-conserved domain 1 residues might contribute to integrin binding (6Binnerts M.E. van Kooyk Y.

Numerous intracellular signaling events have also been observed to be affected by ICAM-3 engagement. Specifically, activation of intracellular calcium flux and stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity possibly via non-receptor tyrosine kinases p56 lck and p59 fyn were seen (8Juan M. Vinas O. Pino-Otin M.R. Places L. Martinez-Caceres E. Barcelo J.J. Miralles A. Vilella R. de la Fuente M.A. Vives J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Arroyo A.G.

ICAM-3 engagement has also been observed to up-regulate β1 and β2 integrin function, and to trigger phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2 (10Campanero M.R. del Pozo M.A. Arroyo A.G.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 5479-5482PubMed Google Scholar). Little information, however, is available regarding the molecular mechanisms of these phenomena. Here we report that ICAM-3 engagement initiates several distinct aspects of lymphocyte function, which involve the 37-amino acid cytoplasmic portion. For these analyses, we developed and characterized an ICAM-3-deficient human T-leukemic Jurkat cell line. Using these cells and gene transfer techniques, a functional map of the cytoplasmic region of ICAM-3 with respect to TCR accessory molecule function, homotypic aggregation, and cell spreading was generated. These data pinpoint serine residues, particularly serine 489, as critical for ICAM-3 function. Jurkat 77 (J77, a gift from Dr. S. Burakoff, Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute, Boston, MA) and the ICAM-3-deficient J77.50.3 cells were maintained in RPMI complete medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate) in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Murine mAb used in this study were as follows. Anti-ICAM-3 (CD50) mAb ICR1.1 (IgG2a), ICR2.1 (IgG1), ICR9.2 (IgG2a), and anti-ICAM-1 (CD54) mAb 18E3D (IgG1) were generated by the ICOS hybridoma facility. Hybridoma lines secreting anti-TCR (CD3e) OKT3 (IgG2a), anti-CD11a TS1/22 (IgG1), anti-CD18 TS1.18 (IgG1), anti-CD45 4B2 (IgG2a), and anti-MHC class I W6/32 (IgG2a) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. These mAb were purified by protein A column chromatography of mouse ascites fluid. Purified mAb were dialyzed against and stored in PBS. Isotype-matched control mAb used were UPC10 (IgG1) and MOPC 21 (IgG2a) (Sigma). Anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (IgG2a) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 was purchased from Sigma. A variant of Jurkat 77 cells deficient in the expression of ICAM-3 (J77.50.3) was generated by two rounds of indirect staining and cell sorting using a mixture of ICR1.1 and 9.2 mAb (4Vazeux R. Hoffman P.A. Tomita J.K. Dickinson E.S. Jasman R.L. St. John T. Gallatin W.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). J77.50.3 cells were compared with the parental line for surface expression of numerous membrane proteins by indirect cytofluorometry (FACSCAN, Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and found to exhibit similar levels for all except ICAM-3. Ten micrograms of total RNA isolated from parental J77 and J77.50.3 cells was subjected to blotting, hybridization, and washing as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeled probes were generated by random priming of the entire ICAM-3 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (14Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Coding sequences for HA epitope-tagged ICAM-3 proteins were generated as described (15Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). To engineer epitope-tagged full-length ICAM-3 construct, three separate PCR fragments that encoded 1) the signal sequence (preceded by a unique HindIII site and Kozak sequence), 2) Ig domains (IgD) I-II of ICAM-3, and 3) a triple (3×) influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag sequence were synthesized and gel-purified (16Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The fragments were combined using PCR in the following order: ICAM-3 signal sequence, HA tag, and ICAM-3 IgD I-II. This product was ligated as a HindIII/ScaI fragment with a ScaI/EcoRI cDNA fragment containing the remainder of the ICAM-3 coding sequence into theHindIII/EcoRI sites of expression vector pMH-neo and all PCR products sequenced (17Hahn W.C. Menzin E. Saito T. Germain R.N. Bierer B.E. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 127: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic region deletions were generated as follows. The region of coding sequence for the extracellular domains described above contained on a HindIII/SacI fragment was combined withSacI/EcoRI PCR fragments encoding cytoplasmic domain truncations and ligated to theHindIII/EcoRI sites of pMH-neo. The PCR fragments were synthesized using the following primers: 1) 5′ common anchoring primer CATAATGGTACTTATCAGTGC, and 2) 3′ primers D505 (−1/3CT), ATATAGCGGCCGCGGATCCTCACTGCATAGACGTGAG; D493 (−2/3CT), ATATAGCGGCCGCGGATCCTCACCTAACATGGTAACT; and D484 (−CT), ATCACTATGCGGCCGCTCAGTGTCTCCTGAAGACGTACAT. Primer D484 contained a change at codon 483 to increase the membrane anchor region of the maximal cytoplasmic region truncation. Amino acid numbering uses the mature amino terminus for the first residue. To generate point mutations, the ICAM-3 cDNA was subcloned as aNotI/EcoRI fragment into M13 BM21 replicative form DNA (Boehringer Mannheim) and primers used for mutagenesis by the Kunkel method were designed to make alanine changes at the following codons: serine 487, serine 489, leucine 499, serine 496, serine 503, and serine 515 (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Leucine 499 was chosen as a control for mutational effect, since it is not a potential phosphorylation site and a conservative change to alanine is expected to maintain similar overall charge. All mutants were sequenced, and each was subcloned as aSacI/EcoRI fragment along with theHindIII/SacI fragment described above into pMH-neo. J77.50.3 cells (107) in 0.2 ml of PBS were electroporated in the presence of 100 μg/ml plasmid DNA using a BTX 6000 device (126 V, 1710 microfarads, 72 milliamps, 0.2-cm electrode gap). Drug-resistant cells (G418, 1.25 mg/ml) were screened by indirect fluorescence flow cytometry with ICR1.1, OKT3, or isotype-matched control antibody. Two independent cell lines were chosen for functional studies from each transfection based on similar mean channel fluorescence measurements. To enrich for cell lines that expressed higher mean ICAM-3 levels, the drug-resistant lines were panned on mAb-coated plastic. Bacteriologic Petri plates were incubated with 8 ml of ICR2.1 (10 μg/ml) in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were rinsed with PBS and cells seeded onto the mAb-coated plastic surface for 8 min at 25 °C. To remove non-adherent cells, the plates were rocked and aspirated. The plates were rinsed with PBS, checked visually to determine the absence of non-adherent cells, and adherent cells removed by trituration. Cells harvested in this manner were expanded and subjected to indirect fluorescence analysis using flow cytometry. Plates (96-well, Corning 25860) were coated with OKT3 (0.5 μg/ml, 50 μl/well) in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. The coating was removed and replaced with PBS alone or mAb at 10 μg/ml in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Wells were rinsed twice with PBS and 2 × 105 cells added in 0.25 ml of RPMI/well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Conditioned medium from duplicate wells was pooled, diluted serially, and assayed for IL2 concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). A dose for OKT3 (25 ng/well) and ICR1.1 (500 ng/well) was chosen for co-stimulation experiments. Assays were repeated a minimum of three times, with similar results observed in each experiment. Dishes (ΔT, 0.5-mm glass; Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA) were coated with 0.5 ml of mAb in PBS (10 μg/ml). Dishes was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and rinsed twice with PBS. Cells (2 × 104) were seeded onto coated surfaces for 15 min at 37 °C. Plates were held at 37 °C in the Bioptechs stage insert while being photographed with Ilford Pan F film using a Nikon Diaphot microscope and DIC optics. For PKC inhibitor studies, chelerythrine chloride (in Me2SO) was added to cells at a final concentration of 50 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to seeding into coated dishes. Cells were pelleted and resuspended at 8 × 105/ml in complete medium and 0.25 ml distributed to duplicate wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate. mAb ICR1.1 or MOPC 21 control were added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the percentage of aggregated cells was determined as described previously (19Lorenz H.M. Harrer T. Lagoo A.S. Baur A. Eger G. Kalden J.R. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 147: 110-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Quantitative determinations were made by counting free cells in five separate squares of a gridded ocular centered over the well at 125 × magnification. Percent aggregation = {1 − (no. of free cells experimentally treated/no. of free cells control-treated)} × 100. Cells (5 × 107) were starved of methionine and cysteine for 1 h prior to labeling with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Tran35S-Label; ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) in RPMI, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells for phosphorylation studies were rinsed in phosphate-free RPMI and labeled with 0.5 mCi of inorganic 32P for 4 h at 37 °C. Labeled cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa2MoO4) and incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional rocking. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation in a table top microcentrifuge. Soluble proteins were transferred to a fresh tube and 0.1 ml of Sepharose 4CL beads added (50% slurry equilibrated in lysis buffer without PMSF; Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsula). The tube was rocked for 16 h, after which the beads were briefly spun down. The clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and antibody added to 10 μg/ml final concentration. Immune complexes were formed by incubation on ice for 1 h and harvested by incubation with protein A beads. The immune complexes were pelleted and washed two times with 1 ml of cold 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa2MoO4, and once with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer. The remaining proteins were eluted by addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by gel electrophoresis. Immune complexes of labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Autoradiography of gels containing32P-labeled proteins was conducted using X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Corp.) with a single intensifying screen at −70 °C. Gels of 35S-labeled proteins were impregnated with fluor and exposed to film at −70 °C. Autoradiographs were used to localize32P-labeled ICAM-3. Bands were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride sheet and the proteins partially acid hydrolyzed and separated as described in (20Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were dried in vacuo and resuspended in 6 μl of pH 1.9 buffer containing unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma). A portion of each sample, representing equal Cerenkov counts, was spotted on cellulose TLC plates and phosphoamino acids separated by high voltage thin layer electrophoresis (HTLE-7000; CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA). After ninhydrin staining of the standards, the plates were exposed to film for autoradiography. Phosphorylation sites were determined by tryptic peptide mapping usingin vivo 32P-labeled proteins. Labeled protein bands were incubated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) for 18 h. The resulting peptide mixture was spotted on a TLC plate and subjected to charge separation and ascending chromatography. Human protein kinase Cθ was amplified by PCR with a primer that contained a 6-histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein coding sequence as described (21Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subcloned into a BACMID vector (Life Technologies Inc.), and recombinant virus was generated as described by the manufacturer. Infected Sf9 cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl floride) by Dounce homogenization. Active soluble protein kinase was separated from insoluble material by centrifugation (16,000 × g) and 0.04-ml assays performed using 50 μg/ml total protein and 100 μm substrate peptide as described (21Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The following substrates were synthesized: ICAM-3 CT, amino acids 482–518 (REHQRSGSYHVREESTYLPLTSMQPTEAMGEEPSRAE), SCR CT (ARSTEQQGMYAESESEELRPGYPEHRSTHTMLPRSVE), SGS (biotin-FREHQRSGSYHVREE), and SGS-P (biotin-FREHQRSGS(PO4)YHVREE). Jurkat cells (J77) examined by indirect fluorescence cytometry with antibodies to ICAM-3 routinely display two populations of cells (Fig. 1 A). The bulk (97%) of these are ICAM-3-positive, while a small population (3%) is ICAM-3-negative. Enrichment of the ICAM-3-negative population by sequential rounds of cell sorting generated a population displaying >97% ICAM-3-negative cells that we have termed J77.50.3. RNA analysis showed that, in J77.50.3 cells, synthesis of the 2.2-kb ICAM-3 message was below detectable levels (Fig. 1 B). Surface expression of numerous proteins was assessed in J77.50.3 and the parental J77 line. Both populations exhibited similar fluorescence profiles for all mAb studied including CD3e, CD11a, CD18, and CD45 (Fig. 1 A), indicating that J77.50.3 cells were similar to J77 except for the ICAM-3 deficiency. Optimal T cell activation is thought to require two signals: one from the antigen receptor and the other from one or more of a large number of accessory molecules including ICAM-3 (22Liu Y. Linsley P.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To confirm that ICAM-3/TCR engagement was costimulatory, Jurkat T cells were seeded onto ICR1.1 coimmobilized with increasing concentrations of OKT3. A dose-dependent increase in IL2 production was observed (Fig. 2 A). Cells exposed to either immobilized mAb alone showed no induction of IL2 secretion. To determined if loss of ICAM-3 expression would impair costimulation, J77.50.3 cells were seeded into mAb-coated wells under conditions that stimulated the parental cells. ICAM-3-deficient J77.50.3 did not secrete IL2 (Fig. 2 B). Both cell lines responded to a greater concentration of OKT3 by secreting IL2. Neither cell line responded to a combination of anti-ICAM-1 mAb (18E3D) and OKT3. These data reveal that TCR signaling and the synthetic machinery for IL2 production in J77.50.3 cells was intact. Further, co-engagement of ICAM-1 and CD3 was insufficient to produce IL2. To evaluate whether ICAM-3 expression in J77.50.3 cells would complement the phenotypic defect, cells were transfected with either a control vector or HA-tagged ICAM-3 (ICAM-3FL). Cells were selected, and several independent lines that maintained stable surface expression were identified (Fig. 3 A). Inclusion of the HA tag allowed for validation that the expressed form of ICAM-3 in the transfected cells was from the introduced DNA construct rather than re-expression of the endogenous gene. Indeed, surface staining for either ICAM-3 or HA tag epitopes showed similar levels of fluorescence in the populations (Fig. 3 A). While the control-transfected lines lacked the ability to be stimulated by the co-immobilized mAb, J77.50.3 cells expressing ICAM-3FL responded to the costimuli by secreting IL2 into the medium as did the parental J77 cells (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, expression of ICAM-3 by J77.50.3 cells restored their ability to respond to ICAM-3/TCR costimulation. J77.50.3 cells expressing the following HA epitope-tagged cytoplasmic tail truncations were generated to grossly map the cytoplasmic region of ICAM-3: −1/3CT (Gln505terminus), −2/3CT (Arg493 terminus), and −CT (His484 terminus) (Fig. 4). Characterization of cells expressing each deletion included monitoring surface expression (Fig. 5 Aand Table I) and immunoprecipitation from lysates of cells that had been metabolically labeled with35S (Fig. 5 B). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the relative migration of the truncated proteins was of the expected sizes of ∼120–140 kDa.Figure 5Surface cytofluorometric and SDS-PAGE analysis of ICAM-3 cytoplasmic tail truncations expressed in J77.50.3 cells.

Wells were treated with 500 ng/well (ICR1.1 or 18E3D) and 25 ng/well OKT3. Fold stimulation = (IL2 secreted from cells on coimmobilized ICR1.1/OKT3)/(IL2 secreted from cells on coimmobilized 18E3D/OKT3).

Wells were treated with 500 ng/well (ICR1.1 or 18E3D) and 25 ng/well OKT3. Fold stimulation = (IL2 secreted from cells on coimmobilized ICR1.1/OKT3)/(IL2 secreted from cells on coimmobilized 18E3D/OKT3).

Conditioned media from cells expressing either ICAM-3FL or −1/3CT forms showed 5.4- and 4.8-fold induction, respectively, when normalized for IL2 secretion in negative control-treated wells (Table I). Cells expressing either −2/3CT or −CT forms secreted about 60% less IL2 (2.2-fold each). All of the cell lines tested responded to a more concentrated dose of OKT3 alone by secreting similar levels of IL2 (data not shown). Immunoregulation of leukocytes has been hypothesized to occur via aggregate formation in which paracrine effects of cytokines (both positive and negative) regulate progression of a cellular immune response (23Mitchison A. Immunologist. 1995; 3: 259Google Scholar). J77.50.3 cells expressing ICAM-3FL treated with ICR1.1 mAb responded by forming aggregates (58% aggregated, Table I). This is not due to direct cross-linking of cells by mAb, since Fab fragments of ICR1.1 trigger ag"

https://openalex.org/W2166885828,"Fragments of characteristic size retaining the ability of sequence-specific DNA binding were generated by partial proteolysis of transcription factor Stat3 with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus V8 proteinase. The molecular masses of the smallest DNA-binding fragments were 75, 48, and 32 kDa after digestion with V8 proteinase, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, respectively. The fragments contained major parts of the domain controlling the sequence specificity of DNA binding (amino acids 406–514), the SH3 and SH2 domains, and the phosphorylated tyrosine residue Tyr-705, but not the C-terminal 20 amino acids. The N terminus of the 32-kDa tryptic fragment (ANCDASLIV) matched the sequence of amino acids 424–432 deduced from cDNA. The fragments were observed after proteolytic treatment of preformed complexes between DNA and native factors eluted from rat liver nuclei or recombinant, tyrosine-phosphorylated rat Stat3 from insect cells. It was possible to elute all three minimal fragments from their complexes with DNA and to obtain specific re-binding. The minimal fragments eluted from complexes with DNA still contained the phosphorylated Tyr-705 and the SH2 domain suggesting that they were probably bound to DNA as dimers. The DNA-binding domain of Stat3 identified by these experiments overlapped the domain previously identified by genetic experiments as the domain controlling the sequence specificity of DNA binding. The DNA-binding domain defined here by partial proteolysis probably represents an autonomously folding portion of Stat3."
